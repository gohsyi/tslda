Neither CBS, which is part of ViacomCBS, nor Gavshon could immediately be reached for comment.

REUTERS\/Kate Munsch  Although it logged a 12% drop in revenue, dragged down by a steep decline in advertising, the fall was less than expected and ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish told analysts the second quarter was the bottom for ad declines.  Revenue and profit surpassed Wall Street expectations.  The company declined to give financial guidance for the year but said that advertising trends had improved since April.  \u201cJune was strong, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing so far in Q3,\u201d Bakish said. \u201cWe believe this reflects not only economic optimism for a gradual recovery but also the power of our portfolio and the significant value we bring to advertisers.\u201d  Stay-at-home orders have boosted demand for streaming services in the absence of live events and theater releases, with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Walt Disney Co DIS.N reporting strong streaming subscriber additions.  ViacomCBS U.S. streaming subscribers reached 16.2 million in the second quarter, up from 13.5 million in the prior quarter. The company said it now expects to reach 18 million customers by the end of the year.  To fuel growth, the company is preparing to launch new streaming platforms by early next year to consolidate programming across the portfolio. It will also launch an international subscription streaming service in 2021 in Australia, Latin America and the Nordics, Bakish said.  \u201cWhile advertising businesses are suffering amid the pandemic, the companies with strong streaming products are benefiting from the stay-at-home environment,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. \u201cSince the merger, ViacomCBS has built an attractive streaming portfolio which is helping the company to weather this downturn.\u201d  Streaming and digital video revenue, which includes subscriptions to CBS All Access and Showtime, rose 25% to $489 million in the quarter, ViacomCBS said.  Advertising fell 27% across the company as marketers slashed spending and as live sports disappeared from TV screens.  Revenue from its filmed entertainment division, which includes Paramount Pictures, fell 26% to $647 million, hurt by a near complete absence of theatrical sales as cinemas shut down to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.  The company said the fees it collected from cable and satellite operators rose 2% to $2.19 billion in the quarter.  Revenue fell 12% to $6.28 billion in the second quarter but exceeded estimates of $6.27 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Comcast-owned NBCUniversal will enter a crowded streaming market on Wednesday when it launches its Peacock streaming service nationally, offering 20,000 hours of content, including NBC shows such as \u201c30 Rock,\u201d \u201cCheers\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d  The service, which became available to some Comcast Corp CMCSA.O subscribers in April, is the media giant's effort to offset declines in Comcast's cable TV business - while finding a new way to monetize NBC and Universal content and maintain demand for the company's broadband business, which powers streaming services.  Peacock will include a mix of NBC series, sports, news and original shows - such as the dystopian drama \"Brave New World\" and documentary \"In Deep with Ryan Lochte\" - as well as content it licenses from ViacomCBS VIACA.O and other networks and studios.  The service will also be available on Sony's 6758.T PlayStation 4 gaming console from July 20, Peacock said on Tuesday. (reut.rs\/3gZfccI)  Unlike the majority of its streaming rivals, Peacock is offering a free, ad-supported version, which will include 13,000 hours of programming. NBCUniversal hopes to lure advertisers through the vast amounts of data it can use to target commercials based on viewers\u2019 interests, including data from Comcast\u2019s cable TV set-top boxes.  Peacock also has two paid options: a $4.99 per month service with commercials and 20,000 hours of programming; and an ad-free version costing $9.99 per month.  NBCUniversal missed the opportunity to market Peacock during its broadcast of the Tokyo Summer Olympics, which were postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. And as the last entry to the streaming war, Peacock will be competing for streaming dollars with services such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O, Walt Disney Co DIS.N-owned Disney+ and Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Prime Video.  But Peacock\u2019s free option could be a draw for viewers who have already maxed out their monthly entertainment budgets, at a time when U.S. viewers stuck at home are hungry for more content.","4":"Jan 5 (Reuters) - Triller Inc, a budding U.S. competitor to popular short-video app TikTok, said on Tuesday it has hired former music executive Paul Kahn as its new chief financial officer, bolstering the company\u2019s ranks ahead of a potential stock market listing.  Kahn was previously CFO at Warner Chappell Music, the global music publishing business of Warner Music Group, for five years. Prior to that, he was a senior vice president involved in strategy and development at media firm Viacom .  \u201cPaul\u2019s wealth of experience, coupled with Triller\u2019s extraordinary momentum, is sure to accelerate us forward into this next chapter of expansion, and we\u2019re lucky to have him on board,\u201d Triller co-owner and executive chairman, Bobby Sarnevesht said in a statement.  Kahn will be Triller\u2019s first CFO.  \u201cI\u2019m elated to be joining Triller at such a great time in the company\u2019s growth,\u201d Kahn said.  Kahn\u2019s hiring comes as Triller is engaging in active discussions with special purpose acquisition companies about a merger which would take it public, according to a people familiar with the matter.  Triller declined to comment on any SPAC discussions.  A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company which then becomes publicly traded as a result.  They have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised.  Los Angeles-based Triller was launched in 2015 and only has a fraction of the 100 million users that TikTok boasts in the United States.  Triller said last year it had 65 million monthly active users on its short video app, although many analytics companies have said they have not been provided enough access to independently verify Triller\u2019s figures.  TikTok, owned by Chinese conglomerate ByteDance, has been in a months-long dispute with the U.S. government over its ownership structure, with the Trump administration arguing that the personal data of U.S. users could be obtained by China\u2019s government.","5":"FILE PHOTO: The ViacomCBS logo is displayed at the Nasdaq MarketSite to celebrate the company's merger, in New York, U.S., December 5, 2019.

The company said the impact on its businesses could be material to its results, cash flows and financial position. It was also working on cost-savings initiatives to mitigate some of the impact.  ViacomCBS had earlier forecast 2020 adjusted earnings of between $5.15 and $5.50, and mid-single-digit revenue growth, or about $29.2 billion, if revenue were to rise by 5%. Wall Street analysts expected 2020 revenue of $29.74 billion.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY\/File Photo  Presidents have used the annual National Football League championship game to try to promote an image of being someone that viewers would like to have a beer with - or in teetotaler Biden\u2019s case, a bowl of ice cream.  \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell, a former White House correspondent, will interview Biden, with excerpts to air on Friday and the whole session to be shown in the 4 p.m. EST hour on Sunday. CBS is broadcasting the Super Bowl this year, with the game starting around 6:30 p.m. EST.  Biden, known to be a Philadelphia Eagles fan, has given no indication of which team he will be cheering on in the showdown between the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Last year\u2019s game, 2020\u2019s single most-viewed U.S. television event, was watched by an estimated 99.9 million people - a clue to how many people Biden might reach to promote his $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package and offer his first expansive views on any number of domestic and foreign topics.  \u201cIt\u2019s an audience that is not just going to be the true believers,\u201d said Thomas Alan Schwartz, a presidential scholar at Vanderbilt University.  \u201cThe Super Bowl is one of the secular national holidays we have that tends to promote unity, the idea being that we all like watching the game. It\u2019s an opportunity to hit an audience that he would otherwise have a hard time finding,\u201d he said.  Presidents in the past have joined in the festivities by calling the coach of the victorious team. In 1972, noted football fan Richard Nixon called Miami Dolphins Coach Don Shula before the Super Bowl to suggest a pass play he might try against the Dallas Cowboys.  George W. Bush began the tradition of an interview around the Super Bowl, appearing with CBS lead commentator Jim Nantz in 2004 for a light interview mostly about the game.  \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a very close contest, but what the heck do I know? I\u2019m just the president,\u201d Bush said.  More recent interviews have been more serious. Democratic President Barack Obama was grilled in 2013 by then-Fox News Channel commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly about the rocky rollout of the website for his Obamacare healthcare plan and the militant attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.  In 2019, then-President Donald Trump granted an interview to CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d as part of the run-up to the game and talked about his differences with the U.S. intelligence community.  He skipped a Super Bowl interview last year.","7":"FILE PHOTO: The ViacomCBS logo is displayed on the Nasdaq MarketSite to celebrate the company's merger, in New York, U.S., December 5, 2019.

Pierluigi Gazzolo, who is spear-heading the roll-out of the advertising-based platform, told Reuters the firm could have an edge in Latin America, where consumers may prefer to avoid the regular costs of subscription.  \u201cI think Latin America is the perfect market for this product,\u201d Gazzolo said in a telephone interview ahead of the official announcement. \u201cYou have the (users) who have pay-TV, who are consuming more and more and are going to be able to consume it, as well as those who have never been able to pay.\u201d  Free, advertising-based services such as Pluto TV and upcoming Peacock from Comcast-owned NBCUniversal are seen as potential challengers that could limit the pricing power of paid platforms like Netflix and Amazon.com\u2019s Prime Video, according to research from Citigroup.  Pluto TV, which Viacom acquired at the beginning of 2019 in a $340 million deal, has around 20 million monthly average users in the United States.  In the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America, Gazzolo said the platform would start with 24 channels, rising to nearly 100 by end of the year. He declined to give investment figures or user projections.  \u201cPluto TV is in the lower part of the pyramid, which is wider, with many more people, that is the people in Latin America that are not going to pay and are willing to see publicity to not pay,\u201d he said.

(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; editing by Jonathan Oatis)","9":"LOS ANGELES, April 14 (Reuters) - U.S. movie theater operators, who were forced to shut their doors in March to help slow the coronavirus spread, are aiming to welcome back crowds across the country by late July for a belated kickoff to the summer movie season.  Ahead of that, operators are considering a transition period when they open some locations in parts of the United States where the novel coronavirus outbreak is receding fastest. That could start as early as mid-June, said Patrick Corcoran, spokesman for the National Association of Theatre Owners, though he called any timeline \u201cvery tentative.\u201d  The timing will depend on guidance from health authorities, he said.  Among the challenges theaters face are making sure filmgoers feel comfortable gathering in groups and having a variety of appealing movies. Hollywood studios are unlikely to release big-budget films when they cannot mount a nationwide release. Blockbusters such as Walt Disney Co\u2019s \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d from AT&T Inc\u2019s Warner Bros are currently scheduled for late July and August.  \u201cThere are two schools of thought,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cPeople will be very tense and careful and nervous, or people will just be desperate to get out of the house. It\u2019s going to probably be a mixture.\u201d  During their first weeks back in business, theaters likely will show classic movies or films that were playing in March when theaters went dark, Corcoran said.  That could mean reviving a beloved musical such as \u201cGrease\u201d or running a marathon of \u201cBack to the Future\u201d or \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies, said Brock Bagby, executive vice president of Missouri-based B&B Theatres, which operates 400 screens in seven states.  Executives are brainstorming ways to draw audiences, such as staging a costume contest around a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film or serving butterbeer, Potter\u2019s favorite beverage, Bagby said. Not on the agenda are \u201csad or very heavy dramas,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe want the movies we bring back to bring joy to people,\u201d Bagby said.  Operators also are debating how visible to be with steps such as extra cleaning, \u201cwhether it makes people comfortable or more nervous,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a delicate dance with any kind of precaution like that.\u201d  Theaters owners likely will look at restaurants and bars for clues on how people are reacting. Safety measures may vary at different cinema locations depending on local guidance, he added.  Bagby said B&B\u2019s locations will implement social distancing if authorities recommend it. In the weekend before theaters closed, the company cut auditorium capacity by 50% to leave room between seats and had \u201czero issues,\u201d he said. Customers adhered to the practice and some showtimes sold out at half-full, he said.  During the shutdown, theater chains and independent operators have been trying to tap government assistance or other financing to stay afloat. Cinemark Holdings Inc, for example, said on Monday it had raised $250 million through a sale of debt.  Getting a full slate of Hollywood movies back on the calendar depends not just on the United States. Studios will need receipts from around the globe to support their most expensive films, said Chris Aronson, president of film distribution at ViacomCBS Inc\u2019s Paramount Pictures.

Justice Hal Greenwald of the state Supreme Court in Poughkeepsie, New York, denied the request to stop publication and canceled the temporary restraining order he issued on June 30 against Mary Trump and her publisher, Simon & Schuster , at the request of Robert Trump, the brother of the president.  Simon & Schuster was due to release the book on Tuesday.  Robert Trump said previously that the release of \u201cToo Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man\u201d would violate a confidentiality agreement tied to the estate of his father, Fred Trump Sr., who died in 1999. Mary Trump, a trained psychologist, is Fred Trump\u2019s granddaughter.  \u201cNotwithstanding that the Book has been published and distributed in great quantities, to enjoin Mary L. Trump at this juncture would be incorrect and serve no purpose,\u201d Greenwald said in his decision.  \u201cIt would be moot. ... To quote United States v. Bolton, 2020, \u2018By the looks of it the horse is not just out of the barn, it is out of the country,\u2019\u201d he wrote.  Mary Trump\u2019s attorney, Theodore Boutrous, said in a statement: \u201cThe court got it right in rejecting the Trump family\u2019s effort to squelch Mary Trump\u2019s core political speech on important issues of public concern.\u201d  Lawyers for Robert Trump could not immediately be reached for comment. The book\u2019s publication comes as the Republican president seeks a second term in the Nov. 3 election. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has described it as a \u201cbook of falsehoods.\u201d  Mary Trump applies her training in psychology to conclude in the book that the president likely suffers from narcissism and other clinical disorders - and was boosted to success by a father who fueled those traits.  She writes of a \u201cmalignantly dysfunctional family\u201d dominated by a patriarch, Fred Trump, who showed little interest in his five children other than grooming an heir for his real-estate business.  Ultimately, he settled on Donald, she wrote, deciding that his second son\u2019s \u201carrogance and bullying\u201d would come in handy at the office, and encouraged it.

But with films like \u201cMatrix 4,\u201d \u201cIn the Heights\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d hitting TVs at the same time as theaters, and Marvel series \u201cThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u201d and \u201cLoki\u201d streaming on Disney+, will they even want to?  The pandemic accelerated a push to subscription streaming video services like Netflix and Disney+ that was already underway, leading to a surplus of top-shelf content being available to consumers in 2021. But behind the scenes of this new golden age of television is a battle over the future of Hollywood.  2020 was the year major media companies placed their bets, with AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Walt Disney Co announcing new strategies around how and where they will distribute content. While their approaches vary, they are united by a singular focus on streaming video to appeal directly to viewers.  Less clear is who will emerge victorious once the pandemic is over. Will the experience of watching a film in a theater - with a community of fans, a giant screen and enveloping sound - trump the convenience and lower cost of watching it at home?  The answer will help decide the future of Hollywood in 2022 and beyond.  AT&T\u2019s Warner Bros studio took the boldest step of its peers when it announced plans to debut all of its 2021 films in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming service on the same day, including potential blockbusters like \u201cMatrix 4,\u201d \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d \u201cDune\u201d and \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d It is releasing \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d in theaters and on HBO Max on Dec. 25.  Warner Bros said the strategy, which AT&T Chief Executive John Stankey described as a \u201cwin-win-win\u201d for consumers and partners, would stay in effect for one year.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why they had to decide about the whole year,\u201d said \u201cWonder Woman 1984\u201d director Patty Jenkins in an interview with Reuters. \u201cI wish we could have waited and seen what was happening with theaters.\u201d  Comcast\u2019s Universal Pictures took a less drastic approach, chipping away at the theatrical window through deals with three major theater operators - AMC Entertainment Holdings and Cinemark Holdings Inc, and Canada\u2019s Cineplex.  The parties agreed to shorten the window between a film\u2019s theatrical and at-home release. After as few as 17 days in theaters owned by one of those operators, Universal could make films such as \u201cSing 2\u201d or \u201cMinions: The Rise of Gru\u201d available on digital platforms for $19.99.  Rather than announce sweeping changes to its movie release strategy, Disney opted to super-charge its streaming services. The company plans to release 10 new TV series each in the Marvel and Star Wars franchises, including two spinoffs of \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d on the Disney+ streaming service over the next few years.  It will make another 15 live-action Disney Animation and Pixar shows and 15 Disney Animation and Pixar feature films available on the service.  Customers should expect about 100 or more titles on Disney+ every year, executives said on Dec. 10. To help fund the $16 billion Disney is planning to spend on new content in fiscal year 2024, in March 2021 Disney will raise the price of Disney+ by $1 in the U.S. to $7.99 per month and by 2 euros in continental Europe to 8.99 euros ($10.92).  In early 2021, ViacomCBS is rebranding its CBS All Access streaming service as \u201cParamount+\u201d - which will include episodes and movies from ViacomCBS-owned brands such as Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures, including series such as \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d and \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d  These changes may not have happened as quickly without the pandemic, although some Hollywood insiders consider them inevitable.  \u201cWithout a doubt, we are into the big curve of change that I think has been due ever since people first had (premium video on demand),\u201d actor Tom Hanks said in December. \u201c(Arguably) since the VHS cassette tape was first introduced in a cheap way, this has been just across the horizon.\u201d","12":"March 26 (Reuters) - National Amusements Inc, the parent of ViacomCBS, said on Thursday it has reached a deal with its lenders to amend borrowing terms and now has substantial cash reserves to fund operations.

Justin Sullivan\/Pool via REUTERS  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s debate with Democrat Kamala Harris attracted 57.9 million TV viewers, the second-highest audience ever for a matchup between vice presidential candidates, according to Nielsen data released on Thursday.  The viewership figure for the Wednesday evening faceoff in Salt Lake City included people watching across 18 networks. The tally came in 56% higher than four years ago, when 37 million people tuned in to see Pence debate Democrat Tim Kaine.  During the policy-heavy 90-minute event, Pence and Harris clashed over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.  Vice presidential debates typically draw smaller audiences than presidential clashes.

The TV viewing record for a vice presidential debate was set in 2008, when Biden debated Republican Sarah Palin. That telecast drew 69.9 million viewers.  For the Pence-Harris matchup, Fox News Channel FOXA.O led all networks, with 11.9 million viewers.  The Nielsen numbers included people watching at home and at such venues as bars and restaurants.

Ticket sales, though difficult to dissect given the uncharted waters of the coronavirus era, are roughly in line with expectations for a new release during a pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: Director Christopher Nolan poses at the 71st Cannes Film Festival, Cannes, France, May 13, 2018 REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe  The espionage thriller is already nearing the $150 million mark globally, thanks to a stronger showing at the international box office. Overseas, \u201cTenet\u201d earned another $78.3 million this weekend, bringing its worldwide haul to $146.2 million.  Warner Bros., in a note Sunday afternoon to press, said the studio was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with initial results, stressing that the rollout of \u201cTenet\u201d will be \u201ca marathon not a sprint\u201d \u2014 meaning it doesn\u2019t need splashy inaugural weekend grosses to justify its release.  \u201cThere is literally no context in which to compare the results of a film opening during a pandemic with any other circumstance,\u201d the studio said. \u201cWe are in unprecedented territory, so any comparisons to the pre-COVID world would be inequitable and baseless.\u201d  The domestic debut for Nolan\u2019s latest includes ticket sales from preview screenings that started on Monday in the U.S. and Canada. In pre-coronavirus times, \u201cTenet\u201d would have seen much more substantial opening weekend figures. However, it\u2019s launching in a vastly different environment since numerous theaters in the country are out of operation.  \u201cWith a significant number of key U.S. states and cities still closed, this is a fair opening,\u201d said David A. Gross, a box office analyst at FranchiseRe. \u201cBusiness in the U.S. is improving, but large numbers of moviegoers are not back yet. For now, this is as good as it gets.\u201d  \u201cTenet\u201d was able to play in about 2,800 cinemas across the country, a smaller footprint than normal for a wide release of this size. But Warner Bros., the studio behind the twisty thriller, is banking on it being enough to rationalize unspooling the mega-budgeted film after months of delays.  Currently, about 65-70% of multiplexes in the U.S. have reopened, though influential markets like New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco are still off limits. That likely shaved millions of dollars off of \u201cTenet\u2019s\u201d grosses.  Drive-in theaters have been a boon for cities where indoor cinemas can\u2019t reopen yet. However, Warner Bros. issued guidelines that restricted the areas where \u201cTenet\u201d can play outdoors.  They mandated that the film can only screen at drive-in theaters if indoor venues in that particular city are open. That means drive-ins in Los Angeles and San Francisco, both of which have been doing robust ticket sales during the pandemic, didn\u2019t have access to one of the buzziest titles of the year.  \u201cTenet\u201d is the first major blockbuster to debut in the U.S. after the pandemic forced theaters to close in March. It was originally slated to bow in July but was delayed multiple times as cases of the virus continued to surge. While other anticipated titles \u2014 like \u201cFast and Furious\u201d entry \u201cF9\u201d and Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d \u2014 pushed their openings into late 2020 or 2021, \u201cTenet\u201d remained fluid with the hopes of welcoming audiences back after prolonged shutdowns.  Warner Bros. domestic distribution chief Jeff Goldstein said the studio opted to forge ahead with the release of \u201cTenet\u201d given its appeal to overseas audiences.  \u201cAs a strategy, we looked at this movie and said [ticket sales will be] two-thirds international and one-third domestic,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly the rest of the world was in a better place in terms of figuring out how to move forward.\u201d  Though \u201cTenet\u201d started playing in theaters on Thursday, Warner Bros. opted not to report grosses until Sunday. Hollywood has been looking to \u201cTenet\u201d as an indicator of the viability of the movie theater business during a global health crisis. Many exhibitors reopened their cinemas in time to screen \u201cTenet,\u201d and they are banking on pent-up demand to see a movie on the big screen for the first time in months.  Ticket buyers who ventured out to see \u201cTenet\u201d in theaters opted to see it in the best quality possible. Imax screens accounted for $11.1 million of global sales this weekend.  China, where \u201cTenet\u201d premiered on Friday, pulled in more than $8 million in ticket sales on opening day and $30 million over the weekend. When it comes to restarting business, the country is well ahead of the U.S. Already, China has seen notable success with war epic \u201cThe Eight Hundred,\u201d which has grossed over $300 million to date.  \u201cThough the box office trajectory in North America will look quite different for \u2018Tenet\u2019 than in the international marketplace, the film may actually see its fortunes rise in the coming weeks as more and more cities open their multiplex doors,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst with Comscore.  The hope, among studios and theater owners alike, is that extensive safety measures will make audiences feel more comfortable returning to indoor spaces in the coming weeks.  \u201cTenet,\u201d led by John David Washington and Robert Pattinson, cost $200 million to make \u2014 and many millions more to globally promote. That means the time-bending thriller needs to pull in robust ticket sales to turn a profit. Audiences gave the film a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore, lower than usual for Nolan\u2019s filmography.  But without much competition from other Hollywood movies, Warner Bros. is optimistic that \u201cTenet\u201d will play in theaters for months to come.  When it comes to competition, \u201cTenet\u2019s\u201d biggest rival may be coming from the small screen. \u201cMulan,\u201d Disney\u2019s reimagining of 1998 cartoon, is skipping U.S. theaters and launching this weekend on Disney Plus. The family movie is available to rent on the studio\u2019s streaming service for $30.  In areas where Disney Plus is not available, \u201cMulan\u201d is opening on the big screen. The fantasy epic \u2014 directed by Niki Caro and starring Liu Yifei \u2014 drew $5.9 million from nine international markets, including Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. \u201cMulan\u201d opens in China and Russia next weekend.

Disney and 20th Century\u2019s \u201cThe New Mutants\u201d is aiming to generate $3.5 million through Labor Day, taking its North American bounty to $12.3 million.  Searchlight\u2019s \u201cDavid Copperfield\u201d is expected to pull in $470,000 from 1,550 theaters over the four-day holiday weekend. That should push its domestic tally to $1.13 million through Monday.  \u201cUnhinged,\u201d in its third weekend in theaters,\u201d made $655,000 on Saturday and looks to collect $1.67 million over the weekend. Through Monday, the movie is projecting $11.67 million total.  It\u2019s unclear if the numbers for \u201cTenet\u201d will justify moving forward with other blockbusters until coronavirus gets under control in the U.S. or a vaccine is developed. For now, \u201cWonder Woman 1984,\u201d also from Warner Bros., is the next film gearing up to hit the big screen.

The game included a record 57 minutes of commercial time, and a 30-second ad was sold for an estimated average cost of $5.6 million, Kantar said Wednesday.  The high price and increase in commercial time helped CBS score record revenue even as the game, which saw the Tampa Bay Buccaneers prevail over the Kansas City Chiefs, got the lowest TV ratings in 15 years.  Advertisers flock to the Super Bowl because it is one of the last remaining annual events that attract millions of Americans to their TVs at the same time.  Auto companies continued to be the top category among Super Bowl advertisers, representing 14% of total spending during the game, followed by streaming services and alcoholic beverages, Kantar said.","24":"Feb 7 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories in the Wall Street Journal.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq clinched a new record high in early trading, crossing the 11,000-mark for a second straight day but has yet to close above the threshold. The benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow were about 2% and 8% away from their own peaks scaled in February.  Economic data released on Thursday painted a mixed picture as Labor Department numbers showed a first fall in jobless claims in three weeks, although a separate report showed a 54% surge in job cuts announced by employers in July.  Investors are looking to the next fiscal aid package to further cope with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday Republicans and Democrats remained far apart over what to include in another wave of relief.  \u201cThe stimulus package will clearly help sentiment and boost the economy near term,\u201d said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist, at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.  \u201cTo that extent, the package should have an upward bias to the broad market.

The corporate results season is now in its final stretch, with about 424 S&P 500 firms having reported so far. Earnings have been about 22.5% above analyst expectations, according to IBES Refinitiv data, the highest on record since 1994.  Energy and healthcare shares fell the most among major S&P sectors.  Among individual shares, Becton Dickinson and Co dropped 8.7% after posting quarterly revenue below estimates as delayed elective procedures during coronavirus-led lockdowns squeezed demand for some of its devices.  Western Digital sank 16.1% after the hard drive maker reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and forecast a soft current quarter.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co gained 2.6% after the drugmaker raised its annual profit forecast on hopes of a recovery in demand for its hospital-administered drugs.  ViacomCBS Inc jumped 3.6% after beating analysts\u2019 estimates for quarterly revenue due to high demand for streaming.

International growth helped the streaming video service trounce expectations in the last quarter of 2019.  But the company acknowledged competition had an impact in the United States, where growth missed Wall Street targets - and that competition will become more global as the Disney+ service launches across Europe in March.  Rivals including Walt Disney Co and Apple Inc are now fighting for streaming customers, and Netflix said it expects to add 7 million subscribers globally in the first quarter, below analysts\u2019 average of 8.82 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  For a company that has historically taken great pains to avoid mentioning competitive forces - it once called the video game Fortnite a bigger rival than other streaming services - it spent a considerable amount of time explaining why Disney\u2019s power will not have as damaging an effect on its engine of growth outside of America.  \u201cDespite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the U.S. on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to investors.  Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings described the fourth quarter\u2019s 8.76 million net subscriber growth - boosted by a new season of royal drama \u201cThe Crown\u201d and two films nominated for Best Picture Oscars - as \u201cjust amazing.\u201d  That number beat Wall Street estimates for the fourth quarter, helping to send shares up 2.2% in volatile after-hours trading on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE  The Disney+ and Apple TV+ streaming services both launched in the United States in November. Disney+, which is also live in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, will launch in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Austria and Switzerland on March 24. Apple TV+ is available in over 100 countries and regions.  The Disney+ service launched in the United States and Canada for $7 per month and $13 a month for a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu; it reached 10 million sign-ups on its first day. Apple TV+ launched Nov. 1 for $5 per month and is free for one year with the purchase of some Apple devices: its performance has been harder to define. AT&T-owner WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max will cost $15 per month when it launches in May.  Netflix is available in over 190 countries; its standard U.S. plan costs $13 per month.  Netflix has had an outsized impact on the pay TV landscape, changing the way that people consume TV and film and forcing media and tech companies to shift their business models. As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive, pushing Netflix to look overseas for growth.  As such, the company has invested heavily in non-English language content, and this quarter began releasing revenue and subscriber numbers by region for the first time. It added 1.75 million subscribers in Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, while Latin America grew by 2.04 million subscribers in the quarter.  As rivals have pulled their content off of Netflix, the company has poured money into original TV series and films. It had a $15 billion cash budget for content last year and $14.76 billion in long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2019.  \u201cFriends\u201d left Netflix in the United States this month and will run on HBO Max. \u201cThe Office\u201d is leaving the service at the end of 2020 and will be available on Comcast-owned NBCUniversals forthcoming Peacock streaming platform next year.  \u201cThe streaming service\u2019s massive content and marketing budget can only be justified if the company is adding more subscribers at a robust rate. If that doesn\u2019t materialize, then its stock price will reflect that reality,\u201d wrote Haris Anwar, an analyst at investing.com.  The addition of new streaming platforms - taking more out of a household\u2019s monthly entertainment budget - has also made it harder for Netflix to raise prices, as it did in the United States last year.  Free, advertising-supported services such as Peacock and ViacomCBS-owned Pluto TV may also limit Netflix\u2019s pricing power, according to research from Citigroup.  Net income rose to $587 million, or $1.30 per share, in the fourth quarter from $134 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier.  Total revenue rose to $5.5 billion from $4.2 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $5.45 billion.  The streaming giant said it added 8.76 million paid subscribers globally compared with expectations of 7.63 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","29":"NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - For 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the length of time it took George Floyd, an unarmed black man, to die at the hands of Minneapolis police - cable TV kids channel Nickelodeon\u2019s screen went black on Tuesday to sounds of inhaling and exhaling, as white text flashed \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d  Pokemon pledged $100,000 in support for Black Lives Matter. Sesame Street is co-hosting a televised town hall meeting with CNN on Saturday morning.

Jones and CNN anchor Erica Hill will host an hour-long special on CNN titled \u201cComing Together: Standing Up to Racism\u201d in partnership with Sesame Street. The show aims to teach school-aged children how to identify inequality and speak out against it.  CNN is owned by telecommunications company AT&T Inc, whose chief executive, Randall Stephenson, urged other CEOs in a CNBC interview to speak out against racial inequality.  Experts said parents need help interpreting for children the relentless barrage of messages on social media and on television as peaceful protesters and looters clash with authorities all across the country.  \u201cI have seen a spike in anxiety for my black kid clients because they are having access to the news,\u201d said Javonte\u2019 Bass, a clinical mental health counselor. \u201cWhen the parents are watching, they\u2019re listening.\u201d  Fear of catching the coronavirus forced families indoors. Fear of dying at the hands of police are keeping kids from going back out, Bass said. One nine-year-old black child even asked Bass, \u201cAm I going to get shot, too?\u201d  On CNN\u2019s event, Jones said viewers should not expect a historical rundown of slavery and colonialism in the United States. The show will urge parents to teach their children empathy. \u201cFailing to teach kids about empathy and fairness is always harmful,\u201d Jones said.  That applies to views of law enforcement as well, Jones and Bass emphasized. \u201cPolice officers are not saints or superheroes. They\u2019re human beings,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSome are good. Most are good, but some are bad.\u201d  Education is a theme among the responses from brands for children.  \u201cOur mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow and that includes inspiring them to be tolerant, inclusive, and kind,\u201d toy company The Lego Group said in a statement.  In addition to pausing advertising for a week to avoid marketing any of its toys, including police-themed toys, next to images of police violence, the company is committing $4 million to organizations that teach children about racial inequality.  Lego has also encouraged fans to come up with new ideas for inclusive toy sets on its platform Lego Ideas.  One of its previous sets, The Women of NASA, which featured astronaut Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space, was inspired by a submission to Lego Ideas.

This year, Australian Associated Press, a newswire part-owned by News Corp, announced its closure after 85 years, as did the local arm of youth website Buzzfeed News and a news site of ViacomCBS Inc VIACA.O owned free-to-air broadcaster Ten Network.  Like others in the Australian media, News Corp hoped to protect its revenue by diversifying, with a stake in real estate advertiser REA Group Ltd REA.AX and an Australian cable TV station called Foxtel.

REUTERS\/Danny Moloshok\/File Photo  Police action series \"NCIS\" scored its biggest audience since February 2019 on Tuesday night, attracting some 13.08 million viewers - a 22% increase over its last original broadcast on March 10, CBS VIACA.O said on Wednesday.  The Tuesday night season finale of heart-tugging NBC CMCSA.O series \"This Is Us\" was the most-watched episode since September 2019 and saw a 21% increase in viewers aged 18-49 over the previous week, NBC said.  Audiences for the big four U.S. television networks - ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC - have been declining in recent years due to fierce competition from streaming, esports and social media.  U.S. movie theaters and Broadway theaters have been shut down for almost two weeks, and multiple U.S. states have ordered the closure of restaurants, bars, theme parks and concert venues in a bid to contain the coronavirus epidemic. There are now more than 60,000 cases in the United States and more than 880 deaths.  Streaming service Netflix Inc NFLX.O was also expected to be a major beneficiary of the stay at home directives. Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos told CNN on Sunday that viewing was up but gave no details. Netflix on Wednesday declined to comment on recent viewership.  However multiple shows on traditional television, including \"The Good Doctor\" on ABC DIS.N, \"The Masked Singer\" on Fox FOXA.O and \"Survivor\" on CBS are also seeing a surge in viewers, according to ratings data.  Data analytics company Nielsen said in a report last week that Americans are expected to watch as much as 60% more television across all platforms as increasingly restrictive shutdowns are implemented across the United States.  The increases are not just for escapist fare. Sunday\u2019s topical news show \u201c60 Minutes\u201d reached 10.9 million viewers, its largest audience since December 2019, CBS said.

That\u2019s a trophy price considering the business accounted for only around a tenth of McLaren\u2019s 1.5 billion pounds in sales in 2019 and reported negative EBITDA in the last two financial years.

Denmark killed 17 million mink after Covid-19 outbreaks at hundreds of farms. After years of falling prices because of lower demand, the massive cull may boost the $22 billion market for alternative furs like chinchilla and fox. Luxury giant LVMH, which Reuters reported said it is using only 100% certified mink, fox and finn-raccoon, is likely to see costs go up.  Longer term, however, the gruesome saga may speed up the shift away from fur. Designers such as Coach and Chanel have already banned the use of fur in its collections, and those houses that still do use it are looking increasingly outmoded.

The Showtime streaming service, which costs $11 per month, launched in 2015.  Viacom purchased Pluto TV, a free service, last year for $340 million and it will play a big role in ViacomCBS\u2019s streaming video strategy.

FILE PHOTO: ViacomCBS headquarters is pictured in New York, New York, U.S. December 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Kate Munsch  Shares were up nearly 15% to $17.1 in morning trading.  ViacomCBS reported over 13.5 million domestic streaming subscribers, up 50% year-over-year, based on demand for original programming such as \u201cStar Trek: Picard\u201d on CBS All Access and \u201cHomeland\u201d on Showtime OTT.  \u201cThe appeal of our streaming and digital offerings has been made even more clear over the last six weeks, where we\u2019ve seen a strong acceleration in momentum across both free and pay as audiences follow stay-at-home guidelines,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Robert Bakish said on a conference call with analysts.  Total advertising revenue declined 19% to $2.48 billion, due in part to the cancellation of the NCAA \u201cMarch Madness\u201d basketball tournament because of the pandemic.  Chief Financial Officer Christina Spade, speaking on the same call, said the company expects \u201csignificantly lower ad demand\u201d in the second quarter, with advertising improving in the third and fourth quarters if businesses reopen.  ViacomCBS, which produces content for other streaming services in addition to distributing its own films and TV shows, has been preparing to launch a new streaming service that will build on CBS All Access. Bakish said the company is accelerating its plans for that service, with major changes coming this summer.  The company also announced that it entered into an expanded distribution agreement with Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google for YouTube TV subscribers, adding 14 new ViacomCBS channels to the service.  Spade said the company does not expect to release any new movies in the second quarter or until theaters reopen broadly.  Viacom and CBS \u2014 controlled by Sumner and Shari Redstone\u2019s National Amusements Inc, \u2014 completed their merger in December to better compete against Netflix, Walt Disney Co DIS.N, Apple Inc AAPL.O and other media and technology giants. The company has said the deal would result in $750 million in cost savings, up from the previous target of $500 million.  Revenue fell 6.1% to $6.67 billion in the quarter ended March 31, but beat the average analyst estimate of $6.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue from domestic streaming and digital video jumped 51% to $471 million.  Adjusted earnings of $1.13 per share beat analysts\u2019 expectations of $0.96, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company reported net income of $516 million, or 84 cents per share, compared with $1.96 billion, or $3.18 per share.","49":"BERLIN (Reuters) - German media group Bertelsmann has agreed to purchase publisher Simon & Schuster for $2.175 billion in cash from ViacomCBS, strengthening its presence in the United States.  Bertelsmann outbid Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp in a contest for the publisher of Dan Brown, Hillary Clinton and Stephen King which Viacom put on the block earlier this year.  The deal represents the second major move in CEO Thomas Rabe\u2019s drive to consolidate Bertelsmann as the world\u2019s biggest bookseller, after the 185-year-old publisher took full control of Penguin Random House less than a year ago.  \u201cWe are building our position as one of the leading creative content companies in the United States,\u201d Rabe said on Wednesday of the move deeper into Bertelsmann\u2019s second-largest market.  \u201cI\u2019m convinced that this a good day both for book publishing and for authors.\u201d  The acquisition of Simon & Schuster, which reported revenue of $814 million in 2019, is profitable and employs 1,500 staff, is expected to close in 2021 subject to U.S. antitrust approval.  The merged entity would have a U.S. market share of less than 20%, making the transaction \u201capprovable\u201d, Rabe told reporters.  However, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson criticised the deal, which he said had an \u201canti-market logic\u201d.  \u201cBertelsmann is not just buying a book publisher, but buying market dominance as a book behemoth. Distributors, retailers, authors and readers would be paying for this proposed deal for a very long time to come,\u201d Thomson added.  Pencils with the logo of German media group Bertelsmann CEO are seen at the annual news conference Berlin, Germany, March 22, 2016. REUTERS\/Fabrizio Bensch\/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD PACKAGE - SEARCH 'BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD NOV 7' FOR ALL IMAGES  TALKING BOOKS  Jonathan Karp and Dennis Eulau will stay on to run Simon & Schuster under the umbrella of the far larger Penguin Random House. Combining printing, sales and distribution would deliver significant synergies, Rabe said.  Size is important in publishing as bestseller lists become dominated by a handful of blockbusters - such as Penguin Random House\u2019s edition of ex-U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s memoir \u2018A Promised Land\u2019.  But overall U.S. book sales have been growing by a mere 1% a year, according to the American Association of Publishers, as readers are distracted by social media and other online formats.  Rabe described books as the \u201cpast, present and future\u201d of Bertelsmann but also highlighted the U.S. publishing deal\u2019s significance for its digital content as people turn to e-books or listen to narrated \u2018talking\u2019 books.  CASHING IN  Founded in 1835 as a publisher of theological texts, Bertelsmann is a private conglomerate spanning magazine, educational and music publishing and controls European TV group RTL.  Rabe is restructuring to reduce its exposure to declining areas such as printing, has merged its Arvato CRM customer services unit, and made a string of smaller technology bets.  The lack of its own public equity to serve as an acquisition \u2018currency\u2019 has constrained Bertelsmann\u2019s ability to chase big deals, even as tech giants led by Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s Google suck up more ad dollars.  Yet Rabe was able to pay cash after this year building a war chest of 4.3 billion euros ($5.1 billion) in liquid funds.  Rabe pulled this off by retrenching during the coronavirus crisis, and selling other investments and property. And, while Bertelsmann\u2019s focus is mainly on organic growth, it has the capacity to do further deals, he added.  ViacomCBS, which was advised by LionTree Advisors and Shearman & Sterling LLP, said it would plough the sale proceeds into its streaming operations, fund its dividend and repay debt.","50":"LOS ANGELES, Nov 4 (Reuters) - An estimated 22.8 million people watched U.S. election returns on television on Tuesday night, as the outcome remained in the balance, according to preliminary ratings figures cited by Hollywood outlet The Wrap.

HBO\/Handout via REUTERS  \"Watchmen\" scored 26 nods, including best limited series, while Amazon Studio's AMZN.O \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" got 20.  Netflix NFLX.O led all platforms with a record 160 nominations for shows ranging from \"Stranger Things\" to \"Tiger King.\" It was followed by HBO with 107, including a surprise nod for Zendaya, the 23-year-old mixed race star of teen drama \"Euphoria.\"  \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d the sleeper hit comedy about a wealthy family forced to live in a rundown motel, scored 15 nods, including for best comedy series and its four main cast members.

The Television Academy did not give a breakdown but Variety calculated that 35, or 34.3%, of the 102 acting nominations went to Black actors, smashing the previous highest tally of 27.7% in 2018.  \u201cI\u2019m proud to see so many Black artists nominated this year.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Chancery Court said it was reasonable to infer from the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that the December 2019 merger was \u201cnot entirely fair,\u201d and that Redstone used it \u201cto consolidate her control of Viacom and CBS at the expense of the Viacom minority stockholders.\u201d  Shari Redstone\u2019s National Amusements Inc had controlled about 80% of the voting power of both Viacom and CBS, despite owning about 10% of the respective shares.

In his 76-page decision, Slights let the shareholders pursue breach of fiduciary duty claims against Redstone, National Amusements and Viacom directors who negotiated the merger.  He dismissed the same claim against ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish, finding no evidence of wrongdoing and saying it appeared Bakish \u201cdeliberately chose not to flaunt his power as chief executive.\u201d  ViacomCBS\u2019 businesses include CBS television, CBS News, Showtime, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount movie studio.

ViacomCBS executives have not made a firm decision, but are considering a service with advertisements that will combine CBS All Access with Viacom's channels such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and Paramount Pictures, the report cnb.cx\/3bh5zUH added.  The company did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.  ViacomCBS will become the latest media company to throw its hat in the streaming ring after the launch of streaming services by Apple Inc and Walt Disney Co in November.  CBS and Viacom completed their merger in December, reuniting media mogul Sumner Redstone\u2019s U.S. entertainment empire.","57":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. movie theater operators, who were forced to shut their doors in March to help slow the coronavirus spread, are aiming to welcome back crowds across the country by late July for a belated kickoff to the summer movie season.  FILE PHOTO: A man cycles past a shuttered movie theater in Times Square following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  Ahead of that, operators are considering a transition period when they open some locations in parts of the United States where the novel coronavirus outbreak is receding fastest. That could start as early as mid-June, said Patrick Corcoran, spokesman for the National Association of Theatre Owners, though he called any timeline \u201cvery tentative.\u201d  The timing will depend on guidance from health authorities, he said.  Among the challenges theaters face are making sure filmgoers feel comfortable gathering in groups and having a variety of appealing movies. Hollywood studios are unlikely to release big-budget films when they cannot mount a nationwide release.  Expected blockbusters such as Walt Disney Co's DIS.N \"Mulan\" and \"Wonder Woman 1984\" from AT&T Inc's T.N Warner Bros are currently scheduled for late July and August.  \u201cThere are two schools of thought,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cPeople will be very tense and careful and nervous, or people will just be desperate to get out of the house. It\u2019s going to probably be a mixture.\u201d  During their first weeks back in business, theaters likely will show classic movies or films that were playing in March, when theaters went dark, Corcoran said.  That could mean reviving a beloved musical such as \u201cGrease\u201d or running a marathon of \u201cBack to the Future\u201d or \u201cHarry Potter\u201d movies, said Brock Bagby, executive vice president of Missouri-based B&B Theatres, which operates 400 screens in seven states.  Executives are brainstorming ways to draw audiences, such as staging a costume contest around a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film or serving butterbeer, Potter\u2019s favorite beverage, Bagby said. Not on the agenda are \u201csad or very heavy dramas,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe want the movies we bring back to bring joy to people,\u201d Bagby said.  \u2018A DELICATE DANCE\u2019  Operators also are debating how visible to be with steps such as extra cleaning, \u201cwhether it makes people comfortable or more nervous,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a delicate dance with any kind of precaution like that.\u201d  Theaters owners likely will look at restaurants and bars for clues on how people are reacting. Safety measures may vary at different cinema locations depending on local guidance, he added.  Bagby said B&B\u2019s locations will implement social distancing if authorities recommend it. In the weekend before theaters closed, the company cut auditorium capacity by 50% to leave room between seats and had \u201czero issues,\u201d he said. Customers adhered to the practice and some showtimes sold out at half-full, he said.  During the shutdown, theater chains and independent operators have been trying to tap government assistance or other financing to stay afloat. Cinemark Holdings Inc CNK.N, for example, said on Monday it had raised $250 million through a sale of debt.  Getting a full slate of Hollywood movies back on the calendar depends not just on the United States. Studios will need receipts from around the globe to support their most expensive films, said Chris Aronson, president of film distribution at ViacomCBS Inc's VIACA.O Paramount Pictures.  Paramount plans to release animated family film \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run\u201d on Aug. 7, a week later than its previous July 31 slot. The studio moved another summer flick, \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d to December.  In China, the world\u2019s second-largest movie market, authorities re-opened theaters in March following an extended closure, but abruptly shut them two weeks later without explanation.  \u201cIf there is great uncertainty in major parts of the world,\u201d Aronson said, \u201cI think there are going to be issues opening major films.\u201d","58":"(Reuters) - With just two weeks to go before the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans kick off the National Football League\u2019s 2020 season, advertisers and sponsors are preparing for the worst in case the coronavirus pandemic disrupts or even outright cancels the season.  FILE PHOTO: The NFL logo is pictured at an event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  The stakes could not be higher for the NFL, which brings in close to $3 billion in advertising for the TV networks and is one of the last remaining live events that draw huge audiences for advertisers in a year when most college sports and the Tokyo Olympics were put on hold, ad agency executives said.  \u201cWe\u2019re making sure the contingency plans have contingency plans,\u201d said Doug Rozen, chief media officer at ad agency 360i, a unit of Dentsu Aegis Network, which counts 7-Eleven and Ben and Jerry\u2019s as clients.  While all signs point to a Sept. 10 kickoff, according to the NFL, advertising agencies are moving ahead with backup planning. Possible plan B\u2019s include shifting some of their clients\u2019 marketing budgets into online video platforms like YouTube, Hulu or Roku that have racked up audiences during the pandemic as viewers have been trapped at home, Rozen said.  Advertisers are also considering moving money into digital ad formats that are focused on ecommerce and pushing sales, which has become more important during the pandemic, he added.  Meanwhile, official NFL sponsors, which sign multi-year contracts that were worth $1.47 billion last season for the league, are still busy figuring out how to replace their usual advertising inside the stadium, since many teams have chosen to play games without an audience in the stands, according to sports marketing agencies that serve sponsors.  Brands and teams are working together to get creative and reach fans on digital or social media, such as hosting virtual autograph signing events for players, said Molly Arbogast, chief executive at POV Sports Marketing.  Sponsors are preparing for all possibilities because it would be \u201cnaive to think that football will be immune to what happened in baseball,\u201d she said, referring to the recent virus outbreaks in Major League Baseball, which has led to nearly 40 games being postponed after the season started due to positive COVID-19 cases.  Still, no amount of contingency planning is likely to provide the same exposure for sponsors and advertisers that they would have gotten from the NFL.  \u201cEveryone needs the games to be played,\u201d Arbogast said, adding the NFL\u2019s importance is why some sponsors and teams may work together to extend their contracts if an entire season is canceled.  Networks including Walt Disney Co\u2019s ESPN and Fox which hold the rights to air certain nights of NFL games are likely to see higher prices for remaining ad slots, especially now that leagues have canceled the fall college football season. But the networks will likely find it difficult to convince advertisers to shift all their money onto other content on their platforms if the NFL season is disrupted, media buyers said.  The uncertainty and economic challenges are already complicating discussions about advertising during the Super Bowl in February. Some brands have yet to decide whether and how they will advertise during the biggest televised event of the year, said Tom McGovern, president of Optimum Sports, a unit of Omnicom, which works with brands like Pepsi and State Farm.  CBS, which will air the Super Bowl, is expecting to charge an average of $5.5 million per 30-second commercial, in line with last year\u2019s rate, and is also requiring advertisers to purchase space in the online stream of the game for about $200,000, according to a source familiar with the matter. In 2019, CBS streamed the Super Bowl on its CBS All Access streaming service as well as all CBS Sports\u2019 website and apps.  \u201cThere is no replacing the NFL,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cWithout college football, you have less (ad) supply, and the NFL was the contingency plan for that.\u201d","59":"HONG KONG\/LONDON\/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.

Weirdly, boss Adam Aron was nonchalant about customers wearing face coverings until an intense backlash prompted him to reverse course. Guests are now required to don masks nationwide. Yet it may not matter, because cinemas\u2019 glory days are almost certainly past.  Just look at the new releases. True, Walt Disney and Warner Bros are releasing two tent-pole films, \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cTenet,\u201d through cinemas. But others aren\u2019t. ViacomCBS said on Monday that \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run\u201d will be distributed in early 2021 on demand and then exclusively through its streaming service CBS All Access. A combination of changing habits and media groups with new digital platforms to promote may play a bigger factor in AMC\u2019s plans than whether or not the guy in the next seat wears a mask. (By Jennifer Saba)  STRINGS ATTACHED. Struggling acrobatics troupe Cirque du Soleil may be getting a lifeline from the Quebec government. The Canadian province, where the high-flying act is based, is prepared to lend $200 million to get Cirque back in motion, Bloomberg reports. But Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon, who spent part of his career before politics as an investment banker and finance chief at National Bank of Canada, is making potential recipients work for the money.  It will only be available after Cirque backflips out of its debt restructuring. Fitzgibbon has so far only offered the cash to Cirque\u2019s current shareholders \u2013 TPG, Fosun International and Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec \u2013 so they\u2019d need to secure control from creditors, some of whom already made an offer for Cirque. And to avoid what he called Cirque\u2019s \u201cdisaster of a capital structure,\u201d the province\u2019s debt would have to be Cirque\u2019s only debt. Those are some understandable restraints. (By Antony Currie)  POLISH SPARKLE. Private equity firms Cinven, Permira and Mid Europa Partners are planning an initial public offering of Poland\u2019s biggest e-commerce website, Allegro, Bloomberg reported late on Monday. The enterprise value at the time of their investment just three years ago was $3.25 billion. It\u2019s expected to be valued at $11 billion in a listing after the summer, Bloomberg reported without specifying whether that included debt.  Online shopping has been a winner from coronavirus lockdowns and global players like Amazon.com have limited market share in Poland. As one of the few big European floats this year and the biggest after coffee group JDE Peet\u2019s, there may well be pent-up investor demand. Still, the banks that are coordinating the deal will have to watch out for market volatility, either if there\u2019s a big spike in virus infections or before the U.S. presidential election. Even a strong IPO candidate may have to price generously. (By Dasha Afanasieva)  SUNBURNED. Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 star LeBron James may be facing his toughest opponent yet: Florida. National Basketball Association players are supposed to be hitting the courts in the state next month. But the Sunshine State now has over 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases \u2013 and recently posted record numbers of new daily cases.  True, the 22 teams are set to play in a bubble-like atmosphere with extensive health guidelines outlined in an 113-page document. But ESPN reported that players and executives have still expressed concerns.  And it\u2019s not just the hoopsters. Major League Baseball \u2013 which, in theory, will play ball this year \u2013 closed spring training facilities in Florida and Arizona until they can be deemed safe, partly because five Philadelphia Phillies players stationed in Florida tested positive. It\u2019s one more sign that the United States\u2019 haphazard response to the coronavirus crisis could make getting back in the game a challenge. (By Anna Szymanski)  ANGKOR WUT? It\u2019s getting pricier to see Siem Reap. Even as some small countries try to help cover virus-related travel costs, Cambodia is asking visitors to put up a $3,000 deposit to pay for a Covid-19 test upon entry and any other potential treatments or fees. And to be extra sure, officials also want proof of $50,000 of health insurance. A cautious approach is understandable for a nation with only 129 reported coronavirus cases and no deaths.  Additional barriers to entry, though, could be problematic for a place where travel and tourism accounts for more than 26% of GDP. Few insurance policies cover a known pandemic. Returning home to most countries often requires a 14-day quarantine. The comparative advantage of open borders also could disappear quickly. Some well-heeled travelers may be itchy to get to the renowned Angkor Wat temple complex, but Cambodia\u2019s solution hardly seems like a passport to recovery. (By Jamie Lo)  HIT THE BRAKES. So much for automakers\u2019 hopes for a V-shaped recovery. Sales by the likes of Volkswagen, Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, are expected to decline by a quarter in 2020 compared with last year, according to a new forecast on Tuesday from the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.  The gloom contrasts with some analysts\u2019 hopes that social distancing might actually be a positive, by making workers drive rather than use public transport. The estimate, equivalent to 3.2 million fewer European vehicle registrations than 2019, implies only a gradual uptick from a 41.5% year-to-date decline. The ACEA wants government help to bolster an industry that accounts for 11% of EU manufacturing jobs. The omens aren\u2019t promising. Buyer incentives have so far focused on niche electric vehicles \u2013 less than one in 10 of the new wheels on the roads. (By Christopher Thompson)  CAR CHASE. By contrast, used car sales may be getting a viral turbocharge. At least that\u2019s the pitch from online selling platform Cazoo, which is now worth $1 billion. The latest brainchild of Alex Chesterman, creator of Lovefilm and online property platform Zoopla, managed to convince investor Draper Esprit and others to inject another 25 million pounds on Tuesday, taking its total fundraising to 200 million pounds.  Investors have little way of knowing if they\u2019ve bought a dud. The company launched just six months ago and so can\u2019t even present a full set of accounts. Last week its finance director said Cazoo had generated 40 million pounds of sales since it hit the tarmac. If it maintained that pace throughout the year, its touted valuation would be roughly 10 times sales, way more than established U.S. rival Carvana\u2019s six times. At least somebody trusts second-hand car salesmen.

The celebrity-laden ads aim to inject some humor and levity into the year\u2019s most-watched U.S. televised event after 11 months of social distancing and lockdowns.  Longtime advertisers Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s Budweiser and Coca-Cola are sitting out the match-up between Kansas City and Tampa Bay to fund COVID-19 vaccine efforts or save money.  Their absence makes room for a new roster of advertisers that have boomed as the world faces a third wave of the health crisis, marketing experts said.  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this many first-timers as a percentage of the advertisers,\u201d said Charles Taylor, a Villanova University professor of marketing.  Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B will join Wayne and Garth to sing a jingle and tell viewers to eat locally, kicking off a $20 million Uber Eats campaign to support independent restaurants.  Rapper Cardi B appears with Mike Myers and Dana Carvey as their \"Wayne's World\" characters in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters on February 3, 2021. Uber Eats\/Handout via REUTERS.  Logitech, maker of computer keyboards and webcams which consumers rushed to buy as they worked from home, recruited rapper Lil Nas X to appear in a spot reflecting how artists have used technology \u201cto create the future,\u201d set to his newest song.  Some upstart brands found ways to poke fun at rivals while touting their business model as safer during the pandemic.  In a commercial for Vroom, a man sits strapped to an interrogation chair as he attempts to buy a car from a traditional dealership. The online used-car marketplace will tout its home delivery service and contact-less buying process.  Despite the pause by perennial advertisers, ViacomCBS\u2019s CBS broadcast network last week said it had sold out commercial time for the game. A 30-second ad sold for about $5.5 million this year, about the same as last year, said a person familiar with the matter.  \u201cWith bigger names pulling out, it gives us a chance to break through even more than we expected,\u201d said Peter Scherr, chief marketing officer at Vroom.  A FINE LINE  While Super Bowl advertisers usually go for laughs or tug at viewers\u2019 heartstrings, brands are skating a fine line to avoid insensitive humor - no gerbil shot from a cannon this year - or further depress sports fans after an emotionally draining 2020, ad experts said.  Humorous ads are more likely to be uplifting, rather than \u201cknee-slapping sophomoric humor,\u201d said Leeann Leahy, chief executive of VIA Agency, which has worked on past Super Bowl spots for Johnson & Johnson and Lowe\u2019s.  System1, an agency that analyzes consumer responses to ads, said early testing shows Super Bowl teasers that use nostalgia and escapism as themes are proving popular with audiences, with Uber Eats being one of the top teasers as of Wednesday.  Uber Eats competitor DoorDash will air its first game day commercial featuring actor and rapper Daveed Diggs alongside Big Bird and other Sesame Street stars, drawing inspiration from the children\u2019s show\u2019s focus on the impact of neighbors and local businesses on people\u2019s lives the last year, said Kofi Amoo-Gottfried, vice president of marketing at DoorDash.  And although Budweiser will sit out the game for the first time in over 35 years, the brand\u2019s owner, brewing conglomerate Anheuser-Busch, will air an ad for the first time at the Super Bowl reflecting its optimism for the end of the pandemic as vaccines roll out.  The commercial, part of the company\u2019s two-year $1 billion economic recovery campaign, features a montage of people in normal times, including a woman who offers to buy a beer for her laid-off coworker and old friends catching up over a drink.  \u201cEveryone is saying, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to get together again,\u2019\u201d said Marcel Marcondes, U.S. chief marketing officer at Anheuser-Busch. \u201cIt\u2019s always more than just grabbing a beer.\u201d","61":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street shrugged off a sluggish start and closed higher on Thursday, with the Nasdaq ending the session above 11,000 for the first time as investors hoped for a new fiscal stimulus package.  Tech and tech-related heavyweight stocks such as Apple AAPL.O, which rose 3.49% and Facebook FB.O, up 6.49% helped pace gains on the indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq clinched a new record high in early trading, and closed above the 11,000-mark for the first time after initially climbing above it on Wednesday.  The benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow were about 1% and 7% away from their own peaks scaled in February.  \u201cMarkets have been incredibly resilient, there is a big fear of missing out and it is the old stalwarts, the technology leaders that keep driving the market higher,\u201d said Sal Bruno, chief investment officer at IndexIQ in New York.  Economic data released on Thursday painted a mixed picture as U.S. Labor Department numbers showed a first fall in jobless claims in three weeks, although a separate report showed a 54% surge in job cuts announced by employers in July. The data comes ahead of the government payrolls report on Friday.  Investors are looking to the next fiscal aid package to further cope with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday Republicans and Democrats remained far apart over what to include in another wave of relief.  Senate Republicans have been told that negotiators have until Friday to reach agreement. \u201cIf there\u2019s not a deal by Friday, there won\u2019t be a deal,\u201d Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters on Wednesday.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure people are taking the drop dead date seriously because most people probably view that as a negotiating ploy and people realize the government is going to have to do something,\u201d said Bruno.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  Ahead of the deadline for a new stimulus package, the focus now shifts to the July jobs report Friday morning, with analysts forecasting a rise of 1.58 million new jobs last month and a decline in the unemployment rate to 10.5%.  As major averages continue to rally off their March lows, powered by heaps of fiscal and monetary stimulus and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings, the Dow and S&P notched their fifth straight daily gain, with the Nasdaq climbing for a seventh consecutive session.  The corporate results season is now in its final stretch, with about 424 S&P 500 firms having reported so far. Earnings have been about 22.5% above analyst expectations, according to IBES Refinitiv data, the highest on record since 1994.  Communication services .SPLRCL and technology .SPLRCT were the best performing of the 11 major S&P sectors on the day.  Among individual shares, Becton Dickinson and Co BDX.N dropped 8.40% after posting quarterly revenue below estimates as delayed elective procedures during coronavirus-led lockdowns squeezed demand for some of its devices.  Western Digital WDC.O sank 16.12% after the hard drive maker reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and forecast a soft current quarter.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N gained 2.75% after the drugmaker raised its annual profit forecast on hopes of a recovery in demand for its hospital-administered drugs.  ViacomCBS Inc VIACA.O climbed 3.35% after beating analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue due to high demand for streaming.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 151 new highs and 5 new lows.  About 9.69 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 10.39 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.","62":"(Reuters) - ViacomCBS VIACA.O said on Thursday it promoted insider Jonathan Karp as president and chief executive officer of its publishing unit, Simon & Schuster, effective immediately.  Karp, who joined the publication in 2010 and most recently served as president and publisher of its adult publishing division, succeeds Carolyn Reidy who passed away earlier this month.  ViacomCBS said in March it was exploring options for its publishing unit to focus on its advertising and streaming business. CEO Robert Bakish had said the company was receiving multiple offers.  Simon & Schuster was originally a part of CBS Corp, which merged with Viacom in December in their third attempt since 2016 to gird against competition in a rapidly consolidating media universe.","63":"(Reuters) - If U.S. President Donald Trump secures a second term in the White House, look for an auto emissions battle with California, a bid to downsize Big Tech and more strong audience ratings for cable news.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he leaves after holding a campaign rally at Fayetteville Regional Airport in Fayetteville, North Carolina, U.S., November 2, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  Here is how a re-election of President Trump could impact six key industries. For a FACTBOX on how these sectors might change if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the election, click.  AUTOMAKERS  A Trump re-election would leave U.S. automakers caught in the crossfire of a war over climate policy between Washington and the state of California.  California sued Trump for rolling back national vehicle emissions standards and seeking to cancel the state\u2019s authority to mandate sales of electric vehicles.  Automakers stand to save billions in compliance costs under Trump\u2019s emissions approach. But the clash with California over emissions and electric vehicles has divided automakers. It has also left the industry to deal with two sets of regulations for the increasingly divergent coastal Blue state markets and heartland, Red state markets. Automakers have long advocated resolving differences between California and federal climate policy to create a single, national set of standards to guide their technology investments.  During his first term, Trump put pressure on Detroit automakers to step up investments in the United States, attacking General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co for decisions to close plants, or invest in China and Mexico. Trump periodically threatened German automakers with tariffs. His steel and aluminum tariffs raised costs for U.S. automakers.  PHARMACEUTICALS  Trump has been a vocal critic of high drug prices but experts say the pharmaceutical industry will likely fare better under a Trump second term than they would if Joe Biden wins the White House.  Trump passed a number of executive orders designed to slash drug prices in his first term but experts say they have had little practical impact.  His efforts to spur Congress to pass new laws to reduce drug costs have been much less successful, in part because his own party blocked a bill that would have allowed Medicare, a government health insurance program, to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.  MINING  Trump, should he win re-election, is expected to continue to slash mining industry regulations and shorten the permitting process, part of a wide-ranging effort to boost domestic production of the minerals used to make electronics, weapons and a host of other goods.  Trump signed several executive orders in his first term that labeled rare earths and other minerals as critical to national defense, ordering the Pentagon to financially support junior projects. The U.S. only has one rare earths mine, though it relies on China for processing. A second Trump term could see multiple new domestic rare earth mines as well as new processing equipment from Rare Element Resources Ltd and others.  At least one mining project could be jeopardized in Trump\u2019s new term, however. Alaska\u2019s Pebble Mine project, a massive copper and gold deposit in the Bristol Bay watershed, has come under criticism by Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who have said the mine would destroy areas where they enjoy fishing and hunting. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in late August extended its permit review timeline out past the election, a step that came after both privately lobbied the president.  The mine\u2019s developer, Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, has said the mine can be safely developed. But Alaska\u2019s two U.S. senators, both Republicans, have publicly come out against the mine, adding further pressure on Trump to deny it permits.  MEDIA  Media companies are poised to benefit if Trump gets another four years in office, based on demand for TV, print and digital news coverage since his election in 2016.  While news consumers first tuned in for coverage of the outspoken president and his administration, the triple threat of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, and racial strife have kept them engaged.  The New York Times, for example, saw its digital-only subscriptions grow more than fourfold between the end of the second quarter in 2016 and the same period this year. Shares of the New York Times Co are up more than 250% since election day 2016.  Evening TV news broadcasts have also seen a resurgence, with Comcast-owned NBC, ViacomCBS Inc-owned CBS and Walt Disney Co\u2019s ABC experiencing their biggest news audiences in years.  Ratings for cable news networks AT&T-owned CNN, Fox Corp-owned Fox News and Comcast\u2019s MSNBC - with their loyal, politically-divided followings - are up 72 percent from last year, according to Nielsen. Fox News was the highest-rated network in all of television for prime-time viewers in July, August and September, per Nielsen.  But despite the uptick in audiences, news organizations continue to suffer from declining advertising revenue, spurred by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc, and exacerbated by the pandemic. Many marketers have slashed their advertising budgets, leading news organizations to lay off tens of thousands of employees.  If the negative news cycle continues into a second Trump term, ad dollars may not follow. For years, ad tech firms have offered tools for brands to block ads from appearing on web pages or URLs that include keywords like \u201cshooting\u201d or \u201cmurder.\u201d These advertising \u201cblacklists\u201d exploded in usage after the 2016 U.S. election, when brands sought to avoid polarizing news stories. Many brands have been reluctant to buy ads against coronavirus and Black Lives Matter coverage.  A second Trump term could help sustain interest in journalism, with an engaged public glued to the news, and a president who has acknowledged his role keeping them there.  \u201cAnother reason that I\u2019m going to win another four years is because newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I\u2019m not there because without me, their ratings are going down the tubes,\u201d Trump said in 2017, according to the New York Times.  RETAIL\/TRADE  U.S. President Trump has imposed $370 billion in tariffs on goods imported from China, part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. Those tariffs on products ranging from handbags to small electronics are estimated to have cost U.S. importers some $61.6 billion through early September, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and have been blamed for eroding U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Retailers argue the tariffs will result in higher prices for consumers and lost jobs.  \u201cIf Trump wins, he will see the election as a validation of his strategy on trade policy, including his use of tariffs, and will certainly continue to follow this strategy with China,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, National Retail Federation Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy.  The trade organization hopes any new deal can be reached without the threat of tariffs.  TECH  If Trump holds the White House, big tech companies will face continued pressure from regulators on antitrust issues. The Trump administration has already sued Alphabet\u2019s Google and a suit against Facebook is said to be coming soon. Should Democrats win the Senate, that could add to the risks for tech, as Democrats are calling for even more scrutiny of practices they say have stifled innovation and reduce competition. Trump may also ramp up his rhetorical war over what he contends is censorship of conservative views on the major social platforms.  The most immediate tech question for Trump will be what to do with TikTok, the Chinese-owned app that his administration says is a security risk that must be transferred to American ownership or banned.  With the election in the rearview, tech companies who depend on China as a supplier or buyer will be watching to see if Trump\u2019s approach to trade ratchets up or cools down.","64":"Jan 31 (Reuters) - ViacomCBS Inc said on Friday that senior NBCUniversal executive George Cheeks will take over the reins of CBS Entertainment Group from Joe Ianniello on March 23.  CBS appointed Chairman Ianniello as the interim CEO of the company in September 2018, after Leslie Moonves resigned from the position amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault.  Cheeks, a media and entertainment industry veteran, will join as president and chief executive officer.  His appointment comes after CBS and Viacom completed their merger in December, reuniting media mogul Sumner Redstone\u2019s U.S. entertainment empire.  The deal combined the CBS television network, CBS News, Showtime cable networks with MTV Networks, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and the Paramount movie studios.","65":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia recorded a further 17 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday but infections in the hard-hit state of Victoria, the site of all the latest deaths, are showing a downward trend, authorities said on Sunday.  FILE PHOTO: A staff member is seen inside the Epping Gardens Aged Care Facility amid the second wave of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Melbourne, Australia, August 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Sandra Sanders  Other than in Victoria, which accounts for over 80% of Australia\u2019s COVID-19 deaths due to a second wave of infections, the country has largely avoided the high casualty numbers of many nations with about 24,500 infections and 502 deaths.  Globally, nearly 5,900 people are dying every 24 hours from COVID-19 on average, according to a Reuters tally, with the United States, Brazil and India leading the rise in fatalities.  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the state, which is almost halfway through a six-week lockdown, had confirmed 208 new infections in the preceding 24 hours. That was higher than the 182 new cases reported on Saturday, but was still lower than the weekly average, he said.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to defeat this second wave,\u201d Andrews told reporters. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll be able to begin the process of opening up. Exactly when that is, we can\u2019t give people a definitive date. But ... my aim is to round out the year with something - a COVID normal.\u201d  Andrews said 11 of the 17 deaths confirmed in the 24 hours to Sunday were linked to virus outbreaks at aged care facilities.  In the state capital Melbourne, production of reality TV series 'The Masked Singer' was halted after \"several crew members\" tested positive for the virus, the ViacomCBS Inc-owned VIACA.O free-to-air broadcaster Ten Network said in a social media post.  Elsewhere, New South Wales, the most populous state, and the north-eastern state of Queensland reported five new cases combined on Sunday. Western Australia reported one new infection, the first confirmed case since Wednesday.  As the spread of the disease slows, state and federal governments have been discussing easing the cap on returning Australians of 4,000 per week to help repatriate those stranded overseas, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Sunday.  A spokeswoman for the prime minister\u2019s office did not return requests for comment.  In neighbouring New Zealand, health authorities reported three new positive cases on Sunday.","66":"(Reuters) - Fox News Channel\u2019s election coverage led all networks with 14.1 million prime-time viewers on a night it riled President Donald Trump and some of his supporters with an early call from a battleground state for Democrat Joe Biden, ratings data showed.

Fox News, the network owned by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corp, and whose commentators often promote Trump\u2019s agenda, stood alone for three hours with its projection that Biden would win Arizona. As of Wednesday, the winner of the presidency remained undecided while vote counts continued.  Fox News was also more than five hours ahead of CNN on projecting Biden would take Virginia, and hours in front on other states. It beat the Associated Press by 90 minutes on saying Trump would win the battleground state of Florida. None of those calls have been disputed.  \u201cWhether they were premature or right on time, the fact of the matter is that they were calling the races in the way races should be called, instead of through the lens that Trump would prefer,\u201d said Frank Sesno, a former CNN correspondent and director of strategic initiatives at George Washington University\u2019s School of Media and Public Affairs. \u201cThat\u2019s their job.\u201d  Their approach angered some Trump backers. Jason Miller, a Trump campaign senior adviser, and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey were among those saying Fox News acted too quickly. Fox News correspondent John Roberts said on air that the Trump campaign was \u201clivid.\u201d  As the night unfolded, Fox News\u2019 average audience topped rivals in prime time and into the early morning hours of Wednesday, according to Nielsen data. From 6 p.m. to 3 a.m. EST, Fox News averaged 10.9 million viewers, compared with 7.0 million for CNN. Fox News\u2019 Arizona call came shortly before 11:30 p.m. EST.  Fox News already had irritated Trump and some supporters in recent months.  \u201cThe people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!,\u201d Trump tweeted in August.  Overall election night viewership slumped below 2016 when Trump upset Democrat Hillary Clinton. Nielsen figures showed that roughly 56.9 million people watched this year\u2019s prime-time coverage across 21 networks.  In 2016, 71.4 million people watched across 13 networks.  The TV ratings do not include viewership via online platforms, which have jumped in popularity.","67":"Nov 6 (Reuters) - ViacomCBS Inc beat analysts\u2019 estimates for quarterly revenue on Friday as higher demand for its streaming services, CBS All Access and Showtime, partially offset a decline in ad sales.

Yet advertising revenue has plummeted for many publishers as companies slash marketing budgets and prove reluctant to buy ads against coronavirus coverage for fear of tarnishing their brand.  Forecasts for global advertising growth this year have been revised down by $20 billion since March 12, according to market research firm eMarketer. It estimates ad spending growth of just 8.4% in China, where the outbreak began, the slowest since 2011.  Total local advertising in the United States could decline by up to 30% this year, or $38 billion, according to media research firm Borrell Associates.  Publishers, advertising agencies and tech firms that help place ads have been trying to persuade brands to rethink, arguing that by eschewing coronavirus coverage, advertisers are losing access to engaged readers.  So far, they appear to have had limited success.  \u201cI can\u2019t say we\u2019ve yet noticed a change,\u201d said Ben Walmsley, commercial director for publishing at News UK, a division of News Corp. \u201cI think change will be relatively slow.\u201d  ViacomCBS-owned CBS News Digital has made some headway with marketers and agencies, said Christy Tanner, its executive vice president and general manager. \u201cBut it\u2019s been more slow-going than most of us would like.\u201d  The Washington Post and the Atlantic said they also had not seen a shift in behaviour from advertisers who are avoiding pandemic content.  The industry was already suffering from declining advertising revenue. Gannett, BuzzFeed, Britain\u2019s MailOnline and News Corp Australia have all announced furloughs, pay cuts or other cost-cutting measures.  Damon Reeve, CEO of the Ozone Project, which sells the online ad inventory of a majority of British national titles, said he had heard that advertising was being kept away from up to 60% of editorial content.  A representative for Reuters news organization said the company has also experienced an impact and cited an Internet Advertising Bureau study that showed 70% of advertisers have scaled back ad spending across the industry during this period.  \"Factual news coverage on the global pandemic is essential and must be supported,\" Reuters CEO Michael Friedenberg said on Twitter here on April 2. \"It is incumbent upon the ad tech and verification industry to ensure that trusted news from reputable sources about Covid-19 is not blocked by safety filters.\"  Five of the top U.S. advertising spenders last year - Comcast, AT&T, Amazon, P&G and General Motors - either declined to comment or did not respond to questions about their advertising policies.  \u201cBLACKLIST\u201d BACKLASH  For years, ad tech firms such as DoubleVerify have offered tools for brands to stop ads from appearing on web pages or URLs that include keywords like \u201cshooting\u201d or \u201cmurder.\u201d These advertising \u201cblacklists\u201d exploded in usage after the 2016 U.S. election, when brands sought to avoid polarizing news coverage.  \u201cTrump\u201d was the most popular blacklist keyword until \u201ccoronavirus\u201d overtook it earlier this year, with more than 3,100 advertisers blocking it as of March, according to ad tech firm Integral Ad Science.  Ad agencies GroupM and Universal McCann have advised clients against blacklisting all coronavirus articles.  \u201cThere are stories about death tolls in Italy or the UK which would not be very appropriate to be monetised, but there are stories about communities coming together and we wouldn\u2019t want to block that kind of content,\u201d said Stevan Randjelovic, GroupM\u2019s director of brand safety and digital risk.  Some ad tech companies have urged brands to use tools that help stop ads from appearing on some but not all articles pertaining to coronavirus. Trade groups representing news publishers have also called on the ad community to stop using keyword blocking practices.  \u201cThe leaders that need to be speaking out are the advertising brands and the CMOs and I\u2019m starting to see some of that,\u201d said Jason Kint, CEO of trade group Digital Content Next.  The Washington Post sales team is working directly with some advertisers who were previously purchasing ads through automated tools, which might avoid the Post if keyword blocking were applied, said Joy Robins, the newspaper\u2019s chief revenue officer.  \u201cIf we\u2019re not able to hand-hold and work directly with brands, there are a lot of unintended consequences with a blanket block,\u201d Robins said.

NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp is betting that viewers who have abandoned traditional pay TV and are weary of being asked to open their wallets for multiple streaming services will embrace a no-cost alternative with commercials.  Peacock will debut for Comcast customers on April 15 and across the United States on July 15. The company plans to expand the service to other countries over time.  Executives unveiled their offering at a celebrity-studded presentation to investors inside Studio 8H in New York\u2019s 30 Rockefeller Plaza where long-running sketch comedy show \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is broadcast.

NBCUniversal said it expects to reach 30 million to 35 million active Peacock accounts by 2024.  \u201cWe believe affordability will be critical as more subscription sources are launched, leading to bigger customer bills,\u201d said NBCUniversal Chairman Steve Burke.  Peacock will be one of the last entries in the crowded streaming landscape, dominated by Netflix Inc and including Walt Disney Co\u2019s Disney+, Apple Inc\u2019s Apple TV+, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Prime Video, Hulu (controlled by Disney), and ViacomCBS Inc\u2019s CBS All Access. In May, AT&T Inc\u2019s WarnerMedia will launch its new entrant, HBO Max.  The majority of those services make money from subscription revenue, but Comcast opted to sell ads to run with the programming and offer a service at no charge to consumers.  \u201cIt is impossible to overstate the power of free,\u201d said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of NBCUniversal advertising and partnerships. \u201cZero dollars means zero barriers between advertisers and consumers.\u201d  Peacock will include 10 advertising formats, such as so-called shoppable ads that let viewers purchase products, but will limit the amount to 5 minutes or less per hour, the \u201clightest ad load in the entire industry,\u201d Yaccarino said.  The average commercial time per hour topped 14 minutes on broadcast and cable networks last year, according to Nielsen.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  \u2018BINGE ADS\u2019  State Farm, Target Corp and Unilever PLC are among the early advertisers on the service, which will bring in \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in initial advertising revenue, NBCUniversal said in a statement.  Peacock will also feature \u201cbinge ads,\u201d where a viewer watches three episodes of a show and a sponsor can make the fourth episode ad-free.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  NBCUniversal hopes to lure advertisers through the vast amounts of data it can use to target commercials based on viewers\u2019 interests, including data from Comcast\u2019s cable TV set-top boxes.  Peacock Free will be offered nationwide and include more than 7,500 hours of programming including classic NBC series and news and sports including the Olympics.

ViacomCBS Inc said it will be on \u201con pause\u201d for #BlackOutTuesday to reflect on recent events and to shift focus from \u201cbuilding business to building community\u201d.  The company on Monday had its channels, including CBS News, MTV and Comedy Central, transmit 8 minutes and 46 seconds of breathing sounds with the words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, denouncing the incident last week that sparked protests across America.  A Minneapolis police officer was arrested last week on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges for his role in the death of the 46-year-old Floyd.  Celebrities including Rihanna, Katy Perry, Britney Spears and Kylie Jenner all went dark on social media to acknowledge Floyd\u2019s death.  NBA stars including LeBron James and Steph Curry posted an empty black photo on their Instagram pages. The league\u2019s official page posted the same photo with the hashtag \u201c#NBATogether\u201d.  Streaming giant Spotify Technology said it would feature an 8 minute and 46 second long track of silence in select podcasts and playlists on Tuesday, while also halting social media publications.  Apple Music said it would use the day to reflect and plan actions to support black artists, creators and communities.  Dozens of artists and sports stars have spoken out against Floyd\u2019s death and the racism they say lay behind it as the protests spread through U.S. cities.  Leading record labels said they would mark Tuesday by suspending business and working with communities to fight racial inequality.  \u201cWatching my people get murdered and lynched day after day pushed me to a heavy place in my heart!,\u201d Rihanna wrote on Instagram.","75":"(Reuters) - The hashtag #BlackOutTuesday became the top trending item on Twitter as hundreds of thousands of businesses and individuals, including TV channels and celebrities, posted black screen shots to signal support for racial justice as street protests over the police killing of George Floyd entered a second week.  Many companies paused normal work and directed their efforts to support the work of Black Lives Matter and other social justice groups.  Streaming service Spotify highlighted the music of black artists, Sirius XM Radio said it would silence its music channels for three minutes, and Apple Music DJ Zane Lowe tweeted that he wouldn\u2019t host his radio show but would be \u201clistening, learning and looking for solutions to fight racial inequality.\u201d  The death last week of Floyd, an unarmed black man, as a white police officer in Minneapolis pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck, unleashed a wave of outrage in cities around the United States about the treatment of black Americans, further polarizing a country politically and racially.  The Blackout Tuesday movement was prompted by two U.S. record industry executives to pressure the music business to improve the presence of black people in its corporate ranks, noting that the industry had \u201cprofited predominantly from black art.\u201d Rap and R&B overtook rock in 2017 to become the biggest music genre in the United States.  The movement was quickly embraced by record labels, celebrities including Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry and basketball player LeBron James and ordinary Americans.  It also gave rise to dissenters. Black Lives Matter complained that news of its planned protests had been drowned out, while film executive Franklin Leonard said he would not be taking part.  \u201cA \u2018show\u2019 of solidarity is NOT solidarity,\u201d Leonard tweeted. \u201cAnd posting a black tile on your Instagram feed for a day definitely isn\u2019t.\u201d  Elsewhere, video-sharing platform TikTok donated $4 million to non-profits that help the black community while eBay in the United States said it would donate all fees collected on Tuesday from items sold in its music categories to a charity that supports equality.  ViacomCBS said it will be \u201con pause\u201d on Tuesday, a day after CBS News, MTV and Comedy Central went dark for 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the length of time Floyd\u2019s neck was pinned to the ground by the knee of a police officer.","76":"FILE PHOTO: California's Governor Gavin Newsom speaks to the media after casting his vote at a voting center at The California Museum for the presidential primaries on Super Tuesday in Sacramento, CA U.S., March 3, 2020.

Ted Sarandos, chief content officer for Netflix NFLX.O, said the streaming platform had resumed filming in countries like South Korea, Iceland and Sweden, where strict testing and contact tracing was underway.  Netflix was paying crews on all of its shut down shows, resulting in a \u201c$150 million plus\u201d commitment, Sarandos told the livestreamed event.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he leaves after holding a campaign rally at Fayetteville Regional Airport in Fayetteville, North Carolina, U.S., November 2, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  Here is how a re-election of President Trump could impact six key industries. For a FACTBOX on how these sectors might change if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the election, click.  AUTOMAKERS  A Trump re-election would leave U.S. automakers caught in the crossfire of a war over climate policy between Washington and the state of California.  California sued Trump for rolling back national vehicle emissions standards and seeking to cancel the state\u2019s authority to mandate sales of electric vehicles.  Automakers stand to save billions in compliance costs under Trump\u2019s emissions approach. But the clash with California over emissions and electric vehicles has divided automakers. It has also left the industry to deal with two sets of regulations for the increasingly divergent coastal Blue state markets and heartland, Red state markets. Automakers have long advocated resolving differences between California and federal climate policy to create a single, national set of standards to guide their technology investments.  During his first term, Trump put pressure on Detroit automakers to step up investments in the United States, attacking General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co for decisions to close plants, or invest in China and Mexico. Trump periodically threatened German automakers with tariffs. His steel and aluminum tariffs raised costs for U.S. automakers.  PHARMACEUTICALS  Trump has been a vocal critic of high drug prices but experts say the pharmaceutical industry will likely fare better under a Trump second term than they would if Joe Biden wins the White House.  Trump passed a number of executive orders designed to slash drug prices in his first term but experts say they have had little practical impact.  His efforts to spur Congress to pass new laws to reduce drug costs have been much less successful, in part because his own party blocked a bill that would have allowed Medicare, a government health insurance program, to negotiate lower drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.  MINING  Trump, should he win re-election, is expected to continue to slash mining industry regulations and shorten the permitting process, part of a wide-ranging effort to boost domestic production of the minerals used to make electronics, weapons and a host of other goods.  Trump signed several executive orders in his first term that labeled rare earths and other minerals as critical to national defense, ordering the Pentagon to financially support junior projects. The U.S. only has one rare earths mine, though it relies on China for processing. A second Trump term could see multiple new domestic rare earth mines as well as new processing equipment from Rare Element Resources Ltd and others.  At least one mining project could be jeopardized in Trump\u2019s new term, however. Alaska\u2019s Pebble Mine project, a massive copper and gold deposit in the Bristol Bay watershed, has come under criticism by Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who have said the mine would destroy areas where they enjoy fishing and hunting. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in late August extended its permit review timeline out past the election, a step that came after both privately lobbied the president.  The mine\u2019s developer, Vancouver-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd, has said the mine can be safely developed. But Alaska\u2019s two U.S. senators, both Republicans, have publicly come out against the mine, adding further pressure on Trump to deny it permits.  MEDIA  Media companies are poised to benefit if Trump gets another four years in office, based on demand for TV, print and digital news coverage since his election in 2016.  While news consumers first tuned in for coverage of the outspoken president and his administration, the triple threat of the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, and racial strife have kept them engaged.  The New York Times, for example, saw its digital-only subscriptions grow more than fourfold between the end of the second quarter in 2016 and the same period this year. Shares of the New York Times Co are up more than 250% since election day 2016.  Evening TV news broadcasts have also seen a resurgence, with Comcast-owned NBC, ViacomCBS Inc-owned CBS and Walt Disney Co\u2019s ABC experiencing their biggest news audiences in years.  Ratings for cable news networks AT&T-owned CNN, Fox Corp-owned Fox News and Comcast\u2019s MSNBC - with their loyal, politically-divided followings - are up 72 percent from last year, according to Nielsen. Fox News was the highest-rated network in all of television for prime-time viewers in July, August and September, per Nielsen.  But despite the uptick in audiences, news organizations continue to suffer from declining advertising revenue, spurred by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc, and exacerbated by the pandemic. Many marketers have slashed their advertising budgets, leading news organizations to lay off tens of thousands of employees.  If the negative news cycle continues into a second Trump term, ad dollars may not follow. For years, ad tech firms have offered tools for brands to block ads from appearing on web pages or URLs that include keywords like \u201cshooting\u201d or \u201cmurder.\u201d These advertising \u201cblacklists\u201d exploded in usage after the 2016 U.S. election, when brands sought to avoid polarizing news stories. Many brands have been reluctant to buy ads against coronavirus and Black Lives Matter coverage.  A second Trump term could help sustain interest in journalism, with an engaged public glued to the news, and a president who has acknowledged his role keeping them there.  \u201cAnother reason that I\u2019m going to win another four years is because newspapers, television, all forms of media will tank if I\u2019m not there because without me, their ratings are going down the tubes,\u201d Trump said in 2017, according to the New York Times.  RETAIL\/TRADE  U.S. President Trump has imposed $370 billion in tariffs on goods imported from China, part of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. Those tariffs on products ranging from handbags to small electronics are estimated to have cost U.S. importers some $61.6 billion through early September, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and have been blamed for eroding U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. Retailers argue the tariffs will result in higher prices for consumers and lost jobs.  \u201cIf Trump wins, he will see the election as a validation of his strategy on trade policy, including his use of tariffs, and will certainly continue to follow this strategy with China,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, National Retail Federation Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy.  The trade organization hopes any new deal can be reached without the threat of tariffs.  TECH  If Trump holds the White House, big tech companies will face continued pressure from regulators on antitrust issues. The Trump administration has already sued Alphabet\u2019s Google and a suit against Facebook is said to be coming soon. Should Democrats win the Senate, that could add to the risks for tech, as Democrats are calling for even more scrutiny of practices they say have stifled innovation and reduce competition. Trump may also ramp up his rhetorical war over what he contends is censorship of conservative views on the major social platforms.  The most immediate tech question for Trump will be what to do with TikTok, the Chinese-owned app that his administration says is a security risk that must be transferred to American ownership or banned.  With the election in the rearview, tech companies who depend on China as a supplier or buyer will be watching to see if Trump\u2019s approach to trade ratchets up or cools down.","82":"(Reuters) - The release of Walt Disney Co\u2019s epic action movie \u201cMulan\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 ninth \u201cFast and Furious\u201d film were postponed on Thursday as Hollywood scrambled to adjust to the worldwide spread of coronavirus.

But on Thursday, as U.S. authorities urged against large gatherings and took other steps to stop coronavirus spread, Disney said it had decided \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d to postpone the debut of \u201cMulan\u201d as well as April releases \u201cThe New Mutants\u201d and \u201cAntlers.\u201d  \u201cWe truly believe in the moviegoing experience, and we are looking at new potential 2020 release dates to be announced at a later date,\u201d a Disney spokesperson said.  \u201cF9,\u201d the new \u201cFast and Furious\u201d movie from Comcast Corp\u2019s Universal Pictures, was scheduled to debut May 22. Its release was delayed by nearly a year to April 2, 2021.  \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cF9\u201d were expected to rank among the biggest box-office hits in the coming months but were among several disruptions to global entertainment caused by coronavirus.  The virus has closed movie theaters in China, Italy and many other nations, while a ban on travel from Europe to the United States announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday is seen likely to curtail red carpets and other promotional events for movies and stars.  U.S. movie theaters remained open as of Thursday. But an industry source said operators may close larger theaters in some areas depending on advice from local authorities.  Ohio on Thursday banned crowds of more than 100 people. In California, Governor Gavin Newsom advised against non-essential gatherings of more than 250 through the end of the month.  Movie theaters were exempted, but even if they stay open, their schedules would have to be rearranged.  Also on Thursday, Paramount Pictures, a unit of ViacomCBS Inc, indefinitely delayed the release of thriller \u201cA Quiet Place Part II,\u201d which was due to start its international rollout on March 18. And it postponed romantic comedy \u201cThe Lovebirds,\u201d originally set for April 3.  \u201cDue to the ever-changing circumstances of what\u2019s going on in the world around us, now is clearly not the right time to do that,\u201d the \u201cQuiet Place\u201d director John Krasinski said in a post on his Instagram account.  The decisions followed the postponement last week of the James Bond movie \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d to November from April, and a delay for \u201cPeter Rabbit 2\u201d to August from March 27.  Separately, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland postponed its induction ceremony scheduled for May 2 to an unspecified future date. That followed the cancellation of the Coachella music festival, South by Southwest and other large entertainment gatherings.","83":"March 5 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories on the New York Times business pages.

An estimated 10.1 million people in the United States tuned in across six broadcast and cable networks on Saturday, the day Trump\u2019s legal team began arguing he had not committed any impeachable offenses in his dealings with Ukraine.  The TV audience for the trial, which began on Jan. 21, had been steadily shrinking. Ratings peaked at about 11 million viewers who watched lawmakers spar over evidence and witnesses on opening day. They fell to 6.8 million last Friday as Democrats wrapped up their arguments against Trump, according to Nielsen.  Trump, a former reality television star, complained on Twitter last week that his lawyers were being \u201cforced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.\u201d for its typically small audiences.  Democrats have argued that the Republican president abused his power and obstructed Congress for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his potential Democratic opponents in November\u2019s election, and impeding the inquiry into the matter.  Trump denies any wrongdoing and has slammed the impeachment process as a hoax. The Republican-controlled Senate is unlikely to vote to remove him from office, which requires a two-thirds majority.  Trump\u2019s legal team ended its three days of defense arguments on Tuesday. Nielsen has not yet released ratings figures for this week\u2019s sessions.  Six broadcast and cable networks have aired live coverage of the impeachment trial during the day.

The figures represent the average audience across 15 networks that aired the event live on Thursday night. Fox News Channel pulled in the largest viewership of any single network, drawing 15.4 million viewers.  Trump initially took a more restrained tone than he did at the September event, which was derailed by his repeated interruptions. That matchup was watched by 73.1 million viewers across 16 networks.  This time, the debate faced competition from a National Football League game that aired on the Fox broadcast network.  Nielsen\u2019s figures reflect people who watched on television and do not include others who streamed the proceedings on digital platforms, which are growing in popularity as traditional TV viewership declines.  During Thursday\u2019s face-off, Biden renewed his attacks on Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while Trump leveled unfounded corruption accusations at Biden and his family.  It was the last televised debate before the Nov. 3 election.

(reut.rs\/2W24dqI)  CBS All Access, the company\u2019s video-on-demand and live streaming service, will stream every UEFA club competition match live each season, featuring all Champions League and Europa League matches, along with the UEFA Super Cup.  CBS will air select marquee matches on the CBS Television Network and CBS Sports Network over the length of the deal, the company said in a statement.","107":"LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co held a red carpet premiere for its action epic \u201cMulan\u201d on Monday, pushing ahead with the movie\u2019s rollout even though the coronavirus spread will keep the film out of China, the second-largest film market, indefinitely.  At the moment, film studios have decided the show must go on at movie theaters in most of the world. The major exception is James Bond thriller \u201cNo Time to Die,\u201d which producers moved to November from April.  Studio executives are closely watching the spread of the coronavirus and the upcoming film calendar. Summer blockbuster season is scheduled to kick off May 1 with Disney\u2019s Marvel adventure \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d followed by a new \u201cFast and Furious\u201d spectacle from Comcast Corp\u2019s Universal Pictures, a \u201cTop Gun\u201d sequel from ViacomCBS Inc\u2019s Paramount Pictures, and other big-budget action flicks.  If the coronavirus keeps people at home or shuts more theaters, it would threaten box office receipts during Hollywood\u2019s most lucrative season. Movie theaters are closed across China and Italy and in part of France.  The situation puts movie studios in \u201cuncharted waters,\u201d said Jeff Goldstein, president of domestic distribution at AT&T Inc\u2019s Warner Bros. studio.  Warner Bros. has not delayed any film openings, Goldstein said, \u201cbut we have an open mind. We will have to look at everything and see how it unfolds.\u201d  The National Association of Theatre Owners said moviegoing remained healthy in most areas and cinemas will remain open \u201cin line with local conditions.\u201d  This past weekend, ticket sales in the United States and Canada, the world\u2019s biggest box office market, rose 1.2 percent from a week earlier to $100.7 million, according to measurement firm Comscore.  \u201cRight now, I haven\u2019t seen any discernible impact at the (U.S. and Canadian) box office,\u201d said Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian.  \u201cMulan,\u201d a $200 million live-action remake of Disney\u2019s animated classic, has been expected to rank as one of the company\u2019s biggest hits of the year.  The movie was tailored to appeal especially to the Chinese market. The story centers around a Chinese heroine, features an all-Asian cast, and was filmed partly in China. The central character is played by Yifei Liu, a film and TV actress well known in China.  It is unclear when Chinese movie theaters will re-open. The movie is set to debut in the United States on March 27.  \u201cMy heart goes out to everybody in China and around the world that is affected,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d director Niki Caro said on the red carpet on Monday. \u201cWhen we do have the opportunity to bring this movie back home to China, it\u2019s going to be the most wonderful celebration.\u201d  \u201cMulan\u201d was made for \u201ca global audience,\u201d producer Chris Bender said at the premiere. \u201cWe want everybody to see it.\u201d  Dergarabedian said \u201cMulan\u201d will be an important test of moviegoing amid the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis is a situation that is changing day by day,\u201d he said.  In the meantime, studios are moving ahead. On Monday, Disney released a new trailer for \u201cBlack Widow\u201d starring Scarlett Johansson as the popular Avengers character. The trailer said the movie\u2019s release date remained May 1.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Thirty years after \u201cRock the Vote,\u201d a liberal nonprofit group, fused pop culture and politics, TV makers are seeking to make dry topics like registering to vote, filling out the census and finding polling places feel vital and fun by writing them into the plots of popular shows.  In \u201cBlack Ink Crew,\u201d a reality show about a tattoo parlor in Harlem, the Black owner registers to vote for the first time and designs a tattoo to mark the occasion. The Cuban-American family comedy \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d ran an episode about a census worker who comes to their home.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a reshaping of how Americans are encouraged to think about civics, not only through a 30-second PSA (public service announcement) but also through integrations into storylines on some of our major shows,\u201d said Steven Levine, director of the Civic Alliance.  The Civic Alliance, launched in January, is supported by more than 180 companies including ViacomCBS Inc VIACA.O, Spotify SPOT.N, Univision and Hollywood's Creative Artists Agency (CAA).  Earlier this year, ViacomCBS rolled out a Civic Storylines Toolkit and organized workshops that have been attended by more than 200 writers across comedy, drama and reality shows.  The toolkit provides a road map on how to \u201cinfuse storylines around voting and voting culture directly into our content, instead of the more traditional approach of PSAs,\u201d said Brianna Cayo Cotter, senior vice president of social impact at the ViacomCBS entertainment and youth group.  \u201cTelevision can really shape the way people think and feel around major issues. But that philosophy had never been applied to civic engagement,\u201d Cayo Cotter said.  Many of the shows are aimed at millennials and Gen Z, who together outnumber baby boomers for the first time in the U.S. electorate, according to a 2019 report by the Pew Research Center.  An upcoming episode of comedy \u201cblack-ish\u201d will focus on first-time voter Junior, who discovers he has been dropped from voter lists and wants to find out why.  The main cast of White House drama \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d which finished its run in 2006, is reuniting for a special episode aimed at promoting voting in November.  Actor Kal Penn, from stoner movie franchise \u201cHarold and Kumar,\u201d is launching comedy show \u201cKal Penn Approves This Message\u201d on the youth-oriented Freeform channel that will tackle topics like healthcare and climate change as well as information about how and where to vote.  \u201cIt\u2019s very important for the show to be funny and non-partisan,\u201d said Penn. \u201cYounger people tend to not be affiliated with a political party the way older audiences are. They tend to care more about issues,\u201d he said.  The initiatives are already yielding results. Appeals by Trevor Noah on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d have resulted in more than 100,000 people signing up to be poll workers through dedicated links on the show\u2019s website, ViacomCBS said.","109":"July 14 (Reuters) - Comcast-owned NBCUniversal will enter a crowded streaming market on Wednesday when it launches its Peacock streaming service nationally, offering 20,000 hours of content, including NBC shows such as \u201c30 Rock,\u201d \u201cCheers\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d  The service, which became available to some Comcast Corp subscribers in April, is the media giant\u2019s effort to offset declines in Comcast\u2019s cable TV business - while finding a new way to monetize NBC and Universal content and maintain demand for the company\u2019s broadband business, which powers streaming services.  Peacock will include a mix of NBC series, sports, news and original shows, such as the dystopian drama \u201cBrave New World\u201d and documentary \u201cIn Deep with Ryan Lochte.\u201d  Unlike the majority of its streaming rivals, Peacock is offering a free, ad-supported version, which will include 7,500 hours of programming. NBCUniversal hopes to lure advertisers through the vast amounts of data it can use to target commercials based on viewers\u2019 interests, including data from Comcast\u2019s cable TV set-top boxes.  Peacock also has two paid options: a $4.99 per month service with commercials and 20,000 hours of programming; and an ad-free version costing $9.99 per month.  NBCUniversal missed the opportunity to market Peacock during its broadcast of the Tokyo Summer Olympics, which were postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. And as the last entry to the streaming war, Peacock will be competing for streaming dollars with services such as Netflix Inc, Walt Disney Co -owned Disney+ and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Prime Video.  But Peacock\u2019s free option could be a draw for viewers who have already maxed out their monthly entertainment budgets. And viewers stuck at home are hungry for content: Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, 23% of U.S. consumers have added at least one new paid streaming video service, according to Deloitte.

As preparations begin to salvage the iconic American cultural tradition in the spring semester, at stake is more than $3.3 billion in advertising and broadcast media rights.  The bigger dilemma is how marketers and networks like Walt Disney Co\u2019s ESPN and Fox Sports will juggle a year jam-packed with other postponed sporting events that could see spring college football bumping against the regularly scheduled college basketball season, and possibly even the Tokyo Summer Olympics.  Everyone will be \u201cscrambling harder than Trevor Lawrence under an all-out blitz,\u201d with \u201clittle to replace the demographic power of college football,\u201d said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco. Lawrence is the Clemson Tigers quarterback whose tweets this week sparked a player-led movement #WeWantToPlay to resume the season.  One concern is whether there\u2019s enough money to go around as marketing budgets are stretched across a pile-up of events postponed from 2020.  \u201cSponsors might cut back because they could have other commitments like NBA or NHL, and not have the money available for college football,\u201d said Neal Pilson, president of sports media consultancy Pilson Communications, and former president of CBS Sports.  Many advertisers chose to keep their ad commitments for other sports that had been paused, such as NBA, and have them run when play resumed, said David Campanelli, chief investment officer at ad agency Horizon Media, which counts GEICO and Corona beer as clients.  FILE PHOTO: The main entrance to Michigan Stadium on the University of Michigan campus is seen amid reports of college football cancellation, during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S., August 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Emily Elconin\/File Photo  When the college football season picks up in the spring, as many hope, and crosses into a new fiscal year, that could create budget issues for advertisers, he said.  On Tuesday, the Big Ten and Pac-12, two of U.S. college sports\u2019 most powerful sports leagues, canceled their fall season, and said they would consider moving those sports to compete in the spring. The announcements added pressure to the rest of the \u201cPower Five\u201d conferences about the viability of the 2020 football season.  But a spring competition format would see college football compete for dollars potentially against the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and college basketball games.  With the exception of some college football games that attract a national audience, many of the games have a more regional appeal and could lose out on ad dollars compared to professional sports leagues that draw bigger audiences, said Sam Bloom, chief executive of ad agency Camelot Strategic Marketing & Media. Advertisers could also pass on college football if future games are played without fans, which would limit branding opportunities in that region, he said.  A postponement will also trigger a series of complicated negotiations throughout the entire media food chain from pay-TV distributors such as Comcast Corp and Dish Network Corp, the media networks including ESPN and CBS, which air the games, down to the athletic conferences, said Patrick Crakes, principal at Crakes Media Consulting, and former vice president at Fox Sports.  Colleges earned $2.2 billion in media rights in 2018, according to an analysis from Sportico, which looked at budget reports from public universities.  If Big Ten and Pac-12 remain the only two conferences that cancel this year\u2019s seasons, that could spell bad news for Fox, since the conferences make up about 80% of Fox\u2019s college football inventory, said Crakes.  Fox declined to comment.  The incentive to get this right is clear. Leagues including the NBA and MLB enjoyed blockbuster viewership when they returned from COVID-19 delays last month, as sports fans devoured coverage after being denied live sports for so long.  For American audiences, college football\u2019s weekly ritual ties generations together, with communities across the country spending Saturdays in front of the television with friends and families.  For marketers trying to reach men, \u201cThere\u2019s simply no substitute for live sports\u2014especially football,\u201d Dorfman said. \u201cWhenever it comes back, football-hungry fans will be flocking\u2014and advertisers will follow.\u201d","111":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO network triumphed at Sunday\u2019s Emmy Awards with 30 wins, including best drama \u201cSuccession\u201d and limited series \u201cWatchmen,\u201d while Apple Inc took home its first award for the iPhone maker\u2019s dive into streaming television.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Netflix Inc, which headed into the ceremony with a record 160 nominations, finished second with 21 honors. The Pop cable network, owned by ViacomCBS Inc, took the top comedy prize for offbeat series \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d which swept comedy categories to collect nine awards overall.  Winning the highest honors in television bestows a mark of prestige that networks can tout in their marketing to attract audiences in a crowded entertainment landscape. AT&T, Walt Disney Co, Apple and others have launched streaming video services to compete with online video pioneer Netflix.  HBO had long dominated the Emmys with hits such as \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Before Sunday, it was the most honored network for 17 of the past 18 years. The exception was in 2018, when Netflix and HBO tied in Emmy wins.  This year, HBO\u2019s alternative-reality drama \u201cWatchmen\u201d topped all shows with 11 awards, while the network\u2019s media dynasty tale \u201cSuccession\u201d earned seven.  The accolades were especially gratifying following questions about what HBO would do once megahit \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d ended in 2019, Casey Bloys, HBO programming president, said in an interview.  \u201cThis was a really nice way to answer that question,\u201d he said.  Bloys also said the network succeeded by staying aware of growing competition \u201cbut not distracted by it.\u201d  \u201cWe just continue to play our game and focus on shows we are proud of, and work with people we believe in,\u201d he said.  Netflix\u2019s awards included best supporting drama actress for Julia Garner in \u201cOzark.\u201d  The Apple TV+ subscription streaming service secured its first Emmy for Billy Crudup\u2019s supporting role in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d as a manipulative executive at a news network rocked by a sexual harassment scandal.  \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Mandalorian,\u201d a show on the Disney+ streaming service about a bounty hunter who protects Baby Yoda, won eight awards.  The Pop network scored best comedy for the sixth and final season of \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek,\u201d a series about a once-wealthy family forced to live in a rundown motel in an out-of-the-way town. Filmed in Toronto, the show aired on the CBC network in Canada.  \u201cThanks to CBC and Pop for broadcasting this without hesitation,\u201d creator and star Daniel Levy said as he accepted his award.  The \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d honors also were a victory for Netflix. The series has streamed on Netflix since 2017, helping to boost the audience. Eugene Levy, who won best comedy actor, thanked Netflix for \u201cthe spark that seemed to start everything\u201d for the show.","112":"May 7 (Reuters) - Media company ViacomCBS Inc on Thursday beat Wall Street revenue estimates for the first quarter on higher demand for entertainment from people hunkered down at home under coronavirus-led lockdowns.

Chip Somodevilla\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  With few sporting events and a captive audience due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a drawn-out, nail-biter of an election could appeal to marketers like the finance, technology, retail, social media and entertainment companies that have bought debate and election night ads.  At least two networks, Fox Corp\u2019s Fox News and Comcast Corp\u2019s NBC, are expecting or already seeing high demand for the week following the Nov. 3 election night. Fox News is also offering its major sponsors the option to extend their campaigns if election results are not in after that first week.  Determining the next president of the United States could take some time after voting ends on Election Day due to a surge in mail-in ballots and expected legal challenges by the campaigns of Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.  Jeff Collins, head of ad sales at Fox News, said the cable network is seeing a significant increase both in average unit rate as well as average deal size since 2016 for election night coverage.  A 30-second spot during the 2016 presidential debates cost as much as $220,000, according to Standard Media Index, a marketing intelligence company.  This year, Walt Disney Co-owned ABC is charging up to $375,000 for a 30-second spot during the debates, according to a source familiar with the network.  \u201cWith election coverage, you\u2019re going to be reaching people who were previously harder to reach on TV,\u201d said Catherine Warburton, chief investment officer at ad agency 360i, adding that the elections have attracted new buyers who previously were not interested in advertising during this period. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be reaching people who are community- and civic-oriented. That\u2019s attractive to advertisers.\u201d  AMERICANS GLUED TO NEWS  TV news has already seen a viewership spike this year, with NBC, ViacomCBS Inc-owned CBS and Disney\u2019s ABC experiencing their biggest news audiences in years, siphoning viewers from sports. In July, August and September, Fox News was the highest-rated network in all of television for prime-time viewers, according to Nielsen.  NBC, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and Fox News sold out their ad inventory for the first debate, according to people familiar with the networks. An estimated 73.1 million viewers tuned in to the first debate, below the record 84 million four years ago - a decline that may reflect changing viewing habits and an uptick in the number of people who stream content online.  ABC sold out its ad inventory for election night and the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, according to a person familiar with the network, and was nearly sold out for the Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 presidential debates.  NBC, MSNBC and Fox News are getting close to being sold out on election night and for other debates, according to sources familiar with the networks.  Thanks to viewer interest in politics and news, ad revenue between June and August was up 68% from the same period a year earlier at CNN and 46% at Fox News, according to Standard Media Index.  Kagan, the media research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, is projecting that annual advertising revenue at Fox News will be up 8.2% from 2019 and up 5.2% at CNN from 2019.  \u201cI anticipate that there\u2019s going to be a greater demand within the news cycle, leading into and following the election period, and that brands will chase the consumer, where they concentrate viewership,\u201d said Gregory Aston, head of digital media research science at data and consulting firm Kantar.  PROTESTS, VIOLENCE  A post-election scenario that involves protests and violence could deter some marketers, according to media forecasters.  Many advertisers have already shunned media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic and Black Lives Matter movement. Trump\u2019s unwillingness to commit to a peaceful transfer of power and his message during the Sept. 29 debate to the right-wing Proud Boys group to \u201cstand by\u201d suggests the possibility of more protests to come.  \u201cI think that every advertiser who plans to be on the air around news-related content on the days immediately around and following the election has got to be very thoughtful about different scenarios because most of them are not good,\u201d said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM. \u201cAnd that may make a sponsorship of news less palatable.\u201d  Fox News\u2019 Collins said none of the companies that have bought ads for the week after Election Day have expressed concern about civil unrest or asked for concessions related to that possibility.  At NBC, where ad executives expect the election to be a week-long event with high demand from advertisers, marketers are concerned about being \u201ctoo red or too blue,\u201d said a source familiar with the company.  A related sentiment was on display this summer, when companies like Unilever Plc used the word \u201cdivisiveness\u201d in their announcements boycotting advertising on Facebook Inc and other platforms, said Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at eMarketer.  \u201cI felt like they were really telegraphing: \u2018We don\u2019t want to be in a place where people are fighting about the election.\u2019 And so that\u2019s leading me to think that election week coverage is not a positive emotional valence for brands to be associated with.\u201d  That divisiveness may be impossible to avoid.  \u201cNumber one, good luck getting away from this,\u201d said Steven Passwaiter, vice president and general manager of the Campaign Media Analysis Group at Kantar. \u201cSecondly, given the dynamics of the year and how difficult it has been, it\u2019s hard to imagine anybody\u2019s going to really want to run away from a situation where they can reach more eyeballs.\u201d","114":"Nov 24 (Reuters) - German media group Bertelsmann made the highest bid in an auction for Simon & Schuster, the publishing unit of ViacomCBS Inc, Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Stock index futures pared losses after data showed jobless claims fell slightly in the latest week after two consecutive weeks of increases that triggered fears of a stalled recovery in the labor market.  Economists polled by Reuters had expected 1.415 million claims.  The weekly jobless claims data comes ahead of the more comprehensive monthly employment report due on Friday.  Despite worries about the economy, Wall Street\u2019s main indexes are set for a second straight weekly gain due to heaps of fiscal and monetary stimulus and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings. The S&P 500 is 2% below its February peak.  \u201cRight now, people are taking a little bit of a pause because we have some uncertainty over the virus, and stimulus appears to be at a bit of a standstill,\u201d said Faron Daugs, chief executive officer of Harrison Wallace Financial Group, based in Libertyville, Illinois.  \u201cWith some of the pullback in the reopening, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we have a slightly higher unemployment rate than what is expected.\u201d  Top congressional Democrats and White House officials will try again on Thursday to find a compromise on major issues including the size of a federal benefit for tens of millions of unemployed workers as they work towards a relief legislation.

The top decliner among the Nasdaq 100 index\u2019s components was Western Digital, which sank 12.2% in premarket trade after the hard drive maker reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and forecast a soft current quarter.  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd and hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc dropped after reporting wider-than-expected quarterly loss as their businesses were ravaged by the pandemic.

With few sporting events and a captive audience due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a drawn-out, nail-biter of an election could appeal to marketers like the finance, technology, retail, social media and entertainment companies that have bought debate and election night ads.  At least two networks, Fox Corp-owned Fox News and Comcast Corp\u2019s NBC, are expecting or already seeing high demand for the week following election night. Fox News is also offering its major sponsors the option to extend their campaigns if election results are not in after that first week.  Determining the next president of the United States could take some time after voting ends on Nov. 3 due to a surge in mail-in ballots and expected legal challenges by the campaigns of Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden.  Jeff Collins, head of ad sales at Fox News, said that the cable network is seeing a significant increase both in average unit rate as well as average deal size since 2016 for election night coverage.  A 30-second spot during the 2016 presidential debates cost as much as $220,000, according to Standard Media Index, a marketing intelligence company.  This year, Walt Disney Co-owned ABC is charging up to $375,000 for a 30-second spot during the debates, according to a source familiar with the network.  \u201cWith election coverage, you\u2019re going to be reaching people who were previously harder to reach on TV,\u201d said Catherine Warburton, chief investment officer at ad agency 360i, adding that the elections have attracted new buyers who previously were not interested in advertising during this period. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be reaching people who are community- and civic-oriented. That\u2019s attractive to advertisers.\u201d  AMERICANS GLUED TO NEWS  TV news has already seen a viewership spike this year, with NBC, ViacomCBS Inc-owned CBS and ABC experiencing their biggest news audiences in years, siphoning viewers from sports. In June and July Fox News was the highest-rated network in all of television for primetime viewers, a spokeswoman said on Sept. 28.  NBC, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and Fox News sold out their ad inventory for the first debate, according to people familiar with the networks. An estimated 73.1 million viewers tuned in to the first debate, below the record 84 million four years ago - a decline that may reflect changing viewing habits and an uptick in the number of people who stream content online.  ABC sold out its ad inventory for election night and the Oct. 7 vice presidential debate, according to a person familiar with the network, and was nearly sold out for the Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 presidential debates.  NBC, MSNBC and Fox News are getting close to being sold out on election night and for other debates, according to sources familiar with the networks.  Thanks to viewer interest in politics and news, ad revenue between June and August was up 68% from the same period a year earlier at CNN and 46% at Fox News, according to Standard Media Index.  Kagan, the media research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, is projecting that annual advertising revenue at Fox News will be up 8.2% from 2019 and at CNN up 5.2% from 2019.  \u201cI anticipate that there\u2019s going to be a greater demand within the news cycle, leading into and following the election period, and that brands will chase the consumer, where they concentrate viewership,\u201d said Gregory Aston, head of digital media research science at data and consulting firm Kantar.  VIOLENCE, \u201cSTAND BY\u201d  A post-election scenario that involves protests and violence could deter some marketers, according to media forecasters.  Many advertisers have already shunned media coverage of the coronavirus pandemic and Black Lives Matter movement. President Trump\u2019s unwillingness to commit to a peaceful transfer of power and his debate message to the right-wing Proud Boys group to \u201cstand by\u201d suggests the possibility of more protests to come.  \u201cI think that every advertiser who plans to be on the air around news-related content on the days immediately around and following the election has got to be very thoughtful about different scenarios because most of them are not good,\u201d said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM. \u201cAnd that may make a sponsorship of news less palatable.\u201d  Fox News\u2019 Collins said that none of the companies that have bought ads for the week after Election Day have expressed concern about civil unrest or asked for concessions related to that possibility.  At NBC, where ad executives expect the election to be a week-long event with high demand from advertisers, marketers are concerned about being \u201ctoo red or too blue,\u201d said a source familiar with the company.  A related sentiment was on display this summer, when companies like Unilever Plc used the word \u201cdivisiveness\u201d in their announcements boycotting advertising on Facebook Inc and other platforms, said Nicole Perrin, principal analyst at eMarketer.  \u201cI felt like they were really telegraphing: \u2018We don\u2019t want to be in a place where people are fighting about the election.\u2019 And so that\u2019s leading me to think that election week coverage is not a positive emotional valence for brands to be associated with.\u201d  That divisiveness may be impossible to avoid.  \u201cNumber one, good luck getting away from this,\u201d said Steven Passwaiter, vice president and general manager of the Campaign Media Analysis Group at Kantar. \u201cSecondly, given the dynamics of the year and how difficult it has been, it\u2019s hard to imagine anybody\u2019s going to really want to run away from a situation where they can reach more eyeballs.\u201d","119":"FILE PHOTO: Phil Keoghan poses with his Outstanding Reality-Competition Program award for the CBS show \"The Amazing Race\" at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles, California August 25, 2014.

Only a fraction of movie and TV productions have resumed filming in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United States, where coronavirus cases are rising. Actors and crew members are unsure when projects might resume, and some expect they will not return to work until 2021.  Los Angeles County, home to the biggest movie and TV studios, gave a greenlight in June for filming to resume with safeguards. Major unions issued a 36-page report outlining safety measures. Producers had hoped to have many sets working again in August.  The number of film permit requests in the Los Angeles area since mid-June ran about 34 percent of normal. Most of those were for commercials or still photography, according to local organization FilmLA, which said it expected scripted TV and feature film production to pick up in September.  Actor Seth Rogen, who produces TV series and movies with partner Evan Goldberg, said he is exploring international locations, including Bulgaria, for some projects.  \u201cI am not ambitious that any filming is going to be happening in America anytime soon in a way that I\u2019m comfortable with,\u201d Rogen said in an interview this month. \u201cI look to other countries who have dealt with this whole thing much better and think maybe, if they\u2019ll let us in, maybe we can film there.\u201d  Slideshow ( 4 images )  OVERSEAS PRODUCTION  A few big movie productions have resumed overseas. The next \u201cJurassic World\u201d dinosaur adventure from Comcast Corp\u2019s Universal Pictures restarted filming in London, and the cast of Walt Disney Co\u2019s \u201cAvatar\u201d sequels is back at work in New Zealand.  To restart, producers must adapt the industry guidelines to their situations, which takes longer for bigger projects.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like flipping a light switch,\u201d said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief operating officer and general counsel for actors union SAG-AFTRA.  The union has cleared more than 1,000 return-to-work plans for film and TV projects, he said, adding that the current production level was \u201cfar lower\u201d than normal.  Lingering shutdowns will limit the supply of fresh programming that TV networks and streaming services can offer even as many viewers remain home-bound during the pandemic.  The cast of Amazon Studios series \u201cThe Boys\u201d recorded a video urging fans to wear face masks to reduce coronavirus spread.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cYou want a \u2018Boys\u2019 season three? They are not going to let us shoot unless we get the numbers down,\u201d star Jack Quaid said.  KISSING MANNEQUINS  Some TV series have pushed ahead with protections including smaller crews, safety officers to monitor compliance with infection-prevention measures and inventive fixes such as using mannequins for kissing scenes.  Producer Tyler Perry created a \u201cCamp Quarantine\u201d at his Georgia studio complex to film his BET series \u201cSistas\u201d in July. No coronavirus cases were detected during a two-week shoot, Perry said.  ViacomCBS, owner of MTV, Comedy Central and other channels, is setting up closed sets called \u201cCOVID compounds\u201d to isolate people working on series such as \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race,\u201d said Chris McCarthy, president of entertainment and youth brands at ViacomCBS.  In the compounds, \u201cwe will control it, we\u2019ll test, but we\u2019ll also contain it and keep everyone as safe as possible,\u201d McCarthy said.  A few productions have reported positive coronavirus tests to SAG-AFTRA, Crabtree-Ireland said, declining to name them.

Of the existing streaming services, only Hulu is ad-supported, although an ad-supported version of HBO Max is expected in 2021.  By including ads in Peacock, Comcast will be able to offer the service at a price Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh described as \u201csensible.\u201d  But even at a lower monthly fee, Peacock faces competition from $5 per month Apple TV Plus and Disney\u2019s $7 per month service. The standard Netflix plan costs $13 per month.  Comcast is investing $2 billion in Peacock throughout 2020 and 2021, and will break even by year five, according to Cavanagh. Netflix, by contrast, earmarked $19 billion in cash for content in 2019.  Peacock will include original content such as \u201cDr. Death\u201d featuring Alec Baldwin, shows licensed from other studios such as \u201cMarried With Children,\u201d and complete seasons of shows from NBC\u2019s library, including \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d \u201cFrasier\u201d and next year, \u201cThe Office.\u201d","132":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. first lady Melania Trump addresses the 2020 PTA Legislative Conference in Alexandria, Virginia March 10, 2020.

ABC, CBS, NBC and other networks will air the public service announcements, which will also include other Trump administration officials and \u201ccommunicate the most important ways Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk,\u201d the White House said in a statement.  Nickleodon will create a separate campaign for children.  The air time will be donated by media networks, the White House said.

Her signature initiative has been a campaign called Be Best, which focuses on the safety and well-being of children.  All the ads will direct audiences to coronavirus.gov, a website containing the latest information about the outbreak.  The announcement comes as the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 rose to at least 146, with the number of infections closing in on 8,000 as millions of Americans stayed home instead going to work or school and President Donald Trump said hospital ships would be deployed to make up for an anticipated shortage of hospital beds.","133":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Viacom and CBS Chairman Emeritus Sumner Redstone, the media mogul who took his father\u2019s movie theater chain and built it into an empire that included Paramount Pictures, CBS and MTV, has died at 97, ViacomCBS and National Amusements said on Wednesday.  Redstone, as executive chairman of both Viacom Inc VIA.O and CBS Corp CBS.N, had controlled the two companies through privately held National Amusements. But in his early 90s, the state of Redstone's physical and mental health set off an avalanche of corporate maneuvering over his media holdings that resulted in him stepping down in 2016 as executive chairman of both companies.  CBS and Viacom were combined from 2000 to 2006, when Redstone separated them in an attempt to unleash the value of Viacom\u2019s cable channels.  His position as one of the world\u2019s leading media moguls had begun fading in 2015 as those close to him began questioning his mental capacity. The long-running legal battle that ensued put him at odds with a former girlfriend and long-time confidante Philippe Dauman but reunited him with his daughter Shari, from whom he had been estranged.  Shari Redstone said in a statement: \u201cMy father led an extraordinary life that not only shaped entertainment as we know it today, but created an incredible family legacy. Through it all, we shared a great love for one another and he was a wonderful father, grandfather and great-grandfather. I am so proud to be his daughter and I will miss him always.\u201d  The challenges to Redstone\u2019s mental health resulted in him being replaced as executive chairman at CBS by Les Moonves and at Viacom by Dauman, whom Redstone would later drop from the trust that was to determine the direction of CBS and Viacom after his death.  After legal and backroom wrangling that one observer likened to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the Redstone family ousted Dauman from Viacom in August 2016, ultimately replacing him with Robert Bakish. Dauman had been among those questioning Redstone\u2019s mental capacity and his influence had waned after Redstone\u2019s daughter, Shari, started taking a more active role in his business.  Since 2016, Shari pushed twice to merge CBS and Viacom. She\u2019s also weathered a lawsuit aimed at diluting her family\u2019s control of CBS, and a sexual misconduct scandal at CBS, which resulted in the September 2018 resignation of CEO Les Moonves. Viacom and CBS re-merged in 2019.  Shari Redstone and her son Tyler Korff will now take over two seats on a trustee board that controls the voting interest in an entity, National Amusements Inc, that holds the controlling stake in ViacomCBS, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  RISK TAKER  Redstone was born on May 27, 1923, into a Boston family that owned a chain of drive-in movie theaters. He graduated first in his class at Boston Latin High School, went through Harvard in three years and worked with an elite U.S. Army unit that cracked Japanese codes during World War Two.  After the war, he earned a law degree at Harvard and successfully pleaded a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. He joined National Amusements, his family\u2019s theater chain, in 1954, and became chief executive officer in 1967.  Known for his blunt talk, Boston accent and audacious risk taking, Redstone was in his 60s in 1987 when he bought Viacom for $3.4 billion with mostly borrowed money. A few years later he acquired Paramount for more than $10 billion and added CBS to the portfolio in 1999 in a deal valued at $37 billion.  Before his health deteriorated, Redstone had claimed to swim naked every day and always liked to be surrounded by beautiful young women.  \u201cWith a striking head of orange hair, Redstone is a vainglorious, old-school egomaniac who has an operatic personal life that has been largely kept out of the media undoubtedly because he controls so much of it,\u201d author Michael Wolff wrote in New York magazine in 2002.  \u201cLIVING GHOST\u201d  After decades spent building his empire, Redstone\u2019s participation at corporate events became minimal in 2014 and he spoke only a few words on earnings calls. Fortune magazine reported he attended his last board meetings that year and cited a witness who said he dozed and drooled during it, which raised the question about whether he was fit to run the company.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Despite the concerns about his health, Redstone hung on to his chairmanship as long as possible. In June 2015, he told Vanity Fair in an email correspondence, \u201cYou should know that I am never retiring!!!\u201d  Later that year, the Wall Street Journal reported Redstone had suffered mini-strokes that made speaking difficult, although he remained mentally sharp.  Former girlfriend Manuela Herzer challenged Redstone\u2019s mental competence in a lawsuit filed in November 2015, referring to him as a \u201cliving ghost.\u201d  The suit was thrown out in May 2016 by a California judge who ruled that Redstone\u2019s testimony had disproved Herzer\u2019s claims. Herzer appealed the judge\u2019s ruling, and the parties settled in 2019.  Redstone\u2019s death, which comes at a time the media landscape is enduring wrenching changes, thins the ranks of a group of media executives, including Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner, who changed the world of news and entertainment with the companies they built.  Redstone displayed a penchant for forcing out top executives, including Viacom President Frank Biondi; Mel Karmazin, the CEO of CBS; and Tom Freston, who was canned as CEO of Viacom after losing a deal to acquire the social media network MySpace to Murdoch.  Asked in his last interview, in January 2014, with The Hollywood Reporter, about who might succeed him, Redstone exploded, \u201cI will not discuss succession. You know why? I\u2019m not going to die.\u201d","134":"(Reuters) - In preparing for election night, some top U.S. television news executives see a cautionary tale in a notorious November evening two decades ago.  FILE PHOTO: Republican supporters react after tv networks announced that Texas Governor George W. Bush won the U.S. election in Austin, Texas, November 8, 2000. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque\/File Photo  After major networks projected Vice President Al Gore the winner in the crucial state of Florida, they pivoted in the wee hours to calling his Republican rival George W. Bush the next president. The margin was so slim, Gore conceded, then took it back an hour later.  The election wouldn\u2019t be decided for more than a month. The only loss that night was the networks\u2019 credibility.  \u201cI think 2000 still sort of lingers over everyone,\u201d said Fox News Media President Jay Wallace, whose network was among those that initially called Gore the winner. \u201cAs competitive as networks can be, you do know that you\u2019re calling a presidency and you don\u2019t want to be wrong on something like this.\u201d  In this year\u2019s matchup between Republican U.S. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, TV networks are facing greater pressure than ever to report election results accurately and without unwarranted speculation. Among the nation\u2019s - and the networks\u2019 - challenges are a president stoking fears of ballot fraud, a deeply divided electorate and the specter of a prolonged vote count, which raises the potential for protests, violence and lawsuits.  In separate interviews with Reuters about their plans for election night, top executives at five major news networks described a focus on restraint, not speed; on transparency about what remains unknown; and on a reassuring message that slow results don\u2019t signify a crisis.  Election night \u201cis not going to be about storylines or narratives or projections or predictions,\u201d said NBC News President Noah Oppenheim. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about: \u2018What do we know in any given moment?\u2019 and staying firmly focused on only those facts.\u201d  Compared to election night features such as the white board Tim Russert scrawled on in 2000, many of this year\u2019s tools will be decidedly more scientific. Networks will be showcasing their investments in more polling, deeper data analysis, and additional reporting on the mechanics of voting, voting integrity and misinformation.  Walt Disney Co\u2019s DIS.N ABC News and ViacomCBS Inc VIACA.O- owned CBS News have voter integrity units dedicated to topics such as foreign election interference and how the vote is tallied, state by state. CBS is using its \u201cBattleground Tracker\u201d that combines polling, files on voter participation, U.S. Census data and historical patterns.  Comcast CMCSA.O-owned NBC News has doubled the size of its \u201cVote Watch\u201d team, which includes 24 correspondents, reporters and producers who specialize in issues such as voting rights and misinformation campaigns. For the past year, the news division has been reporting on voter sentiment in five \u201cbellwether\u201d counties in Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona.  This will be the first presidential election in which the major TV networks will get data from different providers, raising the potential for divergent perspectives on election night returns.  Since 2018, Fox Corp\u2019s FOXA.O Fox News has partnered with the Associated Press to replace traditional in-person exit polls with online and telephone surveys that aim to reach early and Election Day voters. The survey data will be combined with real-time results tabulated by the AP to help make projections. Fox and the AP left the National Election Pool consortium, which includes the three broadcast news networks and AT&T T.N-owned CNN. The consortium will rely on the firm Edison Research for exit polls and results as they come in from each precinct. Reuters has a distribution deal with the NEP for 2020 election data.  Networks may benefit from an adjustment in pre-election polling since 2016: Weighting state polls for education, not just gender and age. In the 2016 election, a voter\u2019s education figured prominently in whether they would vote for Trump or Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton. Whites without college degrees turned out for Trump in greater numbers.  For this Election Day, the executives said, slow-but-sure is the watchword.  \u201cWe will project states\u2019 [results] in the normal way. But getting to that point of confidence ... is a more complicated process, a longer process,\u201d said ABC News President James Goldston. \u201cAnd we just need to be transparent with the audience about what that looks like.\u201d  \u2018TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE\u2019  During the 2000 election, Bush\u2019s narrow margin of victory in Florida led to a recount. After more than a month of political and legal battles, the Supreme Court halted the counting in a 5-4 decision that further divided the nation - and still roils some Democrats.  That drama could seem tame compared to this time around, because partisan divisions have only become more fierce. The coronavirus pandemic has made many people leery of voting in person, leading record numbers to vote in advance. Tallying these ballots could take weeks. Polls have shown Biden with a substantial lead, but some political experts say it is entirely possible Trump will be the front-runner on election night, with Biden emerging as the victor only after all the early and mail-in votes are tallied.  The Supreme Court could become the final arbiter in any legal challenge - just as it was in 2000. But its potential role already has provoked controversy as Republicans vow to quickly install a replacement for the late liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which would tilt the court to the right.  In this divisive environment, networks will be under the microscope for any perceived biases.  \u201cBecause the media is increasingly polarized, and the audiences for some networks are increasingly tribalized, calls that seem to be one-sided and aren\u2019t accompanied by similar calls from other networks are just going to land as sort of political tactics rather than election science,\u201d said Steve Coll, dean of Columbia Journalism School.  Covering this presidential election requires detailed reporting at the state and county levels, according to Coll. The need for this granularity was underscored in 2016, when Clinton won the popular vote but lost the electoral college to Trump. The contest was lost in a few battleground states, sometimes by very narrow margins - in Michigan, by about 11,000 votes.  Calling close races will be particularly treacherous this year, Coll said. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have automatic recounts if a margin of victory is too narrow. In some states it\u2019s going to be hard to tell on election night not only who won, but also whether the margin will trigger a recount.  The key for networks is being upfront about what is known and unknown, the executives interviewed by Reuters stressed.  \u201cGiven the dramatic increase in absentee and vote by mail votes that will be part of this year\u2019s election, it will be all that much more important (to) remain transparent with the viewers and readers at all times about what that vote count represents\u201d on election night, said CNN Political Director David Chalian.  The TV executives said their networks will be focused not just on what precincts are reporting, but on the expected political makeup of early and mail-in voters.  If a campaign claims victory without sufficient evidence or disputes a network\u2019s projections, executives say, the networks will report on those developments. The networks\u2019 calls in elections are made by \u201cdecision desks,\u201d and are typically based on a combination of exit polls, data from previous election cycles, and actual vote results that come in.  CBS News President Susan Zirinsky said the key is to prepare audiences for \u201cthe multiple plays that could happen this night.\u201d  \u201cThis election is totally unpredictable,\u201d she said.","135":"FILE PHOTO: The Facebook logo is displayed on a mobile phone in this picture illustration taken December 2, 2019.

The development comes as Facebook and other big tech companies face regulatory scrutiny, with growing bipartisan consensus to hold them accountable for business practices.  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and nearly every U.S. state filed lawsuits against Facebook in December, saying it used a \u201cbuy or bury\u201d strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.  The complaints accused Facebook of buying up rivals, focusing specifically on its previous acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014.  The lawsuits were the biggest antitrust cases in a generation, comparable to the lawsuit against Microsoft Corp in 1998.

But getting to that point of confidence ... is a more complicated process, a longer process,\u201d said ABC News President James Goldston. \u201cAnd we just need to be transparent with the audience about what that looks like.\u201d  \u2018TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE\u2019  During the 2000 election, Bush\u2019s narrow margin of victory in Florida led to a recount. After more than a month of political and legal battles, the Supreme Court halted the counting in a 5-4 decision that further divided the nation - and still roils some Democrats.  That drama could seem tame compared to this time around, because partisan divisions have only become more fierce. The coronavirus pandemic has made many people leery of voting in person, leading record numbers to vote in advance. Tallying these ballots could take weeks. Polls have shown Biden with a substantial lead, but some political experts say it is entirely possible Trump will be the front-runner on election night, with Biden emerging as the victor only after all the early and mail-in votes are tallied.  The Supreme Court could become the final arbiter in any legal challenge - just as it was in 2000. But its potential role already has provoked controversy as Republicans vow to quickly install a replacement for the late liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which would tilt the court to the right.  In this divisive environment, networks will be under the microscope for any perceived biases.  \u201cBecause the media is increasingly polarized, and the audiences for some networks are increasingly tribalized, calls that seem to be one-sided and aren\u2019t accompanied by similar calls from other networks are just going to land as sort of political tactics rather than election science,\u201d said Steve Coll, dean of Columbia Journalism School.  Covering this presidential election requires detailed reporting at the state and county levels, according to Coll. The need for this granularity was underscored in 2016, when Clinton won the popular vote but lost the electoral college to Trump. The contest was lost in a few battleground states, sometimes by very narrow margins - in Michigan, by about 11,000 votes.  Calling close races will be particularly treacherous this year, Coll said. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have automatic recounts if a margin of victory is too narrow. In some states it\u2019s going to be hard to tell on election night not only who won, but also whether the margin will trigger a recount.  The key for networks is being upfront about what is known and unknown, the executives interviewed by Reuters stressed.  \u201cGiven the dramatic increase in absentee and vote by mail votes that will be part of this year\u2019s election, it will be all that much more important (to) remain transparent with the viewers and readers at all times about what that vote count represents\u201d on election night, said CNN Political Director David Chalian.  The TV executives said their networks will be focused not just on what precincts are reporting, but on the expected political makeup of early and mail-in voters.  If a campaign claims victory without sufficient evidence or disputes a network\u2019s projections, executives say, the networks will report on those developments. The networks\u2019 calls in elections are made by \u201cdecision desks,\u201d and are typically based on a combination of exit polls, data from previous election cycles, and actual vote results that come in.  CBS News President Susan Zirinsky said the key is to prepare audiences for \u201cthe multiple plays that could happen this night.\u201d  \u201cThis election is totally unpredictable,\u201d she said.

As preparations begin to salvage the iconic American cultural tradition in the spring semester, at stake is more than $3.3 billion in advertising and broadcast media rights.  The bigger dilemma is how marketers and networks like Walt Disney Co\u2019s ESPN and Fox Sports will juggle a year jam-packed with other postponed sporting events that could see spring college football bumping against the regularly scheduled college basketball season, and possibly even the Tokyo Summer Olympics.  Everyone will be \u201cscrambling harder than Trevor Lawrence under an all-out blitz,\u201d with \u201clittle to replace the demographic power of college football,\u201d said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco. Lawrence is the Clemson Tigers quarterback whose tweets this week sparked a player-led movement #WeWantToPlay to resume the season.  One concern is whether there\u2019s enough money to go around as marketing budgets are stretched across a pile-up of events postponed from 2020.  \u201cSponsors might cut back because they could have other commitments like NBA or NHL, and not have the money available for college football,\u201d said Neal Pilson, president of sports media consultancy Pilson Communications, and former president of CBS Sports.  Many advertisers chose to keep their ad commitments for other sports that had been paused, such as NBA, and have them run when play resumed, said David Campanelli, chief investment officer at ad agency Horizon Media, which counts GEICO and Corona beer as clients.  When the college football season picks up in the spring, as many hope, and crosses into a new fiscal year, that could create budget issues for advertisers, he said.  On Tuesday, the Big Ten and Pac-12, two of U.S. college sports\u2019 most powerful sports leagues, canceled their fall season, and said they would consider moving those sports to compete in the spring. The announcements added pressure to the rest of the \u201cPower Five\u201d conferences about the viability of the 2020 football season.  But a spring competition format would see college football compete for dollars potentially against the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and college basketball games.  With the exception of some college football games that attract a national audience, many of the games have a more regional appeal and could lose out on ad dollars compared to professional sports leagues that draw bigger audiences, said Sam Bloom, chief executive of ad agency Camelot Strategic Marketing & Media. Advertisers could also pass on college football if future games are played without fans, which would limit branding opportunities in that region, he said.  A postponement will also trigger a series of complicated negotiations throughout the entire media food chain from pay-TV distributors such as Comcast Corp and Dish Network Corp, the media networks including ESPN and CBS, which air the games, down to the athletic conferences, said Patrick Crakes, principal at Crakes Media Consulting, and former vice president at Fox Sports.  Colleges earned $2.2 billion in media rights in 2018, according to an analysis from Sportico, which looked at budget reports from public universities.  If Big Ten and Pac-12 remain the only two conferences that cancel this year\u2019s seasons, that could spell bad news for Fox, since the conferences make up about 80% of Fox\u2019s college football inventory, said Crakes.  Fox declined to comment.  The incentive to get this right is clear. Leagues including the NBA and MLB enjoyed blockbuster viewership when they returned from COVID-19 delays last month, as sports fans devoured coverage after being denied live sports for so long.  For American audiences, college football\u2019s weekly ritual ties generations together, with communities across the country spending Saturdays in front of the television with friends and families.  For marketers trying to reach men, \u201cThere\u2019s simply no substitute for live sports\u2014especially football,\u201d Dorfman said. \u201cWhenever it comes back, football-hungry fans will be flocking\u2014and advertisers will follow.\u201d (Reporting by Sheila Dang and Amy Tennery; editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)","152":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - British actor Robert Pattinson has tested positive for COVID-19, news media reported on Thursday, halting production of \u201cThe Batman\u201d and highlighting the industry\u2019s struggles to get back to business after months of a pandemic-induced shutdown.  Movie studio Warner Bros. said in a statement that \u201ca member of \u2018The Batman\u2019 production\u201d in Britain had tested positive for the coronavirus, but did not give a name. \u201cFilming is temporarily paused,\u201d the studio\u2019s statement added, but did not say for how long.  Variety, the Hollywood Reporter and Vanity Fair all cited sources as saying the person who tested positive was Pattinson, the film\u2019s star.  Warner Bros. and Pattinson\u2019s representatives did not return calls seeking comment. It was not clear to what extent Pattinson, 34, best known for his breakout role in the vampire movie series \u201cTwilight,\u201d was suffering COVID-19 symptoms.  Filming of \u201cThe Batman\u201d had resumed north of London only three days ago after being shut down in mid-March, along with dozens of other movies and TV shows around the world due to the coronavirus.  The movie, in which Pattinson stars as the comic book hero, has about three months of material left to shoot, according to Hollywood trade outlets. Its release was pushed back earlier this year from June 2021 to October 2021.  Movie and TV production has been slow to get going again in the United States under complex safety procedures that include testing, quarantine and social distancing on sets that employ dozens of crew members, makeup artists, actors, extras and other production staff.  Some productions, including Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cJurassic World: Dominion,\u201d have restarted in London or in Eastern Europe, while the cast of the \u201cAvatar\u201d sequel is back at work in New Zealand, where the coronavirus has been kept in check.  Tom Cruise in July got permission to shoot parts of the next \u201cMission Impossible\u201d thriller in Norway without having to follow quarantine requirements. However, Variety reported that the production has hired two cruise ships to house the crew to keep them apart from locals.","153":"Jan 22 (Reuters) - About 11 million TV viewers watched the start of the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on Tuesday when lawmakers sparred for hours over witnesses and records for the historic proceedings, according to Nielsen ratings data.  The total fell short of the roughly 13.8 million viewers across 10 broadcast and cable television networks who tuned in last November for the first day of the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into Trump.  The audience figure on Tuesday covered the 4-1\/2 hours of daytime coverage by six cable and broadcast networks that aired live telecasts on Tuesday.  The networks were Walt Disney Co\u2019s ABC, ViacomCBS Inc\u2019s CBS, Comcast Corp\u2019s NBC and MSNBC, AT&T Inc\u2019s CNN and Fox Corp\u2019s Fox News.  On Tuesday, Senate Republicans rejected Democratic efforts to obtain evidence and call witnesses. Debate stretched past midnight before final rules were approved.  The trial, which resumed on Wednesday with opening arguments, is the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history.  Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House in December on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, and impeding the inquiry into the matter.  The Republican president denies any wrongdoing. He is almost certain to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled 100-member Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to remove him from office.  The TV ratings do not include people who watched live coverage via online streaming or followed the event on social media.

On Thursday, news website Deadline reported that the owner of Paramount Pictures and Showtime Networks had received 25 inbound inquiries about buying the unit since then.

But the drawn-out election results, and the ongoing uncertainty over which party will prevail in the Senate, is an amuse-bouche for the gridlock that lies ahead. Breakingviews takes a closer look at what will shape the agenda for various industries.  The White House is seen at sunrise during the election day, in Washington, U.S., November 3, 2020. REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  WALL STREET REPRIEVE  The money business has dodged the blue wave, but a purple ripple could still dampen the ankles of the masters of the universe. Going into the election, the worst-case scenario for banks like JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs or Citigroup was a Democratic sweep of both arms of government. That would have given a clear platform for ideas like the breakup of large lenders put forward by Senator Bernie Sanders, the elevation of Elizabeth Warren as secretary of the Treasury or proposals to curb stock buybacks and impose taxes on financial transactions.  Those are now vanishingly unlikely. Nor is there much to worry about from more onerous regulation \u2013 especially since Republicans did little to unravel the post-crisis protections in the first place. And while a President Biden would get to put forward his own people to run financial regulators, those will likely have to pass muster with moderates, even if Democrats manage to get control of the Senate. Financial industry executives may even be on the shortlist, and the revolving door will still revolve.  The other touchy subject is tax. Biden\u2019s proposed rise in the corporate income tax rate to 28% from 21% would affect financial institutions as it would most companies. But his talk of raising personal rates for top earners and capital gains would hit finance, with its heavy concentration of wealth, hard. That too now faces heavy dilution. Every Senate vote counts, and Democrats like Charles Schumer of New York rely on Wall Street employees for votes and contributions. Mass decampment to low-tax Florida can wait, for a couple of years at least. (By John Foley)  HAPPY VALLEY  For Big Tech, what comes next is more a question of people than policy. Alphabet\u2019s Google unit, Amazon.com, Apple and Facebook are all under antitrust investigation by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission. Prosecutors have already filed a lawsuit against search giant Google. The big variable is who a Biden administration chooses to lead them \u2013 and what level of aggression that produces.  The technology sector is in the unenviable position of having enemies on both sides. The progressive push against the industry means Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey, of Facebook and Twitter respectively, can forget the kid-glove treatment they received last time a Democrat occupied the White House. Facebook could face even more scrutiny given the clashes the Biden campaign had with the social network over election content. And Republicans are unlikely to forget the platforms\u2019 enthusiastic policing of Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of winning the election while the count was still ongoing.  But slim Senate control \u2013 for either party \u2013 will benefit Big Tech. It makes it harder to pass legislation on antitrust reform to break up the firms or ban them from buying rivals. The same goes for plans to roll back legal liability protections for online content posted by users, which will likely get bogged down by partisan politics because both parties disagree on what constitutes objectionable material. The one area that could see meaningful progress is proposals to boost privacy. That happens to be an area where the industry welcomes joined-up regulation, and there\u2019s less political bickering. (By Gina Chon)  INFRASTRUCTURE WEAK  A stale joke in Trump\u2019s Washington is that every week is infrastructure week, yet no major plans are ever announced. Biden has promised a $2 trillion program centered on clean energy, the creation of well-paid jobs, and equity in where and how investments are made.  Trump has pruned the forest of red tape that can strangle private-sector infrastructure projects raising hopes at companies who invest in such things, like Brookfield Asset Management and Blackstone. Biden\u2019s manifesto makes it sound like Democrats might let some of it regrow. That may be appropriate, for example in pursuit of a carbon pollution-free electricity-generation sector by 2035. And tax breaks and other incentives could encourage investment. There\u2019s a danger, though, that the burden falls heavily on D.C.\u2019s budget.  An analysis from the Wharton School notes that extra federal spending on infrastructure may allow states and municipalities to invest less \u2013 but that such projects boost productivity and therefore wages and GDP. Trump has left much on the to-do list for Biden. And to mobilize vast reserves of cash waiting for the opportunity, states and localities may need to get friendlier with the private sector. Done right, infrastructure investment does come with payback. (By Richard Beales)  BACK ON THE BUS  Public transit may have had a rough year as Americans avoided crowded buses and trains \u2013 but it was a big winner on election night. Voters across the country approved ballot measures to fund better transportation. In Austin, Texas, around 60% of voters supported a property tax hike that would, among other things, fund more light rail and bus routes. Many other areas followed suit, like Virginia\u2019s Fairfax County, which approved borrowing money to pay for transit improvements, and California\u2019s Sonoma County, which voted to maintain a sales tax to make updates like expanding bus services. Biden is also an evangelist for Amtrak trains, which he took almost daily between Delaware and Washington for 36 years.  Is a boost for public transport bad for the private kind? Not necessarily. Leading car companies, like $31 billion Ford Motor and $53 billion General Motors, would have continued shifting toward electric vehicles no matter who was elected president. A Biden administration could mean tougher emissions standards, but less concern about divergence between regulations in the large liberal state of California and the rest of the country. And manufacturers should have fewer concerns about material costs increasing from tariffs or unpredictable trade policies disrupting supply chains. The modernization of transit may now shift into a higher gear. (By Anna Szymanski)  ENERGY GOES GREENER  Whether America\u2019s government is red, blue or purple, its energy is going to get greener. A change in administrations won\u2019t change that direction, but it will affect the speed. Biden has called for a \u201ctransition\u201d from oil and other fossil fuels \u2013 but his plan doesn\u2019t call for a production ban. Instead it pledges to make polluters bear the cost of carbon emissions and proposes large investments in green technologies.  These actions merely echo where the market is going anyway. Cost declines in green energy production have been relentless and are driven more by technology than policy. Solar panels, batteries and wind turbines steadily become more efficient and cheaper, allowing them to outcompete fossil fuels in power production today, and transit tomorrow. Just look at coal. Trump promised to end \u201cthe war on coal\u201d and rolled back environmental regulations to encourage both production and use. Yet U.S. coal production this year is expected to be about 30% lower than when he entered office, as utilities shut uneconomic electricity plants.  Even without Senate backing, Biden can wield influence. Where Trump pulled America out of the Paris Climate Agreement, Biden could put it back in. The way government agencies interpret pre-existing rules is critical and comes from the top. Companies already moving away from high-polluting fuels, from utility NextEra Energy to turbine-maker General Electric, are already on the right political track. And for holdouts like Exxon Mobil, the writing is on the wall. (By Robert Cyran)  RESTART THE PRESS  A Biden presidency will halt the war on media launched by his predecessor. That\u2019s good for the likes of CNN-owner AT&T, Comcast, ViacomCBS, Walt Disney and even Fox Corp, the parent companies of America\u2019s top networks. A relentless four-year assault by the White House to undermine credibility in the press \u2013 branding journalists as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d \u2013 didn\u2019t stop news organizations from carefully and methodically reporting on the chaotic 2020 presidential election. Even Fox News, Trump\u2019s favored network, invoked his ire by declaring early on that the state of Arizona had turned Democratic, and stuck to its guns.  It\u2019s not just the big organizations that will get an additional boost from a cease-fire. The collapse of local news should now get more attention. Since 2004, the United States has lost 2,100 daily and weekly newspapers, according to the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media. The country has paid a steep price for that loss, with a flood of divisive misinformation. Congress has taken note. Bipartisan bills including one that gives news organization a safe harbor to negotiate with tech platforms could finally pass. Information carpetbaggers Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet-owned YouTube, themselves scrambling to police a flood of fake news, may now be called on to effectively provide local news with a financial lifeline. (By Jennifer Saba)  EAT, DRINK, BE MERRY  Consumer-goods firms will have their eye on one big \u2013 or maybe small \u2013 prize: stimulus. The Covid-19 relief package passed in the spring included $1,200 checks and extra unemployment benefits. The results of that were clear. In April, 64% of adults said they could find $400 in cash to meet an emergency, but that rose to 70% in July, according to the Federal Reserve. Companies from Clorox to Kraft Heinz reported strong sales \u2013 and consumers trading up to higher-margin items.  The big question is how much support is on the way. Democrats and Republicans have been far apart on how much stimulus is needed, with numbers ranging from $500 billion to over $2 trillion. With wafer-thin Senate control, or none at all, Democrats might have to rein in expectations. The outgoing president\u2019s views matter too, since he remains in office until January. But all sides will recognize that the cost of doing nothing is high. After the $600 weekly boost to unemployment payments ended in July, consumer spending slowed. (By Amanda Gomez)  SMOKE RISES  The legal cannabis industry laid down new roots in 2020. Voters in New Jersey, Arizona, South Dakota and Montana approved marijuana for recreational use. Yet without a clear Democratic lead in the Senate, the prospects of a federal law giving weed the green light are slim. In short, this should be good for the product, if not so good for the companies that make it.  Bringing New Jersey into the fold of states that let adults buy and consume cannabis is a big step. It increases the pressure on neighboring states like New York to do likewise or see potential tax dollars leak away. Illinois, for example, estimates that around one-quarter of cannabis sales happen out of state. Companies like Curaleaf, which already sells medical ganja in the Garden State, are obvious beneficiaries. That\u2019s contingent, of course, on drawing up new laws and rules.  The biggest listed cannabis stocks are still mostly wagers on the Canadian market, since for now, transportation of weed across U.S. state lines remains verboten. Canopy Growth,, which has an option to buy U.S. rival Acreage, is the obvious exception. And without legislation permitting weed companies to use nationally chartered banks \u2013 or deduct their expenses from taxable income \u2013 the industry will struggle to create attractive investments big institutions want to own. Expect no big changes in the short term. Further out, the smoke signals are clear.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  Yet advertising revenue has plummeted for many publishers as companies slash marketing budgets and prove reluctant to buy ads against coronavirus coverage for fear of tarnishing their brand.  Forecasts for global advertising growth this year have been revised down by $20 billion since March 12, according to market research firm eMarketer. It estimates ad spending growth of just 8.4% in China, where the outbreak began, the slowest since 2011.  Total local advertising in the United States could decline by up to 30% this year, or $38 billion, according to media research firm Borrell Associates.  Publishers, advertising agencies and tech firms that help place ads have been trying to persuade brands to rethink, arguing that by eschewing coronavirus coverage, advertisers are losing access to engaged readers.  So far, they appear to have had limited success.  \u201cI can\u2019t say we\u2019ve yet noticed a change,\u201d said Ben Walmsley, commercial director for publishing at News UK, a division of News Corp. \u201cI think change will be relatively slow.\u201d  ViacomCBS-owned VIACA.O CBS News Digital has made some headway with marketers and agencies, said Christy Tanner, its executive vice president and general manager. \"But it\u2019s been more slow-going than most of us would like.\"  The Washington Post and the Atlantic said they also had not seen a shift in behaviour from advertisers who are avoiding pandemic content.  The industry was already suffering from declining advertising revenue. Gannett GCI.N, BuzzFeed, Britain's MailOnline and News Corp Australia have all announced furloughs, pay cuts or other cost-cutting measures.  Damon Reeve, CEO of the Ozone Project, which sells the online ad inventory of a majority of British national titles, said he had heard that advertising was being kept away from up to 60% of editorial content.  A representative for Reuters news organization said the company has also experienced an impact and cited an Internet Advertising Bureau study that showed 70% of advertisers have scaled back ad spending across the industry during this period.  \"Factual news coverage on the global pandemic is essential and must be supported,\" Reuters CEO Michael Friedenberg said on Twitter here on April 2. \"It is incumbent upon the ad tech and verification industry to ensure that trusted news from reputable sources about Covid-19 is not blocked by safety filters.\"  Five of the top U.S. advertising spenders last year - Comcast CMCSA.O, AT&T T.N, Amazon AMZN.O, P&G PG.N and General Motors GM.N - either declined to comment or did not respond to questions about their advertising policies.  \u201cBLACKLIST\u201d BACKLASH  For years, ad tech firms such as DoubleVerify have offered tools for brands to stop ads from appearing on web pages or URLs that include keywords like \u201cshooting\u201d or \u201cmurder.\u201d These advertising \u201cblacklists\u201d exploded in usage after the 2016 U.S. election, when brands sought to avoid polarizing news coverage.  \u201cTrump\u201d was the most popular blacklist keyword until \u201ccoronavirus\u201d overtook it earlier this year, with more than 3,100 advertisers blocking it as of March, according to ad tech firm Integral Ad Science.  Ad agencies GroupM and Universal McCann have advised clients against blacklisting all coronavirus articles.  \u201cThere are stories about death tolls in Italy or the UK which would not be very appropriate to be monetised, but there are stories about communities coming together and we wouldn\u2019t want to block that kind of content,\u201d said Stevan Randjelovic, GroupM\u2019s director of brand safety and digital risk.

The viewership figure for the Wednesday evening matchup in Salt Lake City included people watching across 18 networks. The tally came in 56% higher than four years ago, when 37 million people tuned in to see Pence debate Democrat Tim Kaine.  During the policy-heavy 90-minute event, Pence and Harris clashed over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.  Vice presidential debates typically draw smaller audiences than presidential clashes. President Donald Trump\u2019s Sept. 29 debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden pulled in 73 million viewers, making it the second-biggest event on U.S. television this year, after the Super Bowl.  The TV viewing record for a vice presidential debate was set in 2008, when Biden debated Republican Sarah Palin. That telecast drew 69.9 million viewers.  For the Pence-Harris matchup, Fox News Channel led all networks, with 11.9 million viewers.  The Nielsen numbers included people watching at home and at such venues as bars and restaurants. It also included some digital viewership through televisions connected to the internet.  The figures do not capture the full extent of online viewing, which has grown in popularity as traditional TV audiences decline, however. The debate was streamed live on Twitter, YouTube, network websites and other digital platforms.","160":"(Reuters) - Alphabet\u2019s new Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday gained the opportunity to reshape the leadership of Google\u2019s parent with the exit of Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, whose outsized strategic role was overshadowed by employee concerns about his personal relationship with a subordinate.  FILE PHOTO: Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt (L) and David Drummond, Google's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, react before a meeting about the \"right to be forgotten\" in Madrid September 9, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrea Comas (SPAIN)  Drummond, also senior vice president of corporate development, had been with Google since its start in 1998. He incorporated the company as outside counsel, winning the business of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He later spent nearly 18 years as the company\u2019s top lawyer and one of its few black executives.  Scrutiny centered on Drummond as the board last year investigated the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct complaints throughout its workforce, and he became a lightning rod for criticism about what some employees viewed as tolerance for poor behavior.  Pichai now has his first big chance to make his mark on Alphabet leadership since Page and Brin left him day-to-day reins of the company last month.  Drummond\u2019s last day is Jan. 31, and a replacement has not been decided yet, Alphabet said.  \u201cWith Larry and Sergey now leaving their executive roles at Alphabet, the company is entering an exciting new phase, and I believe that it\u2019s also the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders,\u201d Drummond said in an email to employees shared by Google.  Some employees had questioned Drummond\u2019s role at the company after the New York Times in 2018 reported on an extramarital affair he had with subordinate, Jennifer Blakely, starting in 2004. She told the paper that she was effectively forced to transfer teams to comply with Google\u2019s workplace dating policy.  Blakely had a son with Drummond, but in August 2019 she publicly criticized him for not providing support. Drummond responded in a statement calling himself \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d Blakely did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.  Some shareholders have urged Alphabet to make changes that had been within Drummond\u2019s purview, including greater financial transparency, bigger share buybacks and a management shakeup. Alphabet shares have risen 6.5% this month as analysts expressed optimism about possible changes.  In a departure from company norm, Drummond is not receiving an exit pay package. In recent weeks, Drummond sold more than $200 million worth of his Alphabet shares, leaving him with about $90 million in company stock.  He remains a defendant, alongside other executives, in a lawsuit shareholders brought last year accusing Alphabet leadership of covering up sexual harassment scandals within the company including by awarding lavish exit packages to two top executives found responsible for misconduct.  \u201cWhile we are glad to see Mr. Drummond is no longer with Alphabet, we still intend to hold him accountable for fiduciary breaches through our litigation,\u201d said Julie Goldsmith Reiser, attorney for the lead plaintiffs.  The board completed an internal investigation last month, but has not publicized findings. The litigation is in mediation, and the board\u2019s findings and resulting actions may become known as it goes on.  Pichai in 2018 said Google made mistakes in some cases and introduced new procedures aimed at creating equity and transparency in harassment investigations.  \u201cI am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society\u2026 and, yes, here at Google, too,\u201d said Pichai, who at the time was Google CEO and had not yet gained the additional title of Alphabet CEO.  The #MeToo movement has forced major shake-ups in management and harassment policy across corporate America.  Through blog posts, congressional appearances and media interviews, Drummond\u2019s presence was felt in nearly every public battle the company fought as it crippled traditional businesses in media and telecoms on its way to online dominance.  Drummond has described himself as a diversity advocate, telling Fortune in 2017 that he \u201cpushed\u201d the company to do more on the issue. He encouraged Google to publish data about the demographics of its workforce, and in 2014 he marched into a companywide meeting and spoke alongside colleagues frustrated by police violence against young black men.  BIGGER ROLE  When Google re-organized under the Alphabet umbrella in 2015, Page elevated Drummond\u2019s role beyond managing the company\u2019s legal and regulatory problems to overseeing its investment funds and far-off ventures.  Earlier in his tenure, he beat a lawsuit lodged by insurer Geico that would have undermined the company's now-massive search ads business. He settled with Viacom VIACA.O a copyright infringement lawsuit that could have crushed YouTube on its way to becoming the top online video destination. And he fended off five major book publishers to enable Google to make their copyrighted works searchable online.  Drummond tussled on behalf of Google with rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for a decade on executive poaching, anticompetitive conduct and patents, with each company taking its share of licks.  As Google\u2019s lead dealmaker, Drummond oversaw billions of dollars\u2019 worth of acquisitions including of YouTube, DoubleClick and Motorola.  Drummond for a time served as the public face of strong stands against governments around the world. He has regularly advocated for freedoms of speech, and in 2010, he called for trade sanctions on countries that censor the internet, such as China and Turkey.","161":"OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian government will make an exception for Tom Cruise and his crew to shoot parts of a new \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie in Norway this autumn without imposing quarantine requirements, a minister said on Friday.

Viacom and CBS completed their merger in December in their third attempt since 2016, aiming to gird against competition in a rapidly consolidating media universe while partnering with and battling the likes of Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Walt Disney Co DIS.N.  The merger reunited media mogul Sumner Redstone\u2019s entertainment empire and brought Showtime networks and CBS News under the same roof as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Paramount movie studios.  ViacomCBS also revealed plans to create a new streaming video service built off of its existing CBS All Access service that will offer free, paid and a premium tier subscription service.  \u201cIn 2020, our priorities are maximizing the power of our content, unlocking more value from our biggest revenue lines and accelerating our momentum in streaming,\u201d ViacomCBS Chief Executive Bob Bakish said in a prepared statement.

Unlike rivals, executives said they did not expect to boost spending on original programing for the service.  Streaming revenue is expected to rise 35% to 40% this year and the company expects to serve about 16 million U.S. streaming subscribers in 2020, up from 11 million in 2019.  Fourth quarter revenue fell to $6.87 billion from $7.09 billion a year ago in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, missing analyst expectations of $7.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Excluding items, ViacomCBS\u2019s earnings per share of 97 cents also missed expectations of $1.44, according to IBES.  Advertising revenue fell 2% to $3.03 billion during the quarter as domestic ad revenue was hit by a decline in political ads.  ViacomCBS also said annual adjusted earnings per share were expected to be $5.15 to $5.50, up from $5.01 in 2019. Free cash flow, a key measure of a media company\u2019s health, is expected to rise to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion, up from $1.2 billion in 2019. Executives said they expected an additional $500 million in free cash flow benefit in 2021.  ViacomCBS said it plans to save $750 million in cost savings from the merger, up from the previous target of $500 million.","164":"July 15 (Reuters) - Popular U.S. TV host and actor Nick Cannon has been fired by ViacomCBS for promoting what the media company on Wednesday said was hateful speech and spreading anti-Semitic conspiracy theories on a recent podcast.

And we can prove this.\u201d  On the podcast, Griffin made the unsubstantiated claim often asserted by hate groups that Jews control the music industry and the media. Cannon responded to Griffin\u2019s comments, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re just saying what you\u2019re saying, you\u2019re speaking facts.\u201d  In a statement Viacom said its executives spoke with Cannon about his comments on the podcast, which it said \u201cpromoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories\u201d and were available on both Cannon\u2019s YouTube channel and Spotify.  \u201cWhile we support ongoing education and dialogue in the fight against bigotry, we are deeply troubled that Nick has failed to acknowledge or apologize for perpetuating anti-Semitism, and we are terminating our relationship with him,\u201d ViacomCBS spokesman Justin Dini said in the statement.

The celebrity-laden ads aim to inject some humor and levity into the year\u2019s most-watched U.S. televised event after 11 months of social distancing and lockdowns.  Longtime advertisers Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s Budweiser and Coca-Cola are sitting out the match-up between Kansas City and Tampa Bay to fund COVID-19 vaccine efforts or save money.  Their absence makes room for a new roster of advertisers that have boomed as the world faces a third wave of the health crisis, marketing experts said.  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this many first-timers as a percentage of the advertisers,\u201d said Charles Taylor, a Villanova University professor of marketing.  Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B will join Wayne and Garth to sing a jingle and tell viewers to eat locally, kicking off a $20 million Uber Eats campaign to support independent restaurants.  Logitech, maker of computer keyboards and webcams which consumers rushed to buy as they worked from home, recruited rapper Lil Nas X to appear in a spot reflecting how artists have used technology \u201cto create the future,\u201d set to his newest song.  Some upstart brands found ways to poke fun at rivals while touting their business model as safer during the pandemic.  In a commercial for Vroom, a man sits strapped to an interrogation chair as he attempts to buy a car from a traditional dealership. The online used-car marketplace will tout its home delivery service and contact-less buying process.  Despite the pause by perennial advertisers, ViacomCBS\u2019s CBS broadcast network last week said it had sold out commercial time for the game. A 30-second ad sold for about $5.5 million this year, about the same as last year, said a person familiar with the matter.  \u201cWith bigger names pulling out, it gives us a chance to break through even more than we expected,\u201d said Peter Scherr, chief marketing officer at Vroom.  A FINE LINE  While Super Bowl advertisers usually go for laughs or tug at viewers\u2019 heartstrings, brands are skating a fine line to avoid insensitive humor - no gerbil shot from a cannon this year - or further depress sports fans after an emotionally draining 2020, ad experts said.  Humorous ads are more likely to be uplifting, rather than \u201cknee-slapping sophomore humor,\u201d said Leeann Leahy, chief executive of VIA Agency, which has worked on past Super Bowl spots for Johnson & Johnson and Lowe\u2019s.  Uber Eats competitor DoorDash will air its first game day commercial featuring actor and rapper Daveed Diggs alongside Big Bird and other Sesame Street stars, drawing inspiration from the children\u2019s show\u2019s focus on the impact of neighbors and local businesses on people\u2019s lives the last year, said Kofi Amoo-Gottfried, vice president of marketing at DoorDash.  And although Budweiser will sit out the game for the first time in over 35 years, the brand\u2019s owner, brewing conglomerate Anheuser-Busch, will air an ad for the first time at the Super Bowl reflecting its optimism for the end of the pandemic as vaccines roll out.

REUTERS\/Kevork Djansezian  Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Delaware Chancery Court ruled four weeks after allowing former Viacom shareholders to pursue similar claims.  In a 157-page decision, Slights said it was reasonable to infer that the merger process was not fair and CBS \u201csubstantially\u201d overpaid for Viacom.  Redstone\u2019s National Amusements Inc had controlled about 80% of the voting power of both Viacom and CBS, despite owning only about 10% of the respective shares.  Slights said the plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201callow a reasonable inference that CBS\u2019s acquisition of Viacom was motivated not only by Ms. Redstone\u2019s concerns about Viacom\u2019s viability as a going concern, but also her desire to shop NAI following their consolidation.\u201d  He said the evidence suggested that CBS directors might have approved the merger to \u201cappease\u201d Redstone, who had a \u201cdogged determination to make this deal happen one way or the other.\u201d  Lawyers for Redstone, the former CBS directors and the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Redstone is non-executive chairman of New York-based ViacomCBS, whose businesses include CBS television, CBS News, Showtime, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon and the Paramount movie studio.  The merger followed unsuccessful merger attempts in 2016 and 2018. Sumner Redstone had split the companies at the beginning of 2006. He died in August at age 97.

Coker\u2019s promotion recently announced broadcast deals with Showtime in the U.S. and the BBC\u2019s iPlayer streaming service in the United Kingdom, and he said his organisation would welcome the extension of the Ali Act, named after Muhammad Ali and designed to protect the rights and welfare of boxers, to MMA.  \u201cBoxing has had it for decades, and if the government moves towards that in MMA, we\u2019ll embrace it. We\u2019re not going to fight it, and it might be the best thing for everybody,\u201d the 58-year-old Coker said in a telephone interview.  \u201cTo be honest, it puts everybody on an equal playing field, us included... I think it might be a blessing in disguise.\u201d  The Ali Act was originally enacted in May 2000 to protect the rights and welfare of boxers, to aid state boxing commissions with the oversight of boxing and to address issues of sportsmanship and integrity in the industry.  One major issue for MMA is that the Ali Act bans promoters from having a \u2018direct or indirect\u2019 financial interest in a fighter. MMA fighters usually sign exclusive contracts with promotions and are not allowed to negotiate freely with others.  The application of the act to MMA could also see a system of external rankings and mandatory title challengers imposed.  In 2016 a bill was introduced by Congressman and former fighter Markwayne Mullin to extend the Ali Act to MMA, and the recent change in government in the United States has re-ignited talk in the sport that more regulation may be on the way.  The UFC, the biggest promotion in MMA, has previously told Reuters it would oppose such a move as it would affect their ability to match-make freely, but Coker and Bellator take a different view.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a \u2018fighters first\u2019 organisation, and if they (fighters) want to go this route and the government wants to go this route, then we\u2019ll do it, we\u2019ll abide by it. We\u2019ll make some adjustments and it\u2019s business as usual, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said.  Bellator staged 18 events, including an undercard from Paris broadcast on iPlayer, in a 2020 calendar severely curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Viacom-owned promotion has safety measures in place as it ramps up its activity again.  \u201cWe are still under the guidelines of the Viacom protocol committee, we are governed just like Paramount Pictures,\u201d Coker said. \u201cLet\u2019s say they\u2019re doing a movie or a TV production, we are in the middle of that as well because we have to abide by their protocols.  \u201cOn a fight week I\u2019m normally out and about, now I\u2019m in my hotel room 80 percent of the time, but if that\u2019s what it takes to continue to do fights and to provide content for Showtime and broadcast partners and, most importantly, for the fighters... we\u2019re going to stay in our bubble.\u201d  With major TV deals secured in the U.S., U.K. and Russia, Bellator are now turning their attention to other markets.  \u201cIn most parts of the world, you will be able to see Bellator live before April 2,\u201d Coker said.","168":"LOS ANGELES, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Television viewership for Wednesday\u2019s debate between U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris rose slightly from four years ago, according to early ratings data reported by Hollywood publication Variety.

Tech and tech-related heavyweight stocks such as Apple and Facebook helped pace gains on the indexes.

Economic data released on Thursday painted a mixed picture as U.S. Labor Department numbers showed a first fall in jobless claims in three weeks, although a separate report showed a 54% surge in job cuts announced by employers in July. The data comes ahead of the government payrolls report on Friday.  Investors are looking to the next fiscal aid package to further cope with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday Republicans and Democrats remained far apart over what to include in another wave of relief.

Ahead of the deadline for a new stimulus package, the focus now shifts to July jobs report Friday morning, with analysts forecasting a rise of 1.58 million new jobs last month and a decline in the unemployment rate to 10.5%.  As major averages continue to rally off their March lows, powered by heaps of fiscal and monetary stimulus and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings, the Dow and S&P notched their fifth straight daily gain, with the Nasdaq climbing for a seventh consecutive session.  The corporate results season is now in its final stretch, with about 424 S&P 500 firms having reported so far. Earnings have been about 22.5% above analyst expectations, according to IBES Refinitiv data, the highest on record since 1994.  Communication services and technology were the best performing of the 11 major S&P sectors on the day.

With companies widely expected to slash marketing budgets, the ad industry could see nearly $26 billion in lost revenue, or a 10.6% decline, Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, estimated in a research note on Thursday.  The coronavirus effect on live sports, one of the last remaining categories that continues to attract large audiences and therefore advertisers to traditional television, could \u201caccelerate a meltdown\u201d for TV advertising, said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at Lightshed Partners.  Ad revenue losses will likely be seen first in the digital market dominated by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc because the spending is more easily adjusted, followed by traditional media like TV, according to Nathanson.  The National Basketball Association said Wednesday it was suspending the current season after a player was diagnosed with coronavirus, and the National Hockey League said it was \u201cevaluating the options\u201d and expected to have further updates on Thursday about its season, which begins in September.  The PGA began its Players Championship golf tournament on Thursday as usual, but said it would continue to review the situation and give an update later in the day.  \u201cThis is an unprecedented situation that media networks have not planned for,\u201d Greenfield said.  Most of the NBA season has been played, and what happens to the playoffs will be the question for AT&T Inc\u2019s TNT network and Walt Disney Co\u2019s ABC and ESPN networks, which hold broadcast rights for NBA games. Comcast Corp\u2019s NBC Sports airs NHL games.  Broadcast rights holders will likely still have to pay their fees to the NBA even if games do not air, and even though the NBA is required to compensate the networks for any lost advertising revenue and fees, those calculations will be complicated, Greenfield said.  The National Collegiate Athletic Association said Wednesday its March Madness basketball tournaments, which begin next week and will air on ViacomCBS Inc\u2019s CBS and AT&T\u2019s Turner networks, will be played without spectators.  The blow to the ad industry is not restricted to the United States, and China\u2019s advertising industry has been hit hard by the epidemic. According to a survey Chinese industry magazine Modern Advertising conducted with 112 advertising companies, 95% of respondents said their first quarter revenue would drop, and of those who said so, 53% described it as a severe decline or devastating blow.  Some analysts, however, believe the impact could be short-lived. \u201cWhile we expect an epidemic in the US will cause contraction in advertising revenues, we expect it to normalize after the threat passes.\u201d wrote Moody\u2019s Senior Vice President Neil Begley in a report Wednesday, prior to the NBA announcement.  Although the extent and length of the virus\u2019s impact is hard to predict, Moody\u2019s forecast assumes economic activity will bounce back in the second half of the year if the spread of the virus in the Northern Hemisphere subsides in warmer weather and efforts to slow the virus globally succeed.  Nathanson did not put a specific time frame around his forecast for a nearly $26 billion decline in ad industry revenues.","177":"LOS ANGELES, March 18 (Reuters) - First lady Melania Trump will urge Americans to wash their hands and keep their distance from one another to fight coronavirus in a new TV ad campaign produced with major U.S. broadcast networks, the White House said on Wednesday.  ABC, CBS, NBC and other networks will air the public service announcements, which will also include other Trump administration officials and \u201ccommunicate the most important ways Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk,\u201d the White House said in a statement.  Nickleodon will create a separate campaign for children.  The air time will be donated by media networks, the White House said.  Trump, a former fashion model, has avoided the public arena more than many first ladies. Her signature initiative has been a campaign called Be Best, which focuses on the safety and well-being of children.  All the ads will direct audiences to coronavirus.gov, a website containing the latest information about the outbreak.  The announcement comes as the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 rose to at least 146, with the number of infections closing in on 8,000 as millions of Americans stayed home instead going to work or school and President Donald Trump said hospital ships would be deployed to make up for an anticipated shortage of hospital beds.

These are just a few examples of how companies that entertain or sell products for kids are adjusting their messages, as they attempt to deal with this moment in American history and explain the complexities of racism and police brutality to children through action and words.  \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to try to preserve the innocence of children, but you shouldn\u2019t preserve the ignorance of children in a country that is multiracial that has this bad history,\u201d CNN commentator Van Jones told Reuters in an interview on Friday.  Jones and CNN anchor Erica Hill hosted the hour-long special on CNN titled \u201cComing Together: Standing Up to Racism\u201d in partnership with \u201cSesame Street.\u201d The show aimed to teach school-aged children how to identify inequality and speak out against it.  CNN is owned by telecommunications company AT&T Inc, whose chief executive, Randall Stephenson, urged other CEOs in a CNBC interview to speak out against racial inequality.  Experts said parents need help interpreting for children the relentless barrage of messages on social media and on television as peaceful protesters and looters clash with authorities all across the country.  \u201cI have seen a spike in anxiety for my black kid clients because they are having access to the news,\u201d said Javonte\u2019 Bass, a clinical mental health counselor. \u201cWhen the parents are watching, they\u2019re listening.\u201d  Fear of catching the coronavirus forced families indoors. Fear of dying at the hands of police is keeping kids from going back out, Bass said. One 9-year-old black child even asked Bass, \u201cAm I going to get shot, too?\u201d  Jones said the CNN event was not meant to be a historical rundown of slavery and colonialism in the United States. It urged parents to teach their children empathy. \u201cFailing to teach kids about empathy and fairness is always harmful,\u201d he said.  That applies to views of law enforcement as well, Jones and Bass emphasized. \u201cPolice officers are not saints or superheroes. They\u2019re human beings,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSome are good. Most are good, but some are bad.\u201d  Education is a theme among the responses from brands for children.  \u201cOur mission is to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow and that includes inspiring them to be tolerant, inclusive, and kind,\u201d toy company the Lego Group said in a statement.  In addition to pausing advertising for a week to avoid marketing any of its toys, including police-themed toys, next to images of police violence, the company is committing $4 million to organizations that teach children about racial inequality.  Lego has also encouraged fans to come up with new ideas for inclusive toy sets on its platform Lego Ideas.  One of its previous sets, the Women of NASA, featured astronaut Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space. It was inspired by a submission to Lego Ideas.  MGA Entertainment Inc, which owns toy brands such as L.O.L. Dolls and Little Tikes, announced it is releasing a limited edition Black Lives Matter Bratz Dolls. The company will donate $10 from each doll sold to anti-racism programs and organizations.","179":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - Youth television channel MTV and other stablemate channels said they will go dark around the world on Monday to mark the death in police custody of George Floyd, joining other U.S. entertainment outlets in condemning racial inequality.  MTV will be joined by its other ViacomCBS youth and music channels, including Comedy Central, CMT, and VH1, at 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT) in an eight minute, 46 second blackout - the length of time they said that a white Minneapolis police officer last week knelt on the neck of Floyd, a black man.  Floyd\u2019s death has prompted mass protests in cities around the United States decrying the treatment of black Americans, polarizing the country politically and racially.  \u201cWe are seeing the tragic impact of discrimination affect our community in a myriad of ways \u2013 including the disproportionate number of people of color who have been impacted by COVID-19 \u2013 another life or death fight for our breath,\u201d Chris McCarthy, president of entertainment and youth brands at ViacomCBS domestic networks, said in an internal note to staff that was seen by Reuters.  The TV networks will also provide a call to action encouraging audiences to link up with racial justice organization Color of Change.  The move by MTV follows calls by leading record labels to suspend business, delay new music releases, and pledge support for racial justice organizations in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death.  Warner Music Group, Universal Music, Sony Music and other record labels have issued pledges and support for the \u2018Black Out Tuesday\u2019 initiative.  Multiple musicians, including Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Jay-Z have spoken out in response to the death and subsequent demonstrations, some of which have turned violent.  \u201cWe\u2019re broken and we\u2019re disgusted...

In this year\u2019s contest between Republican U.S. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat, TV networks are facing heightened pressure to report election results accurately and without unwarranted speculation.  Among the challenges facing the nation - and the networks - are a president stoking fears of ballot fraud, a deeply divided electorate and the specter of a prolonged vote count, which raises the potential for protests, violence and lawsuits.  This will be the first presidential election in which the major TV networks will get data from different providers, raising the potential for divergent perspectives on election night returns.  Fox Corp\u2019s Fox News and the Associated Press are no longer using traditional in-person exit polls, instead relying on online and telephone surveys that aim to reach early and Election Day voters. The news organizations will combine that survey data with real-time results tabulated by the AP to help make projections.  The three broadcast news networks and AT&T-owned CNN are part of the National Election Pool consortium, which will rely on the firm Edison Research for exit polls and results as they come in from each precinct. Reuters has a distribution deal with the NEP for 2020 election data.  Networks will be showcasing their investments in more polling, deeper data analysis, and additional reporting on the mechanics of voting, voting integrity and misinformation.  ViacomCBS Inc.-owned CBS News will broadcast its Election Night coverage from Times Square for the first time, with primetime coverage beginning at 7:00 p.m. EST. The network will use four high-resolution LED video walls to display real-time data, maps, results and video feeds from around the country.  CNN will begin its coverage at 4:00 p.m. EST on Tuesday, with correspondent John King reporting live from the network\u2019s \u201cMagic Wall,\u201d along with political director David Chalian, who will cover exit polls.  Comcast Corp-owned NBC News\u2019 coverage will begin at 7:00 p.m. EST, lasting until at least 4 a.m., and as long as the race continues. The network will rely on more than 100 NBC News journalists for its coverage. Its \u201cDecision Desk\u201d will make projections when there is 99.5 percent statistical confidence in the result.  Walt Disney Co\u2019s ABC News will begin its primetime coverage at 7 p.m. EST, with anchor George Stephanopoulos leading coverage from New York.  Fox News is airing an eight-hour-long live special \u201cFox News Democracy 2020: Election Coverage,\u201d beginning at 6 p.m. EST; additional coverage will continue until 9 a.m. (Reporting by Helen Coster in New York; Editing by Aurora Ellis)","181":"(Reuters) - As news broke of more cases of coronavirus spreading across the United States, T-Mobile had a novel response to the threat: fewer hugs, kisses or high-fives.

Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google on Monday scrapped its biggest conference for cloud computing customers, scheduled for next month in San Francisco, following the cancellation last Friday of two other events.  Facebook last week shelved its annual developer conference and has also restricted travel to China, South Korea and Italy.  The Menlo Park, Calif. social media giant went one step further and discouraged all gatherings of more than 50 attendees. Job candidates shouldn\u2019t bother showing up at the office. Interviews are being rescheduled as video conferences where possible, according to one source familiar with the plans.  In addition to banning travel to and from Asia and Italy, Home Depot also implemented a 14-day stay-at-home policy for employees who have returned from those regions within the past two weeks.  On Wall Street, at least two major banks are testing technologies and compliance systems in preparation for employees who may be asked to work from home or off-site locations in coming weeks.  In Hollywood, the coronavirus threat has already affected how films are being made and who gets to see them. Movie producers are being forced to delay film releases in China and parts of Italy where movie theaters are closed, and are looking at relocating movie shoots in areas with high numbers of coronavirus cases.  ViacomCBS Inc's VIACA.O Paramount Pictures postponed a three-week-long shoot in Italy for Tom Cruise's next \"Mission Impossible\" film. And Walt Disney Co DIS.N executives are waiting to see when theaters will reopen in China so they can release \"Mulan,\" an action epic about a Chinese heroine that is scheduled to hit other countries on March 27 and was expected to be the entertainment giant's first billion-dollar box office hit of the year.","182":"FILE PHOTO: An image of Tom Cruise from the movie \"Top Gun\" is reflected in a window as people arrive at the Museum of the Moving Image Salute to Tom Cruise in New York November 6, 2007.
