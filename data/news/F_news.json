Mich. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump traveled on Thursday to the crucial U.S. election battleground state of Michigan to visit a Ford Motor Co F.N plant amid tensions with its Democratic governor during the coronavirus pandemic, opting not to wear a protective face mask for the cameras.  Trump toured the Ford plant, which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment, and held a roundtable discussion with African-American leaders concerning vulnerable populations hit by the virus.  Trump, who has said he is taking a drug not proven effective for the coronavirus after two White House staffers tested positive, did not wear a mask during any of his public events at the plant in the city of Ypsilanti even though Ford on Tuesday reiterated its policy that all visitors must wear them.  Trump has consistently disregarded guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging people to wear masks in close company to try to curb the spread of the virus.  Surrounded by Ford executives wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras.  \u201cI had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,\u201d Trump said.  When asked if Trump was told it was acceptable not to wear a mask in the plant, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to him.\u201d  The company later said in a statement that the chairman had \u201cencouraged\u201d Trump to wear a mask when he arrived, adding that the President had obliged during a private viewing of three two-seater Ford GT sports cars.  In an interview cnn.it\/2ZrT3Os with CNN, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said there would be a \"very serious conversation\" with Ford for permitting the President to violate state governor Gretchen Whitmer's executive order on masks.  Slideshow ( 20 images )  The order specifies any person who is medically able must wear a mask in enclosed public spaces.  \u201cThey knew exactly what the order was and if they permitted anyone, even the President of the United States, to defy that order, I think it has serious health consequences potentially to their workers,\u201d Nessel, a Democrat, said.  Trump told Nessel on Twitter she shouldn\u2019t be taking her anger out on Ford.  \u201cNot their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!\u201d  Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has urged states to loosen coronavirus restrictions so the battered U.S. economy can recover, even as public health experts warn premature easing of restrictions could spark a second wave of infections.  Whitmer, seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, is facing a backlash from critics in a state hit hard by the last recession. Trump has encouraged anti-lockdown protests against Whitmer in the state.  Whitmer, whose state has been hit by devastating floods, on Thursday moved to further reopen Michigan\u2019s economy through a series of executive orders.  Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold federal funding from Michigan over its plan for expanded mail-in voting, saying without offering evidence that the practice could lead to voter fraud - though he later appeared to back off the threat.  Slideshow ( 20 images )  On Thursday he pledged federal support to help with the dam breaks.  Whitmer spoke with Trump on Wednesday.  \u201cI made the case that, you know, we all have to be on the same page here. We\u2019ve got to stop demonizing one another and really focus on the fact that the common enemy is the virus,\u201d Whitmer told CBS News.  Whitmer added, \u201cThreatening to take money away from a state that is hurting as bad as we are right now is just scary.\u201d  Trump won in Michigan in the 2016 election, the first Republican to do so since 1988.","1":"FILE PHOTO: Ford logo is pictured at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 10, 2019.

The project is part of a 65-million-pound ($80.87 million) investment in 5G backed by the UK government, according to Ford and Vodafone, and would be among the first of its kind in Britain.  The private 5G network at Ford\u2019s facility will replace older Wi-Fi networks and help speed up the production of EV components, according to the companies.  \u201cFor a single EV product, this could generate more than a half a million pieces of data every minute\u201d, the statement said, adding that the upgrade will provide faster and more accurate manufacturing control and analysis.  Earlier this week, Toyota Production Engineering Corporation selected Finland\u2019s Nokia Oyj to install an industrial-grade 5G private wireless network at its manufacturing design center in Fukuoka, Japan.","2":"FILE PHOTO: Ford logo is pictured at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co\u2019s decision to close three plants in Brazil will cut its losses and allow it to focus on boosting profitability in its underperforming international segment, J.P. Morgan analysts said on Tuesday.  The United States\u2019 No. 2 automaker on Monday said it would take pretax charges of about $4.1 billion to close the Brazilian plants, under used for a while due to pandemic-related restrictions, affecting 5,000 jobs.  Shares of the company gained 3% following the announcement on Monday afternoon and were roughly steady in premarket trading on Tuesday at $9.31.  Ford said the move was part of a previously announced $11 billion global restructuring, of which it has already taken a charge of $4.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020. It expects to book another $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and about $1.6 billion in 2021.  J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a note the move came at a time when investors had been complaining of the absence of a path to profitability for the South American businesses.  \u201cWe expect the move to quickly reduce losses in its South American operations, for which we now model a breakeven result in 2020 compared with a loss of $300 million prior.\u201d  The brokerage raised its price target for Ford\u2019s stock by 10% to $11.  Credit Suisse analysts also said the plant closures supported Ford\u2019s road to improved margins and that a reduced footprint made sense.","3":"LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Ford will restart output at its two British engine factories from May 18 which means all of the U.S. carmaker\u2019s European manufacturing sites will be in operation next week, after shutdowns due to the coronavirus outbreak.  Ford built nearly 1.1 million engines last year at two British sites, Dagenham in east London and Bridgend in south Wales, which are then shipped to a number of other factories in countries such as Turkey and Germany to be fitted into vehicles.  Anyone entering a Ford facility will need to wear a company-provided face mask and have their body temperature checked with work areas having been redesigned to make sure social distancing rules can be adhered to.  \u201cOur key priority is the implementation of Ford\u2019s global standards on social distancing and strengthened health and safety protocols to safeguard the well-being of our workforce,\u201d said Ford of Britain\u2019s chairman Graham Hoare.  Ford\u2019s Valencia engine plant in Spain will also resume output next week.","4":"(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Friday raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors to shore up its cash reserves as the coronavirus outbreak pummeled vehicle sales and production, resulting in an estimated loss of about $2 billion for the first quarter.  FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: The front grill logo of a Ford pickup truck is seen in this photo taken in Carlsbad, California November 5, 2014 REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company, which lost its investment-grade status in March, raised new funds with a three-part debt offering, according to a regulatory filing.  Investors said Ford benefited from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s move last week to backstop debt offerings by companies that lost investment-grade credit ratings after the COVID-19 crisis accelerated in the United States, International Financing Review reported on Friday.  \u201cToday\u2019s deal is a good sign of the growing confidence around the improving market backdrop with respect to liquidity as well as more promising views around the economic outlook,\u201d said Dan Mead, head of investment grade syndicate at Bank of America Securities, which was one of the lead banks on the Ford deal.  In an environment where interest rates on cash savings are close to zero, Ford will pay investors interest of between 8.50% and 9.625% on the new debt securities.  There was around $40 billion worth of demand from investors across the three debt packages, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Ford had earlier drawn down over $15 billion from revolving credit lines to ride out the pandemic, which forced the shutdown of its North American and European factories during the past month.  Separately, General Motors Co GM.N disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement of $1.95 billion. The automaker said it has allocated the credit line for exclusive use by its financial services business. (bit.ly\/3ezBDoy)  Ford on Friday said it had to put up additional guarantees for earlier loans - not the notes sold Friday - because it has not maintained an investment-grade status. It has suspended its dividend for the quarter.  Stanching the cash drain and restarting profitable operations in Europe and North America will be critical for Ford in the months ahead. The company told investors ahead of Friday\u2019s bond deal that absent new funding and a restart of production, it had cash to last to the end of the third quarter.  Now, Ford has more breathing room financially, and federal and state officials this week said they expect coronavirus lockdowns to begin easing, possibly allowing auto plants to begin building vehicles again early next month.  Still, the company has taken a body blow from the pandemic at a time when it was already wrestling with a difficult restructuring effort begun more than two years ago. Ford\u2019s vehicle sales to dealers fell 21% in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier.  Only Ford\u2019s joint ventures in China, where the pandemic has been receding, are currently producing vehicles, and dealers there have resumed work.  Separately, Ford warned that its production of high-priced versions of pickups and sport utility vehicles could be hurt due to the damage caused by a tornado earlier this week at parts supplier BorgWarner's BWA.N South Carolina factory.  BorgWarner\u2019s facility makes transfer cases for some of Ford\u2019s most profitable vehicles, such as four wheel-drive large F-series pickups and large sport utility vehicles.

The U.S. automaker previously said it would begin transporting people and goods in automated vehicles in Miami and Washington.  Ford's self-driving system, now being tested in Fusion Hybrid sedans, is being jointly developed with Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup in which Ford and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE together hold a majority stake.  Sherif Marakby, chief executive of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, said Ford plans to launch the commercial transportation service in 2021 in a purpose-built hybrid vehicle that can be equipped to carry either people or goods.  Peter Rander, president of Argo AI, said development teams soon will be manually driving the Fusion test vehicles in Austin, mapping the city streets and assessing driver and pedestrian behaviors ahead of the commercial launch.  Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo last year introduced an automated ride service with human attendants in Phoenix, using specially outfitted Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans it buys from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI.  General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise Automation said in July it planned to delay commercial deployment of automated vehicles in San Francisco beyond its initial target of 2019 because more testing was required.","7":"FILE PHOTO: Ford Motor Co. displays a 2021 Ford F-150 pickup truck at the Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S. September 17, 2020.

The catch is, only the system hardware will be installed. The software will not be ready for nearly another year, Ford said.  The automaker\u2019s Active Drive Assist will be offered first on the redesigned F-150 pickup and the new Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, both of which go on sale later this year. However, the feature will not be activated until the third quarter of 2021, the company said.  Customers can order a Mach-E or an F-150 with the Co-Pilot360 advanced driver assistance package, which includes the hardware for Active Drive Assist. That feature will be switched on via a wireless over-the-air update when the software is finalized next year, Ford said.  Active Drive Assist will be standard on selected high-end models and available as an option on others, priced from around $1,500.  Consumer Reports earlier this week released results of its test of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems, including a Tesla TSLA.O Model Y -- a head-to-head competitor to the Mustang Mach-E -- with Autopilot. The Model Y finished \"a distant second\" in the testing to a Cadillac CT6 fitted with General Motors Co's GM.N Super Cruise system.","8":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N new chief executive, Jim Farley, on Thursday promised the U.S. automaker would move with urgency, responding to investor and analyst criticism of the speed at which his predecessor acted.

He was officially tapped to succeed Jim Hackett in August.  \u201cDuring the past three years, under Jim Hackett\u2019s leadership, we have made meaningful progress and opened the door to becoming a vibrant, profitably growing company,\u201d Farley said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to charge through that door.\u201d  Hackett and Ford have been criticized by some on Wall Street for not moving quickly enough on its restructuring. At the end of the second quarter, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company had incurred only $3.9 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges.  Farley will face immediate tests in his new role, including ensuring a smooth launch for the highly profitable, top-selling F-150 pickup truck to avoid the costly missteps Ford experienced when it revamped the Ford Explorer SUV.  Ford on Thursday reaffirmed its goal for operating margins of 8%, something it identified as a 2020 target before the coronavirus pandemic hit. It did not specify when it would achieve this target.  Ford\u2019s operating margin was 4.1% last year, before falling to negative 4.8% in the first half of 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The company also said John Lawler would succeed Tim Stone as CFO. Lawler most recently had been head of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and vice president of mobility partnerships. He also served as president of Ford China for nearly four years.  Stone, who will remain with Ford through Oct. 15, accepted a job as COO and CFO with ASAPP Inc, an artificial-intelligence software company. Stone had been in the CFO job only since June 2019.  Ford also said it would separate the Lincoln and marketing jobs to put greater focus on both. Joy Falotico, who had held both the Lincoln and global marketing jobs, will focus on Lincoln once a chief marketing officer is named, in a move meant to accelerate the brand\u2019s growth.  Farley outlined his objectives during a virtual town hall meeting with Ford\u2019s global team on Thursday, saying the company will allocate capital to its strongest franchises and high-growth opportunities, such as the F-Series pickup truck and its commercial business.  It also will add more affordable vehicles to its global lineup, build electric vehicles at scale and stand up new autonomous-enabled businesses, he said. Decision making will be pushed down to the regional level.  Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy welcomed Farley\u2019s urgency and Lawler\u2019s ascension, and said investors will expect increased disclosure under the new management team.  Ford has moved to cut costs globally, including earlier this month when it said it would target cutting 1,400 U.S. salaried jobs by year end.  Last year, Ford cut 7,000 salaried jobs globally, as well as targeting 12,000 additional layoffs and plant closures in Europe. It also restructured operations in China and South America.  The automaker previously said it expects a full-year loss because of the pandemic\u2019s impact. It sees a pre-tax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter, and a loss in the fourth quarter as it launches several new vehicles.","9":"DETROIT, March 30 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Monday it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with General Electric\u2019s healthcare unit, and can then build 30,000 per month as needed to treat patients afflicted with the coronavirus.

FILE PHOTO: People walk by a Ford Escape SUV displayed during the media day for the Shanghai auto show in Shanghai, China April 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  On the face of it, the plan announced by Ford in June last year to combine sales channels for vehicles manufactured with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and Jiangling Motors Group made sense. It would promote operational efficiency at its loss-making China operations and is standard practice in most other markets.  But it ignored realities on the ground. Chinese automakers, often in 50-50 partnerships with foreign car makers, are reluctant to lose control over sales decisions, rarely willing to trust each other and loyal to local provinces that are fiercely competitive in their quest for economic growth and tax revenues from vehicle sales.  \u201cI would say there was a lack of deep understanding on how relationships work in China,\u201d Anning Chen, who in October took over as Ford\u2019s third China chief in two years, said in an interview in Shanghai.  It is the first time that Ford, grappling with a host of problems in China that present no quick fix, has disclosed the dropping of the plan - a decision also prompted by a sharp slowdown in China\u2019s economic growth amid the trade war with the United States as well as deeper losses at dealerships.  Many major foreign automakers have 2 or 3 partners in China, involving different marketing and distribution strategies for each partner. Ford is the only one known to have tried combining sales channels for mainstream cars.  Other steps Ford is taking to turn around its China business include launching 30 new or significantly redesigned vehicles over the next three years, reductions in the number of temporary workers at plants, hiring more local Chinese, and putting profits before growth in market share.  Capacity cuts as Ford and its partners embark on \u201cright-sizing\u201d their plants are also likely, Chen said.  A recovery would help relieve pressure on the U.S. automaker which is also scrambling to end losses in Europe through plant closures and layoffs. It would also mitigate the risk that Ford ends up a marginal player in China - a market with annual sales of some 28 million vehicles that many foreign automakers now consider their most important.  SALES IMPLOSION  The slide in Ford\u2019s sales has been unprecedented for a major global automaker in China. After a peak of 1.08 million vehicles in 2016, sales began faltering in late 2017, then nearly halved last year to 504,488, according to consultancy IHS Markit.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  IHS forecasts Ford\u2019s sales will tumble further to 382,882 this year, while LMC Automotive predicts Ford\u2019s China market share will fall to 1.4% compared to 3.8% in 2016.  GRAPHIC: Ford's China sales collapse -  Ford has publicly pinned the blame on an aging model lineup but company officials familiar with the matter said the breakdown in relationships with its joint venture partners and dealers as well as missteps by previous management teams were the bigger factors at play.  For now, Ford\u2019s main goal in China is profitability, Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Automotive, told Reuters at the company\u2019s Dearborn, Michigan headquarters.  \u201cYou can be a profitable business in China with a relatively low market share because of...the size of the market,\u201d he said.  As signs of progress, Hinrichs pointed to dealer inventories at their lowest level in 18 months and a halving in first-half China losses before interest and tax to $283 million from the same period a year earlier.  \u201cThis is not a five-year journey,\u201d he said, but declined to be more specific when asked how soon Ford\u2019s China unit is expected to regain profitability.  Hinrichs, who became head of Ford\u2019s auto business in May, helmed its Asia Pacific business from 2009 to 2011 - a period of strong growth for the automaker in China.  Chen, a U.S. citizen who grew up in China and speaks fluent Mandarin, joined Ford in October from Chery Automobile Co. He is however, a Ford veteran, having worked for the firm for 17 years, mostly in Dearborn, prior to joining Chery.  TERRITORIAL ABOUT TERRITORY  Highlighting the uneasy relationship that the joint venture partners have with each other and with Ford has been unhappiness over a cross distribution arrangement for a small sport-utility vehicle, the Territory. It was developed with JMC and sold not only through JMC Ford\u2019s sales network but also through Changan Ford\u2019s.  The approach angered Changan, which wondered why it wasn\u2019t the development partner and which as a bigger state-owned company considers itself far higher in pecking order than a regional firm like JMC, Ford company officials said.  For its part, JMC was upset the product was shared with Changan, the officials added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.  Changan Ford, which makes the Ford EcoSport SUV, Focus small car and Mondeo sedan, did not respond to a request for comment. JMC, which builds the Territory and the Transit and Tourneo vans, declined to comment.  While Ford previously touted the arrangement as a success, Chen was more circumspect, saying similar agreements were unlikely as they can create inconsistencies in dealer services.  \u201cWe want to make sure distribution networks are directly facing different market segments and customers. We don\u2019t want to mix them up,\u201d he said.  Ford is also aiming to build more cars locally, which will improve relations with domestic partners and help fill its woefully underused assembly plants. Cars likely to be built in China include the redesigned Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs.  Ford used only 24% of its China production capacity to build 1.6 million vehicles in 2018, according to U.S. consultancy AlixPartners. Normally, rates of around 70% to 75% are considered the breakeven threshold. Ford declined to comment on its China capacity.  PSA Group, also struggling in China with a 26% capacity utilization rate in 2018 according to AlixPartners, is shutting one plant, selling another and cutting thousands of jobs.  Hinrichs said, however, that Ford doesn\u2019t feel a \u201chuge amount of pressure\u201d to shutter any of its five China plants given that they are already paid for.  Instead, by locally producing many of the upcoming new products, Ford will gain an opportunity to further adjust the installed capacity, he said.","14":"Penn State rushed for 248 yards and quarterback Sean Clifford tossed a touchdown pass Saturday afternoon for the Nittany Lions, who won the 900th game in program history with a 23-7 victory over host Rutgers in a Big Ten game at Piscataway, N.J.

In the third quarter, sales of the automaker\u2019s mass-market Ford brand fell 37.7%, while its luxury division Lincoln saw sales drop by 24.1%. It delivered around 421,000 vehicles in the first nine months of the year, according to Reuters calculations.  Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017.  The automaker plans to launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which more than a third will be electric vehicles. It also said it would localize management teams by hiring more Chinese staff and aimed to improve relationships with joint venture partners.  Ford has launched a series of new models in the third quarter in China, including Focus, sport-utility vehicle models Edge, and electric Territory.  In China, Ford makes cars through its joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd 000625.SZ and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) 000550.SZ. It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd 000980.SZ to sell lower priced cars, but there seems to have not been little progress.  In a series of moves, Ford named a new president for its main local venture, Changan Ford, in August and said it would enhance its partnership with Changan through research, production and marketing cooperation in September.  Ford is also planning to revamp some of its existing manufacturing facilities with Changan to localize production of its premium brand Lincoln.

The disappointing financial results are a setback for Hackett, the former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase, who took over Ford in May 2017 after the abrupt ouster of Ford veteran Mark Fields.  For two years, Hackett has been asking investors to be patient with a methodical restructuring that has made progress, including a wide-ranging alliance on electric vehicles with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and the sale of money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra MAHN.NS.  But by Ford\u2019s own reckoning, most of the restructuring work has yet to be done. It has booked only $3.3 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring, up from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.  The company also suffered a bumpy introduction of the redesigned Ford Explorer and all-new Lincoln Aviator in the quarter, said Joe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s president of automotive.  \u201cWe were disappointed in the overall performance,\u201d he told analysts, referring to the uneven vehicle launch and production ramp-up at an aging Chicago assembly plant.  \u201cWe took on too much,\u201d said Hinrichs, citing the difficulty of launching the Explorer and Aviator simultaneously while it was breaking in a new assembly line at the 95-year-old Chicago plant. \u201cWe have plenty of inventory now at dealers,\u201d he added.  The third quarter included $1.5 billion in costs for the company\u2019s global restructuring, $800 million of which was related to the formation of a joint venture in India with Mahindra.  Ford\u2019s ongoing restructuring includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets like China and Europe.  The No. 2 U.S. automaker still faces the prospect of negotiating a new four-year labor agreement with the United Auto Workers following the union's more than month-long strike against General Motors Co GM.N, which cost GM about $2 billion according to analysts.  Ford reported a third-quarter net profit of $425 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $991 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time charges, Ford earned 34 cents a share, above the 26 cents analysts had expected according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to $37 billion, above the $33.98 billion expected.

Previously, the high end of its forecast had been $1.35. Analysts expect $1.26 a share.  Ford\u2019s third-quarter operating profit in North America was just over $2 billion. Its U.S. sales in the quarter fell 4.9%, but demand for lucrative pickups remained strong with an increase of almost 9%.

The company and its amici from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups are hoping that the Supreme Court uses the cases to establish that plaintiffs in personal injury suits cannot establish specific personal jurisdiction unless they can show that defendants\u2019 actions within the jurisdiction led directly to the claims in the case.  How big a deal would such a ruling be? Very big indeed, said trial lawyer Kyle Farrar of Kaster Lynch Farrar & Ball, who represents the plaintiff in one of the Ford cases the Supreme Court will hear. \u201cThese cases could fundamentally change products liability law in this country forever,\u201d Farrar said.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  It\u2019s easier to understand Ford\u2019s arguments when you know the particulars. Back in 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Daimler AG v. Baumann that defendants\u2019 due process rights restricted the general jurisdiction of U.S. courts against foreign corporations. The justices concluded that plaintiffs could not establish California's general jurisdiction over Daimler simply because the corporation conducted business in the state. The Daimler court expressly distinguished between general and specific jurisdiction, but Ford\u2019s lawyers at Hogan Lovells came up with the theory that they could use Daimler to cast doubt on the premise that plaintiffs can establish specific jurisdiction by merely pointing to a defendant\u2019s business activities.  Ford\u2019s argument crystallized around suits involving used cars and trucks that were purchased in the secondary market. In the Supreme Court\u2019s 1980 ruling in World-Wide Volkswagen Corp v. Woodson the court held that defendants are subject to a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction if they have placed an allegedly defective product into the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d with the expectation that the product will be purchased by consumers in that forum. The court toughened the standard a bit in 1987\u2019s Asahi Metal v. Superior Court of California, demanding some additional showing that defendants intended to serve the forum\u2019s market. But Ford\u2019s lawyers, led by Hogan\u2019s Sean Marotta, argued that plaintiffs had to do still more under Daimler and the Supreme Court\u2019s 2017 decision restricting personal jurisdiction in Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Superior Court of California: To comply with defendants\u2019 due process rights, plaintiffs had to show that their allegations arose directly from Ford\u2019s conduct.  Yes, Ford said, the company markets its cars and has dealerships across the country. But if Ford didn\u2019t sell plaintiffs the cars or trucks at the heart of their claims, the company argued, then its conduct cannot not give rise to plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Ford can only be tagged with liability for designing, manufacturing and selling allegedly defective vehicles, the company contended. Plaintiffs can\u2019t rely on vague \u201cstream of commerce\u201d arguments, according to the company, to establish specific jurisdiction if they didn\u2019t buy their cars from Ford.  State supreme courts in both Minnesota, in Bandemer v. Ford, and Montana, in Ford v. Montana 8th Judicial District Court, rejected Ford\u2019s theory in 2019 decisions. The courts both found that Ford subjected itself to their jurisdiction by marketing to customers in their states, selling and repairing cars and trucks through dealerships in their states and otherwise providing services, such as driver assistance and recall notifications, to state residents who own Ford vehicles.  In Ford\u2019s petitions for certiorari in the Minnesota and Montana cases, Hogan Lovells emphasized a split in both state and federal courts over whether \u2013 and to what extent \u2013 a plaintiff must show, in order to establish specific jurisdiction, that the conduct of an out-of-state defendant caused the plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries. Some states, including Montana and Minnesota in their 2019 Ford rulings, have said plaintiffs need not show a causal link. But other state and federal courts have required plaintiffs to show a direct link between a defendant\u2019s conduct and a plaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries \u2013 some imposing a \u201cbut-for\u201d standard, some insisting on a more stringent proximate cause standard and still others not specifying what causation test they would apply.  \u201cThese different approaches give plaintiffs every reason to bring suit in the courthouse they believe will be more receptive to their claims,\u201d Ford argued. \u201cThat is particularly easy to do in products-liability suits like this one; a plaintiff\u2019s attorney will usually have no trouble finding an in-forum defendant who has had some contact with the product and whose joinder will destroy complete diversity.\u201d  The Chamber\u2019s amicus brief, written by Mayer Brown, echoed that theme, arguing that plaintiffs have learned to plead specific jurisdiction to engage in \u201crampant\u201d forum-shopping at the expense of defendants\u2019 due process rights. The no-causation approach of the Minnesota and Montana courts in the Ford cases, the brief said, \u201cmeans that companies that do business in a large number of states would have no ability to predict where, and to what extent, they might be haled into court. States would be newly empowered to regulate conduct that occurred entirely outside their borders \u2014 contrary to the principles of federalism that animate this court\u2019s personal jurisdiction precedents.\u201d  In opposition, Minnesota plaintiff Adam Bandemer, represented by Farrar of Kaster Lynch, and Montana plaintiff Charles Lucero, represented by Deepak Gupta of Gupta Wessler, argued that the state supreme courts had faithfully applied U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The opposition briefs pointed out that no state supreme court or federal appellate court has adopted Ford\u2019s view that plaintiffs can\u2019t establish specific jurisdiction without showing that their cars were designed, manufactured or originally sold in their chosen forum.  \u201cFord does not even attempt to ground its strict causation standard in the original meaning of the Due Process Clause or in any historical tradition,\u201d the Bandemer opposition brief said. \u201cAnd its rule likewise finds no justification in fairness or federalism, the two principles that have animated the Court\u2019s modern personal jurisdiction doctrine.\u201d  If the Supreme Court adopts Ford\u2019s standard, Farrar said, it will create high hurdles for products liability plaintiffs attempting to sue makers of component parts, who would be able to argue against specific jurisdiction because their parts were first sold to manufacturers, not to consumers. Farrar, who said that he\u2019s brought Gupta into his case for briefing on the merits, also predicted that if the justice agree with Ford, defendants will try to structure sales to restrict jurisdiction to favorable forums.  But Farrar said he\u2019s confident the Supreme Court will side with plaintiffs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put an end to this question,\u201d he said.","22":"(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Tuesday it was postponing its plan to restart production at its North America plants due to safety concerns for its workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.

But on Tuesday, Ford said that although it had been aiming to resume production at several key U.S. plants on April 14, it would now do so at dates to be announced later on.  \u201cThe health and safety of our workforce, dealers, customers, partners and communities remains our highest priority,\u201d Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford\u2019s North American operations, said in a statement.  Still, the automaker will open a plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, during the week of April 20, that will make ventilators to treat patients afflicted by the coronavirus.  Michigan, which is home to a large portion of the U.S. automotive industry, has also become a hot spot in the pandemic.

Ford didn\u2019t specify which changes triggered its move.  Last week, Ford said its China joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co would start making all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicles.  In a statement on Thursday, Ford said it would pursue a more \u201cflexible business model in China\u201d that would see it utilise its existing operations in the country and elsewhere, and build related business centres.  Zotye did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In 2017, during a visit by former U.S. President Donald Trump to China, Ford and Zotye said that they would invest a combined $756 million to set up a 50-50 joint venture in China to build small electric passenger vehicles.  A year later, the two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding for another venture that would make electric vehicles for ride-hailing fleets.

The government currently has 108,000 ventilators in its medical equipment stockpile, and 12,000 deployed at U.S. hospitals, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said Tuesday.  GM and medical equipment maker Ventec Life Systems are in the \u201chome stretch\u201d toward completing a contract to deliver 30,000 critical care ventilators by the end of August under a $489 million contract with the federal government, the automaker said.  GM and Ventec have already delivered more than 20,000 machines, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.  Ford has assembled about 47,000 of the 50,000 ventilators it agreed to supply to partner General Electric Co, Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said. GE has a $336 million contract with the government.  Ford and GM earlier this year said they would employ a total of as many as 1,500 people on ventilator assembly lines. Automakers likened the efforts to their switch from making cars to tanks and planes during the Second World War.  With North American car and truck factories back in operation, the Detroit automakers are winding down their forays into ventilator manufacturing, while continuing to make respiratory masks.  GM has said it plans to transfer the ventilator-making operations at a factory in Kokomo, Indiana, to its partner Ventec on Sept.1. Union-represented GM workers employed at the plant will return to the automaker, and temporary workers will remain with Ventec.  Ford has not said what the future will be for its ventilator facility.  The automakers\u2019 efforts to build ventilators and other medical equipment were launched in a politically charged atmosphere as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic swamped the U.S. economy and healthcare system. The shortage of ventilators became a symbol of the nation\u2019s struggle to respond.  U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on the automakers as part of a broader push to secure more than 130,000 ventilators by the end of 2020.  The automakers used the medical equipment assembly operations set up in the spring to test safety protocols they later used to reopen their vehicle-making operations.","44":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it will draw about $16 billion from its credit lines in a bid to beef up liquidity amid rising business impact from the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Roosevelt Cassio  The No.1 U.S. automaker, which also suspended its 2020 outlook, said it was evaluating its quarterly dividend, but has not yet decided to suspend it. As of the end of 2019, GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity, including $17.3 billion in cash.  Companies across the globe are tapping their credit lines to shore up liquidity and help them cover their costs amidst a crisis which has brought many elements of the global economy to a complete standstill.  \u201cWe are aggressively pursuing austerity measures to preserve cash and are taking necessary steps in this changing and uncertain environment to manage our liquidity,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said.  The pandemic has already hit other automakers as well and more are expected to cut their expectations.  Last week, rival Ford abandoned its 2020 forecast and said it drew down $15.4 billion from two credit facilities to bolster its balance sheet. Its more than $37 billion in cash now dwarfs its market capitalization of about $16 billion.  Analysts believe that corporate liquidity is paramount and the U.S. automakers have strong enough balance sheets to weather the outbreak\u2019s impact.  Both GM and Ford have seen U.S. employees test positive for the virus, leading them to shutdown their North American plants to prevent its spread among factory workers.  Meanwhile. U.S. new vehicle demand dropped 13% in the first 19 days of March, according to research firm J.D. Power, while brokerage Morgan Stanley expects auto sales to decline 9% this year, a first in many years.  Shares of both Ford and GM were up 7.5% to 11% in premarket trading.","45":"(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday said it expects a full-year loss but added it should have ample cash on hand throughout the rest of 2020, even if global demand falls further or the COVID-19 pandemic forces more shutdowns of vehicle assembly plants.  FILE PHOTO: The Ford logo is seen at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said that on July 27 it repaid $7.7 billion of an outstanding $15.4 billion on its revolving credit facilities, and extended $4.8 billion of its three-year revolving credit lines.  Ford's comments came as the company posted a quarterly profit thanks to an investment by Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in its self-driving Argo AI unit, more than offsetting a loss caused by a coronavirus-induced production shutdown.  The better-than-expected results and earnings outlook sent Ford\u2019s shares up 2.5% in after-market trading.  \u201cThe strong execution enabled us to deliver much better financial results than we expected just three months ago,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Hackett said on a conference call with analysts.  German automaker VW last month closed its $2.6 billion investment in Argo, which now is valued at $7.5 billion. Each automaker has a stake of about 40% in Argo.  Ford said it expects a pre-tax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion for the third quarter and a loss for the fourth quarter, which features three significant product launches delayed by the shutdown earlier this year.  In April, Ford warned that its second quarter loss would more than double to more than $5 billion due to the coronavirus outbreak.  Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said a focus on cost-cutting, a productive restart following a two-month shutdown, strong performance by the automaker\u2019s captive finance arm and a solid pricing environment for its vehicles had helped mitigate the anticipated loss.  \u201cWith Ford having passed the worst of COVID upheaval, we believe the focus now returns to the company\u2019s redesign efforts. While the product opportunity is bright with F-150 and Bronco, there is more work to be done on restructuring,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said in a research note, referring to the company\u2019s popular pickup truck and the new SUV it will offer later this year.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said operating charges for its global restructuring would total $700 million to $1.2 billion for the year, down from $3.2 billion last year. Stone told reporters Ford\u2019s redesign was \u201cabsolutely not stalled.\u201d  Ford also said it had more than 150,000 reservations for the new Bronco, which launches in the fourth quarter. That number was above internal expectations and Ford executives said they are working to increase production further, including possibly adding another shift at a plant.  Ford ended the quarter with nearly $40 billion in cash, and said it should be able to maintain or exceed its target cash balance of $20 billion for the rest of 2020, even if global auto demand falls or if COVID-19 forces another big wave of plant closures.  Ford reported net income in the second quarter of $1.1 billion, or 28 cents a share, compared with a profit of $100 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Ford posted a second-quarter operating loss of $1.9 billion, or 35 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.17 per share.","46":"DETROIT, May 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co briefly closed its Chicago assembly plant twice on Tuesday, after reopening following a two-month shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, as two employees tested positive for COVID-19, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  The plant, which builds the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, was operating again on Wednesday. A day earlier, it suspended operations twice for several hours - once when a worker went home sick, and then after a second worker received news they had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said.  The U.S. auto industry, including Ford, reopened many plants on Monday after a long shutdown due to the outbreak. To ensure safe operation amid the health crisis, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, and other automakers and suppliers imposed new safety measures, including screening employees who enter the building, mandating the use of face masks and face shields, and social distancing along the assembly line where possible.  The reopening of car plants will be a closely watched test of whether workers across a range of U.S. industries will be able to return to factories in large numbers without a resurgence of infections.  At Ford\u2019s Chicago plant, the brief work stoppages came during the first and second shifts, and both employees worked in a building separate from the main, larger plant, the spokeswoman said.  The entire plant had to be closed, however, as the building is used to build additional vehicles as well as to put parts in order for the larger plant before vehicles are assembled.  Felker noted that due to the incubation time for the virus, both employees contracted it outside the plant and that the company immediately took safety measures aimed at curbing the spread of the disease.  \u201cWhen two employees who returned to work this week tested positive for COVID-19, we immediately notified people known to have been in close contact with the infected individuals and asked them to self-quarantine for 14 days,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe also deep cleaned and disinfected the work area, equipment, team area and the path that the team member took.\u201d (Reporting by Ben Klayman; Editing by Bernadette Baum)","47":"March 24 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it was working with General Electric\u2019s healthcare unit and 3M Co to speed up production of ventilators for patients and respirators for healthcare workers during the coronavirus outbreak.

The company reported it sold 32,175 cars in 2019, up 31% from a year earlier.  The additional investment, which will bring the company\u2019s total investments in Vietnam to more than $200 million, will come in two stages over a two-year period starting this year.  Deputy Trade Minister Do Than Hai said he expected the expansion would reduce Vietnam\u2019s reliance on imported vehicles and therefore lower the country\u2019s trade deficit.  The construction will expand the facility across an additional 60,000 square meters of land, bringing the total area to 226,000 square meters.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Brouillette 70-15.  Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who stepped down on Sunday while at the center of Trump\u2019s impeachment probe in the U.S. House of Representatives for his role as one of the \u201cthree amigos\u201d who ran a side foreign policy in Ukraine, under Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Perry has said he did nothing wrong and his role in Ukraine centered on natural gas and coal.  Brouillette, 57, faced questions at his confirmation hearing last month from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden about his own involvement with Ukraine. He said his role was focused on how U.S. energy supplies could help the country find alternatives to fuel from Russia.  Wyden, who voted against Brouillette, asked what the rush was to confirm him, while questions linger about the role of Trump officials in Ukraine.  Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal-producing West Virginia, said ahead of the vote that Brouillette was \u201creally the right person (at the) right time for this job.\u201d  Brouillette, a member of Louisiana\u2019s Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016, is expected to firmly support Trump\u2019s policy of maximizing production of oil, natural gas and coal, offering them for sale abroad, and rolling back regulations.  Before being a Louisiana state energy regulator, Brouillette was an assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Energy Department under former President George W. Bush.  Brouillette said last month he backs technologies to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and burying the gas linked to climate change underground, because oil, gas and coal would provide a large portion of energy needs for 40 to 50 years.  \u201cWe have to get these technologies off the shelf and into the market,\u201d Brouillette said at his confirmation hearing.  He also supports nuclear power plants, but it is not clear how the Department of Energy can help reactors that are at risk of closing due to stiff competition from a glut of cheap natural gas and from falling costs for wind and solar power.","50":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Thursday it was teaming up with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Amazon.com AMZN.O to give its future electric car customers a range of charging options from highways to homes.

Ford\u2019s figures rounded off U.S. automakers\u2019 sales for 2019, with passenger cars falling out of favor with buyers amid lower oil prices and as automakers focused on SUVs and pick-ups that are more profitable.  Total U.S. light-vehicle sales fell by about 1% from 2018, but still finished above 17 million vehicles for the fifth consecutive year.

While Tesla Inc TSLA.O and General Motors Co GM.N have moved faster on over-the-air software upgrades and high-speed in-vehicle data networks, the new F-150 will bring such technology squarely into the mainstream.  The new truck, expected to launch later this year, is a critical plank in Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley\u2019s plan to slash $5 billion in warranty costs, speed Ford\u2019s push into vehicle connectivity and add to the No. 2 U.S. automaker\u2019s already-strong position in the North American commercial vehicle market.  Ford has borrowed more than $20 billion to ride out the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic. Profit from the new F-150 will be key to paying that money back.  Ford is not taking big risks with the exterior look of the new truck given its sales dominance, instead focusing on improving the interior, according to those who have seen it. Ford is scheduled to publicly show for the first time the new F-150 online on June 25.  \u201cIt\u2019s really about technology and productivity,\u201d Farley said at a Deutsche Bank conference on June 10.  One prominent feature will be the lay-flat passenger seat like those seen in first-class cabins on some planes, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. \u201cYou can basically live in the truck,\u201d the person said.  Ford's nicer interior, including a larger display screen, follows a similar move by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N with its new Ram truck, which received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch display screen.  \u201cRam taught everybody a little bit of a lesson,\u201d said Rhett Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cThe old 5-inch screen for your navigation and radio controls is gone. They\u2019re all going to be 10-, 12-, 15-inch screens. That was started by Tesla.\u201d  The F-150\u2019s new electrical architecture will allow Ford to provide over-the-air updates to key modules controlling the vehicle, replacing trips to the dealership.  The new truck\u2019s connectivity also will help Ford boost sales to commercial customers, and reduce warranty costs, Farley told investors.  The F-Series truck has been around since 1948, while the F-150 debuted in 1975. Sales of the current version have remained strong despite its age, and the new model could help Ford hold or even build its position in the segment, said Sandy Munro, chief executive of Michigan-based consulting firm Munro & Associates.  \u201cIf they add the same stuff as what Ram did and if they can add more stuff like Tesla\u2019s doing, there\u2019ll be a gigantic gap between Ford, and Ram and Chevy,\u201d he said.  The key for Ford will be to avoid the kinds of costly production problems that hobbled the launch of the new Explorer SUV last year. Ford acknowledged it erred in trying to launch the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator simultaneously while breaking in a new assembly line at its 95-year-old plant in Chicago.  Farley has been visiting the plants in Dearborn, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri, that will build the new F-150. Despite delays related to the virus, he said the launch is in \u201creally good shape.\u201d","55":"FILE PHOTO: Ford logo is pictured at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 10, 2019.

Now, Ford and GM are racing to design radical new takes on their most profitable models, replacing petroleum-fueled engines with batteries in a bid to outflank Tesla Inc\u2019s plan to eclipse their brands. Ford\u2019s F-150 pickup and GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado are the top selling vehicles in the U.S. market.  \u201cThis is going to be a real watershed for the whole industry,\u201d Ford Chairman Bill Ford told Reuters in a recent interview. The automaker has disclosed few details about the electric F-series, but Bill Ford hinted the truck could have load-carrying space under the hood in addition to the traditional bed in the back.  \u201cYou pick up all that extra space where the engine compartment has been,\u201d Ford said. An electric F-Series could be a work truck - with its batteries functioning as a job site power source, he said. And it could be positioned as a high-performance vehicle next to the gas-fueled, 450 horsepower Raptor pickup truck.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company has said it will invest $11.5 billion electrifying its vehicles by 2022, including adding 16 fully electric models, all of which will be profitable.  Ford and GM have more than one reason to take chances on electric pickups - a concept that some analysts and industry executives say could be a small niche.  Electric pickups could help Ford and GM generate the significant sales of EVs they will need to meet tougher emission standards and electric vehicle mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but the electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.  Governments and corporations - major buyers of pickups - could view electric pickups as a way to show a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Competition from Tesla and EV startups Rivian Automotive and Workhorse Group Inc is another factor, although Ford recently mitigated some of that risk by investing $500 million in Rivian.

Tesla is expected to unveil a prototype this year, with analysts forecasting a 2022 debut. Musk declined to comment for this story.  Officials familiar with Ford and GM\u2019s plans said their electric pickups will be introduced by early 2022.  \u201cOur strategy is very clear,\u201d Ted Cannis, Ford\u2019s director of electrification, told Reuters at the No. 2 U.S. automaker\u2019s product development center outside Detroit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play to our strengths. We\u2019re good at pickups.\u201d  Ford\u2019s electric truck will be built on a company EV platform separate from the vehicles it will offer later on a Rivian platform.  Ford has said it will introduce a hybrid F-150 next year. Bill Ford said the all-electric F-150 \u201cwon\u2019t be too far after that.\u201d  GM\u2019S ELECTRIC PICKUP PUSH  At GM, Chief Executive Mary Barra said in April the automaker would make an electric full-size pickup, but provided no further details. The company has said it plans to invest $8 billion to develop electric and self-driving vehicles, launching 20 new EVs globally by 2023.  Officials have not discussed plans for the electric pickup, but GM is pushing to introduce it within two years, according to several people familiar with the plans.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The lead engineer is Josh Tavel, who was the chief engineer for the Chevy Volt, Cadillac ELR, and Spark and Bolt EVs as well as executive chief engineer for full-size pickups, GM said.  Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe believes positive reaction last fall for his company\u2019s R1T electric truck, due in fall 2020, shows the potential demand.  \u201cThe question is how large is the demand and does it translate across all price points or does it stay more isolated in the higher price points?\u201d he told Reuters at the company\u2019s Plymouth, Michigan, headquarters.  Ford officials will not discuss sales expectations for the electric F-150. But Bill Ford said the electric pickup could outperform conservative expectations - if prospective customers try it.  Ford has broken with pickup segment conventions before - substituting a turbo-charged six-cylinder \u201cEcoBoost\u201d engine for the traditional V-8, and then giving the current generation of the truck an aluminum body instead of steel, the chairman said. The aluminum F-series is the best-selling pickup truck line in the United States, and about half are equipped with six-cylinder engines.  \u201cLike it was with EcoBoost and like it was with aluminum, it\u2019s important we get people in the vehicle to try it,\u201d Ford said.  Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said customers are already asking about the truck.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to be shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the electric pickup truck has a huge future.\u201d  Not everyone is so sanguine. Industry tracking firm IHS Markit has estimated the entire full-size electric truck segment will account for fewer than 30,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 2.3 million sales overall.  \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters,\u201d IHS Markit principal analyst Stephanie Brinley said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking niche in the beginning.\u201d  Detroit\u2019s other big automaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , has no current plans for an all-electric Ram, while Toyota Motor Corp is betting more heavily on a hybrid Tundra pickup.  \u201cThe sliver of volume that\u2019s going to be electric pickups is not worthy of a business case,\u201d said one person familiar with Toyota\u2019s plans.  The Detroit automakers ultimately want to defend a segment they see as their own.  \u201cWhy would we let Tesla beat us with a pickup truck?\u201d said one person familiar with Ford\u2019s plans. \u201cThat\u2019s our turf.\u201d","60":"Hall of Fame pitcher Whitey Ford, who won six World Series with the New York Yankees, died Friday at age 91.

Ford posted a 5% fall in U.S. auto sales for the third quarter but said a continuing recovery from pandemic-induced lockdowns helped it record better sales compared with the second quarter.  The No.2 U.S. automaker, which announces its quarterly sales volumes a day later than the rest of the industry, said it sold 551,796 vehicles in the country in the quarter, down from 580,251 a year earlier.

F.N is dusting off one of its treasured nameplates this spring in hopes of reviving a decades-old rivalry with Fiat Chrysler Automobile\u2019s FCHA.MI popular Jeep brand.  Ford's Bronco R race prototype debuts in the desert to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Rod Hall's historic Baja 1000 win in a picture obtained March 12, 2020. Ford\/Handout via REUTERS.  Leading the charge is a trim new mid-size Bronco sport utility vehicle, based on the Ranger pickup. Ford insiders have hinted there are more Bronco models to follow, including a smaller, car-based Bronco Sport later this year, with rumors of a Bronco pickup and a high-performance Bronco Raptor said to be under consideration.  The automaker is slated to reveal details of the 2021 Bronco on March 17.  Since announcing the return of the Bronco three years ago, Ford executives have made it clear the latest edition is targeted at the long-lived Jeep Wrangler. The rivalry dates back to mid-1965, when the original Bronco was launched as a compact two-door SUV, aimed squarely at the Jeep CJ, the predecessor of the Wrangler.  But Ford does not intend to stop there. It sees the potential to build a franchise around the Bronco name, a feat accomplished by Jeep over a period of eight decades, though under at least six owners.  Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said the return of the Bronco is the most exciting vehicle launch he has seen from Ford in a long time.  \u201cI\u2019ve had more people ask about this car than anything else we\u2019ve launched,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why Bronco\u2019s potential wouldn\u2019t be the same as Jeep\u2019s.\u201d  The Jeep family now includes six nameplates in North America, from the tiny Renegade to the new Gladiator pickup, with several additional models sold overseas and more coming.  The Jeep brand generates a huge share of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s profit, analysts say. So much so that Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas three years ago estimated the Jeep brand alone was worth 120% of the parent company\u2019s market value \u2014 more than $20 billion at the time.  Last year, Fiat Chrysler sold 1.5 million Jeeps globally, down from 1.6 million in 2018. That seems like a distant target for the resurrected Bronco, for which Ford has relatively modest aspirations: About 125,000 sales in its first year, suppliers say. Sales of the earlier Bronco peaked in 1979 at around 100,000.  Ford hinted at the general shape and size of the new Bronco last fall when it revealed a racing version called Bronco R.  The new model goes into production this spring at Ford\u2019s Wayne, Michigan, plant. The 2021 Bronco Sport, which shares underpinnings with the Ford Escape, is slated for production this fall at Ford\u2019s Hermosillo plant in Mexico.","63":"March 31 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it would postpone restarting production at its North America plants to help protect its workers from the coronavirus pandemic.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  The No. 2 U.S. automaker needs to strengthen the inventory of F-150 pickup trucks to bolster its profits for the year. The company had previously said production of the F-150 would take a hit in the fourth quarter as it ramped up production of the new version.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley, who took over the helm in October, has promised to move more capital to the automaker\u2019s high-growth areas, such as the F-Series pickup truck and its commercial business.  \u201cWe expect soft fourth-quarter results driven primarily by F-series downtime. Ford could provide better than expected 2021 outlook, benefiting from new F-150, Bronco, Mach-E launches; better warranty performance, and large restructuring savings from South America,\u201d Deutsche Bank auto analyst Emmanuel Rosner said.  THE CONTEXT  Ford\u2019s three launches - the redesigned F-150 pickup, electric Mustang Mach-E and the revived Bronco sport-utility vehicle - are considered a make or break for the automaker.  The F-Series truck has been around since 1948, while the F-150 debuted in 1975. Profits from the new F-150 is key to paying back the billions of dollars Ford has borrowed to ride out the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic.  The company also needs to reduce its warranty repair costs - the primary reason why the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker\u2019 s financial performance in North America has lagged that of its archrival, General Motors Co.

Ford said it was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on connected electric vehicles and said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025, nearly twice what it had previously committed to EVs. Ford also said it would invest $7 billion in self-driving, or autonomous, technology development over 10 years through 2025 \u2013 $5 billion of that from 2021 forward.  \u201cWe are accelerating all our plans,\u201d Chief Executive Jim Farley said, including increasing battery capacity and adding more electric vehicles in its future portfolio.

He added that Ford will have more announcements soon around its EV partnerships.  Farley told Reuters last fall Ford was considering making its own battery cells as sales volumes of electric vehicles rise globally.  Ford previously committed to invest $11.5 billion in electrification, including gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, through 2022. That included the launch of the Mustang Mach-E EV crossover, and electric versions of the F-150 pickup and Transit van.  A Ford spokesman said the $22 billion includes hybrid vehicles, but the commitment is \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d on EVs.

It said it plans to offer 30 EVs globally by 2025 and is targeting topping annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025.  Asked whether Ford would match GM\u2019s announcement that it aspires to stop selling gasoline-powered light vehicles by 2035, Lawler told reporters Ford is focused on selling high-volume EVs now, a possible reference to GM\u2019s initial EV product launches being lower-volume, higher priced models.  For 2020, Ford reported a net loss of $1.3 billion. It had previously said it expected a full-year profit of between $600 million and $1.1 billion.  Ford had a loss in the fourth quarter of $2.8 billion, or 70 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included several previously disclosed charges related to a recall, remeasurement of pensions and the closure of the company\u2019s Brazilian manufacturing operations.  Excluding the charges, Ford\u2019s operating profit was 34 cents a share, easily topping the 7-cent loss analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company projected operating earnings would climb to $8 billion to $9 billion in 2021, compared with $2.8 billion last year.

In COVID-19 pandemic-ravaged 2020, Ford\u2019s total revenue fell to $127 billion, from $156 billion in 2019.  Ford ended the quarter with nearly $31 billion in cash and $47 billion of liquidity, compared with almost $30 billion and more than $45 billion respectively in the prior quarter.

The Mach E has become within Ford a high-profile test for a restructuring that has been marred by profit warnings, costly quality problems and the troubled launch this year of another important vehicle, the Ford Explorer sport utility.  For Chief Executive Jim Hackett, the Mach E\u2019s aggressive design and futuristic interior represent a long-awaited, visible sign of the overhaul of the company\u2019s product creation process he has tried to explain to skeptical Wall Street analysts for the past two years.  By accelerating the \u201cclock speed\u201d of vehicle development, cutting overlapping product architectures to just five from 13 and extending the company\u2019s most successful brands to new products, Ford could slash $20 billion out of a five-year, 2018-2023 product plan, Hackett told Reuters.  \u201cThis is the first thing we generated out of this new thinking,\u201d Hackett said in an interview ahead of the Mach E unveiling. \u201cWe have a lot more coming.\u201d  For Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., the Mustang Mach E puts together two previously conflicting goals: His desire for Ford to be a leader in clean cars and make the automaker carbon-neutral by 2030, and his personal love of the Mustang and its growling V-8 engine.  \u201cWe are really pushing our chips in on the table with this vehicle,\u201d Ford said in an interview ahead of the Mach E\u2019s unveiling. The automaker has said it will spend $11.5 billion developing electric and hybrid models by 2022.  Automakers have struggled to make money on electric vehicles. Bill Ford told Reuters on Sunday after unveiling the Mach E \u201cwill be profitable right from the start.\u201d  Ford\u2019s confidence in the Mach E, and its determination to challenge Tesla, was reflected in the location the company chose to reveal it: An airplane hangar just a short walk from the main offices of Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX operations in Hawthorne, Calif. Musk often uses SpaceX facilities to unveil Tesla\u2019s new models, and has scheduled the debut of his electric pickup truck for somewhere in Los Angeles on Thursday.  The Mach E started with humble ambitions.  The SUV originally was to be what Ted Cannis, Ford\u2019s global director for electrification, called a \u201ccompliance\u201d play - an electric variant of a front-wheel drive internal combustion vehicle, aimed at generating emissions credits to comply with clean air regulations at low cost. There was no link to Mustang\u2019s muscle car image.  Boring electric cars were the norm for Ford and other legacy automakers. Then Tesla Inc in 2013 launched its Model S - an electric car that looked like a sporty European luxury sedan with a giant screen for a dashboard and entertainment and functional features that could be upgraded with over-the-air software updates.  Tesla\u2019s market value is now higher than Ford\u2019s.  Ford\u2019s own customer research showed dull electric cars were a mistake, Cannis and other executives said.  \u2018MUSTANG EXPERIENCE\u2019  Those doubts came to a head in mid-2017 when Hackett, then newly appointed, reviewed the design for the electric SUV with Executive Vice President Jim Farley, who has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old.  \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Hackett recalled saying. Farley agreed, and Hackett said, \u201cWe tear it up.\u201d  The team designing the vehicle started over, using a new architecture engineered from the start to be a battery electric vehicle, instead of the original plan to use a modified version of an internal combustion engine vehicle, Ford executives said.  The Mustang muscle car\u2019s distinctive \u201cshark face\u201d front end and body proportions were adapted to a new skin, and under the floor Ford designed a new battery pack that can deliver up to 300 miles (483 km) of range in an \u201cextended range\u201d version.  The re-do had to be accomplished much faster than normal to stay on target for a fall 2020 launch.  \u201cWe were super behind time,\u201d said exterior designer Chris Walter during a briefing on the vehicle ahead of the Los Angeles debut.  A concept for new dashboard software and a display using a 15.5-inch (39 cm) diagonal screen was pulled together in just 90 days by a 15-person group that called itself Team Menlo - a reference to Thomas Edison\u2019s Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory. A paper prototype of the new screen used an empty Keurig coffee pod to represent a large control knob.  The overhaul cost money, but Ford product development chief Hau Thai-tang told Reuters the dedicated electric vehicle architecture should allow for 25% to 30% improvements in manufacturing efficiency to help offset the cost.  The final call on using the Mustang name came from the top, and was not given easily.  \u201cI was dead set against it, initially,\u201d Bill Ford said. Ford said he started to warm to the idea as he saw the styling and the performance data for the vehicle.  Ford said he did not grant his approval until earlier this year after driving a prototype.  \u201cIt felt like a Mustang experience to me,\u201d he said.  TURNING POINTS  This is not the first time a challenge to reinvent the Mustang has emboldened Ford employees to break with convention during a rough patch in the company\u2019s history.  The original Mustang launched in 1964 was derived from a mainstream Falcon compact car, and quickly became a hit, far out-selling the company\u2019s projections.  In the early 1990s, with the economy in a slump, a small group of Ford employees rebelled against a plan to transform the rear-wheel drive Mustang into a front-wheel drive car developed by Ford\u2019s then-partner, Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp . That project became a laboratory for cutting the costs of product engineering by putting representatives of different functions on the same team.  The Mach E is another turning point, Hackett said. \u201cThe science project platform for EVs is now gone.\u201d","77":"MEXICO CITY, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Mexico\u2019s auto production and exports fell sharply in October compared with the same month last year as production from U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co ground to a halt, according to data from the national statistics agency INEGI.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The union turned to Ford to negotiate a new four-year agreement after ratifying a contract last week with GM following a 40-day U.S. strike that shut down almost all of GM\u2019s North American operations.  Detailed terms of the deal were not released, but they are expected to echo those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow.  \u201cThe pattern bargaining strategy has been a very effective approach for UAW and its members to secure economic gains around salary, benefits and secured over $6 billion in major product investments in American facilities, creating and retaining over 8,500 jobs for our communities,\u201d UAW Vice President Rory Gamble, head of the union\u2019s Ford department, said in a statement.  Ford confirmed the deal in a statement, but declined further comment.  UAW leaders from the various U.S. plants will meet on Friday to approve the deal, which will then be sent to the 55,000 members at Ford for final approval, a union spokesman said.  Ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract.  Ford and the UAW began talks on Monday covering larger issues such as pay raises, the use of temporary workers and healthcare insurance coverage, but the union previously said the sides had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d addressing smaller issues.  Ford historically has had an easier relationship with the union than its Detroit rivals. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford has described the UAW as \u201cfamily\u201d in the past and in September 2018 hailed the Dearborn, Michigan, company\u2019s relationship with its hourly workers.  \u201cThe UAW doesn\u2019t just make our workers better, it makes Ford better and stronger,\u201d Bill Ford told UAW workers last year.  Under the deal with GM, that automaker agreed to invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 billion directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. It also said it would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs. The GM contract also will provide $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.  Under its deal, GM also will close three plants, but it left the UAW members\u2019 healthcare insurance coverage unchanged.  Once the Ford deal is ratified, the UAW will turn to Fiat Chrysler to complete its quadrennial talks with the Detroit automakers.","82":"Oct 28 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will cut about 450 jobs at its Oakville assembly plant in Ontario, Canada as the No. 2 U.S. carmaker discontinues production of Ford Flex and Lincoln MKT crossovers, Canada's largest union in the private sector Unifor said reut.rs\/2pmAPhJ on Monday.

The expanded production will create 1,200 jobs with Ford in South Africa, increasing the local workforce to 5,500 employees, while adding an estimated 10,000 new jobs across the carmaker\u2019s supplier network.  Ford also aims to make the Silverton plant entirely energy self-sufficient and carbon neutral by 2024, Cavallaro said.  South Africa has big ambitions for its automotive sector, putting it at the heart of attempts to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment via industrialisation.

Trump said company founder Henry Ford would be \u201cvery disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn\u2019t work as well, because execs don\u2019t want to fight California regulators.\u201d  Ford said in a statement that it is focused on acting to protect the environment while also protecting the affordability of vehicles. \u201cThis agreement with California provides regulatory stability while reducing CO2 more than complying with two different standards,\u201d it said.  There is no evidence that existing fuel economy rules would degrade vehicle performance. And environmentalists and many states challenge Trump\u2019s assertion that his administration\u2019s proposed rule would boost vehicle safety or dramatically reduce the price of vehicles -- and argue that consumers will save more in reduced fuel costs under the Obama rules.  California Attorney General Xavier Becerra responded to Trump\u2019s attacks on automakers saying it would result in an additional 540 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and other harms. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like a better alternative to us,\u201d he said.  The White House has urged other automakers not to back the California agreement, while Democrats have been calling and writing automakers urging them to sign on with California.  The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday ridiculed the voluntary framework, which it said \u201cso far has been nothing more than a press release.\u201d  \u201cMy proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!\u201d Trump tweeted earlier.  Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Ford, Volkswagen and others, said the companies \"look forward to seeing a final rule soon. We support increases to standards that optimize all the priorities, including affordability so more Americans can buy a new car, plus preserving jobs and safety at the same time.\"  GM has not backed the voluntary agreement, arguing that it does not properly credit the company\u2019s electric vehicles.  Even so, Trump tweeted that the founders of Ford and GM \u201care \u2018rolling over\u2019 at the weakness of current car company executives\u201d over the fuel rules, adding: \u201cCrazy!\u201d  GM said late Wednesday that the company is \u201ccontinuously improving fuel economy\u201d and is focused on \u201cworking with all parties on a solution that would involve a 50-state solution and a national electric vehicle program.\u201d  Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said Trump\u2019s tweet was completely untrue. \u201cTrump\u2019s rollback is unraveling from every corner,\u201d he said.  All major automakers are on record saying they oppose the administration\u2019s \u201cpreferred option\u201d announced in August 2018, which would freeze fuel economy requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.  Trump\u2019s tweet misstated some aspects of the administration\u2019s proposal, expected to be finalized sometime after late September. The proposal said that by the 2030 model year, the average price increase of a new vehicle would be reduced by $1,850 and consumers would pay $490 less for financing, insurance and taxes. There is nothing in the administration\u2019s proposed revisions that would result in engines running more smoothly.  The Trump plan\u2019s preferred alternative would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day in the 2030s while reducing automakers\u2019 collective regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles or setting state emissions rules.  The administration says the increased fuel use would hike the average global temperature by 3\/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100, but would save thousands of lives over the next 30 years -- in part because consumers would more quickly buy safer, cheaper vehicles. Environmentalists and many states reject that analysis.  The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration\u2019s preferred option.","90":"WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will recall 3 million vehicles for air bag inflators that could rupture, at a cost of $610 million.

The U.S. automaker delivered 146,473 vehicles in China in the fourth quarter, down 14.7% year-on-year, Ford said in a statement. In total, it sold 567,854 vehicles over 2019.  Ford has been trying to revive sales in China after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37% in 2018, after a 6% decline in 2017.  Anning Chen, president and chief executive of Ford Greater China, said that while 2019 was a \u201cchallenging\u201d year for the automaker, it saw its market share in the high-to-premium segment stabilize and its sales decline in the value segment start to narrow in the second-half of the year.  \u201cThe pressure from the external environment and downward trend of the industry volume will continue in 2020, and we will put more efforts into strengthening our product lineup with more customer-centric products and customer experiences to mitigate the external pressure and improve dealers\u2019 profitability.\u201d  The automaker plans to launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which over a third will be electric vehicles. It has also said it would localize management teams by hiring more Chinese staff and aimed to improve relationships with joint venture partners.  Models launched in the fourth quarter include a new Ford Escape version - for which the automaker said orders received so far have been much higher than expected - and the Lincoln Corsair, the first localized Lincoln model in China.

It has also said it would partner Zotye Automobile Co Ltd 000980.SZ to sell lower priced cars.  Its larger U.S. rival General Motors Co GM.N last week said its sales in China fell 15% from a year earlier to 3.09 million vehicles in 2019, its second year of decline.  China\u2019s auto market is set to contract by 2% in 2020 for the third year of decline, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) forecast, due to a weaker economy and trade dispute with the United States.  Over 28 million vehicles were sold in 2018, down 3% from the prior year, while 2019 sales are likely to have declined 8% from the prior year, CAAM said.","93":"LONDON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday said its car lineup in Europe will be all-electric by 2030 as the U.S. automaker races to get ahead of CO2 emissions targets and looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles.  The carmaker said it will invest $1 billion over the next 30 months to convert its vehicle assembly plant in Cologne, Germany, to become the U.S. automaker\u2019s first electric vehicle facility in Europe.  \u201cThis reinforces our commitment to the European region,\u201d Stuart Rowley, head of Ford\u2019s European operations, said during a news conference.  Ford said its first European-built, all-electric passenger vehicle will be produced at the facility from 2023 and is considering building a second model there.  The carmaker has a strategic alliance with Volkswagen AG, under which Ford will use its German partner\u2019s MEB electric vehicle platform to build some models. Rowley said the model out of Cologne will be the first to use Volskwagen\u2019s MEB platform.  The No.2 U.S. automaker said that by 2026 it will have electric versions of all its passenger cars on sale in Europe and that by 2030 two=thirds of its commercial vehicle sales in Europe will be fully electric or plug-in hybrids.  The company said it will have plug-in hybrid or fully-electric versions of its entire commercial vehicle range available by 2024.

It will also partially assemble the Police Interceptor SUV.  On Friday, Ford said it would lay off about 200 workers in September at a Canadian manufacturing plant in Oakville, Ontario, with more layoffs possible in January, because of slowing sales of the sedans that the plant manufactures.  Overall, U.S. new vehicle sales are expected to fall this year, although pickup trucks and SUVs remain more popular than traditional passenger cars.  Last week, Ford also kicked off talks on a new four-year contract with the United Auto Workers union, with job security, healthcare costs and the use of temporary workers expected to be major sticking points.","96":"FILE PHOTO: Ford logo is pictured at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 10, 2019.

Ford Motor Chief Executive Jim Hackett can rest easier off the back of the automaker\u2019s second-quarter results. The company actually turned a profit thanks to some fortuitous timing: It booked a $3.5 billion gain from closing Volkswagen\u2019s investment in its self-driving unit, Argo AI. Even without that, though, the $2.8 billion operating loss was almost half what analysts had expected, according to Refinitiv data.  Ford\u2019s balance sheet looks better, too, as the company revealed on Thursday that it repaid almost $8 billion of its revolving credit lines this week. And the relaunch earlier this month of the Bronco SUV was so popular that there\u2019s now an 18-month waitlist.  Granted, Ford\u2019s performance still lags archrival General Motors \u2013 but not as much as feared. That will relieve some of the pressure that had been steadily increasing on Hackett. It will take more work in controlling costs as well as developing self-driving and electric cars to prove that Ford\u2019s better-than-expected showing was not a one-quarter aberration.

What\u2019s got Wall Street more excited was how operating margins held up \u2013 they only declined one percentage point to about 11%.  A year ago, Amazon.com\u2019s ambitions in delivering packages raised the specter of excess capacity. Now, UPS and FedEx can barely keep up. Moreover, the wave isn\u2019t likely to ebb soon, as the pandemic continues. Holiday shipments will strain the system further. That means shippers can hike prices. UPS already introduced some surcharges at the end of May. The 10% rise in its share price suggests investors think those prices will stick for the long term, even if higher volumes don\u2019t.

The pandemic has helped Mediobanca store up some wealth.

Chinese spend is likely to represent half of global luxury revenue in 2020, up from 36% last year. But the industry\u2019s road to full recovery is tortuous as long as travel stays on hold and the rest of the world underperforms.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker has not lost any vehicle production outside of China and it is taking steps to keep its plants operating, he said. However, some parts of the U.S. market have seen customer traffic at dealers hurt by the outbreak, he added.  On Thursday, FCA said an employee at its Indiana transmission plant had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but he was being treated and the plant was still operating while anyone exposed to that worker was quarantined.  Manley said in the letter to employees on Thursday that FCA is focused on worker safety and keeping its plants running.  \u201cClearly, we are now moving beyond regional hotspots and into planning for how this will impact every area of our business across the world,\u201d he said.  Changes include allowing for greater space between employees at several plants, and stepping up cleaning and availability of face masks, Manley said.

Rival electric vehicle models from Audi, Jaguar and Porsche have fallen short of Tesla\u2019s driving range between charges and failed to match Tesla\u2019s brand cachet.  More analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d which is extremely unusual for companies on Wall Street. Eleven analysts recommend buying Tesla shares, while 13 recommend selling and another nine are neutral, according to Refinitiv data.  Shares of GM are about unchanged over the past 12 months, while Ford has risen 10%, both drastically underperforming the broader market, with a slump in China car sales hurting investor sentiment in both of those companies.","103":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Monday rolled out the product and marketing strategy for its new family of Bronco SUVs designed to take a bite out of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MIFCAU.N profitable Jeep franchise.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Ford\u2019s Bronco lineup, launching later this month, will include two- and four-door models, as well as a smaller Bronco Sport. The vehicles\u2019 boxy looks, their new bucking bronco logo, a \u201cBronco Nation\u201d online fan club along with the \u201cBuilt Wild\u201d marketing campaign are all part of Ford\u2019s plan to muscle into the lucrative off-road adventure segment that Jeep has dominated for decades.  The new Bronco lineup will offer off-roading technology aimed at people who want a comfortable ride on the highway, and who go off-roading on sand, gravel or dirt, not clambering over boulders, Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said in an interview.  \u201cWe see our vehicle different than Wrangler,\u201d the Jeep model favored by extreme off-road enthusiasts, Farley said. \u201cWe see it as a vehicle you can live with every day.\u201d  Bronco\u2019s real mission is to boost profits as Ford strives to repay debt taken on to weather the coronavirus slowdown. Last year, Ford said retooling its Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant to build Ranger mid-sized pickup trucks and the Bronco instead of hybrid and compact cars would improve operating earnings by more than $1 billion.  Teaser images from Ford and spy photos from auto magazines have hinted the new Bronco will take styling cues from the first generation of Ford Broncos, built from 1966 to 1977, which were boxy two-door models now considered one of the earliest SUVs. Ford withdrew the Bronco line in 1996 amid falling demand for two-door SUVs.  While FCA declined to comment on the Bronco, Chief Executive Mike Manley and his predecessor, Sergio Marchionne, invested heavily in the Jeep brand. The Jeep family includes six nameplates in North America, from the tiny Renegade to the Gladiator pickup, with several additional models sold overseas and more coming.  Jeep generates a huge share of FCA\u2019s profit. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas three years ago estimated the Jeep brand alone was worth 120% of the parent company\u2019s market value \u2014 more than $20 billion at the time.  Last year, Fiat Chrysler sold about 1.5 million Jeeps globally, down from almost 1.6 million in 2018. Ford\u2019s aspirations are lower starting at 125,000 sales in the first year, according to suppliers. Sales of the earlier Bronco peaked in 1979 at around 100,000.  As part of the Bronco launch, Ford will create four U.S. off-road testing grounds next year, dubbed \u201cOff-Roadeos.\u201d  Ford will unveil online the four-wheel-drive SUVs at 8 p.m. ET on July 13, when customers can begin placing $100 deposits.","104":"Sept 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it has begun production of the new generation F-150 pickup truck at its Dearbon, Michigan facility, and expects the redesigned model to go on sale in November.

The company unveils its new E-Transit commercial van on Thursday during a virtual webcast. Chief Executive Jim Farley has made clear Ford is betting connected, electric commercial vehicles, can generate lucrative, recurring profits despite a growing field of electric competitors.  Ford already dominates the U.S. and European markets for gasoline-powered commercial vehicles with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively.  \u201cWe deserve the same share in EVs that we have in ICE and we think we\u2019re well positioned to get there,\u201d Ted Cannis, head of Ford\u2019s North American commercial vehicle business, said in a telephone interview ahead of the online introduction.  Farley said Ford expects global demand for electric vans will grow by more than 1.1 million vehicles by 2030 and while startups like Rivian and Arrival have contracts to build electric vans for Amazon.com Inc and UPS, respectively, none can match Ford\u2019s product or service options, including a deep list of service centers and upfitters.  \u201cWorkhorse or Arrival or Rivian, they don\u2019t have the breadth of product,\u201d Cannis said. Ford has invested in Rivian, but the E-Transit is not related to the startup\u2019s van.  The E-Transit comes in eight configurations, including three roof heights and three lengths, as well as in cargo, cutaway and chassis cab versions. The low-roof cargo van version will have an EV driving range of 126 miles.  The new van, which includes a standard 12-inch touchscreen and the ability to do over-the-air software updates, will have a starting price of almost $45,000, about $10,000 more than the gas-powered version, and comes with an 8-year, 100,000 electric vehicle component warranty.  Others planning EVs for the commercial van segment include Germany\u2019s Daimler AG, General Motors Co and startups Xos Trucks and Bollinger Motors.  Cannis did not disclose what sales volumes Ford is planning for E-Transit, but Bill Rinna, director of Americas vehicle forecasts at LMC Automotive said the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker is expected to build 20,000-25,000 a year in North America.  Two of three electric vehicles Ford has announced as part of an $11.5 billion investment in electrification through 2022 are aimed at commercial customers - the E-Transit and an electric F-150 pickup, coming in mid-2022.  Ford\u2019s Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, arriving later this year, represents a low-volume challenger to electric luxury vehicle market leader Tesla Inc..  Regulators in Europe and some U.S. cities are stepping up pressure on businesses to replace diesel or gasoline-fueled delivery vans with electric models to reduce pollution.  Ford said Tuesday it will invest $100 million and hire 150 workers to build the E-Transit at its plant near Kansas City, Missouri.","106":"SEOUL, July 21 (Reuters) - Volkswagen and Ford said a U.S. legal row between South Korean battery makers could disrupt supplies of the key electric vehicle parts and cost U.S. jobs during the Covid-19 outbreak, according to documents submitted to a U.S. trade panel.  The two automakers asked the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) to allow SK Innovation to manufacture batteries at its proposed U.S. factory in Georgia for use in Ford\u2019s fully electric F-150 and other electric cars, the statements seen by Reuters showed.  Last year, South Korean battery maker LG Chem sued small rival SK Innovation over alleged trade secret theft in the United States, seeking to bar SK from producing battery cells in the U.S. and importing the components necessary to make the cells.  \u201cAny remedial orders should seek to avoid collateral damage to SKI\u2019s existing customers,\u201d Volkswagen said in its public interest comments to the ITC in May.  \u201cTo avoid a catastrophic supply disruption,\u201d the commission should allow SK Innovation to manufacture EV batteries in the U.S. facility, Volkswagen said in the May statement.  Ford said that LG Chem\u2019s assertion that it can replace SK Innovation as a supplier is not \u201ccredible\u201d given EV battery supply shortages and the long development period required for EVs.  LG Chem declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.  SK Innovation is building its first battery plant in Georgia to serve Volkswagen\u2019s EV base in neighboring Tennessee starting 2022. SK Innovation also plans to add a second U.S. plant to supply Ford\u2019s electric pickup trucks and other models.  \u201cThe risk to such U.S. jobs is especially unacceptable in light of current economic conditions caused by COVID-19,\u201d Ford said in its public interest comments to the ITC.

In March, Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N told salaried employees to work from home to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Ford brought back 12,000 salaried employees last month, and others have been told they can work from home until September, spokeswoman Marisa Bradley said. Given potential workplace changes caused by the outbreak, a facility consolidation the No. 2 U.S. automaker had already launched could accelerate.  \u201cIf we know we are going to have a smaller population that\u2019s going to come back to work, we could look at maybe shrinking our footprint,\u201d Bradley said.  U.S. companies are wrestling with who can work from home and how much office space is necessary.  Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said recently many salaried employees can work from home, and the Dearborn, Michigan-based company could eliminate offices. The shutdown is \u201creally an opportunity to redesign how we do work,\u201d he said.  FCA has one of the largest offices spaces in the country with its U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. A small number of employees who work in testing facilities have returned to work there, and more salaried workers will return slowly over the coming months, a spokeswoman said.  A GM spokesman said the No. 1 U.S. automaker is not looking at consolidating office space, but is bringing salaried workers back in phases, focusing first on those \u201cwho need to be in the office to do their job.\u201d  Hourly workers in the automakers\u2019 U.S. plants largely returned to work May 18 after a two-month lockdown, using greater safety measures such as screening workers for fevers and providing face masks.","108":"DETROIT\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Friday it has chosen Ford Motor Co F.N as the next U.S. automaker the union will negotiate with after workers at General Motors Co GM.N approved a new contract deal.  The UAW said 57% of hourly workers at GM voted to approve the deal to end a contentious 40-day U.S. strike, the longest automotive labor stoppage since 1970.  GM Chairman and Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a statement the new contract \u201crecognizes our employees for the important contributions they make to the overall success of the company, with a strong wage and benefit package and additional investment and job growth in our U.S. operations.\u201d  The UAW and Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, will begin talks on Monday, the union said. Ford and the UAW said earlier this month they had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in addressing many bargaining issues.  Ford said on Friday it looks \u201cforward to reaching a fair agreement that helps Ford enhance its competitiveness and preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs.\u201d  Unlike GM, Ford has not signaled it wants to close plants, but executives have said future electric vehicles would require 30% fewer labor hours to build. UAW leaders have expressed concern about the impact of EVs on their members.  GM also did little to lower its share of the UAW\u2019s healthcare plans, which could be more costly to Ford since it employs about 55,000 UAW members in the United States.  The UAW had previously agreed to a temporary contract extension with Ford while it focused on GM.  While the talks between GM and the UAW grew tense at times, with the union accusing the automaker of trying to \u201cstarve ... workers off the picket lines,\u201d Ford historically has had an easier relationship with the union. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford has described the UAW as \u201cfamily\u201d in the past and in September 2018 hailed the No. 2 U.S. automaker\u2019s relationship with its hourly workers.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  \u201cThe UAW doesn\u2019t just make our workers better, it makes Ford better and stronger,\u201d Bill Ford told UAW workers last year.  Workers at GM will begin to go back as early as Saturday under the new four-year contract, ending the strike that cost the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion and costing the automaker about 300,000 units of lost production. GM will attempt to make up some of that production in the coming months.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  The union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers.  UAW leaders had recommended that the members at GM, who have remained on the picket lines, ratify the deal reached on Oct. 16.  The GM strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers.  The strike at GM likely slashed at least 46,000 jobs from October\u2019s nonfarm U.S. payrolls, the Labor Department said on Friday.  Under the deal, GM will invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. The Detroit company said it will also create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which will be new, a source previously said.

GM and Ford could face significant hurdles before it could build a complex piece of medical equipment like a ventilator and it is unclear how long it would take to do so, however.  Countries around the world have raised concerns about potential shortages of the ventilators needed to treat critically ill patients suffering from coronavirus. Running in the thousands of dollars per unit, ventilators are used to help people with respiratory difficulties to breathe.  Earlier this week, Britain asked manufacturers including Ford, Honda 7267.T and Rolls Royce RR.L to help make health equipment including ventilators and said it will look at using hotels as hospitals.

Many of the vehicles that Ford, General Motors GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI put on show were pickup trucks, a segment of the Chinese market that has remained relatively resilient even as the overall industry braces for a second year of dipping sales.  Demand for pickups - both from traditional farm and construction-related customers as well as newer interest from general car buyers - has increased and last year China became the world\u2019s second-biggest pickup truck market.  But many big Chinese cities restrict pickups from entering their centers, an obstacle for sales growth.

The Trump administration in March finalized rollback of U.S. vehicle emissions standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That is far weaker than the 5% annual increases in the discarded rules adopted under President Barack Obama.

Ford confirmed the deal in a statement and declined further comment.  The deal now must be ratified by the 55,000 UAW workers at Ford, with voting running through Nov. 15. While GM\u2019s deal was approved, ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract.  Detailed terms of the Ford deal echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. The UAW said the deal included agreements by Ford to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs.  The spending includes a $1.1 billion investment in Ford\u2019s Wayne, Michigan, pickup truck plant; $1 billion for the Louisville, Kentucky, plant, where Ford makes pickups and SUVs; and $900 million in an Ohio plant where it produces heavy-duty pickup trucks. A new unnamed vehicle will be added to the Ohio plant in 2023.  The deal also includes building hybrid and fully electric versions of various SUV models and the best-selling F-150 pickup truck, the union said.  Full-time UAW members at Ford will receive a signing bonus of $9,000, but the deal will allow the Dearborn, Michigan, company to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan.  The deal includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage.  Once the Ford deal is ratified, the UAW will turn to Fiat Chrysler to complete its quadrennial talks with the Detroit automakers.

Doria has defended Sao Paulo as a manufacturing hub at a time when the auto industry turned to other Brazilian states that were offering aggressive tax incentives. He has introduced a tax incentive of his own.

The Republican-controlled Senate previously confirmed Brouillette in 2017 as deputy energy secretary in a 79-17 vote.

Perry has said he did nothing wrong and his role in Ukraine centered on natural gas and coal.  Brouillette, 57, faced questions at his confirmation hearing last month from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden about his own involvement with Ukraine, but said his role was focused on how U.S. energy supplies could help the country find alternatives to fuel from Russia.  Brouillette, a member of Louisiana\u2019s Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016, is expected to firmly support Trump\u2019s policy of maximizing production of oil, natural gas and coal, offering them for sale abroad, and rolling back regulations.  Before being a Louisiana state energy regulator, Brouillette was an assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Energy Department under former President George W.

Brouillette said last month he backs technologies to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and using burying the gas linked to climate change underground, because oil, gas and coal would provide a large portion of energy needs for 40 to 50 years.  \u201cWe have to get these technologies off the shelf and into the market,\u201d Brouillette said, at his confirmation hearing. He also supports nuclear power plants, but it is not clear how the Department of Energy can help reactors that are at risk of closing due to stiff competition from a glut of cheap natural gas and from falling costs of wind and solar power.

AstraZeneca\u2019s results have put rebel investors on the defensive. The $134 billion drugmaker said on Wednesday total sales in the first quarter were up 17% to $6.3 billion. Analysts had only been expecting product sales of $5.9 billion. The figures should be a relief to Chief Executive Pascal Soriot as he meets shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting. A Sky News report earlier this month suggested investors were preparing to vote against his pay package.  Pension perks are the root of the problem. The board has already cut Soriot\u2019s pension contribution to 20% of his 1.3 million-pound salary, from 30%. But it still far exceeds the retirement awards paid to AstraZeneca staff. BlackRock, the company\u2019s largest shareholder, has previously warned it will vote against the compensation of any CEO whose retirement awards that are out of line with workers. But Soriot\u2019s delivery of seven consecutive quarters of sales growth should allow him to shrug off any rebellion. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HONG STRONG. Banks everywhere are cranking up bad debt charges due to the pandemic-induced slowdown. Yet Hong Kong looks a financial safe haven, despite being one of the first places outside mainland China to impose a lockdown. Standard Chartered on Wednesday said that first-quarter pre-tax profit in the special administrative region was broadly unchanged from the previous three months, at $378 million, even though bad debt charges almost doubled. Larger rival HSBC, a day earlier reported pre-tax profit of $2.85 billion in Hong Kong, up 9% from the previous quarter.  What\u2019s going on? Hong Kong has so far been successful in containing the Covid-19 outbreak. The government is supporting consumers and companies, though its biggest support package only came earlier this month. And Hong Kong banks started raising bad debt charges last year, as violent protests kept visitors away from the financial hub. The global slump will squeeze its economy, which is dependent on tourism and finance. So far, however, Hong Kong\u2019s financial system is holding up. (By Peter Thal Larsen)  UPHILL START. The gears are crunching badly at Daimler and Volkswagen. First-quarter operating profit at the two German automakers fell by roughly four-fifths year-on-year, the pair reported on Wednesday. But China offers a crumb of comfort. Daimler said April unit sales in the country were 97% of the comparable figure a year earlier, up from just 29% in March. And footfall in the company\u2019s dealerships was already back at levels seen in January before an economic lockdown was initiated. Volkswagen, meanwhile, said it expected China car sales would by July match 2019 trends.  Any resurgence would benefit VW more than Daimler. China accounts for around two-fifths of group sales at the Wolfsburg-based company, versus one-tenth at the Mercedes-Benz maker. That may be why boss Herbert Diess still expects VW to report an operating profit in 2020, albeit \u201cseverely\u201d below the prior year. Something is better than nothing. (By Christopher Thompson)  FACE-SAVING MOVE. Chinese electric-car maker BYD unveiled terrible results late on Tuesday, but it was surprisingly chipper about the months to come. The $20 billion company, which reported an 85% decline in quarterly net profit from a year earlier, expects the first-half bottom line to increase by as much as 24% once the April to June period is included. Amid a depressed market for vehicle sales, handset assembly will power some of the growth. Another unlikely source: surgical face masks.  It took less than two weeks for Shenzhen-based BYD to set up the new manufacturing process. By mid-March, the plant was running at full capacity churning out 5 million masks and 300,000 bottles of disinfectant daily. The likes of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors also have shifted gears into making protective and medical equipment. Given some of the virus-induced societal changes in the offing, this might be a form of diversification that pays longer-term dividends. (By Sharon Lam)  CROSSED WIRES. The usual path for an activist investor harbouring a beef with a company is to get on its share register, build a stake and lobby for management to get the boot. Chris Hohn is offering an interesting variation. The head of $24 billion TCI Fund Management has a 1.04% short position in Wirecard\u2019s shares, and is demanding the exit of Chief Executive Markus Braun, who also holds 7% of the German payments group.  A short-seller might want an underperforming boss to stay in post. Either way, it keeps the spotlight on Wirecard. The group\u2019s shares fell on Tuesday after auditor KPMG found no evidence of \u201cbalance sheet forgery\u201d but added big caveats such as an unwillingness to cooperate by Wirecard\u2019s third-party partners. Those businesses were central to allegations of suspect accounting made by the Financial Times, which Wirecard has always denied. With shares off another 7% on Wednesday, greater transparency might be needed. Hohn\u2019s odd activism helps maintain the pressure for more light.

(Reporting by Ben Klayman; Editing by Leslie Adler)","145":"DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - Investors sent Ford Motor Co shares skidding on Tuesday after the company delivered a weaker-than-expected 2020 forecast, warning of higher warranty costs, lower profits at its credit arm and continued investments in future technology such as self-driving cars.  FILE PHOTO: Ford Motor Co. shows the all-new electric Mustang Mach-E vehicle for a photo shoot at a studio in Warren, Michigan, U.S. October 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Shares in the No. 2 U.S. automaker plunged 9.4% in after-hours trading, shaving more than $3 billion off the company\u2019s value. In comparison, electric carmaker Tesla closed up nearly 14%, pushing its market cap to $160 billion, more than four times the size of Ford\u2019s $36.4 billion.  \u201cThe results were not OK in 2019,\u201d Ford Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone told reporters at the company\u2019s headquarters outside Detroit.  \u201cAs I look to 2020 and beyond, I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d he said, while cautioning that Ford\u2019s lower guidance does not yet account for the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.  In an after-hours call with financial analysts, Chief Executive Jim Hackett was more blunt about the challenge of balancing Ford\u2019s protracted turnaround efforts with its continuing work on future technology, including electric and self-driving cars.  \u201cI don\u2019t think this company can keep straddling the old and new worlds forever ... This company has to change,\u201d Hackett said.  Ford said it expects 2020 operating earnings to be in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.26 a share.  Stone said Ford expects to continue its quarterly dividend of 15 cents, which could cost the company $2.4 billion in 2020. Asked about continuing the dividend after lowering its 2020 guidance, Hackett said, \u201cWe like to return value to shareholders.\u201d  The disappointing 2020 forecast, coming after Ford previously trimmed its 2019 outlook, is a blow for Hackett, who took the helm in May 2017.  He has been asking investors to be patient with a restructuring that has seen the formation of a wide-ranging alliance on commercial, electric and autonomous vehicles with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and the sale of its money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by India's Mahindra & Mahindra.  But by Ford\u2019s own accounting, the restructuring is far from complete. It has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.  For the fourth quarter of 2019, Ford reported a net loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, compared with a loss of $100 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier.  The quarter included a loss of $2.2 billion due to higher contributions to its employee pension plans, something it disclosed last month.  Revenue in the quarter fell 5% to $39.7 billion, above the $36.5 billion Wall Street had expected.  Ford\u2019s adjusted free cash flow fell 67% in the fourth quarter to $500 million, including the $600 million cost of bonuses related to a new labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. The UAW deal also played a role in driving North American automotive profit margins down to 2.8% in the fourth quarter.  Ford said its operating losses in China last year totaled $771 million, including a loss of $207 million in the fourth quarter. It lost $1.5 billion in 2018. Ford\u2019s market share in China in the fourth quarter fell to 2% from 2.3% last year.  In December, Ford said it would halve its operating loss in 2019 and nearly halve it again in 2020, followed by further improvement in 2021.  However, that forecast was before the appearance of the fast-spreading coronavirus and its crippling effects on China\u2019s economy.  Ford\u2019s China sales fell about 15% in the fourth quarter and 26% for the year as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.  Detroit rivals General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are scheduled to report their results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.","146":"March 17 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co:  * FORD TEMPORARILY SUSPENDS EUROPEAN PRODUCTION IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS; HELPS CONTAINMENT EFFORTS  * FORD MOTOR CO - VEHICLE AND ENGINE PRODUCTION SUSPENDED AT FORD\u2019S MAIN MANUFACTURING SITES IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE FROM THURSDAY, MARCH 19  * FORD MOTOR CO - TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION EXPECTED TO LAST FOR A NUMBER OF WEEKS  * FORD MOTOR - VEHICLE MANUFACTURING SITES IN COLOGNE & SAARLOUIS IN GERMANY, CRAIOVA FACILITY IN ROMANIA WILL TEMPORARILY HALT PRODUCTION FROM MAR 19  * FORD MOTOR CO - COMPONENT SUPPLIES TO FORD MANUFACTURING SITES IN EUROPE HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY INTERRUPTED  * FORD MOTOR CO - IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS AT CO\u2019S FACILITIES SO FAR HAS BEEN LIMITED  * FORD MOTOR - VALENCIA ASSEMBLY AND ENGINE FACILITY IN SPAIN ALREADY TEMPORARILY HALTED PRODUCTION FROM MARCH 16  * FORD MOTOR CO - FORD DEALERSHIPS ARE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE ACROSS EUROPE  * FORD MOTOR CO - SALES OF VEHICLES ACROSS INDUSTRY HAVE DECLINED  * FORD MOTOR CO - WORKING REMOTELY POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES WILL CONTINUE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE Source text: (ford.to\/2w3oz9v) Further company coverage:","147":"March 30 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co:  * FORD TO PRODUCE 50,000 VENTILATORS IN MICHIGAN IN NEXT 100 DAYS; PARTNERING WITH GE HEALTHCARE WILL HELP CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS  * FORD MOTOR CO - FORD EXPECTS TO PRODUCE 50,000 OF VENTILATORS WITHIN NEXT 100 DAYS, WITH ABILITY TO PRODUCE 30,000 A MONTH THEREAFTER AS NEEDED  * FORD MOTOR CO - FORD, IN COLLABORATION WITH GE HEALTHCARE, WILL LEVERAGE DESIGN OF AIRON CORP.\u2019S FDA-CLEARED VENTILATOR TO PRODUCE IN MICHIGAN  * FORD MOTOR CO - EXPECTS TO PRODUCE 1,500 VENTILATORS BY END OF APRIL, 12,000 BY END OF MAY AND 50,000 BY JULY 4  * FORD MOTOR - FORD\u2019S RAWSONVILLE PLANT TO PRODUCE VENTILATORS NEARLY AROUND CLOCK, WITH 500 PAID VOLUNTEER UAW-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES WORKING ON 3 SHIFTS  * FORD MOTOR CO - AT FULL PRODUCTION, FORD PLANS TO MAKE 7,200 AIRON-LICENSED MODEL A-E VENTILATORS PER WEEK Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","148":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Friday shook up its top management, naming strategy chief Jim Farley as chief operating officer of the No. 2 U.S. automaker and promising skeptical investors the company will kick a slow-moving turnaround into a higher gear.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Ford\u2019s move positions Farley, 57, as potential heir to Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May 2017. Farley is currently president of new businesses, technology and strategy but will now be responsible for all global operations as well as future technology such as self-driving cars.  News of Farley\u2019s promotion and the retirement of automotive president Joe Hinrichs, another potential CEO candidate, effective on March 1, came three days after Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford saw its shares slide following a disappointing forecast. On Friday, Ford shares were off as much as 2.8% to their lowest price since January 2019 and finished the day down about 1.7 percent.  Farley told Reuters that Ford needs to move more quickly, especially around taking advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its vehicles including commercial vehicles. Farley added that Ford was \u201cdeep\u201d in partnership talks with digital companies to improve its customer experience.  \u201cWe put a lot of new cost and capability in these new vehicles,\u201d Farley said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe have to get a lot quicker in taking advantage of them. We do not have two or three years to figure out how we use connectivity in the F-150 and our new electric architecture that we launch later this year.\u201d  Ford is in the midst of a global restructuring and faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market. Hackett said on a conference call with reporters that the company needs to move with greater speed, echoing what some investors have said.  \u201cIt\u2019s my judgment the time is to move with urgency now to fully integrate and accelerate Ford\u2019s transformation,\u201d Hackett said.  \u201cWe\u2019re now in execution mode and what the company needs is to come together,\u201d Hackett added, saying he had no plans to leave the company after almost three years on the job and it was the board\u2019s role to manage succession.  Analysts and investors have speculated how long Hackett, 64, will remain as CEO and whether an internal executive or an outsider will succeed him. Ford\u2019s struggles, including a poor launch of its new Ford Explorer SUV and rising warranty costs, have only heightened speculation.  Ford restructuring is far from complete. It said on Tuesday it has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.  In China, Ford lost $771 million last year, about half the 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. Ford has been struggling to revive sales there since its business began slumping in late 2017, and now the world\u2019s largest market has been hit by a fast-spreading coronavirus that has killed more than 630 people.  Another key element for 2020 is Ford\u2019s planned introduction of a fully redesigned F-150 full-sized pickup truck, its top profit generator, as well as the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV and the Ford Bronco utility vehicle.  Farley joined Ford in 2007 as global head of marketing and sales and went on to lead Lincoln, South America, Ford of Europe and all of Ford's global markets in successive roles. He previously worked at Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T.  Farley is credited, along with Hackett, in forcing the redesign before its introduction of the Mach-E and the decision to make it a Mustang vehicle, leveraging that iconic brand. Farley has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old.","149":"FILE PHOTO: The Ford logo is seen at the Ford oldest Brazil plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil September 3, 2019.

The plant, located in the industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, produced buses and the Fiesta compact car, which sold poorly. It employed up to 2,800 people earlier this year, although it is unclear how many were still working there as of October.  Ford first announced it would shut down the plant in February, and said it had failed to find a buyer. But then the Sao Paulo government intervened and a local automaker, CAOA, expressed interest.  CAOA, Ford and the Sao Paulo state government announced in September that they had reached a preliminary deal, but needed 45 days to carry out due diligence. That time period has already expired, and neither side has provided an explanation. CAOA declined to comment.  CAOA got its start as a Ford dealership, but expanded into manufacturing with a contract with Hyundai and later bought 50% of Chinese automaker Chery\u2019s [CHERY.UL] operation in Brazil.

Ford has been seeking to recover from a slump in sales unprecedented for a major global automaker in China, with sales sinking 26% last year after a 37% drop in 2018.  Company sources have previously said those sales were hurt by an aging model lineup, a breakdown in relationships with its joint venture partners and dealers, as well as missteps by past management teams.  China sales for the second quarter climbed to 158,589 units, Ford said in a statement, attributing the rise to a stronger vehicle lineup including new sport-utility vehicles and locally-made luxury Lincoln cars and \u201cstrong demand following the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions\u201d.  By contrast, rival General Motors GM.N said its sales in China for the quarter declined 5.3% to 713,600 units.

Ford said it has $1.26 billion of remaining principal left on the loan.

Ford officials said the action was part of the $11 billion global restructuring previously forecast by the U.S. automaker, of which it had accounted for $4.2 billion through the third quarter of 2020. Ford shares closed up more than 3%.  The plant closures affect about 5,000 employees, mostly in Brazil, Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said on a conference call with reporters.  Industry vehicle sales fell 26% in Brazil last year and are not expected to rebound to 2019 levels until 2023 with an emphasis on less profitable fleet sales, Ford said.  \u201cWe know these are very difficult, but necessary, actions to create a healthy and sustainable business,\u201d Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in a statement. \u201cWe are moving to a lean, asset-light business model by ceasing production in Brazil.\u201d  Ford officials said the plant closures are part of the company\u2019s strategy to achieve 8% global operating margins. Ford, which has operated in Brazil for more than a century, has begun discussions with its unions and others about the layoffs.  Brazil\u2019s Economy Ministry lamented Ford\u2019s decision to end production in the country and said it reinforced the need for reforms to improve the business climate.  In Cama\u00e7ari, in northeastern Brazil, the union called an emergency meeting at the factory gates at the first shift on Tuesday to take a stance on the loss of 4,059 jobs.  \u201cThis very hard blow took us by surprise. We never imagined that Ford could close its factories in Brazil,\u201d said union leader Julio Bonfim in a video message to the workers.  The closures marked another retreat by Ford in a developing market after the Dearborn, Michigan-based company last month called off its auto joint venture with India\u2019s Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.  As a result of the plant closures, Ford will end sales in South America of EcoSport SUV, Ka subcompact car and T4 SUV once inventories are sold.  Ford retains a plant in Argentina and another in Uruguay.  Ford said it will maintain its product development center in Bahia, its proving ground in Tatu\u00ed, S\u00e3o Paulo, and its regional headquarters in S\u00e3o Paulo.  Of the $4.1 billion in charges, Ford said it expects to record about $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and about $1.6 billion in 2021.

FILE PHOTO: Ford logo is pictured at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay  The venture, valued at $275 million, will see Ford F.N enlist Mahindra MAHM.NS as a partner for developing and selling vehicles in India and emerging markets using the U.S. automaker's production facilities in the country.  By shifting to a joint venture, Ford is also changing its strategy for India, where it has long run an independent operation. The South Asian nation, where auto sales are slumping, once promised growth for global carmakers, many of which are now frustrated after working hard to gain a foothold.  Ford\u2019s decision comes at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration is trying to boost local manufacturing by cutting corporate tax rates and offering cheap loans to push car sales.  Under pressure from shareholders to make profits, Ford has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years.  Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett said the partnership was \u201cnot only a fitness objective\u201d but also gave the automaker a platform to expand in a market like India, where it wished it had done things differently.  \u201cWe have other emerging markets where we need to apply the same kind of understanding,\u201d Hackett told reporters in Mumbai over a video conference from Dearborn, Michigan.  Ford, which has invested more than $2 billion in India over two decades, will take an $800 million to $900 million non-cash charge to reflect the writedown of its Indian assets, it said in a separate exchange filing.  By shelving efforts to go it alone in emerging markets, including India, Ford will save capital for more urgent and potentially profitable endeavours - such as defending its U.S. truck franchise or fixing its operations in China.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Ford has also executed a significant alliance with Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE to share the costs of electric cars, commercial vehicles and developing autonomous vehicles.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a disappointment when I see Ford sitting at the passenger seat, while Mahindra drives, if that will be the arrangement,\u201d said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst, automotive forecasting at consultancy IHS Markit.  \u201cBut looking at a global scenario of rapid transformation in powertrains and a shift to electric, this is a better way to mitigate investment risks,\u201d he added.  INDIA OPERATIONS  The two companies have for months been negotiating the deal which will see Ford take a 49% stake in the new entity, ending most of its independent India operations, Reuters reported in April.  Under the terms of the deal, which is likely to be finalised by mid-2020, Ford will transfer its local automotive assets, including both car manufacturing plants, and employees to the new entity, the companies said. Ford will retain its engine plant at Sanand in western India and global business center in Chennai in the south.  The new entity, which will be operationally managed by Mahindra, will develop and sell Ford brand vehicles in India and export Ford and Mahindra brand vehicles to emerging markets.  Mahindra will bring its sourcing, supply chain and Indian market knowledge to the table and will in return get access to Ford\u2019s global reach and technology.  \u201cThese synergies lead to sizable business opportunities to create new products, leverage brand and distribution assets, enter new markets and seize leadership,\u201d said Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group.  In India, Ford currently manufactures and sells its cars via its wholly owned subsidiary. In 2017 it formed a strategic alliance with Mahindra under which, among other things, they would develop new cars together.  The companies expect to launch three new utility vehicles under the joint venture, starting with a midsize SUV. They are also jointly developing electric vehicles for emerging markets.

Ford confirmed its new electric SUV will be called the Mustang Mach-E ahead of a debut event scheduled for Los Angeles on Sunday. Until now, the Mustang name has been used only on a line of sporty coupes associated with Detroit\u2019s 1960s muscle car era.  Customers in the United States, Canada and Europe can start ordering the electric vehicles on Nov. 17, Ford said.  While Mustang coupes are built in Michigan, the Mach E will be built at a factory in Cuatitlan, Mexico.  The Mach E is the first of a more than dozen all-electric automobiles the company plans to launch by 2022 with an investment of $11.5 billion as it moves away from traditional gasoline-powered cars.  Electric vehicle market leader Tesla IncTSLA.O has used speed and power to sell its vehicles, along with upgradable software and big display screens.

FILE PHOTO: The Ford logo is seen at the Ford oldest Brazil plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil September 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Rahel Patrasso  The U.S. automaker is pushing into electric vehicles at a time when car manufacturers around the world are racing to slash carbon dioxide emissions in order to comply with more stringent environmental standards in the European Union.  Ford\u2019s launches include electric variants of the Kuga and Puma SUVs and the Mondeo sedan. The automaker also plans to launch nine other electric vehicles by 2024 in Europe, including a new Mustang-inspired electric sports utility vehicle next year.  The automaker unveiled the models at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, and said it would partner with six leading energy suppliers across Europe to provide home-charging wall box installation services.  The carmaker, like its rivals, has been facing stagnant demand and rising costs as it invests billions of dollars in electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles in efforts to boost sales.  The company\u2019s European business has been losing money for years and the pressure to restructure its operations increased after rival General Motors raised profits by selling its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to France\u2019s Peugeot SA.  In a bid to slash development and manufacturing costs, Ford tied up with Volkswagen <AG VOWG_p.DE> in July to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles.  VW agreed to plow $3.1 billion into Ford\u2019s Argo AI self-driving unit, but estimated it could realize up to $20 billion in revenue by sharing its MEB electric vehicle architecture with Ford in Europe.  Ford had said it expects to build more than 600,000 electric vehicles in Europe over six years, sourcing components and the vehicle underpinnings from VW, helping both to cut costs.  The cooperation with VW on electric vehicles in Europe is part of Ford\u2019s previously disclosed $11.5 billion EV investment worldwide.  The challenge of investing in low-emission vehicles while having to overhaul combustion engines to meet new clean-air rules, has forced Europe\u2019s carmakers to slash fixed costs and streamline their model portfolios.  The company will also introduce a smartphone app that will let its users and operators locate, navigate to and pay for charging.  Ford said it expects its electric vehicle line-up to surpass sales of gasoline and diesel models by 2022 in Europe, and expects to sell 1 million electric vehicles by then.

GM  GM has revealed one of its future EVs \u2014 the Cruise Origin self-driving shuttle \u2014 and shared details in early March with analysts and media of 13 other future EVs for the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. Suppliers familiar with GM\u2019s plans have shared additional details.  Buick is planning to introduce a midsize crossover and a companion SUV in 2023, the automaker said. It also expects to launch a compact crossover about the same time, according to suppliers.  Cadillac showed off three upcoming EVs \u2014 the Lyriq midsize crossover, the Celestiq luxury sedan and a large, unnamed SUV about the size and shape of its Escalade.

Ford is also the No. 1 commercial vehicle brand in Europe, and has led the commercial van market in Britain, which is Europe\u2019s largest, for 55 years.  Regulators in Europe and in some U.S. cities are stepping up pressure on businesses to replace diesel or gasoline-fueled delivery vans with electric models to reduce pollution in city centers.  In the United States, Amazon.com Inc, has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from start-up Rivian, the first of which will be delivered in 2021 and built in Normal, Illinois. Ford has a separate partnership with Rivian.  The electric Transit will not be related to the Rivian van, said Ted Cannis, Ford\u2019s director of electrification.

Leading the charge is a trim new mid-size Bronco sport utility vehicle, based on the Ranger pickup. Ford insiders have hinted there are more Bronco models to follow, including a smaller, car-based Bronco Sport later this year, with rumors of a Bronco pickup and a high-performance Bronco Raptor said to be under consideration.  The automaker is slated to reveal details of the 2021 Bronco on March 17.  Since announcing the return of the Bronco three years ago, Ford executives have made it clear the latest edition is targeted at the long-lived Jeep Wrangler. The rivalry dates back to mid-1965, when the original Bronco was launched as a compact two-door SUV, aimed squarely at the Jeep CJ, the predecessor of the Wrangler.  But Ford does not intend to stop there. It sees the potential to build a franchise around the Bronco name, a feat accomplished by Jeep over a period of eight decades, though under at least six owners.  The Jeep family now includes six nameplates in North America, from the tiny Renegade to the new Gladiator pickup, with several additional models sold overseas and more coming.  The Jeep brand generates a huge share of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s profit, analysts say. So much so that Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas three years ago estimated the Jeep brand alone was worth 120% of the parent company\u2019s market value \u2014 more than $20 billion at the time.  Last year, Fiat Chrysler sold 1.5 million Jeeps globally, down from 1.6 million in 2018. That seems like a distant target for the resurrected Bronco, for which Ford has relatively modest aspirations: About 125,000 sales in its first year, suppliers say. Sales of the earlier Bronco peaked in 1979 at around 100,000.  Ford hinted at the general shape and size of the new Bronco last fall when it revealed a racing version called Bronco R.  The new model goes into production this spring at Ford\u2019s Wayne, Michigan, plant. The 2021 Bronco Sport, which shares underpinnings with the Ford Escape, is slated for production this fall at Ford\u2019s Hermosillo plant in Mexico.

Ford has acknowledged that mistakes proved costly in its introduction of the redesigned Explorer SUV.  Electric carmaker Tesla Inc TSLA.O has shown how connected vehicles and over-the-air updates can build customer loyalty, Farley said, and Ford could better profit from the data generated in vehicles and improve its customer service.  Ford also will focus more heavily on advantages in commercial vehicle sales.  \u201cThis is the signature execution opportunity for Ford and growth opportunity for Ford,\u201d Farley said.  He also cited a focus on growing the electric vehicle business of the No. 2 U.S. automaker.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company named Farley its COO on Feb. 7, and promised investors it would kick a slow-moving turnaround into higher gear.  On Tuesday, shares hit their lowest in more than a decade as a rapidly escalating coronavirus epidemic that began in China threatened sales outside the United States.

The Mach E has become within Ford a high-profile test for a restructuring that has been marred by profit warnings, costly quality problems and the troubled launch this year of another important vehicle, the Ford Explorer sport utility.  For Chief Executive Jim Hackett, the Mach E\u2019s aggressive design and futuristic interior represent a long-awaited, visible sign of the overhaul of the company\u2019s product creation process that he has tried to explain to skeptical Wall Street analysts for the past two years.  By accelerating the \u201cclock speed\u201d of vehicle development, cutting overlapping product architectures to just five from 13 and extending the company\u2019s most successful brands to new products, Ford could slash $20 billion out of a five-year, 2018-2023 product plan, Hackett told Reuters.  \u201cThis is the first thing we generated out of this new thinking,\u201d Hackett said in an interview ahead of the Mach E unveiling. \u201cWe have a lot more coming.\u201d  For Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., the Mustang Mach E puts together two previously conflicting goals: His desire for Ford to be a leader in clean cars and make the automaker carbon-neutral by 2030, and his personal love of the Mustang and its growling V-8 engine.  \u201cWe are really pushing our chips in on the table with this vehicle,\u201d Ford said in an interview ahead of the Mach E\u2019s unveiling. The automaker has said it will spend $11.5 billion developing electric and hybrid models by 2022.  The Mach E started with humble ambitions.  The SUV originally was to be what Ted Cannis, Ford\u2019s global director for electrification, called a \u201ccompliance\u201d play - an electric variant of a front-wheel drive internal combustion vehicle, aimed at generating emissions credits to comply with clean air regulations at low cost. There was no link to the Mustang\u2019s muscle car image.  Boring electric cars were the norm for Ford and other legacy automakers. Then Tesla Inc in 2013 launched its Model S - an electric car that looked like a sporty European luxury sedan with a giant screen for a dashboard and entertainment and functional features that could be upgraded with over-the-air software updates.  Tesla\u2019s market value is now higher than Ford\u2019s.  Ford\u2019s own customer research showed dull electric cars were a mistake, Cannis and other executives said.  \u2018MUSTANG EXPERIENCE\u2019  Those doubts came to a head in mid-2017 when Hackett, then newly appointed, reviewed the design for the electric SUV with Executive Vice President Jim Farley, who has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old.  \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Hackett recalled saying. Farley agreed, and Hackett said, \u201cWe tear it up.\u201d  The team designing the vehicle started over, using a new architecture engineered from the start to be a battery electric vehicle, instead of the original plan to use a modified version of an internal combustion engine vehicle, Ford executives said.  The Mustang muscle car\u2019s distinctive \u201cshark face\u201d front end and body proportions were adapted to a new skin, and under the floor Ford designed a new battery pack that can deliver up to 300 miles (483 km) of range in an \u201cextended range\u201d version.  The re-do had to be accomplished much faster than normal to stay on target for a fall 2020 launch.  \u201cWe were super behind time,\u201d said exterior designer Chris Walter during a briefing on the vehicle ahead of the Los Angeles debut.  A concept for new dashboard software and a display using a 15.5-inch (39 cm) diagonal screen was pulled together in just 90 days by a 15-person group that called itself Team Menlo - a reference to Thomas Edison\u2019s Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory. A paper prototype of the new screen used an empty Keurig coffee pod to represent a large control knob.  The overhaul cost money, but Ford product development chief Hau Thai-tang told Reuters the dedicated electric vehicle architecture should allow for 25% to 30% improvements in manufacturing efficiency to help offset the cost.  The final call on using the Mustang name came from the top, and was not given easily.  \u201cI was dead set against it, initially,\u201d Bill Ford said. Ford said he started to warm to the idea as he saw the styling and the performance data for the vehicle.  Ford said he did not grant his approval until earlier this year after driving a prototype.  \u201cIt felt like a Mustang experience to me,\u201d he said.  TURNING POINTS  This is not the first time a challenge to reinvent the Mustang has emboldened Ford employees to break with convention during a rough patch in the company\u2019s history.  The original Mustang launched in 1964 was derived from a mainstream Falcon compact car, and quickly became a hit, far outselling the company\u2019s projections.  In the early 1990s, with the economy in a slump, a small group of Ford employees rebelled against a plan to transform the rear-wheel drive Mustang into a front-wheel drive car developed by Ford\u2019s then-partner, Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp . That project became a laboratory for cutting the costs of product engineering by putting representatives of different functions on the same team.  The Mach E is another turning point, Hackett said. \u201cThe science project platform for EVs is now gone.\u201d","178":"WASHINGTON\/SEOUL Oct 26 (Reuters) - The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) on Monday delayed a decision on South Korea\u2019s chemicals and electric vehicle battery maker LG Chem Ltd\u2019s complaint its cross-town rival SK Innovation Co Ltd misappropriated electric vehicle battery trade secrets.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of SK Innovation is seen in front of its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, February 3, 2017.

The ITC added that SK Innovation can replace or repair its batteries in Kia vehicles sold to U.S. consumers. The move could effectively ban the company from supplying EV batteries in the United States unless the company can source all the needed materials there - a step analysts say is not feasible.  The ITC said the decision would allow the automakers to transition to new suppliers for these programs.  LG Chem\u2019s wholly owned battery subsidiary LG Energy Solution, a EV battery supplier to Tesla Inc and General Motors Co, praised the ruling.  \u201cSKI\u2019s total disregard of our warnings and intellectual property rights gave us no choice but to file this case,\u201d Kim Jong-hyun, the CEO of LG Energy Solution, said in a statement.

Biden has made electric vehicles and reducing vehicle emissions a top priority.  \u201cWe have serious concerns about the commercial and operational implications of this decision for the future of our EV-battery facility in Commerce, Georgia,\u201d SK said in a separate statement, adding it believes the \u201cruling could have a serious adverse impact on President Biden\u2019s policies to combat climate change and expand the electrification of the US auto fleet in coming years.\u201d  A White House spokesman declined to comment on the ruling.  An official at LG Energy Solution, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the company was open to settlement talks with SK Innovation. If the two companies reach an agreement, the ITC\u2019s case will be dropped.  In February 2020, the ITC made a preliminary ruling in favour of LG Chem, which has since split off its battery business as LG Energy Solution.  SK Innovation is building two EV battery factories in Georgia to manufacture batteries for us in Volkswagen and Ford electric vehicles. LG Chem has set up an EV battery cell venture plant with GM in Ohio.  \u201cWith the ITC\u2019s final ruling, SK Innovation is now facing scenarios that they would not be able to operate their business in the United States, which will likely accelerate settlement talks between LG and SK,\u201d said Han Sang-won, an analyst at Daishin Securities, adding that SK Innovation needs to settle the lawsuit to better operate its EV battery business.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  \u201cThese are new growth initiatives that could create a lot of value for the company,\u201d Farley told Reuters, after Ford announced that he will succeed Jim Hackett as the automaker\u2019s fourth CEO since 2014.  In addition to Ford\u2019s work on self-driving vehicles, \u201cthese are concrete areas that will change Ford,\u201d Farley said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to impact the company\u2019s future look and feel.\u201d  In the meantime, Farley, 58, must wrestle with a painful restructuring of Ford\u2019s global operations amid the ravages of the coronavirus crisis that has saddled the No. 2 U.S. automaker with large amounts of debt.  Executive Chairman Bill Ford said the company had not considered outside candidates because \u201cour board felt that we were on the right path\u201d with Farley.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect any big surprises,\u201d Ford said in terms of additional management changes.  Farley, who joined the company in 2007, was named chief operating officer in March soon after his main internal rival for the top role at the automaker, Joe Hinrichs, announced his retirement.  Farley has a reputation within Ford for being a skilled political operator with sharp elbows, which has garnered him some loyal fans but made him unpopular with others.  Hackett and Farley will work together during a two-month transition period, and Hackett, 65, will continue as a company advisor through March 2021.  Ford shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading, after initially rising 3% on news of Farley\u2019s succession as CEO.  The stock has lost nearly 40% of its value since Hackett took the reins as chief executive in May 2017 and has been at lows not seen since the Great Recession in 2009.  In the year to date, Ford shares have sunk 26% and its market capitalization of $27 billion is one-tenth that of rival Tesla\u2019s.  HANDPICKED  Hackett was handpicked for the top job at Ford by chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford. Hackett had no automotive experience, and his tenure at the automaker was rocky and accompanied by persistent rumors that he was about to be ousted, but Bill Ford stuck loyally by his chosen CEO for more than three years.  Hackett\u2019s relationship with Wall Street has, at times, been strained. Analysts have expressed frustration at his preference for often-impenetrable corporate language, instead of clear updates on where Ford was heading, and a perceived lack of urgency in restructuring the automaker.  Last week, Ford reported a quarterly profit thanks to an investment by Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in its self-driving Argo AI unit, more than offsetting an operating loss caused by a coronavirus-induced production shutdown.  Ford said it expects a full-year loss, but added it should have ample cash on hand through the rest of 2020, even if global demand falls further or the coronavirus pandemic forces further shutdowns of vehicle assembly plants.  Executives insisted that although the company had dramatically scaled back the amount it will spend on a global restructuring of its business, that overhaul had not stalled.  \u2018STEADY HANDS\u2019  The No.2 U.S. automaker also faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market.  Ford lost $771 million in China last year, about half its 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. The company has struggled to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017.  In an SEC filing, Ford said Farley\u2019s annualized base salary increased to $1,700,000 from $1,400,000, while Hackett\u2019s remained unchanged at $1.8 million. Farley will receive stock options valued at $4,000,000.  Hackett\u2019s total compensation, including stock options, fell to $17.4 million in 2019 from $17.8 million in 2018. He will cease to have access to private aircraft for personal travel effective Oct. 1.  Farley previously led Lincoln, South America, Ford of Europe and all of Ford\u2019s global markets in successive roles.  In the last two months, Ford has unveiled a redesigned version of its highly profitable F-150 pickup truck and a family of off-road Bronco SUVs as part of efforts to revitalize its lineup and pay down money borrowed to ride out the economic shock of the pandemic.","195":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Tuesday it plans to hire 350 more U.S. workers to expand production capacity for its electric F-150 pickup truck in Michigan and add assembly of electric commercial vans at a plant near Kansas City, Missouri.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  The company said it also will add a second vehicle at the Mexican factory that is already set to build the Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle. Ford did not disclose how many people would be hired to build the additional vehicle in Mexico, which would \u201cshare a similar electrifed platform\u201d as the Mach-E.  Ford will invest $150 million to add production of electric vehicle motors and transaxles at a transmission factory in suburban Detroit, retaining 225 jobs.  The automaker\u2019s latest electric vehicle investments are part of an $11.5 billion plan mapped out through 2022. Ford has promised the United Auto Workers union that it will invest $6 billion in U.S. factories to build electric vehicles.  Ford will increase production capacity for an electric version of its F-150 large pickup by 50% from its original plans, adding another 200 permanent jobs at a complex near its headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. Those jobs would be on top of 300 jobs previously promised for the electric F-150 line.  The electric F-150, scheduled to go on sale in 2022, will compete with electric pickups planned by Tesla Inc TSLA.O, General Motors Co GM.N, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI and several startup companies, in a segment that was not on most automakers' product plans just a few years ago.  Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford\u2019s Americas and International Markets groups, said the decision to boost electric F-150 output was taken after the truck\u2019s debut in June.  Based on the response to the work-oriented electric truck from government agencies, commercial fleets and individual buyers, \u201cwe started working on a substantial increase,\u201d Galhotra said in an interview.  Galhotra did not say how many electric F-150s Ford will be able to build.  Ford will invest $100 million and hire 150 workers to build electric versions of its Transit commercial van, scheduled to go on sale in 2022. The electric Transit will enter a field that is racing from virtually non-existent to crowded as established automakers and startups compete to respond to demand from e-commerce delivery companies for electrically driven and digitally connected vehicles.","196":"A federal judge has declined to certify a class of female employees at two Ford Motor Co plants in Chicago who claim they were subjected to rampant sexual harassment and assault, saying they have too little in common to move forward as a group.

FILE PHOTO: A visitor is reflected as he takes pictures of a new Ford Aspire car during its launch in New Delhi, India, October 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Anushree Fadnavis\/File Photo  The two companies have for months been structuring the deal to create a new entity in which Ford will hold a 49% stake, while Indian rival Mahindra will own 51%, Reuters reported in April.  Under the deal Ford will transfer most of its automotive assets and employees in India to the new company, but the carmaker will retain an engine plant in Sanand in the western state of Gujarat, according to the two sources, who asked not to be named as the talks are private.  A Ford spokeswoman did not comment directly on the deal, but said the company was engaged with Mahindra \u201cto develop avenues of strategic cooperation that help us achieve commercial, manufacturing and business efficiencies\u201d.  Mahindra did not respond to a request for comment.  By shifting to a joint venture, Ford is changing its decades-old India strategy focused on running an independent operation. Under pressure from shareholders to make profits, the U.S. carmaker has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years.  Ford\u2019s decision is a setback for the country at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration is trying to boost local manufacturing by cutting corporate tax rates and offering cheap loans to push car sales. Sale of cars by manufacturers to dealers have fallen at their steepest pace in two decades.  Ford\u2019s two manufacturing plants - one in Chennai in southern India and the other in Sanand which was inaugurated in 2015 - will be moved to the new joint venture, but Ford will keep the engine plant at Sanand. Together, they have a maximum annual manufacturing capacity of 440,000 vehicles.  Ford-brand cars will continue to be built and sold in India and exported by the new company, one of the sources said.  Over two decades, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford invested more than $2 billion in India but it has consistently struggled - it currently has a share of about 3% in a market where Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS is the top player with a 50% share.  \u201cThe Mahindra deal is an opportunity for Ford to recover some of the money it has invested in India,\u201d said one of the sources.

Health care providers and states are preparing for a new type of vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna Inc that require lower temperatures for storage.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing this so that we can make the vaccine available to our employees on a voluntary basis,\u201d Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said.  Details of how Ford will use the freezers, which are expected to be delivered by year end, are still being worked out, she said. Ford screens its workers in-plant and, if COVID-19 testing is required, has partnerships with local healthcare providers.  Assembly workers are considered essential in most states, but not at the top of the list for vaccines, which are expected to be distributed first to healthcare workers and nursing home residents.  Automakers have been largely able to avoid spread of the virus among hourly workers in their assembly plants after a two-month shutdown earlier in the year, but COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are spiking in the United States, especially in the Midwest.  Felker did not know which company is supplying Ford with the freezers. Major manufacturers include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, PHC Corp of North America, Luxembourg\u2019s B Medical Systems, Stirling Ultracold and Helmer Scientific.  Some specialty freezer makers have warned of months-long waits for units.  Ford, which decided to buy the freezers on its own and is not working with other companies or states, did not disclose how much it spent, but the specialized freezers required by Pfizer\u2019s vaccine can cost $5,000 to $15,000 apiece, according to industry officials.  General Motors Co said it had not purchased freezers at this time. \u201cWe are taking steps to be prepared to make vaccines available to our employees when the time is right and vaccines are available to us,\u201d GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it is studying the most effective approach to distributing vaccines to employees when they become available.  Officials at Toyota Motor Corp, and the United Auto Workers union, which represents most U.S. hourly workers at the Detroit automakers, did not have an immediate comment.  A Michigan Department of Health spokeswoman said the agency was not aware of companies seeking to buy these freezers. Lynn Sutfin said state officials surveyed healthcare providers and health departments and are aware of about 50 ultra-cold freezers in Michigan.

FILE PHOTO: Ford's North American commercial vehicles chief Ted Cannis announces the all-electric Transit van at the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S. March 3, 2020. Picture taken March 3, 2020. Ford Motor Co\/Bill McCausland\/Handout via REUTERS  But it\u2019s not just more trucks and vans that Farley wants to sell. As Farley prepares to takes over as chief executive on Oct. 1, he is betting Ford can transform its commercial vehicle business to generate recurring revenue through sales of services that take advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its F-Series pickup truck and Transit vans.  \u201cThink of it as a second F-150,\u201d Farley told Reuters, referring to the U.S. automaker\u2019s lucrative full-size truck business that generates $50 billion in annual revenue. \u201cWe have the F-150 everyone loves. There\u2019s this other business out here that\u2019s huge.\u201d  \u201cThink of the data being more powerful than the fuel economy of the vehicle,\u201d he added.  Automakers like Ford have talked for a long time about generating post-sale revenue from connected vehicles, but they have struggled to deliver. As a result, Ford has been abandoned by growth-oriented investors, despite its lucrative F-series franchise.  Ford now is trying to show it can grow, and build a competitive moat around its commercial vehicle business before electric car leader Tesla Inc, other startups and larger technology players like Amazon.com Inc enter those markets.  The U.S. market alone last year accounted for more than $58 billion in sales of commercial trucks and vans, everything from Class-1 regular pickups to Class-7 heavy-duty trucks like the Ford F-750, according to ACT Research.  Farley is counting on a new hire to help build data-generated revenue from Ford\u2019s commercial vehicle business: Alex Purdy, former head of agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co\u2019s Silicon Valley office.  At Deere, Purdy led efforts to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) on the farm through smart equipment and founded John Deere Labs to help build a \u201csticky\u201d relationship with customers. Deere\u2019s aftermarket parts and services business accounted for about 15% to 20% of $35 billion in sales last year.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In his first interview since his May hiring to lead Ford\u2019s commercial vehicle connectivity business, Purdy said he \u201chelped transition an industrial goods business that thought about metal bending into a service business.\u201d  Among the products developed by Deere while Purdy worked there were the ExactEmerge planter that offers improved seed spacing at higher speeds, freeing up workers for other jobs; and the See and Spray distribution system that will use smart cameras to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy crops, allowing for reduced use of herbicides when it\u2019s introduced next year.  Purdy, a 35-year-old former investment banker and consultant, grew up on a farm in Okotoks, outside Calgary, Canada, and describes himself as \u201cpassionate about smart connected vehicles, automotive, AI.\u201d  Ford is the leading commercial vehicle brand in the United States and Europe - with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively - thanks to the F-Series trucks as well as its Transit vans.  \u201cFord is the 900-pound gorilla in the commercial business,\u201d said Rhett Ricart, a big Ford commercial vehicle dealer in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cThey\u2019ve always had this competitive advantage.\u201d  Earlier this year, Ricart moved into a new 116,000-square-foot commercial truck facility that dwarfs the old 18,000-square-foot building, and said he looks forward to working with Ford as they roll out additional connected services.  Purdy and other Ford officials want Ford\u2019s commercial customers to regularly pay for services, creating a revenue stream that flows throughout the vehicle\u2019s life, beyond a one-time transaction every few years.  Ford officials talk about products as such geolocation services to optimize route planning and reduce gasoline usage, predictive products that allow for faster oil changes and fleet management operations.  \u201cWhen you measure time as a commodity like money, there are lots of those kinds of experiences that customers are willing to pay for because they\u2019re in the productivity business,\u201d Farley said.  The goal for Ford is to lower the total cost of ownership for its commercial customers; raise productivity, such as increased package delivery; and reduce downtime for customer vehicles, said Ted Cannis, head of Ford\u2019s North American commercial vehicle business.  \u201cSo now the total addressable market, instead of being just new-vehicle sales is the entire process - parts, service, accessories, connected services,\u201d he said.  Hans Schep, head of Ford\u2019s European commercial vehicle business, said the shift in focus is playing out in meetings on quality. Five years ago, those meetings were about how to reduce Ford\u2019s warranty costs, he said. Now, the discussions are about how to keep its customers\u2019 vehicles on the road.  Ford\u2019s push in commercial vehicles will work hand-in-hand with the push to electrify its vehicles, including the F-150 and Transit.  As part of the efforts, Ford and Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said in June they would make up to 8 million units of mid-sized pickup trucks and commercial vans over the lifecycle of the vehicles, starting in 2022. Farley believes the automakers' alliance will allow Ford to use their combined scale to build its European commercial vehicle business even more.","202":"FILE PHOTO: The Ford logo is seen at the Ford oldest Brazil plant after company announced its closure in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Brazil, February 21, 2019.

Sales of Ford\u2019s pick-up trucks rose 5% to 240,387, their best third-quarter performance in 14 years, even as overall sales fell 4.9% to 580,251 units, hurt by lower demand for the company\u2019s passenger cars including the Taurus sedan.  Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sales of its Ram pick-up trucks surged 14% to 161,635, marginally lifting overall sales by 0.1% to 565,034 units.  GM\u2019s sales fell slightly short of U.S. car shopping website Edmunds\u2019 forecast of 748,746 vehicles, while Ford and Fiat Chrysler beat expectations. Edmunds had expected third-quarter sales for the industry to rise by 0.8% to 4.3 million vehicles, led by volume gains at GM.  Edmunds had forecast Ford\u2019s sales at 570,179 vehicles and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s at 558,302.  The results showed September U.S. light vehicle seasonally adjusted annualized pace was tracking 17.2 million vehicles, above consensus of 17 million, J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said.  Shares of GM fell 4.7% to their near four-month low of $34.41, while those of Ford slumped 5.2% to more than six-month low of $8.44.

The Dearborn, Michigan-based company has slashed costs during the COVID-19 outbreak to weather the shutdown, including cutting salaries of executives and white-collar employees.  Ford also moved to cut spending on projects, saying on Tuesday it was pushing back its commercial autonomous vehicle services by a year to 2022 and that it had decided not to develop a previously announced luxury electric Lincoln sport utility vehicle in partnership with electric vehicle maker Rivian.  Ford shares were down more than 4.6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after closing the regular session at $5.38.  Ford\u2019s market value of $20.6 billion is now less than the $35 billion in cash it had on hand as of last Friday, an indication that investors expect the company to burn through significant amounts of cash before a recovery takes hold.  Ford had preannounced the pandemic-fueled first-quarter loss earlier this month. That warning came the same day the company raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors.  Last month, Ford moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business.  \u2018AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE\u2019  Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states beginning to reopen their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can be restarted.  In an earlier conference call with reporters, Stone, the CFO, said the company would restart U.S. production \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d but did not give a timeline.  Ford\u2019s captive finance arm posted $30 million in first-quarter pretax earnings, down $771 million from a year ago. That included $600 million in additional-loss reserves, plus higher depreciation of former lease vehicle sales and expected lease defaults \u2013 in preparation for the estimated future impact of the coronavirus on the finance unit\u2019s performance.  Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N are aiming to resume production some time in May, and are negotiating with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents their U.S. hourly workers, about how to safely resume vehicle production. FCA and GM are scheduled to report quarterly results on May 5 and 6, respectively.  Last week, the UAW said it was \u201ctoo soon and too risky\u201d to reopen auto plants in early May.  Ford, whose credit rating has been downgraded to \u201cjunk\u201d status by Standard & Poor\u2019s, said previously it hoped to resume production in April at plants that make its most profitable vehicles, but subsequently backed off those plans.  Ford said on Tuesday it would restart most of its European manufacturing starting next Monday. It has already resumed operations in China, where the pandemic began and where sales fell 35% in the first quarter. U.S. sales fell 12.5%.  Once North American production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand bounces back.  Ford said it expected to spend $700 million to $1.2 billion on its global restructuring this year, but executives said the automaker was looking at additional actions.","213":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) -Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it was calling off its automotive joint venture with India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd due to the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. (ford.to\/2X2V6Gg)  The companies said in separate statements that the decision was driven by changes in the global economy over the last 15 months, causing both to reassess their capital allocation priorities.  \u201cThe global economy and business environment are not the same as October last year,\u201d Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said.  The deadline to finalize a joint venture between the companies was Dec. 31, and both made the decision to end the agreement rather than close a deal or extend the timetable to do so, Reid said.  In October 2019, Ford and Mahindra said they would form a joint venture in India in a move to cut costs for developing and producing vehicles for emerging markets. The companies said at the time they expected to launch three new utility vehicles, starting with a midsize SUV, and also jointly develop electric vehicles for emerging markets.  Asked if those vehicles were now canceled, Reid said, \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s nothing to talk about other than the joint venture isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Ford said its independent operations in India will continue.  Pressure to pursue mergers or alliances in the auto industry has grown as the costs of developing electric and self-driving vehicles drives companies to preserve funds for those efforts. France\u2019s PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV expect to close their $38 billion merger in the first quarter of 2021.  Ford executives have repeatedly touted a company strategy that includes partnerships, including with Mahindra, as a way to increase efficiencies and reduce costs on its path to achieve 8% global operating profit margins. Reid said that strategy would continue, when asked whether Ford would look to partner with another automaker in southeast Asia.  Mahindra said in its statement that the decision will not have any impact on its product plan, and that it is accelerating efforts to develop electric SUVs.","214":"Slideshow ( 4 images )  DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday unveiled the next generation of its F-150 pickup in an online event, showing a truck with a familiar look but that incorporates the automaker's new strategy for profiting from software and connectivity.  The new F-150 and the soon-to-launch Mach-E electric SUV will be the first Ford vehicles equipped with electronic systems that allow for extensive over-the-air software upgrades. Rival Tesla Inc TSLA.O pioneered the use of smartphone-style updates to improve vehicles and generate revenue long after the sale. General Motors CoGM.N has launched comparable technology on several vehicles.  Now the F-150, part of the best-selling line of vehicles in the United States with annual sales equivalent to Tesla\u2019s current volume, will bring upgradeable, fully connected vehicle technology to the mainstream market. Ford will offer a hybrid version of the F-150. An electric model is expected within two years.  The new F-150\u2019s design does not shock like the Tesla Cybertruck, with an exterior hard to distinguish from the current model. When it launches this fall, the truck will aim for traditional buyers in the U.S. heartland, down to the American flag stamped into the dashboard.  However, customers who opt to pay for it will be able to download software to enable hands-free driving on highways when it becomes available next year, Ford said. Commercial customers will be offered software that can help with routing or tracking vehicles in a fleet.  Ford\u2019s chief operating officer, Jim Farley, said in an interview that after-sale software upgrades for customers may not be the biggest benefit the company gets from connecting F-series trucks to the cloud. Connected F-150s can tell Ford when there\u2019s a problem with engine control software, and enable a quick fix.  \u201cIt\u2019s a gamechanger for us,\u201d Farley said. The time to detect a warranty problem \u201cgoes from weeks and months to days and hours.\u201d  Ford will also be able to know what features customers use and how, and what equipment could be safely omitted to cut costs. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to guess anymore,\u201d he said.","215":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N expects to have its U.S. vehicle assembly plants return by early July to building at the rates they did before the coronavirus pandemic shut down the U.S. auto industry for two months, a top executive said on Wednesday.

The Mach E has become within Ford a high-profile test for a restructuring that has been marred by profit warnings, costly quality problems and the troubled launch this year of another important vehicle, the Ford Explorer sport utility.  For Chief Executive Jim Hackett, the Mach E\u2019s aggressive design and futuristic interior represent a long-awaited, visible sign of the overhaul of the company\u2019s product creation process he has tried to explain to skeptical Wall Street analysts for the past two years.  By accelerating the \u201cclock speed\u201d of vehicle development, cutting overlapping product architectures to just five from 13 and extending the company\u2019s most successful brands to new products, Ford could slash $20 billion out of a five-year, 2018-2023 product plan, Hackett told Reuters.  \u201cThis is the first thing we generated out of this new thinking,\u201d Hackett said in an interview ahead of the Mach E unveiling. \u201cWe have a lot more coming.\u201d  For Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., the Mustang Mach E puts together two previously conflicting goals: His desire for Ford to be a leader in clean cars and make the automaker carbon-neutral by 2030, and his personal love of the Mustang and its growling V-8 engine.  \u201cWe are really pushing our chips in on the table with this vehicle,\u201d Ford said in an interview ahead of the Mach E\u2019s unveiling. The automaker has said it will spend $11.5 billion developing electric and hybrid models by 2022.  Automakers have struggled to make money on electric vehicles. Bill Ford told Reuters on Sunday after unveiling the Mach E \u201cwill be profitable right from the start.\u201d  Ford\u2019s confidence in the Mach E, and its determination to challenge Tesla, was reflected in the location the company chose to reveal it: An airplane hangar just a short walk from the main offices of Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX operations in Hawthorne, Calif. Musk often uses SpaceX facilities to unveil Tesla\u2019s new models, and has scheduled the debut of his electric pickup truck for somewhere in Los Angeles on Thursday.  Musk replied to Ford\u2019s event with a tweet late Sunday:  \u201cCongratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable\/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too.\u201d  The Mach E started with humble ambitions.  The SUV originally was to be what Ted Cannis, Ford\u2019s global director for electrification, called a \u201ccompliance\u201d play - an electric variant of a front-wheel drive internal combustion vehicle, aimed at generating emissions credits to comply with clean air regulations at low cost. There was no link to Mustang\u2019s muscle car image.  Boring electric cars were the norm for Ford and other legacy automakers. Then Tesla Inc TSLA.O in 2013 launched its Model S - an electric car that looked like a sporty European luxury sedan with a giant screen for a dashboard and entertainment and functional features that could be upgraded with over-the-air software updates.  Tesla\u2019s market value is now higher than Ford\u2019s.  Ford\u2019s own customer research showed dull electric cars were a mistake, Cannis and other executives said.  \u2018MUSTANG EXPERIENCE\u2019  Slideshow ( 12 images )  Those doubts came to a head in mid-2017 when Hackett, then newly appointed, reviewed the design for the electric SUV with Executive Vice President Jim Farley, who has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old.  \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Hackett recalled saying. Farley agreed, and Hackett said, \u201cWe tear it up.\u201d  The team designing the vehicle started over, using a new architecture engineered from the start to be a battery electric vehicle, instead of the original plan to use a modified version of an internal combustion engine vehicle, Ford executives said.  The Mustang muscle car\u2019s distinctive \u201cshark face\u201d front end and body proportions were adapted to a new skin, and under the floor Ford designed a new battery pack that can deliver up to 300 miles (483 km) of range in an \u201cextended range\u201d version.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  The re-do had to be accomplished much faster than normal to stay on target for a fall 2020 launch.  \u201cWe were super behind time,\u201d said exterior designer Chris Walter during a briefing on the vehicle ahead of the Los Angeles debut.  A concept for new dashboard software and a display using a 15.5-inch (39 cm) diagonal screen was pulled together in just 90 days by a 15-person group that called itself Team Menlo - a reference to Thomas Edison\u2019s Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory. A paper prototype of the new screen used an empty Keurig coffee pod to represent a large control knob.  The overhaul cost money, but Ford product development chief Hau Thai-tang told Reuters the dedicated electric vehicle architecture should allow for 25% to 30% improvements in manufacturing efficiency to help offset the cost.  The final call on using the Mustang name came from the top, and was not given easily.  \u201cI was dead set against it, initially,\u201d Bill Ford said. Ford said he started to warm to the idea as he saw the styling and the performance data for the vehicle.  Ford said he did not grant his approval until earlier this year after driving a prototype.  \u201cIt felt like a Mustang experience to me,\u201d he said.  TURNING POINTS  This is not the first time a challenge to reinvent the Mustang has emboldened Ford employees to break with convention during a rough patch in the company\u2019s history.  The original Mustang launched in 1964 was derived from a mainstream Falcon compact car, and quickly became a hit, far out-selling the company\u2019s projections.  In the early 1990s, with the economy in a slump, a small group of Ford employees rebelled against a plan to transform the rear-wheel drive Mustang into a front-wheel drive car developed by Ford's then-partner, Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T. That project became a laboratory for cutting the costs of product engineering by putting representatives of different functions on the same team.  The Mach E is another turning point, Hackett said. \u201cThe science project platform for EVs is now gone.\u201d","220":"MEXICO CITY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Mexican government is trying to entice Ford Motor Company to consider relocating some of its operations to Mexico, a senior official said on Tuesday, after the U.S. carmaker announced the closure of three plants in Brazil.

For decades, carmaking has been a key part of Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector.  Ford\u2019s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Earlier this month, Ford announced plans to shutter its three plants in Brazil this year while taking pre-tax charges of about $4.1 billion as the coronavirus pandemic pushed the company to reevaluate its manufacturing capacity.  Company officials said at the time that the decision was part of a previously announced $11 billion global restructuring. (Reporting by Sharay Angulo; Editing by David Alire Garcia and Stephen Coates)","221":"(Reuters) - During oral arguments Wednesday in a pair of product liability cases against Ford, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito rather heatedly described the court\u2019s dilemma in confronting personal jurisdiction in the internet age.  The Supreme Court\u2019s seminal ruling on the intersection of personal jurisdiction and due process fairness for defendants was 1945\u2019s International Shoe v. State of Washington, in which the justices held that corporations can be sued in states where they conduct significant business \u201caccording to our traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  But it\u2019s not 1945 anymore, Justice Alito said, in a nod to other justices\u2019 questions about how the internet has expanded interstate commerce for even the smallest of businesses. (Chief Justice John Roberts, for instance, proposed a hypothetical about whether a duck decoy artisan in Maine who advertised his decoys on the internet could be sued wherever they\u2019re sold.) And in the 1945 International Shoe decision, Justice Alito said, the Supreme Court did not even attempt to discern what due process meant when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, instead applying its own notion of fair play.  So what is today\u2019s court supposed to do, Justice Alito asked Deepak Gupta of Gupta Wessler, who represents two plaintiffs who sued Ford in their home states after they were injured in crashes involving second-hand Ford vehicles. \u201cWe could perhaps decide this case within the contours of our existing cases because there\u2019s nothing particularly 21st century about what happened here,\u201d the justice said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in a strange situation \u2026 The world in 2020 is completely different. You may just say, \u2018Well, decide this on the basis of your existing case law and not propose anything grander.\u2019 But if you have a solution to the bigger problems that have been framed by some of the questions, it would be interesting to hear it.\u201d  Based on Wednesday\u2019s arguments, that\u2019s the crux of the Supreme Court\u2019s challenge in the Ford cases: There\u2019s no clear path to a grand resolution. Should the court sidestep what Justice Neil Gorsuch called \u201cthe difficulties our doctrinal tests have created\u201d to articulate a whole new framework based on an originalist view of due process? Should the justices build on the court\u2019s own precedent to adopt a sweeping new test for personal jurisdiction \u2013 even though Gupta and Ford counsel Sean Marotta of Hogan Lovells proposed completely different tests, both purportedly rooted in Supreme Court precedent? Or, alternatively, should the justices rule narrowly to avoid imposing a problematic new test?  \u201cI don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d said Fordham law professor Howard Erichson. \u201cMaybe this is not the case for redefining personal jurisdiction.\u201d  University of Connecticut law professor Alexandra Lahav agreed that the justices seemed to struggle with the consequences of every available path. \u201cThey seemed to have difficulty figuring out how much they want a general rule and how much they want to do justice in the individual cases,\u201d she said.  Erichson wrote in a pre-argument blog post that Ford was offering the court \u201can aggressive but superficially plausible reading\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent precedent restricting jurisdiction. As Marotta explained the proposed test on Wednesday, the court\u2019s precedent in such cases as 2017\u2019s Bristol-Myers v. Superior Court of California and 2014\u2019s Walden v. Fiore lead to the conclusion that to establish specific jurisdiction plaintiffs must show defendant\u2019s conduct within the state where they have sued caused their injuries. It\u2019s \u201cirrelevant,\u201d Marotta said, that Ford marketed, sold and serviced cars in Minnesota and Montana, where it was sued in the cases before the Supreme Court. Ford did not design, manufacture or sell the vehicles involved in the crashes at the heart of the two cases in Minnesota or Montana, Marotta said. (The vehicles in both cases were second-hand so they were not sold by Ford dealers.) Under Ford\u2019s causation test, Marotta said, Montana and Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over claims that the vehicles were defective.  Justice Elena Kagan offered the most forceful opposition to Marotta\u2019s proposed test. In the Bristol-Myers case, she pointed out, the Supreme Court said plaintiffs with no connection to California could not participate in a mass tort action filed in California state court. By contrast, Justice Kagan said, the plaintiffs suing Ford lived in, used Ford vehicles and were injured in the states where they sued.  Justice Clarence Thomas said Marotta\u2019s proposed test left him \u201ca little confused \u2013 how do we get from the Due Process Clause to your proximate cause argument?\u201d  Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out that the court\u2019s jurisdictional doctrine is intended to prevent unfairness to defendants who shouldn\u2019t be haled into court at the whim of plaintiffs. Ford, he said, does a lot of business in Minnesota and Montana, and even if it did not sell the exact vehicles involved in the crashes in the two cases within state lines, it sells lots of cars and trucks of the same model. \u201cSince they do a lot of business with the same kinds of cars there, they have to be prepared to defend against this kind of suit,\u201d Justice Breyer said. \u201cSo what\u2019s unfair about it?\u201d  Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel Gupta said Ford\u2019s proposed test would turn jurisdiction into \u201can irrelevant scavenger hunt,\u201d introducing complexity and unfairness into what should be a simple regimen. He offered the justices a different test: Plaintiffs must show that a defendant has \u201cpurposefully availed\u201d itself of the opportunity to conduct business in a state and that their suit is \u201crelated to\u201d the defendant\u2019s conduct in the forum. When Justice Thomas asked Gupta to clarify his definition for \u201crelated to,\u201d Gupta said plaintiffs can meet the test by showing that defendants sold the same products at issue in their cases within the state. (Even if Ford did not sell the exact vehicles involved in the Minnesota and Montana cases, in other words, plaintiffs\u2019 claims were related to Ford\u2019s marketing, sale and service of cars and trucks of the exact same make and model.)  But the justices posed hypotheticals showing that Gupta\u2019s test has its own complexities. Justice Alito asked if, say, a rebuilt, customized car should fit the definition. Justice Gorsuch homed in on whether the relevant product is the finished car or a part within the vehicle. Justice Breyer wanted to know if Gupta had in mind a standard for how many identical products a defendant would have to sell to meet his standard.  In his rebuttal, Ford counsel Marotta highlighted the problems that could arise from the relatedness test, which he said was ungrounded in common law (or even in the records of the Montana and Minnesota cases). \u201cIs a similar product sufficient? Does it have to be the same features that are alleged to be defective in the case?\u201d Marotta said. \u201cAnd how long does this have to take place? One year of sales, many years of sales? These are the questions that are going to trouble the lower courts for years if you adopt that test.\u201d  Of course, as Fordham prof Erichson said, the justices could opt to institute no new test at all, simply deciding on the fact of the Montana and Minnesota cases whether those state supreme courts properly determined that they had jurisdiction. (As Gupta mentioned during Wednesday\u2019s argument, Justices Alito and Breyer actually cautioned against adopting broad jurisdictional rules that might have unintended consequences in their concurrence in J. McIntyre Machinery v. Nicastro.  The eight justices who heard Wednesday\u2019s arguments, Erichson predicted, will sorely miss Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as they grapple with this case. \u201cShe would have been the dominant voice,\u201d he said.","222":"FILE PHOTO: A Ford logo is seen on a wall of the Oakville Assembly Plant as workers with UNIFOR attended a ratification vote nearby, in Oakville, Ontario, Canada November 6, 2016.

The federal government, along with the Ontario government, is willing to invest in turning the Oakville plant over to the production of EVs, an investment that could keep the facility open for years, a government source confirmed on Tuesday.  \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of negotiation\u201d of how much money the Ontario government would contribute to the Ford plant\u2019s electric car production line, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Tuesday.  He did not say how much the province was considering to contribute.  The Toronto Star and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp have reported that the two governments could pitch in up to C$500 million.  Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said the deal is beneficial for Ford as it averts a strike at the U.S. automaker\u2019s Canada plants and addresses spare capacity.","223":"DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Friday that rank-and-file members at Ford Motor Co have voted in favor of a new four-year labor contract with the No. 2 U.S. automaker.  FILE PHOTO: Ford logo is pictured at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt, Germany September 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Wolfgang Rattay\/File Photo  The UAW will now focus on Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), the sole remaining Detroit automaker without a new labor contract. Talks with FCA are expected to begin on Monday, a UAW spokesman said.  The union said 56.3% of Ford\u2019s hourly workers voted to approve the deal, which allowed the company to avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors Co about $3 billion (\u00a32.3 billion).  UAW leaders said earlier this month that Ford under the deal agreed to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs.  The deal also includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage.  Workers at GM approved a deal in late October that ended a contentious 40-day U.S. strike, the longest automotive labor stoppage since 1970.  Detailed terms of the Ford deal - released just a week after GM workers approved their new contract - echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a template for those that follow.  UAW leaders managed contract negotiations with Ford and GM, including the lengthy strike, while struggling with an ongoing federal corruption probe.  To date, 10 people have pleaded guilty in connection with the criminal investigation into illegal payoffs. Just last week former UAW vice president and former GM board member Joseph Ashton was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud.  Earlier this month the UAW said that its president, Gary Jones, who had been linked to the ongoing corruption probe, was taking a leave of absence.  Rory Gamble, the union\u2019s acting head, said last week he will examine every department of the union in response to the spreading federal corruption probe to prevent future misuse of members\u2019 dues.","224":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will recall 3 million vehicles for air bag inflators that could rupture, at a cost of $610 million.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday ordered Ford to issue the recall for driver-side air bag inflators, rejecting the automaker\u2019s 2017 petition to avoid it.  The defect, which in rare instances leads to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 67 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators installed by 19 major automakers have been recalled.  The recall includes 2.7 million U.S. vehicles. Ford will include the cost in fourth-quarter results.  The vehicles were previously recalled for passenger-side inflators. \u201cWe believe our extensive data demonstrated that a safety recall was not warranted for the driver-side airbag. However, we respect NHTSA\u2019s decision and will issue a recall,\u201d Ford said.  NHTSA also required Mazda Motor Corp to recall 5,800 air bag inflators in 2007\u20132009 B-Series vehicles.  Takata inflators have resulted in at least 400 injuries and 27 deaths worldwide - including 18 U.S. fatalities with two in previously recalled 2006 Ford Ranger trucks.  The Ford vehicles being recalled include various 2006-2012 model-year Ranger, Fusion, Edge, Lincoln Zephyr\/MKZ, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKX vehicles.  In November, NHTSA rejected a petition filed by General Motors Co to avoid recalling 5.9 million U.S. vehicles with Takata air bags. GM said the callback covered 7 million vehicles worldwide and would cost $1.2 billion.  Ford separately disclosed on Thursday it expects to record a pretax remeasurement loss of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter related to pension and other post-employment benefits plans, driven by lower discount rates.  Ford said the remeasurement loss is expected to reduce net income by about $1.2 billion, but did not change expectations for 2021 pension contributions.","225":"Ford Motor Co has resolved nearly two-thirds of the cases in U.S. multi-district litigation by drivers who sought damages because of allegedly defective transmissions in their Fiesta and Focus cars over several model years.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker reported a third-quarter net profit of $425 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $991 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included $1.5 billion in special charges, mostly for its global restructuring that included the formation of its Indian joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra.  Excluding one-time charges, Ford earned 34 cents a share, above the 26 cents analysts had expected according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to $37 billion, above the $33.98 billion expected.  Virtually all of Ford\u2019s third-quarter pretax profit came from North America - its most lucrative market - where highly profitable pickup trucks drive margins for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker and its Detroit rivals, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.  Ford said on Wednesday it now expects full-year adjusted operating profit in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, compared with $7 billion last year. In July, it had forecast it would increase, ending in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion.  Ford also said it expects adjusted earnings this year in the range of $1.20 to $1.32 a share.

Ford said in a securities filing that reviews by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Environment and Climate Change Canada remain open.

FILE PHOTO: The logo is seen on the bonnet of a new Ford Aspire car during its launch in New Delhi, India, October 4, 2018. Picture taken October 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Anushree Fadnavis  \u201cThe options could include working out a new relationship with Mahindra or ending the relationship and related vehicles completely,\u201d one of the sources said.  The two other sources said they expect Ford to make a decision in about a month on whether to proceed with Mahindra in a different form or not, adding Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley wants to see a path to greater profitability in India.  Ford and Mahindra had proposed a joint venture to develop at least three sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) for India and emerging markets, as well as share suppliers, powertrains and technology. The $275 million deal, which would have ended most of Ford\u2019s independent operations in India, was called off on Dec. 31.  Since Farley became CEO in October, Ford has pushed harder to remake itself globally as part of an $11 billion restructuring, including ending manufacturing in Brazil, and speeding up the rollout of electric vehicles. With so much on Farley\u2019s plate and limited financial resources, India is a lower priority, the first source said.  Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford entered India 25 years ago, but it has just 3% share in a market dominated by Suzuki Motor Corp\u2019s and Hyundai Motor\u2019s extensive line-up of mainly low-cost cars.  The tie-up with Mahindra would have given Ford a better chance against rivals by allowing it to launch new vehicles faster, at reduced costs and with lower investment, company officials and analysts previously said.  Ford said its independent Indian operations will continue.  \u201cWe are reviewing our businesses strategy, making choices and allocating capital consistent with the plan to achieve an 8% company adjusted EBIT margin and generate consistently strong cash flow,\u201d spokesman Kapil Sharma said. \u201cWe will have more details to share at a later date.\u201d  For Mahindra it would have been an opportunity to enter new global markets, but it walked away from the deal over concerns its return on investment would be too low.  Mahindra said in a statement that the automakers are looking at ways to collaborate. \u201cWe have defined a timeline till the end of March for this work to be completed,\u201d the company said.  STRATEGIC RETHINK  Ford is weighing all programmes it had planned for the joint venture with Mahindra and will review which ones it plans to keep from a profit standpoint, the second source said.  The most crucial was a mid-sized SUV to be built by Mahindra on its vehicle platform and using its powertrain. Ford planned to launch this in 2022 with a target to sell around 50,000 units annually in India, two sources said. Mahindra, too, has asked suppliers to freeze work on this, they said.  Ford is also negotiating new terms, including costs, for an engine Mahindra was to supply for its EcoSport SUV later this year, one of the people said.  For two other SUVs that Ford is building for launch in 2023 and 2024, the plan had been to use Mahindra engines. If it walks away from that deal, Ford will need to find another supplier or invest in upgrading its own engines, two sources said.  It will come down to a cost versus profit analysis and that \u201chinges on discussions with Mahindra,\u201d one of the sources said.  At a town hall earlier this month, Dianne Craig, president of international operations, said Ford was exploring all options when asked about the company\u2019s plans following the end of the Mahindra relationship.  Ford\u2019s average sales in India have languished at around 90,000 units a year prior to the economic slowdown in 2019 and the pandemic in 2020. But exports are nearly double what it sells in the domestic market and that helps it make money.  While Ford India reported pre-tax profits over the last three years, its biggest hurdle in India is low plant utilisation of around 53% over a five-year average.  Even as it thinks about bringing global products to India - its Territory SUV in China is an option - Ford will need to look at several factors including competition, new fuel efficiency rules and its ability to make money in a price-sensitive market to ensure success.  India\u2019s competitiveness as an export base for affordable cars will also play a role, two sources said.  \u201cIf Ford decides to invest more in India it needs to know by when it can recover that investment,\u201d one source said.","233":"FILE PHOTO: Zhu Huarong, chairman of Chongqing Changan Automobile, speaks at the 2016 China-U.S. Automotive Industry Summit during the Auto China 2016 show in Beijing, China April 26, 2016.

The UAW said Wednesday the Ford deal \u201csecured over $6 billion in major product investments in American facilities, creating and retaining over 8,500 jobs for our communities.\u201d  Ford will close the plant in the future under the UAW agreement. Ford and the UAW declined to comment.  In March 2017, Ford said it was investing $150 million in the Romeo Engine Plant to boost capacity for engines and new tooling for components, one of three Michigan plants at the time it said were getting new investments. Ford said the investment was to boost the plant building engines for vehicles that include Ford Super Duty, E-Series, Ford Shelby GT 350 Mustang and Shelby GT350R Mustang, along with components for F-Series, Mustang, Explorer and Edge.  In 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump praised Ford\u2019s decision to invest in Romeo and two other Michigan plants. \u201cMajor investment to be made in three Michigan plants,\u201d Trump posted on Twitter at the time. \u201cCar companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!\u201d  In contrast to Ford, General Motors Co endured a 40-day-strike by its U.S. hourly workforce that cost it about $3 billion before winning approval for a new labor deal earlier this month.  Detailed terms of the Ford deal were not released, but they are expected to echo those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow.  The deal includes a signing bonus of $9,000 per person, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified. Union members at GM received $11,000 per person.  UAW leaders from the various U.S. plants will meet on Friday to potentially approve the deal, which then would be sent to the 55,000 members at Ford for final approval, a union spokesman said.","242":"The Coca-Cola Co is driving off with a new top lawyer from Ford Motor Co, the beverage maker announced Monday in a statement.

FILE PHOTO: View of the entrance of German automotive parts manufacturer Robert Bosch Belgian plant in Tienen April 21, 2009. REUTERS\/Thierry Roge\/File Photo  Ford said it is cutting shifts at two plants that build its highly profitable and top-selling F-150 pickup trucks next week. Meanwhile, union sources told Reuters Stellantis would slow production at its Melfi, Italy, plant next week and furlough 7,000 workers.  Global automakers have been caught off guard by the shortage of crucial semiconductors, used for everything for computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking, highlighting the need to cut dependency on Asian manufacturers.  Automakers have largely curtailed production of less profitable vehicles as they manage the shortage, but Ford cutting output of its high-profit trucks will raise fears the impact is spreading.  Bosch and Infineon warned that more production headaches could lie ahead as the chip shortage complicates the recovery from last year\u2019s pandemic-related shutdowns.  Volvo Cars also said that while it had so far avoided the chip shortages that have curtailed production at a growing number of automakers, there was still a risk it could be hit.  During a presentation of its 2020 annual results, Stuttgart-based car parts supplier Bosch said the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the chip shortage would weigh on global automotive production growth in 2021.  Around 85 million vehicles will roll off assembly lines around the world this year, more than the 78 million produced in 2020 but still below the 92 million made in 2019, it said.  Global automotive production hit a high of 98 million vehicles in 2017.  \u201cWe are quite positive,\u201d Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said, but he added \u201cwe still have a long way to go to catch up\u201d.  Bosch said it had not been left unscathed by what it called a bottleneck in the global chip market.  U.S. automaker General Motors Co <GM.N > said on Wednesday it would cut production next week, joining other automakers that have been hit, including Volkswagen AG, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co.  Infineon said it was facing challenges in meeting auto industry demand for microcontrollers due to capacity constraints at the contract manufacturers it relies on.  \u201cSemiconductor shortages are being felt in the overall automotive supply chain,\u201d Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss said after Infineon reported quarterly results.

Ford has come under fire from some analysts on Wall Street for moving too slowly to cut costs and restructure its business.  At the end of last year, it had booked only $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take in its global restructuring.  Since then, the outbreak has spread globally, leading Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, FCAU.N on Wednesday to announce the shutdown of their North American plants to prevent the spread of the disease among their factory workers.

Ford said on Thursday it notified lenders it would borrow the unused amounts of the two credit lines, totaling $15.4 billion. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company had $22 billion in cash at the end of last year.  The dividend suspension will save Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion.  The company said it was prioritizing financial flexibility and investments in future technologies such as self-driving cars and a series of important 2020 vehicle launches including a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck.  Ford also withdrew its 2020 profit outlook. In February, before the coronavirus hit the United States, it offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share.  Ford said it would update its outlook when it reports first-quarter results on April 28.  Also on Thursday, Ford said it would offer new-car buyers up to six months of payment relief.

It also referred frequently to several unnamed figures, in particular \u201cOfficial A\u201d who is Jones, and \u201cOfficial B,\u201d his predecessor Dennis Williams, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The union had targeted GM, the largest U.S. automaker, as the one it wanted to conclude contract talks with and set a pattern for subsequent agreements with Ford and Fiat Chrysler  This year\u2019s talks were widely expected to be contentious, focusing on thorny issues like healthcare costs and profit-sharing at a time when U.S. new vehicle sales are declining.  But according to sources briefed on the matter, the searing complaint throws into question whether talks will continue between GM and the UAW ahead of the Saturday deadline.  Two people briefed on the matter say GM may ask for a temporary extension of the contract and could pursue other options including seeking assistance from a third party.  It was not clear if the talks with GM will continue with the current UAW president under investigation.  In a statement, Ford said it agreed with the union to extend the contract talks while the focus \u201cremains on reaching a fair agreement with the UAW.\u201d  Rory Gamble, the official who oversees the UAW\u2019s relations with Ford, said a contract extension was \u201cnot unusual and commonly occurs when another company has been identified as the lead.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Neither Jones nor Williams has been charged with any wrongdoing.

The government currently has 108,000 ventilators in its medical equipment stockpile, and 12,000 deployed at U.S. hospitals, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said Tuesday.  GM and medical equipment maker Ventec Life Systems are in the \u201chome stretch\u201d toward completing a contract to deliver 30,000 critical care ventilators by the end of August under a $489 million contract with the federal government, the automaker said.  GM and Ventec have already delivered more than 20,000 machines, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.  Ford has assembled about 47,000 of the 50,000 ventilators it agreed to supply to partner General Electric Co, Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said. GE has a $336 million contract with the government.  HHS said it has received more than 69,000 ventilators assembled by GM and Ford and their partners, and \u201cboth of these delivery schedules are nearly complete.\u201d  Ford and GM earlier this year said they would employ a total of as many as 1,500 people on ventilator assembly lines. Automakers likened the efforts to their switch from making cars to tanks and planes during the Second World War.  With North American car and truck factories back in operation, the Detroit automakers are winding down their forays into ventilator manufacturing, but continuing to make respiratory masks.  GM has said it plans to transfer the ventilator-making operations at a factory in Kokomo, Indiana, to its partner Ventec on Sept.1. Union-represented GM workers employed at the plant will return to the automaker, and temporary workers will remain with Ventec.  Ford transferred full-time workers who were building ventilators back to their home plants in May, and the majority of the temporary workers still assembling ventilators will have opportunities to land jobs building the new Ford Bronco SUV at a factory near Detroit, a company spokeswoman said Tuesday.  The automakers\u2019 efforts to build ventilators and other medical equipment were launched in a politically charged atmosphere as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic swamped the U.S. economy and healthcare system. The shortage of ventilators became a symbol of the nation\u2019s struggle to respond.  U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on the automakers as part of a broader push to secure more than 130,000 ventilators by the end of 2020.  The automakers used the medical equipment assembly operations set up in the spring to test safety protocols they later used to reopen their vehicle-making operations.","259":"DETROIT (Reuters) - The union that represents U.S. hourly workers at Detroit automakers gave its tacit approval on Tuesday for the companies to restart production amid the coronavirus pandemic, after Fiat Chrysler said it expected to reopen its North American plants on May 18.

U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of cases of the novel coronavirus jumped. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states reopening their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can safely restart.  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer previously extended the state\u2019s stay-at-home order through May 15, but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday, and Whitmer is facing increasing calls to follow suit.  Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk was highly critical last week of the various states' stay-at-home orders, which have idled the electric carmaker's California plant. He called the policies \"fascist.\"  Ford said on Tuesday it had not determined when to restart North American production.  \u201cWe are continuing to assess public health conditions, government guidelines and supplier readiness to determine when the time is right to resume production,\u201d Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in an email.

Ford said the simplified ventilator design, which is licensed by GE Healthcare from Florida-based Airon Corp and has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, can meet the needs of most COVID-19 patients and relies on air pressure without the need for electricity.  Officials in states hard hit by the pandemic have pleaded with the Trump administration and manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients struggling to breathe. Hospitals in New York already are using one ventilator to sustain two patients. New Orleans has a fraction of the ventilators it needs for a surge of COVID-19 patients, Louisiana officials said.  On Friday, President Donald Trump said he would invoke powers under the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors Co, to produce ventilators.  On Monday, the head of the United Auto Workers and other officials compared the auto industry\u2019s effort to build ventilators to Detroit\u2019s conversion to bomber production during the World War Two.  Ford said it plans to begin production of ventilators at a plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, deploying 500 United Auto Workers employees.  It said it plans to start production at the facility the week of April 20. That is roughly when New York officials expect the peak of COVID-19 cases to hit their state.  Ventilators built by Ford, GM and others could be used in other parts of the United States where the peak case loads are expected later.  GM said Sunday it plans to produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month by this summer at a plant in Kokomo, Indiana.  The Ypsilanti workers will be stationed at a safe distance apart and will be screened for symptoms of coronavirus infection before they enter the plant, Ford officials said.  \u201cWe\u2019re using and deploying a whole host of technologies to keep workers safe,\u201d said Adrian Price, director of global manufacturing core engineering for Ford. The safety procedures will be adapted from work Ford and the UAW have been doing to prepare for the automaker to reopen other U.S. factories, Price said.  Separately, GE and Ford engineers are working together to boost production at a GE plant in Madison, Wisconsin, of a GE ventilator, different from the model licensed from Airon.  GE expects to double ventilator output from the Wisconsin plant during the second quarter, Tom Westrick, GE Healthcare\u2019s vice president for quality, said during a call with reporters on Monday.","265":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N have widely touted their commitment to emission-free electric cars, but their production plans show a growing reliance on ever-larger gas-powered vehicles.  An undated handout photo from General Motors shows one of its six new different types of electric vehicles that can accommodate the automaker's flexible battery pack. General Motors\/Handout via REUTERS  The two biggest U.S. automakers will make more than 5 million SUVs and pickup trucks in 2026, but only about 320,000 electric vehicles, according to detailed production plans for North America seen by Reuters.  That will be about 5% of their combined vehicle production in North America, but less than Tesla Inc TSLA.O, the world leader in electric vehicles, produced last year.  The plans show that Detroit\u2019s Big Two are betting their short-term future on satisfying America\u2019s demand for bigger, petroleum-fueled vehicles which they can sell at a higher profit margin than mostly smaller, expensive-to-develop electric vehicles.  Large SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than midsize cars, meaning the plans will most likely wipe out any gains in overall fuel efficiency or reduction in auto emissions that were targeted over the next six years, according to industry experts.  The recent collapse of oil prices - pointing toward cheap gas for the foreseeable future - and a dip in demand caused by the coronavirus may only serve to strengthen automakers\u2019 commitment to the strategy.  Detroit has tried to latch onto the consumer and investor excitement over electric vehicles made by Tesla, whose market value is double that of GM and Ford combined, even though its sales are much smaller.  GM executives have been repeating a \u201czero emissions\u201d mantra since 2017, and the company\u2019s website features a prominent commitment to its \u201call-electric future.\u201d Ford\u2019s Executive Chairman Bill Ford told the Detroit auto show two years ago: \u201cWe\u2019re all in on this. We\u2019re taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we\u2019re electrifying them.\u201d  But it is hard to detect a major change of direction from the companies\u2019 production plans.  According to data from AutoForecast Solutions seen by Reuters, North American production of SUV models by GM and Ford will outpace production of traditional cars by more than eight to one in 2026, and 93% of those SUVs are expected to be gas-fueled. The data has not previously been reported.  Graphic Greener vehicles: how soon?  AutoForecast\u2019s data is based on planning information provided to suppliers by the automakers, and is widely used across the industry. GM and Ford executives interviewed by Reuters did not dispute the accuracy of the data.  \u201cGM and Ford understand that buyers want more SUVs and trucks, but they\u2019re also trying to play to Wall Street, which thinks the future is all about electric vehicles,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president, global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast. \u201cThe Detroit automakers would love to get a little of that Tesla magic and money.\u201d  \u2018DON\u2019T VIOLATE THE LAWS OF ECONOMICS\u2019  Internal production plans from other industry sources seen by Reuters support AutoForecast\u2019s numbers, which show GM and Ford expect to produce about 320,000 pure electric vehicles - powered solely by a battery - in North America in 2026. That is nearly 10 times the 35,000 they have planned to build in 2020, but fewer than the 367,500 Tesla delivered last year.  It is only a fraction of the 5.2 million SUVs and pickups that GM and Ford expect to make in North America in 2026, according to the AutoForecast data, up 14% from 4.6 million SUVs and pickups in 2019. SUVs and pickups will account for about 87% of vehicles made by GM and Ford in the region in 2026, compared with about 82% last year.  Executives at GM and Ford told Reuters in interviews they are serious about launching more electric vehicles in the United States in the coming years, but they are concerned about getting too far ahead of mass-market demand.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to time this with the natural demand of consumers (so) we\u2019re not forced to do artificial things and we don\u2019t violate the laws of economics,\u201d Hau Thai-Tang, Ford\u2019s chief product development and purchasing officer, told Reuters.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in early March the company planned to spend $20 billion to bring a million electric vehicles a year to market by the middle of the 2020s. A majority of those are expected to be built and sold in China, where a government mandate calls for increasing numbers of electric vehicles.  \u201cWe want to meet customer demand with the best possible (carbon) footprint on the planet to help improve the CO2 (carbon dioxide) situation,\u201d said Doug Parks, GM\u2019s executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, regarding GM\u2019s production plans for SUVs and electric vehicles in North America.  Read a summary of GM and Ford\u2019s electric-vehicle plans here.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  CHEAP GAS, BIGGER TRUCKS  The long-term battle between electrons and petroleum to be the primary energy source for future transportation took an unexpected turn with a crash in oil this month that sent fuel-pump prices to 20-year lows, with no signs of rising, making the cost of running internal combustion vehicles even more attractive to buyers.  The spread of the coronavirus will put more financial pressure on automakers, according to analysts, limiting their capacity to develop and build money-losing vehicles. A global recession triggered by the epidemic \u201ccould add strain to balance sheets and ability to fund aggressive technology shifts,\u201d said Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas.  In such an environment, automakers are not looking to depart from their winning formula.  They make more profit on each luxury SUV - such as GM\u2019s $80,000 Cadillac Escalade or Ford\u2019s $76,000 Lincoln Navigator - than they do on a dozen compact cars, according to analysts.  Because of that, automakers are replacing compact sedans with small SUVs that share many of the car\u2019s mechanical parts, but sell for more. Ford discontinued the Focus compact sedan in the United States, which gets 31 miles per gallon of gas. Ford customers who want a similar-sized vehicle now can buy a 26 miles-per-gallon Ford Escape compact SUV, whose starting price is $6,000 higher.  That may be good for automakers\u2019 finances, but probably not for the environment.  SUVs and pickups burn more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than comparable sedans, and those with larger \u201cfootprints,\u201d - the area between the points where the wheels touch the ground - are subject to looser emissions standards.  Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to roll back tougher fuel economy and emissions standards proposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, removing an incentive for automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles.  That all indicates that any overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions enabled by new electric vehicles will be largely, or entirely, offset by the continued substitution of gasoline-fueled SUVs for cars, experts say.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of this outcome in October, in a report that showed growing demand for SUVs across the world was the second-largest contributor to the increase in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2010 to 2018.  \u201cIf consumers\u2019 appetite for SUVs continues to grow at a similar pace seen in the last decade, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars,\u201d said the IEA report. The IEA declined to comment on this story.  The Obama White House predicted that doubling average car and truck fuel efficiency from 2011 to 2025 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion tons. That does not look likely to happen.  Trump\u2019s White House is planning to follow through on its plan to roll back the Obama rules by the end of March, administration officials have told Reuters.  The Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates U.S. auto emissions, did not respond to a request for comment.","266":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it is cutting shifts at two plants that build its highly profitable flagship F-150 pickup trucks starting next week due to a global shortage of semiconductor chips and warned the issue could result in the loss of 10% to 20% of planned first-quarter production.  FILE PHOTO: Ford Motor Co. displays a 2021 Ford F-150 pickup truck at the Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S. September 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it will run one of three shifts of production at its Dearborn Truck Plant the week of Feb. 8, while the truck portion of its Kansas City Assembly Plant will run two of three shifts of production during that week. Both are expected to return to three shifts the following week.  Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the production losses stemming from the semiconductor shortage could lower Ford\u2019s adjusted earnings by $1 billion to $2.5 billion.  Lawler said moving forward Ford will continue to prioritize and allocate chips to the highest-margin vehicles when it can. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a logistic effort to do that,\u201d he said.  Ford declined to say what part or supplier were involved or how much volume would be lost.  Global automakers have been caught off guard by the shortage of crucial semiconductors, used for everything from computer management of engines to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking.  Other automakers hit by the shortage include General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Subaru Corp.  Up to now, automakers have largely focused on cutting production of less profitable vehicles as they manage through the shortage, but Ford cutting output of its high-profit trucks will raise concerns the impact is spreading.  Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker declined to address why the F-150 had been affected, but the Dearborn, Michigan-based company may discuss the matter further later on Thursday.  Felker said the automaker was \u201cworking closely with suppliers to address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage and working to prioritize key vehicle lines for production.\u201d Ford has previously cut other production because of the issue.  Also on Thursday, union sources told Reuters that automaker Stellantis will slow production at its Melfi plant in Italy next week due to a shortage of microchips and other parts and will put over 7,000 workers on furlough. Mazda Motor Corp said it expected a production cut of 7,000 vehicles this month as a result.  On Wednesday, GM said it would cut production at four of its plants due to the chip shortage.  On Tuesday, a group of 15 U.S. senators including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican John Cornyn urged the White House to work with Congress to address the global semiconductor shortage hitting auto manufacturing.","267":"March 17 (Reuters) -  * FORD WEIGHS CUTTING SHIFTS AT U.S. PLANTS TO REDUCE VIRUS RISK TO WORKERS \u2013 WSJ  * PRODUCTION CUTS AMONG PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES FORD CONSIDERING AS UAW PRESSES AUTO MAKERS TO CLOSE FACTORIES\u2013 WSJ Source text : on.wsj.com\/3b5qyJe Further company coverage:","268":"DETROIT, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong U.S. demand for pickups and SUVs, and forecast a full-year profit instead of a loss.

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Wednesday reported a lower-than-expected profit, weighed down by charges to restructure its units in Europe and South America, and the automaker gave a full-year earnings forecast that fell short of analysts' expectations.  Ford shares fell as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading.  Virtually all of Ford's second-quarter pre-tax profit came from North America - its most lucrative market - where highly-profitable pickup trucks drive margins for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker and its Detroit rivals, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N.  The automaker also posted a small profit in Europe and a far smaller loss in China compared with the second quarter of 2018 as better pricing and new luxury models helped offset a poor performance in that market.  Ford\u2019s second-quarter sales in China slid 21.7% in the second quarter after a first-quarter drop of 35.8%.  In April, Ford said it planned to launch more than 30 new models over the next three years to overhaul its vehicle lineup in China.  The automaker\u2019s ongoing restructuring includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets like China and Europe. The company said Wednesday it had so far only recorded $2.2 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Last month, Ford said it would cut 12,000 jobs, close five plants and cut shifts at other factories in Europe by the end of 2020 in an effort to return that region to profitability.  In May, the company said it would eliminate about 10% of its global salaried workforce, cutting about 7,000 jobs by the end of August.  Earlier this month, Ford and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles, deepening a global alliance to slash development and manufacturing costs. The size and timing of the payoff from that alliance remain unclear.  Ford had previously not provided an earnings forecast for this year.

Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly.  Billions of dollars in revenue and profits are riding on how quickly Ford and its U.S. rivals can convince the UAW and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer that it is safe to return to work. The UAW declared that early May was too soon to reopen, and since then has not agreed to a date.  Without Michigan, the Detroit Three and other automakers operating in the United States cannot build vehicles. Ford executives highlighted that the U.S. auto sector accounts for 6% of U.S. economic output.  Ford has the largest unionized workforce in the United States with about 56,000 UAW members. The F-series pickup trucks UAW workers build account for $50 billion in annual revenue, Ford said.  \u201cIt\u2019s just really now getting the clarity from our government leaders because we\u2019re ready,\u201d Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said on a conference call with reporters.  Farley added he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be comfortable having his family work in a Ford plant given the steps the company has taken to ensure employee safety.  UAW President Rory Gamble said the union is negotiating with the Detroit automakers about safely reopening their U.S. plants. Among the issues on the table are what types of protective gear workers should have, how fast assembly lines should move and how much testing should be done.  \u201cThe UAW is asking for as much testing as is possible to prevent exposure to the virus,\u201d Gamble said in a Thursday statement.  Ford\u2019s human resources chief Kiersten Robinson said the automaker will not have a \u201creliable and scalable testing solution\u201d for COVID-19 for several weeks if not months and the company was forming a task force to see how it can move faster to achieve that.  \u201cLonger term, we think it will be critical,\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully, in coming weeks or months, it will be part of our protocol.\u201d  Ford manufacturing chief Gary Johnson said any worker who worried they had been exposed would be sent to a hospital for testing and the UAW had agreed to that process.  Johnson said the company was not planning to provide workers with N95 respiratory masks, which are designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, as the regular face masks and shields were good enough.  Slowing the speed of production lines in plants would be too complex, he added. Some union leaders have suggested lines could be slowed to allow for greater physical separation between workers.  What Ford will do in its plants is no-touch doors, require use of personal protective equipment like face masks and shields, install barriers where employees must work closely together, use thermal scanning to screen employees for fevers and do heavy sanitizing of work areas.  Ford executives said they have been using the same safety protocols already in China, where production restarted in late February.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company did not provide a date for restarting U.S. factories. Ford did say white-collar workers would likely return to their offices in late June or early July.  Officials in Whitmer\u2019s office could not immediately be reached to comment on Thursday. She extended the state\u2019s stay-at-home order through May 15 but has lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio is allowing manufacturing to resume on Monday.  In its restart playbook, GM\u2019s strategy relies heavily on many of the same approaches as Ford, but does not address assembly line workstations. The No. 1 U.S. automaker has not provided a target for a U.S. restart.  FCA has retreated from its plan to restart North American operations on May 3 given Michigan's extended stay-at-home order. It is using similar measures to Ford. Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk was highly critical on Wednesday of the various states' stay-at-home orders, which have idled the electric carmaker's California plant. He called the policies \"fascist.\"","282":"DETROIT (Reuters) - A battery-powered Lincoln SUV, due in mid-2022, will be the first Ford Motor Co F.N vehicle built on a custom electrified chassis that resembles a skateboard, which was developed by Ford-backed startup Rivian, according to several people familiar with the program.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The all-wheel-drive Lincoln SUV could compete against Rivian\u2019s R1S, an electric sport utility vehicle slated to go into production in early 2021 that will be priced from $72,500. Both models will use Rivian\u2019s so-called skateboard, a flexible platform that combines electric motors, batteries, controls and suspension.  On Tuesday, Ford declined to comment. Rivian did not respond to a request for comment.  The new Lincoln, which carries the internal program code U787, also could compete with premium offerings from others, including General Motors Co GM.N, which plans to introduce at least two new electric SUVs by 2023, one for Cadillac and one that could revive the Hummer name, sources have said.  Ford invested $500 million in Rivian this year and plans to help it begin production next year at a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois.  When Ford made the investment, it said it would use Rivian\u2019s skateboard to develop its own electric vehicle, but did not disclose details.  It is not clear where Ford intends to build the Lincoln SUV, which will be among the first of several battery-powered utility vehicles planned for Ford\u2019s premium brand in North America and China, according to supplier sources familiar with those programs who asked not to be identified.  Ford expects to introduce a compact Lincoln electric crossover in late 2021 or early 2022 and a mid-size companion in 2023, the sources said.  The U.S. auto industry plans to invest billions of dollars over the next few years to build all-electric pickups and SUVs, sectors of the market that have been among the most profitable, especially for Detroit-based automakers.  But analysts have questioned whether demand from consumers and commercial customers will come close to matching production.  Founded in 2009, Rivian has raised $1.9 billion from investors, including e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, which has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. The first Amazon vans will be built in Normal and are to be delivered in 2021.  Ford aims to sell an electric F-series pickup in late 2021, sources have said. It also will offer the electric Mustang Mach E SUV next year as part of plans to invest $11.5 billion by 2022 electrifying its vehicles.","283":"FILE PHOTO: A Ford Motor Co. Bronco is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is delaying the launch of its Bronco SUV next year to the summer from the initial spring target due to coronavirus-related issues with its suppliers, a company spokesman said on Friday.  \u201cDeliveries will begin the summer rather than the spring. That\u2019s being driven by COVID-related challenges some of our suppliers are experiencing,\u201d Ford spokesman Said Deep said.  The suppliers, which Ford did not identify, have had development work for tooling delayed by the pandemic, Deep said. Asked whether the launch could face further delays, Deep said Ford was monitoring the outbreak closely.  The pandemic caused the U.S. auto industry to shutter plants for two months earlier in the year, but since production restarted automakers have been largely successful in preventing the spread of the virus within their facilities.  Ford still expects to begin building the Bronco at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan in the spring, Deep said. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company is already shipping the smaller Bronco Sport, which is built in Mexico.  Customers\u2019 ability to place orders for the Bronco also has been delayed from Dec. 7 to mid-January, Deep said.  Earlier on Friday, industry officials said a shortage of chips used in auto manufacturing could disrupt vehicle production in China well into next year. Deep said Ford\u2019s issues were not related.","284":"DETROIT, April 28 (Reuters) - Investors already know how the coronavirus outbreak has hurt Ford Motor Co\u2019s bottom line, so when the automaker releases first-quarter results on Tuesday they will focus on how and when Ford plans to restart North American operations.  Ford said on April 17 that the outbreak would result in an estimated first-quarter loss of about $2 billion. That warning came the same day the Dearborn, Michigan-based company raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors.  Last month, Ford moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business. It also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast.  Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. However, with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states beginning to reopen their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can be restarted.  Ford, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) are aiming to resume production some time in May, and are negotiating with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents their U.S. hourly workers, about how to safely resume vehicle production. FCA and GM are scheduled to report quarterly results on May 5 and 6, respectively.  Last week, the UAW said it was \u201ctoo soon and too risky\u201d to reopen auto plants in early May.  Ford, whose credit rating has been downgraded to \u201cjunk\u201d status by Standard & Poor\u2019s, has not said when it plans to reopen in North America. It previously had hoped to resume production in April at plants that make its most profitable vehicles, but subsequently backed off those plans.  Ford has idled most of its European plants until May 4, but has resumed operations in China, where the pandemic began and where sales fell 35% in the first quarter. U.S. sales fell 12.5%.  Prior to the bond deal, Ford told investors that absent new funding and a restart of production, it had cash to last until the end of the third quarter. It also said revenue in the first quarter would finish at about $34 billion.  Ford also warned that production of high-priced versions of pickups and SUVs could be hurt due to damage caused by a tornado at parts supplier BorgWarner Inc\u2019s South Carolina factory. That facility makes transfer cases for some of Ford\u2019s most profitable vehicles, such as four wheel-drive large F-series pickups and large SUVs.  Once production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand bounces back.  Earlier in April, Ford\u2019s U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, told Reuters the automaker believed some level of government stimulus for the U.S. auto sector will be needed for consumers once the pandemic recedes.  During the Great Recession of 2008-09, the U.S. government rolled out a \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers.

Strategy chief Jim Farley, who begins his role as Ford COO on March 1 after being appointed earlier this month, is scheduled to speak at a Wolfe Research conference in New York early on Wednesday. Slides for his presentation showed other key parts of his strategy, include speeding up Ford\u2019s push in vehicle connectivity and its commercial vehicle business.  The slides also show a focus on growing the battery electric vehicle business of the No. 2 U.S. automaker.  Ford has acknowledged that mistakes had hurt its introduction of the redesigned Explorer SUV.  The company named Farley its COO on Feb. 7, and promised investors it would kick a slow-moving turnaround into higher gear.  On Tuesday, shares hit their lowest in more than a decade as a rapidly escalating coronavirus epidemic that began in China threatened sales outside the United States.  Ford is in the midst of a global restructuring and faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market. Chief Executive Jim Hackett has said the No. 2 U.S. automaker needs to move with greater speed.  It has booked $3.7 billion of a projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year.  As part of its restructuring, Ford formed a wide-ranging alliance on commercial, electric and autonomous vehicles with Volkswagen AG and sold its money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by India\u2019s Mahindra & Mahindra.  In China, Ford lost $771 million last year, about half the 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. Ford has been struggling to revive sales there since its business began slumping in late 2017, and prospects look more cloudy now that the world\u2019s largest market has been hit by a fast-spreading coronavirus.

The cold snap has overwhelmed Texas\u2019 power grid, while natural gas supplies to Mexico from Texas were interrupted, leaving millions without power in Mexico\u2019s industrial northern states earlier in the week.  In Texas, freezing temperatures are expected to last through Saturday.  Mexico generates most of its power from natural gas, largely imported from the United States. The two countries also require intricate supply chains to be functional to supply auto and other industrial operations on both sides of the border.  Six northern Mexican states have experienced significant power cuts that have triggered a temporary suspension of operations at auto assembly plants, according to Mexican auto association AMIA.  At least five plants have been affected since Tuesday, the association added, which has forced the plants to cut their consumption of natural gas by between 20-30%.  Ford Motor Co. F.N on Thursday said adverse weather had led to the temporary closure of plants in Kansas City, Michigan and Kentucky, as well as a plant in Hermosillo in the northern Mexican border state of Sonora..  Late on Wednesday, Volkswagen said it would suspend some production in Mexico on Thursday and Friday due to limited natural gas supply. The cut in supply also affected Audi as well as General Motors Co\u2019s plant in the central city of Silao, where work stopped on Tuesday night and Wednesday.  GM said Thursday that first-shift operations were canceled at plants in Arlington, Texas; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Bowling Green, Kentucky. The first two factories also would likely be closed for the second shift.  Other automakers affected by the winter weather include Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co Ltd.  Toyota said its plant in Texas would be idled through Friday, while first shifts would not operate on Thursday at plants in Mississippi and Alabama. Nissan said production at plants in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Canton, Mississippi, remain suspended.  Ford\u2019s Kansas City plant\u2019s operations have been canceled from Feb 13-22, the company said.  Mexico, Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy, has reeled as gas imports via pipeline from Texas dropped by about 75% over the last week, causing billions of dollars of losses on power outages and factory closures.

FILE PHOTO: The corporate logo of Ford is seen at Brussels Motor Show, Belgium January 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir  Fears over the spread of the virus led hourly employees at Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N minivan assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, to stop working for a time, a spokeswoman said.  The FCA workers had been concerned about possible exposure to the virus through secondary contact, but were convinced there was no risk and they returned to work Friday afternoon after about 24 hours, a spokeswoman said.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told employees on Friday the No. 1 automaker is asking all employees and contract workers to work remotely, noting the company has faced crises before.  \u201cFor many of us, it\u2019s our first experience of this type. But disruption and trying circumstances are not new to us,\u201d she said in an email.  Barra said the remote-work policy applied globally apart from China, which has existing protocols in place. \u201cOur IT tools and systems have been extensively stress-tested; it\u2019s vital that we leverage them to continue delivering,\u201d she said.  Ford will shift most of its global white-collar workforce outside China, where recovery has begun, to working remotely, CEO James Hackett said in an email to employees.  \u201cIn recent days ... we\u2019ve concluded the coronavirus issue has taken on a different dimension \u2013 and we need to be proactive to keep our people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work,\u201d he said.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also is accelerating its deployment of remote work for white-collar employees beyond the most affected countries of China, South Korea, Japan and Italy, CEO Mike Manley said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters on Friday.  Ford\u2019s Hackett told employees that in the event a worker tests positive for the virus they will be told to get medical attention and self quarantine at home. Ford will identify others who may have been in contact with that person and instruct them to seek medical attention and self quarantine for 14 days.  He added Ford will close any facility exposed to a confirmed case, and a spokeswoman confirmed that includes manufacturing plants.  However, Ford has seen \u201climited\u201d impact to its global operations due to the epidemic, with some employees testing positive for the virus in China and Germany but none so far in the United States, spokesman Mark Truby said.  The No. 2 U.S. automaker has not lost any vehicle production outside of China and it is taking steps to keep its plants operating, he said. However, some parts of the U.S. market have seen customer traffic at dealers hurt by the outbreak, he added.  On Thursday, FCA said an employee at its Indiana transmission plant had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but he was being treated and the plant was still operating while anyone exposed to that worker was quarantined.  Manley said in the letter to employees on Thursday that FCA is focused on worker safety and keeping its plants running.  \u201cClearly, we are now moving beyond regional hotspots and into planning for how this will impact every area of our business across the world,\u201d he said.  Changes include allowing for greater space between employees at several plants, and stepping up cleaning and availability of face masks, Manley said.

We clearly hold the ambition to be a global brand and there again the electric journey is an important one,\u201d Shah said.  Mahindra\u2019s high-end electric vehicle Pininfarina Battista is a starting point, Shah said, adding that the automaker would look at developing more electric platforms in India to build SUVs for the local and export markets.  Mahindra and Ford late on Thursday called off their automotive joint venture due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted them to reassess their capital allocation priorities.  The two companies had plans to jointly develop vehicles for manufacture in India for local sales and export to dozens of emerging markets under the Ford badge.  However, Mahindra was not convinced the venture would generate returns needed to justify the higher investment it would have to make in a post-pandemic world.  Shah told reporters Mahindra had initially planned to invest about 30 billion rupees ($410.68 million) in the venture, half of which would have been equity.  Now, Mahindra plans to invest the money in electric vehicles, he said, adding it is open to collaborating with Ford in the future, including in EVs.  The review is part of a broader restructuring at Mahindra under which the company is exiting several loss-making businesses, including its South Korean unit Ssangyong Motor, to focus on profits and cash flow.  Mahindra said on Friday it is close to agreeing a deal with a potential investor for its majority stake in Ssangyong, which has been placed in receivership. Its total investment in the SUV-maker is $264 million and the extent of the write-off would depend on what deal is agreed, Shah said.  The automaker last year also pulled the plug on its U.S. electric scooter unit GenZe and aviation business GippsAero. Its other global subsidiaries include Peugeot Motorcycles.  Mahindra sold close to 190,000 passenger vehicles in India in the last fiscal year ended March 31, giving it close to 7% share of the market, industry data shows.","293":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it was extending production cuts at three North American plants until at least mid-March due to the global semiconductor chip shortage, while vehicles at two other factories would only be partially built.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen in Warren, Michigan, U.S. on October 26, 2015. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  GM\u2019s U.S. rival Ford Motor Co also said Tuesday that it was in limited cases parking partly assembled vehicles due to the chip shortage.  GM, whose shares dipped 1.1% after the announcement, did not disclose the impact on volumes or say which supplier and vehicle parts were affected by the chip shortage.  But it said it would focus on keeping production running at plants building its highest-profit vehicles: full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. GM said it intended to make up as much lost production as possible once the shortage chip eased.  \u201cSemiconductor supply remains an issue that is facing the entire industry,\u201d GM spokesman David Barnas said. \u201cGM\u2019s plan is to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products.\u201d  GM said it was extending downtime at its U.S. plant in Fairfax, Kansas; its Canadian factory in Ingersoll, Ontario; and its Mexican facility in San Luis Potosi until mid-March when it would reassess the situation, he said.  In addition, GM said it would build but leave incomplete for final assembly vehicles at Wentzville, Missouri, and its Mexican plant at Ramos Arizpe.  GM vehicles affected by the idled plants include the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, Cadillac XT4 SUV, Chevy Equinox, and GMC Terrain SUVs. Vehicles to be left incomplete for now included the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon pickups and Chevy Blazer SUV.  This week, GM had said it was idling the three factories where it has now extended downtime and said it would halve production at a plant in South Korea.  Ford\u2019s chief product platform officer, Hau Thai-Tang, at a conference on Tuesday raised the possibility that Ford might have to park vehicles that would need parts added later because of the chip shortage. Kelli Felker, a Ford spokeswoman, later said the company was doing that \u201cin limited cases,\u201d but did not say what vehicles were affected.  The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as auto manufacturers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.  Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tight chip supplies. They have also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies.  The chip shortage has affected many automakers, including Toyota, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Renault, Subaru, Nissan, Honda and Mazda.  VW said Tuesday it expects chip supply to remain tight in the first half of the year.  AutoForecast Solutions on Tuesday updated its estimate for lost production this year, saying the global industry could lose almost 1.3 million vehicles as a result of the shortage. GM could lose an estimated 111,450 vehicles, the forecasting firm said.  Honda and Nissan said on Tuesday they would sell 250,000 fewer cars in total this financial year due to the chip shortage.  Ford said last week the shortage was hitting production of its highly profitable F-150 pickup trucks, saying it could lose 10% to 20% of planned first-quarter vehicle production and earnings could fall by $1 billion to $2.5 billion.  Taiwan, home to the world\u2019s largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), is at the center of efforts to resolve the shortage. U.S. officials discussed the issue with their Taiwanese counterparts last week.  Chinese officials said on Tuesday they had met with auto and chip companies, asking them to help ease the shortage. French state officials meet with auto and electronics industry leaders on Wednesday to discuss the issue.  The Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) said this week that chip shortages had hurt national auto production in January, and it would likely dampen output during the first half of 2021.  The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents technology and auto companies, wrote U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urging action to address the shortage, including providing \u201csubstantial funding\u201d to ensure there will be enough chips.","294":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N will work with Intel Corp's INTC.O autonomous driving unit, Mobileye, to develop an improved collision avoidance system for its vehicles, the No.2 U.S. carmaker said on Monday.

The plan is to get the new design approved quickly by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Tom Westrick, vice president and chief quality officer at GE Healthcare, said on a conference call.  Ford also is evaluating a separate effort not involving GE with the British government to make additional ventilators.  Hackett told CNN he believes the industry can produce \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of ventilators by early to mid-May. \u201cThere\u2019s no higher sense of urgency.\u201d  Ford on Tuesday extended the shutdown of its North American plants beyond March 30 as originally planned, but a spokesman said the healthcare-related efforts are separate and continuing.  Separately, Ford will work with 3M to increase manufacturing capacity of its air-purifying respirators by up to a factor of 10 to meet a surge in demand for first responders and healthcare workers, while also similarly developing a simplified design that Ford could build at one of its Michigan plants.  Under the simplified design, Ford is looking at using fans from its Ford F-150 pickup\u2019s cooled seats to make parts of the respirators.  Additionally, Ford said its U.S. design team, working with the United Auto Workers union, was starting to test transparent full-face shields for first responders, which when paired with N95 respirator masks, could be an effective way of limiting exposure to the coronavirus. The company is targeting making more than 100,000 a week at non-vehicle manufacturing facilities in Michigan, including using 3D printers to help.

How do we use what we\u2019ve got to get to something that\u2019s capable and would meet regulatory requirements,\u201d Jim Baumbick, the Ford vice president in charge of the automaker\u2019s efforts, told Reuters.  On Monday, No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co GM.N said it was partnering with medical equipment maker Ventec to build ventilators at GM's parts plant in Indiana.  Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler Automobile NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N told employees in an email that the Italian-American automaker would start converting one of its China plants to ultimately make over 1 million masks a month to help combat the coronavirus outbreak.","297":"(Refiles to correct spelling of \u201cTesla,\u201d not \u201cTelsa,\u201d in headline of second graphic)  SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 8 (Reuters) - For the first time, Tesla Inc\u2019s stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.  The Silicon Valley electric car maker\u2019s stock rose about 4%at midday on Wednesday, hitting a record high and elevating its market capitalization to $88 billion. That is $2 billion larger than General Motors\u2019 and Ford\u2019s respective stock market values of $49 billion and $37 billion, combined.  Fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter , Tesla\u2019s stock has nearly doubled in the past three months.  The progress made by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has defied short sellers and other traders expecting the automaker to be overtaken by long-established car companies, including GM and Ford.  Underscoring investors\u2019 confidence in Musk and his company\u2019s future growth, its market capitalization has outpaced its U.S. rivals, even as their businesses dwarf Tesla\u2019s. GM and Ford each delivered more than 2 million vehicles in the United States last year, compared with Tesla\u2019s worldwide deliveries of 367,500 vehicles.  While Tesla\u2019s recent progress has cheered supporters, many analysts and investors remain pessimistic about the company\u2019s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow.  The company has repeatedly missed targets in recent years and Musk\u2019s mercurial behavior has come under close scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders of Tesla.  More analysts rate Tesla \u201csell\u201d than \u201cbuy,\u201d which is extremely unusual for companies on Wall Street. Eleven analysts recommend buying Tesla shares, while 13 recommend selling and another nine are neutral, according to Refinitiv data.  Shares of GM are unchanged over the past 12 months, while Ford has risen 10%, both drastically underperforming the broader market, with a slump in China car sales hurting investor sentiment in both of those companies.  This week Tesla began delivering Model 3 electric cars built at its Shanghai factory, just under a year since it began work on the $2 billion plant.","298":"Ford Motor Co. shows the all-new electric Mustang Mach-E vehicle for a photo shoot at a studio in Warren, Michigan, U.S. October 29, 2019. Picture taken October 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N has tried and failed to generate interest in utilitarian electric vehicles such as a battery-powered Focus compact car. Now, the company is using the high-performance image of its Mustang muscle cars to sell an electric SUV. Here are some details of the Mustang Mach E's design and performance.  What\u2019s in the name? The Mustang Mach E name is a reference to the high-performance \u201cMach 1\u201d versions of the Mustang sports car that Ford has offered at various times.  How much will it cost? Ford says the Mach E will start at about $43,000. There will be three versions to start with: Select, Premium and First Edition. In 2021, Ford plans a \u201cCalifornia Route 1\u201d model and in the spring of 2021 a high-performance GT model.  How long will it run on a charge? Ford is aiming for 230 miles (370 km) of driving range per charge for standard models, and 300 miles for \u201cextended range\u201d models. The rival Tesla Model Y sport utility has a 300-mile range for rear-drive models, and 280 miles of range for all-wheel drive and performance models.  How fast is it? Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk pioneered high-performance electric vehicles. Ford plans to join Porsche and other automakers in catching up. Ford is aiming to make the standard Mach E's time from 0 to 60 miles per hour faster than the least expensive Porsche Macan sport utility. The Mach E GT's acceleration target is in the \"mid-3-second\" range - on a par with a high-performance Porsche 911, Ford said.  How big is the dashboard screen? Ford will offer a 15.5 inch screen in the Mach E. The Tesla Model 3 offers a 15-inch (38 cm)screen. Ford has developed a new generation of its Sync infotainment software that can be updated over the air, like a Tesla.  When will the Mach E go on sale? Ford will start taking reservations for Mach Es on Sunday, Nov. 17, asking customers to put down a $500 deposit. Vehicles are scheduled to start shipping to customers in late 2020.  Where\u2019s the growl? Mustang coupes deliver a distinctive engine growl that is as much a part of the brand as the pony logo. The Mach E will have no pistons or exhaust pipes. Ford said it will make noises in three modes: Whisper, Engage and Unbridled.  How much can it haul? The Mach E will have 59.6 cubic feet of load space with the rear seats folded down. The vehicle will also have a front trunk, or \u201cfrunk,\u201d that can carry 4.8 cubic feet of stuff - and has a drain in the bottom that makes it usable as a drink cooler.","299":"Former play-by-play announcer Al Michaels was named the winner of the Ford C.
