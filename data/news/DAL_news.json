- Shares in U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N dropped 4 percent in Thursday morning trading on concerns that slowing global economies would limit the No. 2 U.S. airline's revenue growth in 2019 despite strong travel demand.  At its investor day, Atlanta-based Delta forecast a 4 to 6 percent rise in revenues, compared to an average 5.6 percent rise forecast by Refinitiv data.  The lower end of Delta\u2019s 2019 profit forecast of $6 to $7 per share also fell short of an average $6.70 forecast by Refinitiv.  U.S. airlines hiked fares and baggage fees in 2018 to drive revenues, but investors fear carriers will not be able to keep increasing prices as global economic growth slows.  Delta shares were down $2.29, or 4 percent at $53.97 shortly before noon EST (1700 GMT), underperforming a slight rise on the S&P 500 stock index.  To boost revenues, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Delta would continue segmenting its cabins with an increased focus on higher-margin premium products. These now account for 30 percent of Delta\u2019s revenue stream, double the amount six years ago.  The airline plans to increase average seats per aircraft by 2 percent annually between 2018 and 2023, with premium seats growing by 40 percent on every aircraft.  Delta also said it will start offering five different cabins on four of its aircraft next week, with a view to equipping all of its widebodies with the five cabins by 2021.  Less than half of revenues currently come from its main cabin.  On fuel costs, Delta said it expects a $300 million drop in fuel expenses for 2019. Traditionally, airlines have taken advantage of lower fuel costs to add more flight and seat capacity, a measure that can also drive down unit revenues, a closely watched metric that compares airlines\u2019 sales to available seat miles.  Delta said it planned to increase capacity by about 3 percent in 2019. This is below a 4 to 6 percent capacity increase targeted by rival United Airlines UAL.O, which has been trying to claw back market share against its larger peers.  Oil prices have fallen about 30 percent since hitting a four-year high in October.  Delta expects $3 to $4 billion in free cash flow, and about $4.5 billion in capital expenditures for 2019.","1":"(Reuters) - Several state officials on Tuesday offered Delta Air Lines DAL.N a new place to call home after a Georgia legislator said he would kill lucrative tax benefits to the Atlanta-based carrier as retribution for its decision to sever ties with the National Rifle Association.

REUTERS\/Ginnette Riquelme\/File Photo  Officials from Virginia, Washington, New York and Ohio have volunteered their states to headquarter Delta after the No. 2 U.S. carrier faced some public outcry for ending its relationship with the NRA in the wake of the recent Florida school shooting.  \u201cAny state would be lucky to call itself the home of Delta headquarters,\u201d Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, a Democrat, wrote in an open letter to Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian.  \u201cHey @Delta\u2014Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You\u2019re welcome here any time,\u201d Virginia Governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, wrote on Twitter to his 125,000 followers.  Delta did not respond to requests for comment.  On Monday, Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, a Republican, wrote on Twitter he would \u201ckill any tax legislation\u201d that benefits Delta, unless the carrier reinstated its relationship with the NRA, which advocates for the Second Amendment right for Americans to bear arms. [nL2N1QG1RM]  \u201cCorporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,\u201d Cagle wrote.  Delta is one of Georgia\u2019s largest private employers with 33,000 employees statewide.  The Georgia legislator is considering a jet fuel sales tax exemption designed to benefit Delta that would save the airline some $40 million per year.  Cagle is running for governor in the 2018 race, and rival Republicans in the race have said they will not support the measure unless Delta reinstates its relationship with the NRA.  The NRA has been under renewed fire since the Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman with a legally purchased semiautomatic rifle reignited the nation\u2019s long-running debate over gun rights. [nL2N1QG18N]  More than a dozen corporations have cut ties with the NRA since last week, including rival United Airlines, car rental companies Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Alamo Rent a Car, MetLife insurance and others. [nL4N1QG3WY]  Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo and the Lieutenant Governor Cyrus Habib of Washington also extended welcomes to Delta to relocate to their respective states.  \u201cWhile Georgia politicians may disagree with the airline\u2019s principled stand, we here in the Empire State welcome Delta with open arms, and invite them to move their headquarters here,\u201d Cuomo said in a Tuesday statement.

BASTIAN REPORTS OPEN MARKET SALE OF 25,000 SHARES OF CO'S COMMON STOCK ON APRIL 20 AT $55.335\/SHARE - SEC FILING Source text (bit.ly\/2Jk7cSx) Further company coverage:","3":"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines had a strategy for years: expand worldwide by buying stakes in airlines and partner with them while avoiding the cost and red tape of full acquisitions.  FILE PHOTO: Delta Air Lines passenger planes are seen parked due to flight reductions made to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage\/File Photo  That strategy, more aggressive than those of any rival, could now backfire. Aeromexico this week became the third Delta partner to file for bankruptcy due to the coronavirus pandemic, following LATAM Airlines Group and Virgin Australia.  In Latin America, Delta spent nearly $3 billion to build up stakes in Aeromexico and LATAM over the past three years.  The investments had promise before the pandemic, but their valuations have since been crushed and could be leveled entirely if equity holders are wiped out, as is common in Chapter 11 reorganizations.  Even if that does not happen, Delta faces diluted equity stakes if other partners come in through the two airlines\u2019 reorganizations, as well as a probable downsizing. Both factors could make them less promising partners to connect with its flights.  In the worst case scenario, it would be at the back of the queue if either company liquidates, getting pennies on the dollar.  But over the longer term, partnerships could be a way for U.S. airlines to reboot international travel, which is expected to recover more slowly than domestic travel.  \u201cA restructured set of partners ... could end up being the way that the U.S. majors reconstruct their global networks,\u201d said Vik Krishnan, who leads McKinsey\u2019s Travel practice in North America. \u201cIn other words, they become more reliant on these partnerships rather than less.\u201d  Even if Delta did want to trim back its global partnerships, the bankruptcies mean that any stake sale would make little sense, at a time when Aeromexico and LATAM are valued at record lows.  One consultant said there was a chance Delta could chip in some funds to help Aeromexico survive, given the importance of the market across the southern U.S. border.  \u201cDelta has spent time, money and effort on Aeromexico. If they had to rescue them, I think they would,\u201d said Carlos Ozores, an aviation consultant at ICF.  It might not be as inclined to rescue LATAM, Ozores said, partly because the relationship is much newer.  Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian has said the company stands by its partners.  Following Aeromexico\u2019s bankruptcy, Bastian forecast it would emerge from Chapter 11 \u201cwell positioned to succeed and will be a stronger partner for Delta.\u201d  But the carrier, which has received $5.4 billion in U.S. government aid to pay employees through September, has shown no willingness to put cash into foreign partners\u2019 restructurings.  The Financial Times on Wednesday reported Delta would support Virgin Atlantic, in which it holds a 49% stake, with deferred payments on branding fees and shared IT platforms.  Its approach contrasts with that of state-controlled Qatar Airways, which owns a 10% in LATAM and has joined other shareholders to commit $900 million in cash to the Chilean carrier.  Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said the bankruptcies do not affect its financial position or the state of its balance sheet.  DIMINISHING VALUE  For years Delta built a foothold in new markets through joint ventures, which allow airlines to coordinate fares and schedules. By buying stakes, it also got to appoint board members to have a say in its partners\u2019 strategies.  But with border restrictions and international travel at a near standstill, the partnerships\u2019 economic and strategic value has been vastly curtailed, analysts said.  Three of Latin America's largest airlines - LATAM, Aeromexico and Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN - are now in Chapter 11, as governments avoided potential bailout packages. Analysts expect a changed post-crisis landscape in the region with fewer competitors and higher ticket prices.  Delta paid $2 billion for a 20% in LATAM just 3-1\/2 months before global travel imploded in March. With that money, it could now buy LATAM more than twice over.  It booked the value of its 49% stake in Aeromexico at $833 million in 2019, but as of Wednesday the investment was only worth about $85 million, according to the market cap value from Refinitiv, a data provider.  In its bankruptcy papers, Aeromexico called its relationship with Delta \u201cextremely important in strengthening its position in the Mexico-United States travel market,\u201d the Mexican carrier\u2019s largest and most critical international market.  Delta also owns stakes in Air France KLM and Korean Air, and has a joint venture partnership with Virgin Australia, which is set to be bought out of administration by U.S. private equity group Bain Capital, and joint venture agreement with Canada\u2019s WestJet pending U.S. regulatory approval.  It had been negotiating a stake in Italy\u2019s Alitalia which, since the pandemic, is expected to survive only by being re-nationalized.","4":"Sept 17 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it is raising $9 billion through new bonds and loans backed by its SkyMiles loyalty program, as the carrier attempts to strengthen its cash position to weather the travel downturn due to the pandemic.  The airline had said earlier this week that it is pledging its loyalty program to raise $6.5 billion as it burns through $27 million a day.","5":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines has hired two investment banks to offer a stake in its Monroe Energy refining subsidiary, signaling it wants a partner to shoulder the risk of running an energy business.  A Delta Air Lines flight is pushed put of its gate at the airport in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., January 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The Atlanta-based airline acquired the 185,000-barrels-per-day refinery in 2012 for $150 million in a bet that it could lower its cost of jet fuel, among the highest expenses for any airline. The refinery also makes gasoline and diesel for profit.  The U.S refining industry has been consolidating into larger players that can use scale to lower their cost of buying raw materials and paying for regular overhauls. In the U.S. East Coast, four refineries closed in the past decade due to the rising costs of acquiring crude.  Ed Hirs, a professor of energy economics at the University of Houston, said the attempt to recruit a joint venture partner is no sure thing.  \u201cIt was a boneheaded decision then, and they are still paying for it. It is going to be tough to sell a refinery that has faced closure several times due to bad economics,\u201d he said.  Delta defended its effort to bring in a partner.  It is planning to invest $120 million in Monroe Energy\u2019s Trainer, Pennsylvania, plant next quarter on maintenance and improvements. That overhaul will curb production for two months.  \u201cAfter several years of ownership it is natural for Delta to seek other opportunities that might exist to optimize the benefits to Delta and maximize the value of other aspects of the refinery for a potential joint venture partner,\u201d Paul Jacobson, Delta\u2019s finance chief, said in a statement.  Delta has said the refinery\u2019s purchase was more than a way to make a profit from the subsidiary, arguing that if the facility had closed it would have sent jet fuel prices higher across the Northeast, hurting the airline\u2019s results.  But more recently Delta has run the plant like a traditional refinery, choosing to make more of whatever refined product offered the highest margin.  The company has hired investment banks Barclays and Jefferies to manage the sale process. The banks have already begun talking with potential suitors, according to sources familiar with the matter. It was not immediately clear what valuation the company has put on the stake offered.  Delta has grappled with the best way to manage Monroe.  Last year, it hired a consultant to evaluate the impact on jet fuel prices of any sale or closure of the refinery. The company downplayed the evaluation\u2019s significance at the time, calling it routine.  East Coast refiners got a lifeline from the Bakken shale boom in North Dakota earlier this decade. Production there outpaced pipeline capacity, forcing producers to offer steep discounts to East Coast refiners like Monroe.  However, the discounts have vanished in recent years as more pipeline capacity came online in the upper U.S. Midwest. That forced Monroe and other U.S. East Coast refineries once again to buy higher priced crudes for their plants, reverting back to the poor economics that hurt them a few years earlier.","6":"ROME (Reuters) - Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport will run COVID-tested flights to and from the United States operated by Delta Air Lines and Alitalia, it said on Thursday, adding it will be the first airport in Europe to offer the service on transatlantic flights.  From December, passengers flying between Rome and some U.S. destinations can be tested for the coronavirus 48 hours before departure and on arrival at the airport, to avoid the mandatory 14-day quarantine Italy imposes on incoming travellers.  Aeroporti di Roma (ADR), the unit of Italian infrastructure group Atlantia that runs Fiumicino airport, said the new protocol will be valid for those flying from New York JFK, Newark and Atlanta.  In a separate statement, Delta Air Lines said it would reopen its routes between Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airport, in Georgia, and Rome on Dec. 19 to those travelling for work, health or study reasons.  \u201cCarefully designed COVID-19 testing protocols are the best path for resuming international travel safely and without quarantine until vaccinations are widely in place,\u201d said Steve Sear, Delta President \u2013 International and Executive Vice President - Global Sales.  Fiumicino saw its passenger traffic plummet this year due to the coronavirus crisis and early in March it was forced to announce a partial closure.  In September, in an effort to resume domestic travel after the first wave of the epidemic, Italian carrier Alitalia experimented with COVID testing on some flights between Rome Fiumicino and Milan city airport Linate, Italy\u2019s biggest hubs.  However, the government progressively restricted movement between regions to tackle a second wave of infections and Milan is currently under a partial lockdown.  The Italian government is expected to give the go-ahead to COVID-tested U.S. flights in the coming days, ADR said, adding that the government\u2019s official backing will also allow them to offer such flights between Rome and Munich, and Rome and Frankfurt in Germany.","7":"WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc said Friday it will temporarily suspend all remaining U.S.-China flights after the U.S. State Department elevated a travel advisory over concerns about the coronavirus.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Around 100,000 employees of American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N and United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O have already accepted offers for temporary or permanent leaves, the companies have said.  Airlines continue to reduce their workforces in an effort to align their businesses with the sharp downfall in air travel. But they are also trying to keep enough workers, particularly pilots whose training is costly and lengthy, to service any recovery.  If airlines furlough too many workers, \u201cthe bounce-back is almost impossible,\u201d United Chief Executive Scott Kirby said at a conference on Thursday.  United is in talks with its labor unions on voluntary options that Kirby said are focused more on the bounce-back than on \u201csurvivability.\u201d  Airlines have said cancellations are slowing and bookings are improving, though their flying schedules are still just about 20% of what they would normally be.  Delta, with around 91,000 employees, announced on Thursday details of an enhanced retirement package for long-term employees and a separate voluntary opt-out package. Both include cash severance, full healthcare coverage and travel benefits, a memo dated May 27 showed.  In a video seen by Reuters, the company said it is offering between four and 20 weeks of severance along with 12 months of health care and travel benefits for the voluntary opt-out. Delta is offering up to 26 weeks of severance for enhanced retirement packages and retiree medical accounts of more than $100,000.  \u201cEvery voluntary departure helps to protect the jobs of those who most need them,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said in the memo to employees. He added: \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how challenging the environment is, and will be for the foreseeable future.\u201d  Delta says most retirements will take place Aug. 1.  U.S. airlines cannot force any job or pay rate cuts until Oct. 1 under the terms of the federal CARES Act, which provides billions of dollars to help cover their payroll expenses until Sept. 30.  After that date, airlines have warned of involuntary reductions if overall workforces are still larger than needed.  American Airlines, with more than 100,000 employees, told its management and support staff on Wednesday that it must cut about 30% of their ranks, the same size of reductions planned by United for its management and administrative employees.  \u201cWe must plan for operating a smaller airline for the foreseeable future,\u201d American\u2019s Elise Eberwein told employees Wednesday in an email.  American is also discussing voluntary options with unions representing pilots and flight attendants, and Delta with its pilots\u2019 union. Delta\u2019s flight attendants are not unionized.","15":"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DAL.N moved to retire its Boeing Co BA.N 777 fleet and reduce its pilot ranks on Thursday as it joins other airlines wrestling with the need to shrink their operations to match reduced air travel due to the coronavirus crisis.  After announcing that it would no longer fly its 18 wide-body 777s, Delta told its 14,500 pilots that it expects to have 7,000 more than it needs in the fall, according to a memo to flight operations employees first reported by Reuters.  \u201cI recognize that is an alarming number so it\u2019s important to know that our intent is to align staffing for what we need over the long term,\u201d John Laughter, S.V.P. of flight operations, said in the May 14 memo seen by Reuters.  U.S. airlines are collectively burning more than $10 billion in cash per month and averaging fewer than two dozen passengers per domestic flight in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as they brace for two or three years until air travel will return to pre-crisis levels.  American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O has also announced a large fleet retirement, and United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O has told its pilots to brace for changes.  All three are receiving billions of dollars in government payroll aid that bans any job cuts before October.  Taking into account the exit of pilots who will reach mandatory retirement age over the next year, Delta would still have between 2,500 and 3,500 more pilots than needed to fly its schedule in the third quarter of 2021, Laughter said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  U.S. pilots must retire by age 65, a requirement that until a few months ago was fueling a rush by airlines to recruit new aviators to feed what the U.S. industry expected would be continued growth in domestic air travel.  But the spread of the novel coronavirus has brought airports around the globe to a virtual standstill, turning airlines\u2019 growth plans upside down.  Delta said it also plans to retire its older and higher- maintenance MD-90 planes by the end of the year, resulting in second-quarter non-cash impairment charges of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, before tax.  Shares in Delta were down 2.7% at $18.89 in late-morning trading after earlier hitting a 7-year low.  When international demand returns, Delta plans to use Airbus SE's AIR.PA more fuel-efficient and cost-effective A330 and A350-900 wide-body planes for long-haul flying, it said.

A Delta spokeswoman said the 10 A350 aircraft, which stem from Delta\u2019s tie-up agreement with Chilean carrier Latam, would be delivered through 2025.  The deal, which Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday, firms up a planned switch first announced when the two carriers forged their alliance in 2019 and whose completion was partially disclosed in manufacturing data issued last week.  The formal transfer of the jet order, worth roughly $3 billion at list prices, coincides with Delta and other U.S. airlines negotiating government aid to help them meet their payroll costs while dealing with a drastic drop in air travel demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.  \u201cGiven the current environment, we are working in close partnership with Airbus on further rescheduling opportunities across our entire order book,\u201d Delta spokeswoman Lisa Hanna said.

FILE PHOTO: Passengers check in at a counter of Delta Air Lines in Mexico City, Mexico, August 8, 2016. REUTERS\/Ginnette Riquelme\/File Photo  Atlanta-based Delta had long struggled to get a better foothold in the Latin American market, lagging United Airlines UAL.O and American Airlines AAL.O, whose longtime partnership with LATAM gave it a comfortable lead.  With the Delta deal, that reigning power couple has split.  Dominance in Latin America \u2014 an air travel market expected to double in the next decade \u2014 has been fiercely disputed by the top three U.S. carriers for good reason. Eight of every 10 passengers in Latin America traveling outside the region are bound for North America, according to industry group ALTA.  Following its breakup with Chile-based LATAM last month, American Airlines quickly announced new flights next year from Miami to Chile and Peru \u2014 destinations where the two had been coordinating their routes with regulatory approval.  \u201cThis shows you that the (American-LATAM) partnership ultimately ended up undermining supply,\u201d said Carlos Ozores, a principal at consulting company ICF. \u201cThere was no competition because these were two carriers that coordinated their fares and worked as one.\u201d  American said it had \u201cexpanded routes and lowered prices\u201d as a result of its coordination with LATAM in Chile and Peru.  The combined strength of LATAM and American ultimately doomed their partnership, as Chile\u2019s top court ruled in May that they could not expand their cooperation on travel to the United States.  By contrast, Delta\u2019s historic weakness in the region has become a distinct advantage, allowing it to leapfrog competitors without facing as much regulatory scrutiny.  \u201cAmerican and LATAM had a number of overlaps that created issues,\u201d Delta Chief Legal Officer Peter Carter told investors last month. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t have that here.\u201d  LATAM declined to comment.  American said in a statement it \u201cremains the largest U.S. carrier to both Latin and South America and we look forward to competing and growing in this region of the world.\u201d  American also announced an additional daily flight from Miami to Sao Paulo starting in 2020, a market where it did not have the level of coordination as in Chile or Peru. This will create stiffer competition, especially in Miami, a hub for both LATAM and American and a top destination for Latin Americans.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very risky move because Delta is not very strong in Miami and American is very strong there,\u201d said Luis Felipe Oliveira, ALTA\u2019s executive director.  BEYOND BRAZIL  Delta has worked for much of the past decade to improve its standing in Latin America, investing in Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas GOLL4.SA in 2011 and Grupo Aeromexico AEROMEX.MX the next year. In 2016, it made an offer for Colombia's Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN, but was rebuffed in favor of United.  In recent years, Delta has grown frustrated with the Gol partnership, which did little for its South American push beyond Brazil. LATAM and Avianca have broader regional ambitions, investing in domestic airlines outside their home markets.  \u201cSo the natural thought is ... that produces a return that\u2019s below your average return,\u201d Glen Hauenstein, Delta\u2019s president, told investors last month regarding the prior regional strategy.  Delta is in the process of selling its stake in Gol, and redoubling efforts in Colombia, Chile and Peru, which account for a combined 45% of South American travel to the United States, compared with just 29% percent from Brazil.  Air traffic in each of the three countries is expected to more than triple between 2020 and 2040, according to a forecast prepared by CAF, a Latin American development bank owned by countries in the region.  Colombia even rivals Brazil for U.S. travel. Last year, 3 million travelers flew between Brazil and North America, compared with 2.7 million who flew between Colombia and North America, according to worldwide industry group IATA. Colombia, which has a quarter of the population of Brazil, is also expected to grow its economy more quickly than its larger neighbor.  \u201cThe major market that we want to be in is Colombia,\u201d Delta\u2019s Hauenstein said.  LATAM is already making ambitious moves there. In May, it announced a $300 million investment in Colombia aimed at challenging market leader Avianca, which has allied with United and Copa Holdings CPA.N in their own regional play.  Delta is hoping it is arriving in time to reap the benefits of LATAM\u2019s groundwork.","18":"FILE PHOTO: A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft is pictured in front of United Airlines planes, including Boeing 737 MAX 9 models, at William P.

Airlines have been operating about 90% fewer flights than normal but are gradually adding flights back to their schedules as demand begins picking up.  Southwest said on Tuesday it recorded positive bookings on a net basis so far this month as passenger reservations outpaced trip cancellations, helping the company slow its cash burn rate.

The surprise deal with Latin America\u2019s largest carrier will give Delta a much bigger footprint in the region, a key growth market in which LATAM flies to dozens of destinations including cities in Argentina, Peru and Brazil.  The LATAM deal is Delta\u2019s largest since it merged with Northwest Airlines a decade ago.  American Airlines Group Inc, which has long been the leading U.S. carrier in the region and was pursuing a deeper route alliance with LATAM, said the loss of its Chilean partner would not have a significant impact on its financial results.  American added that its LATAM partnership had limited upside after the Chilean Supreme Court struck down the two carriers\u2019 plans for further route cooperation that would have also involved oneworld alliance members British Airways and Iberia.  \u201cThis is a body blow for American, but not a lethal body blow. It means that Delta will have more access to Latin America than it did before, but American already has much of that in its back pocket,\u201d independent aviation analyst Mike Boyd said.  Following its tie-up with Delta, LATAM will exit oneworld and pursue route options with Delta and its partner Grupo Aeromexico, which belong to the rival SkyTeam alliance. It has not, however, decided whether to officially join SkyTeam.  Oneworld said LATAM had advised it would leave the alliance in \u201cdue course\u201d in line with contractual requirements, without naming a specific date.  Airlines increasingly have bilateral codeshare arrangements outside major alliances. Qantas Airways Ltd, a oneworld member, said it would retain its codeshare partnership with LATAM despite the Chilean carrier\u2019s departure from the alliance.  DELTA PARTNERSHIP  As a result of the deal, Delta will sell its stake in Brazil\u2019s largest airline Gol, a LATAM rival.  Delta does not expect regulatory obstacles for its tie-up with LATAM, where it will gain representation on the board of directors. The plan envisions growth for both carriers, which currently overlap on only one route, Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a great fit,\u201d he said.  Atlanta-based Delta expects the LATAM deal to be accretive to earnings per share over the next two years and add $1 billion in revenue growth over five years, Bastian said.  Delta is using newly issued debt and available cash for the deal. It will also provide LATAM with an additional $350 million to help it transition out of oneworld and plug into Delta\u2019s network.  The two can start code-sharing before they receive government, regulatory and anti-trust approval for the larger tie-up, a process Bastian said he expects to take between 12 and 24 months.  Delta will also acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and assume LATAM\u2019s commitment to purchase another 10 A350s to be delivered between 2020 and 2025 for an undisclosed sum.  Apart from its stake in Grupo Aeromexico, Delta also has holdings in Air France KLM, China Eastern, Virgin Atlantic and Korean Air Lines Co\u2019s parent company.  It has also been negotiating a 10% stake in Alitalia as part of its strategy to boost its international presence through equity investments. That plan has not changed with the LATAM deal, which Delta started studying about three months ago after an approach by a third party, Bastian said.  Delta has seen its shares and earnings outpace U.S. rivals this year.

The airline said on Saturday the last China-bound flights will now leave on Saturday, Feb. 1, and the last returning flights from China will depart China on Sunday.  China is facing mounting isolation from international travel curbs and flight suspensions as the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to 259.

The strength of the recovery will hinge on factors such as the pace of vaccine rollouts and people\u2019s appetite for flying after a year that nearly brought global travel to a halt.  In the first quarter, the Atlanta-based airline expects revenue to fall by 60% to 65% from a year ago and its scheduled flight capacity to shrink by 35%.  As it continues to block middle seats at least through March 30, it expects the actual capacity it sells to fall by around 55%.  \u201cWhen the demand for air travel picks up because of confidence, that\u2019s going to be the indication that we start selling those middle seats,\u201d Bastian said.  Business travel should pick up in the second half of the year but remain muted for a period of time, he said.  A recovery in international travel, which has been hit hard by travel bans, will take at least another year and Bastian said the airline would continue to burn through $10 million to $15 million a day in the first quarter.  It lost an average of $12 million a day in the fourth quarter, but remains on track to halt its cash burn in the spring, the airline said.  Global airline industry body IATA believes a return to positive cash flow for the industry might not happen this year, Chief Economist Brian Pearce said on Thursday, as a resurgence in lockdowns has killed off a fragile bookings upturn.  Delta expects to have $18 billion to $19 billion of liquidity by the end of March, including an additional $3 billion in government payroll support, while carrying around $18 billion in net debt.  It had $16.7 billion in liquidity in 2020 after a series of capital raisings.  FIRST ANNUAL LOSS SINCE 2009  Delta, the first U.S. airline to post 2020 results, reported a $12.4 billion loss - its first since 2009 - on operating revenue of $17 billion. It recorded a $4.8 billion profit a year earlier.  It lost $755 million in the fourth quarter, or $1.19 per share.  Delta booked $1 billion in COVID-19 related charges in the quarter, though total adjusted operating expenses fell by $4.6 billion or 47% on lower fuel, maintenance and salary costs.  Delta has avoided furloughs but said nearly 18,000 employees, or 20% of its workforce, decided to leave the company in 2020.  It does not intend to furlough any employees once the second round of government payroll support for airlines expires in March.  The company expects to retire nearly 400 jets through 2025 as it simplifies its fleet to nine families of aircraft.  Bastian has previously hinted at the possibility of purchasing Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX.  The U.S. government will hopefully lift its international travel ban by the spring or summer if the virus is contained, Bastian said.  Turning to disruption on recent U.S. flights by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, Bastian said Delta has placed passengers involved in incidents that targeted senators Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham on its no-fly list.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N said on Wednesday it will extend social distancing measures on its flights through Sept. 30 and will block the selection of middle seats and cap seating in every cabin.  Reuters reported last month the airline would keep planes to no more than 60% full through at least July, adding more flights to its schedule than demand would usually justify, citing sources. The goal is to convince passengers worried about COVID-19 to return to flying.  The move is part of a longer-term bet that CEO Ed Bastian has highlighted to investors: Consumers\u2019 perceptions of safety will be instrumental in reviving more routine travel, and they will be willing to pay a premium for comfort.  \u201cReducing the overall number of customers on every aircraft across the fleet is one of the most important steps we can take to ensure a safe experience for our customers and people,\u201d Delta\u2019s chief customer experience officer, Bill Lentsch, said.  Delta will cap seating at 50% in first class, 60% in other cabins and 75% in its exclusive Delta One cabins.  Social distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry\u2019s main group, IATA, has said airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit planes to two-thirds of normal capacity unless they drastically increased airfares.  In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Peter DeFazio, in May urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.  While major U.S. airlines\u2019 middle-seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings. Airlines have also endorsed the Transportation Security Administration\u2019s beginning temperature checks before passengers board planes, but the Trump administration has not yet endorsed the idea.","27":"April 2 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc said on Tuesday it expects first-quarter profit between $0.85 per share and $0.95 per share, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $0.80 per share.

Without an industrial partner, Alitalia could soon find itself in trouble since neither Ferrovie nor the state have the skills to run the carrier, a source said last week.  Alitalia was put under special administration in 2017 after workers rejected its most recent rescue plan, leaving Ferrovie racing to meet an end of March deadline set by Rome to present a rescue plan.  Should the deadline be missed, it would jeopardize the repayment of a 900 million euro ($1 billion) state loan to Alitalia, which must take place by the end of June.  Although the parties had not seen eye to eye on the structure of a deal, prompting easyJet to withdraw from talks, Delta said on Monday it was still in talks with Ferrovie over the proposed 900 million euro rescue plan.  \u201cDiscussions remain ongoing as Alitalia is a long-standing partner of Delta,\u201d the U.S. airline said, while Alitalia and Ferrovie were not immediately available for comment.  FRESH FUNDS?  Italy\u2019s populist government, which has made the re-launch of Alitalia one of its priorities, is sponsoring a plan that would see Ferrovie inject fresh funds and revamp the carrier together with industrial partners.  Ferrovie is not willing to take a stake of more than 30 percent in Alitalia, a source with knowledge of the talks said, forcing Rome to look for additional investors, probably among them state-controlled companies.  However, potential suitors have so far been few and far between, and Delta can only imagine taking a 15 percent stake or spending around 100 million euros, another source close to the matter said last week.  EasyJet, whose shares were unaffected by its announcement, had said several times it was interested in Alitalia\u2019s short-haul operations and positions at primary airports.  A source familiar with the talks said easyJet still believed it could be a good partner for Alitalia, but that a deal was not feasible with the current approach.  \u201cEasyJet pulled out because it wanted to control (Alitalia\u2019s) Milan hub and use it for point-to-point flights. This could not be done,\u201d another source said.  EasyJet said in a statement it remained committed to Italy as a key market: \u201cWe continue to invest in the three bases in Milan, Naples, (and) Venice\u201d.","49":"WASHINGTON, March 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected nominate former Delta Air Lines executive Steve Dickson to head the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as early as Tuesday, two people briefed on the matter said.

The carrier said \u201cit\u2019s likely to take a long time for the airline industry to bounce back.\u201d  American has more than 86,000 unionized mainline employees, including about 25,300 flight attendants and 13,800 pilots.  Under a deal offered to workers on Tuesday, flight attendants, mechanics and gate agents can opt for a period of six, nine or 12 months of unpaid leave while keeping medical benefits and travel privileges. They can also take early retirement with two years of medical benefits, but no pay.  Pilots have reached a separate, more attractive deal with the company that would allow early retirement for ages 62 to 65 at half pay and medical benefits. The mandatory retirement age for U.S. airline pilots is 65.  American has not offered any leave or early retirement options to ticket reservation employees, who are in high demand as customers rush to cancel or rebook tickets.  Meanwhile, more than 5,000 Delta flight attendants have taken a voluntary unpaid leave option starting in April after the company extended a deadline for requests, according to two Delta employees, who declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.  The people said the reasons for taking unpaid leave varied from a sense of solidarity among flight attendants who may have other family income, to family care needs as schools close or the emotional toll of being potentially exposed to the virus.  Delta has extended unpaid leave options through July, according to a memo seen by Reuters. It is also paying flight attendants\u2019 medical premiums while on leave, but the cost will be deducted from their paychecks when they return to work, the employees said.  Delta declined to comment.  The take-up for April represents around 1\/5 of Delta\u2019s 25,000 flight attendants, but still means the company would have more employees than it needs to serve a drastically reduced April flying schedule.  Delta said on Saturday it had reached an agreement with its pilots union to manage overstaffing in April with partially paid schedules and coronavirus-related sick leave.

The airline previously said it could halt a cash bleed that averaged $18 million per day in September before the end of the year, but pushed back the target as revenues fell 76% to $3.1 billion in the third quarter from a year earlier.  Atlanta-based Delta, the first U.S. airline to report third-quarter results, said it expects its cash burn to narrow to $10 million to $12 million per day in December. It was burning $27 million in cash per day in June.  The company swung to a $5.4 billion net loss, or $8.47 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from a $1.5 billion profit a year ago. Analysts had estimated a $3.04 per share loss, based on Refinitiv data.  The losses included a $3.1 billion charge for voluntary separation and early retirement programs as Delta slimmed its workforce as demand plunged, and a $2.2 billion fleet restructuring charge.  However, a 32% decline in labor costs in the quarter led to $1.3 billion in unspent federal funds awarded by Congress in March to cover airlines\u2019 payroll costs for six months and protect jobs.  \u201cWe\u2019ve stretched those dollars out,\u201d Delta\u2019s chief executive, Ed Bastian, told Reuters, saying the company can use the money in the fourth quarter, on top of any additional aid if lawmakers finally approve another $25 billion payroll support program for U.S. airlines.  An industry push for more aid has broad bipartisan backing but is stalled amid a Washington deadlock over wider COVID-19 economic relief.  Unlike its two major rivals, Delta has avoided the furlough of flight attendants and other frontline employees after reducing work hours, but it could still furlough some 1,700 pilots on Nov. 1 without a union agreement or more federal aid, Bastian said.  Delta\u2019s flight capacity was down 63% in the third quarter and its average load factor was just 41% versus 88% a year ago, though the average yield per passenger declined only 2%.  To woo pandemic-wary passengers, the airline is blocking off middle seats through the end of the year. The policy beyond that will depend on COVID-19 testing developments, traveler surveys and continued studies on the risk of COVID-19 transmission on airplanes. Studies so far have shown the risk is \u201cremarkably low,\u201d Bastian said.  Delta has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on efforts to restore passenger confidence, and while more people are beginning to travel, quarantines and uneven public health measures remain a deterrent, Bastian said.  He estimates business travel will recover in 12 to 24 months, though not at 100%. Delta is currently operating about 15% of its normal business travel, he said.  With no immediate need for new jets, the company has reduced purchase commitments for Airbus and Bombardier CRJ aircraft by more than $2 billion in 2020 and by more than $5 billion through 2022.  Delta ended the quarter with $21.6 billion in liquidity, after a $9 billion capital raising in September secured by its loyalty program. Adjusted net debt totaled $17 billion.

However, that growth is driving up expenses, a concern for investors. Shares of Delta, which have outperformed major airline peers this year, sank 3.4% to $52.06, after earlier dropping to $51.07, its lowest since March 29.  Delta paid its pilots record overtime this summer as the carrier flew a heavy schedule, in part because of demand tapped from competitors that canceled flights due to the grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes, Reuters reported on Wednesday.  \u201cThe size of the demand surprised us,\u201d Bastian said in a telephone interview.  Atlanta-based Delta does not own the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes. As a result, it is able to increase flight capacity at a time when growth at MAX carriers like Southwest Airlines LUV.N and American Airlines AAL.O remains at a standstill.  Delta is forecasting capacity growth of around 4.5% in the fourth quarter, though costs per available seat mile, excluding fuel, are also seen rising between 4% and 5% in the period.  Costs, excluding fuel, rose 2.4% in the third quarter due to higher employee wages, demand volume and weather incidents, Delta said. \u201cGiven the high volume that we\u2019ve experienced and the demand for the product, it\u2019s created a need for additional resources across all of our work groups (...) and getting this staffing in sooner,\u201d Bastian said.  Delta expects to retain the market share it picked up this summer, he told investors on a conference call. New hires will help meet larger travel volumes and keep cost inflation at around 2% over the longer term.Net income climbed 13.1% to $1.5 billion in the quarter to Sept. 30 on total adjusted revenue of $12.56 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached $2.32, beating analysts\u2019 expectations for profit of $2.26, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts were forecasting revenue of $12.6 billion.  For the fourth quarter, Delta expects earnings per share in the $1.20 to $1.50 range, below analyst estimates for $1.51. The airline, the first of its peers to report quarterly earnings, is among the U.S. airlines hardest hit by a new 10% tariff on European-made Airbus AIR.PA planes. Bastian said the tariff is not expected to have an impact this year because its remaining Airbus deliveries will come from the European planemaker's plant in Mobile, Alabama, which is exempt from the levy. Delta is \"looking at all of our options to make sure that we don't incur any increases to our already negotiated prices with Airbus\" for deliveries due next year, Bastian said. Last month, Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s, which are assembled in Europe, as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group. The airline is also still targeting an investment of around 100 million euro ($109.80 million) in the rescue of Italian flagship carrier Alitalia, Bastian said.","63":"FILE PHOTO: Delta Air Lines passenger planes are seen parked due to flight reductions made to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. March 25, 2020.

The United States and Europe have been locked in a 15-year spat over mutual claims of illegal aid to plane giants.

Delta does not operate the MAX, enabling it to expand its flight capacity and capture new customers as peers like Southwest Airlines Co have had to scale back.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that we\u2019re picking up new customers, but that\u2019s not the main driver of our performance,\u201d Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters, citing strong customer loyalty at a time when air travel demand continues to rise.  American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc are scheduling flights without the MAX into early June, in anticipation of extra simulator training requirements for pilots once regulators finally approve the jet to fly again.  Southwest, the other U.S. MAX carrier, so far is cancelling flights into April.  Delta has not picked up premium revenues from rivals over the MAX but Bastian said the carrier would continue to see a marginal benefit while the jet remains grounded.  Net income climbed 8% to $1.1 billion in the quarter through Dec. 31 from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share hit $1.70, beating analysts\u2019 expectations for $1.40, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Lower fuel costs and a 9-cent-per-share gain from the sale of its stake in Brazil\u2019s Gol also propped up profit.  Quarterly operating revenue rose 7% to $11.4 billion, and Delta expects growth of 5% to 7% in the first quarter as U.S. demand rises in spite of heightened geopolitical tensions.  Shares were up 4.2% at $61.94, with Delta\u2019s positive comments on travel demand lifting shares of other U.S. airlines as well..  Delta, the first of its peers to report quarterly results, generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow for the year, and expects to repeat that this year, enabling new investments in technology to improve passenger experience.  J.P.Morgan analyst Jamie Baker called the cash flow \u201cunchartered territory for any airline.\u201d  One issue for 2020 will be ongoing contract negotiations with pilots.  As for new aircraft, Delta is still interested in Boeing\u2019s proposed new midsized airplane, known as the NMA, despite the planemaker\u2019s delayed decision on whether to launch the new aircraft as it continues to deal with the 737 MAX fallout.  Delta wants to remain a customer of both Boeing and Airbus SE but the longer Boeing takes to decide on the NMA\u2019s launch, the fewer options the carrier has, Bastian said, noting Airbus\u2019 A321XLR and A330 could be alternatives.  The airline is also still interested in investing around 100 million euros ($111.34 million) in the rescue of Italian flagship carrier Alitalia, Bastian said, and is working on anti-trust immunity in South America after closing this month the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group.

The number of passengers screened at U.S. airports dipped to 501,513 on Tuesday, the lowest number since July 4 as COVID-19 cases spike, and Delta Air Lines\u2019 chief executive warned that the outlook remained bleak in the months ahead.  An initial $25 billion in payroll support for airline employees expired in October, prompting tens of thousands of furloughs.  Airlines have lobbied for fresh relief, arguing their infrastructure is critical to quickly and widely distributing COVID-19 vaccines.  A summary of the draft legislation seen by Reuters would provide payroll aid through the end of March, protecting workers and banning share buybacks and dividends and limiting executive compensation during that period.  U.S. carriers are burning $180 million in cash every day, with passenger volumes down 65% to 70% and cancellations rising, industry lobby Airlines for America (A4A) said on Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  \u201cPeople are more inspired to travel,\u201d Bastian told Reuters ahead of the carrier\u2019s investor day, citing the increased affordability of flying and advances in social media and technology, even as environmental and \u201cflight-shaming\u201d activists threaten air travel growth in Europe.  Atlanta-based Delta is forecasting 2020 profit of $6.75 to $7.75 per share, versus analysts\u2019 mean estimate of $7.06 according to IBES data from Refinitiv, on revenue growth of 4% to 6% and $4 billion of free cash flow.  Still, Bastian said Delta\u2019s investors and customers are also increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of air travel and cited airlines\u2019 ability to protect the environment as an existential threat to their growth.  For 2020, the chief risk to Delta\u2019s earnings forecast is any deterioration in U.S. consumer health, he said.  On Wednesday, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said overall airline profit is on course to fall faster than it initially expected in 2019 as trade wars hit global commerce and broader confidence, though it predicted a modest recovery next year.  Delta's 2020 revenue target already takes into account uncertainty on the timing of a return to service of the Boeing Co BA.N 737 MAX, which has forced U.S. competitors Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N, American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O to cancel flights in a marginal benefit to Delta, which does not own the aircraft.  The 737 MAX was grounded after a fatal crash in Ethiopia in March, about five months after another fatal crash in Indonesia.  Delta also announced on Thursday a deal for its Delta Private Jets subsidiary to partner with Wheels Up, a private aviation company with 190 aircraft, to create one of the world\u2019s largest owned and managed fleets of private jets.  While private aviation has a larger environmental impact than commercial flying, Bastian said empty legs as jets are repositioned account for 40% to 50% of private flying. By making it more accessible and affordable, the jets can be better utilized.  \u201cIt\u2019s not something we\u2019ll ever market as sustainable but certainly as an improvement,\u201d Bastian said.  Delta will hold an equity stake in Wheels Up but did not disclose the size of the holding or any financial details.

The United States lifted a 20-month-old flight ban on Boeing 737 MAX on Wednesday, easing a safety crisis that left its top exporter with a tarnished reputation and hundreds of idle jets.  Bastian also cast doubts on travel corridor between New York and London calling it \u201ccomplicated\u201d and said it would be easier to relaunch transatlantic flights to \u201cjust about any\u201d other European capital.  Major airlines want the U.S. and British governments to launch a trial of coronavirus testing for passengers flying between London and New York to pave the way for resuming more international travel.","76":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DAL.N said on Thursday it is raising $9 billion, $2.5 billion more than its previous estimates, through new bonds and loans backed by its SkyMiles loyalty program, as it attempts to strengthen its coronavirus-roiled finances.  U.S. airlines have cut costs and raised debt to survive what they call an unprecedented industry crisis and the situation is not expected to improve anytime soon.  The Atlanta-based company said on Thursday the total proceeds is being raised at a blended average annual rate of 4.75%.  Delta said on Monday that it is pledging its loyalty program to raise $6.5 billion comprising of $4 billion bonds and $2.5 billion loan, as it burns through $27 million a day.  Earlier this month, the carrier said it would not chase a $4.6 billion federal loan available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, although it continues to lobby for a second round of federal payroll grants.  Smaller rival United Airlines UAL.O in June had pledged its loyalty program MileagePlus for a new $5 billion loan aimed at further buffering its liquidity.","77":"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N said on Thursday it sees a return to margin growth next year as it posted a estimate-beating rise in quarterly profit on strong demand and tight cost controls, sending shares higher.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  With oil prices hovering near four-year highs, Delta and peers such as American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N are facing a surge in fuel costs that is weighing on profits, even as demand for air travel is strong.  To combat that headwind, airlines have increased ticket prices, used more fuel-efficient planes and hiked baggage fees.  \u201cOur commercial momentum and improved cost trajectory give us confidence that we are on a path to deliver continued top-line growth and expand margins as we move into 2019,\u201d Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said.  Net income rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the third quarter, from $1.16 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. The company took a $30 million charge from Hurricane Florence last month in the quarter, but said the impact from Hurricane Michael has been minimal.  On an adjusted basis, Atlanta-based Delta earned $1.80 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.74, according to Refinitiv data.  Adjusted operating revenue rose 8 percent to an all-time third-quarter record $11.8 billion, driven by a rise in domestic and transatlantic revenues.  Corporate travel remained strong in the United States and demand should not be hurt by rising U.S. interest rates, the carrier said.  Shares climbed 3.4 percent to $51.42, underpinning gains on the Dow Jones US Airlines index .DJUSAR and S&P Composite 1500 Airlines index .SPCOMAIR.  J.P. Morgan said in a note to investors that Delta\u2019s outlook left the door open for fourth-quarter margin expansion and higher margins in 2019, which it sees as \u201ccritical\u201d for the stock performance.  Delta said it would keep any growth in nonfuel unit costs below 2 percent next year.  The company expects overall capacity to rise about 3 percent in 2019, and said it is replacing older narrowbody aircraft with larger, more efficient Airbus SE AIR.PA A321s and Boeing Co BA.N 737-900s through 2020. This will provide a nearly 15 percent improvement in seat cost, executives said.  Delta said it expects earnings of $1.10 to $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter, in line with estimates, and total annual revenue growth of about 8 percent versus 2017.","78":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Wednesday it will continue blocking middle seats through March 30, setting it apart from its largest U.S. rivals under a longer-term strategy to fetch higher passenger revenues.  Recent medical research has shown that the risk of contracting the coronavirus on airplanes is very low when passengers wear masks, underpinning other large U.S. airlines\u2019 policies to sell all available seats on their planes.  But Delta is betting that people are willing to pay a premium for more space.  \u201cSome customers are still learning to live with this virus and desire extra space for their peace of mind,\u201d its chief customer experience officer, Bill Lentsch, said in a statement.  The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed diverging strategies among airlines to coax people to travel again and pave a path back to profitability once the crisis subsides.  U.S. airlines have cut their flying capacity by around 50% in response to lower demand, but intend to gradually put more planes back in the air as demand returns, particularly once COVID-19 treatments and vaccines become widely available.  Delta\u2019s move means that it can immediately free up capacity by unblocking middle seats, without the cost of adding more planes.","79":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DAL.N has doubled its staffing to handle revamped pre-flight \"pit stops\" for deeper cleaning and wants to ensure that tray tables and restroom door handles are germ-free with a new testing process, an executive told Reuters.  Airlines\u2019 efforts to reassure travelers of their safety during the pandemic have spurred a behind-the-scenes scramble to complete the enhanced cleaning that they are promising without sacrificing turnaround times, a cornerstone of profitability, once more passengers take to the skies.  \u201cWe\u2019ve done quite a lot of change to our turn process,\u201d the head of Delta\u2019s new Global Cleanliness division Mike Medeiros said in an interview detailing the airline\u2019s strategy for \u201cturns\u201d -- the time a plane spends on the ground between flights.  Depending on the aircraft\u2019s size, Delta is deploying at least eight pre-flight cabin cleaners, up from three to five previously, and has adopted a new \u201cpit stop mentality\u201d based on industrial engineering studies into the extra resources required for cleaning each plane type, he said.  After cleaners spray with disinfectant and wipe down high-touch surfaces, a flight attendant and gate agent walk the cabin together to inspect. If the cabin is not up to par, they call back the cleaners.  \u201cEven if that means taking a delay to the flight,\u201d said Medeiros, who is among managers who receive daily cleanliness reports in their inbox based on customer surveys taken after every flight.  \u201cAs important as (being) on-time is to our company, we know that cleanliness, particularly in this environment but also going forward, will be just as important,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Delta\u2019s average clean time for its domestic fleet is now 20 minutes, up from 10 minutes to 15 minutes previously depending on the aircraft size, but it aims to speed up the procedure to protect its turn times once schedules are heavier by adding resources.  To verify levels of cleanliness, Delta is purchasing ATP test kits that measure the amount of bacteria on airplane and airport surfaces. The kits cannot test for COVID-19.  It has already purchased 30 of the hand-held units, which cost about $1,000 each, to test the effectiveness of its cleaning program. The plan is to buy the tests for all of its global airport bases, though details are still being developed.  Among large U.S. rivals, American Airlines AAL.O said it has doubled the strength of its cabin cleaning crews but has not had to add extra time to its turns given lighter passenger loads and fewer scheduled flights.  United Airlines UAL.O said it has added some extra time to its cleaning process but not workers given the lighter loads.  Southwest Airlines LUV.N, whose low-cost model depends on quick turns, has not added staffing and said this month it was scaling back some pre-flight cleaning with a view to preserving an average 45-minute turn once its schedule ramps up. It is still using an electrostatic and an anti-microbial spray that kill viruses and shield surfaces for 30 days, as well as a broad-spectrum disinfectant for lavatories and tray tables before every flight, but is not wiping down seat belts or arm rests.  All of the airlines are eyeing new cleaning technology. United, for example, is testing ultraviolet sanitation deployed by drones and hand-held wands for airport and aircraft surfaces. Delta is rolling out antimicrobial LED light technology by Vital Vio in all its aircraft restrooms that will continuously prevent the growth of bacteria, fungi, mold and yeast.  The airline is also in talks with Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus SE AIR.PA on developing touchless restrooms and is studying a UV light that would sterilize lavatories when they are not in use, Medeiros said.  Last week Delta said it would continue blocking middle seats through Jan. 6. Southwest is limiting seating capacity through October, while American and United are selling all seats. Beyond the jet, Delta is looking at bipolar ionization to improve air filtration at its airport facilities, including jetways. Airplanes already use hospital-grade HEPA that refresh air every two to four minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of adding costs to the business, but it has to add value,\u201d said Medeiros. \u201cIf people are fearful or uncomfortable, travel won\u2019t come back in the near term.\u201d","80":"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N said on Wednesday it does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years and is working to halve its cash burn after posting its first quarterly loss in eight years due to the coronavirus pandemic.\"We should be prepared for a choppy, sluggish recovery even after the virus is contained,\" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said.  A second wave of the coronavirus is expected to hit the United States next winter and could strike much harder than the first because it would likely arrive at the start of influenza season, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Tuesday.  Current air travel is purely essential, Bastian said, and predicted that larger passenger volumes will not return until people perceive that it is safe to travel.  Delta shares were 2% lower in midday trading, reversing earlier gains.  In a matter of months, U.S. airlines like Delta have gone from expansion to survival, searching for ways to raise and save as much cash as possible as flight cancellations started outnumbering new bookings around mid-March when Delta said demand dropped to near-zero.  By the end of the quarter, passenger volumes had dropped by as much as 95 percent and Delta was burning $100 million per day. Net sales are expected to remain slightly negative through June, said Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson, who has suspended his retirement to help the airline through the crisis.  After a series of cost-cutting measures and capital raisings, including a government bailout, the airline\u2019s daily cash burn will slow to about $50 million by the end of June, and possibly by May, executives said.  The airline expects to have $10 billion in liquidity in June, up from $6 billion in March.  Atlanta-based Delta said its expenses will decline by about 50%, or $5 billion, in the second quarter, and its revenues by 90%.

Total operating revenues fell 18% to $8.59 billion.  Delta, the first U.S. airline to post first-quarter results, is among those receiving a government bailout meant to cover six months of payroll on the condition that it not lay off employees until October and retain a certain number of flights.  It received half of its $5.4 billion payroll aid on Monday; the remainder will arrive over April, May and June.  The airline also said it was considering applying for an additional $4.6 billion in secured government loans under the stimulus package known as the CARES Act.  Airlines could benefit in the coming quarter from a recent plunge in oil prices, though with so few planes flying the impact may not be substantial.  Delta is reducing its flight schedule by about 85% through June, including an 80% cut for domestic flights and 90% for international flights, which experts expect will be the slowest to recover. More than 37,000 employees have volunteered for unpaid leaves lasting between one month to one year.  Delta\u2019s fuel expenses decreased 19% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. It paid $1.81 per gallon, including a $29 million benefit from its refinery.  Delta is parking more than 650 aircraft and may not spend any cash on new aircraft this year. Some of the parked jets may never fly again as the airline looks to downsize in the near term.  \u201cThis certainly isn\u2019t the world we were expecting when the year began,\u201d Bastian said.","81":"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines and British retail bank HSBC UK were named as major winners of a global anti-slavery award on Thursday after training flight attendants to spot trafficking and giving bank accounts to slavery survivors.

HSBC won the innovation award, Delta the campaign award, while Aldi scooped the goods and service firms award, recognized for cleaning up a high-risk supply chain and requiring suppliers and other partners to be trained in slavery awareness and laws.  Outland Denim, which employs survivors and vulnerable women in Cambodia, won the small and medium sized companies award with judges noting its wide-ranging approach to helping staff.

If confirmed, the deal would mark the second order for the slow-selling A330neo in as many weeks after Kuwait Airways ordered eight of the long-haul planes in mid-October.  Airbus is aggressively seeking more orders for the latest version of its profitable A330 franchise after sales of the engine-upgraded A330neo model fell short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from the newer Boeing 787.  However, industry sources have questioned how far recent orders represent net new sales for the European giant, saying they could replace at least some earlier orders for the A350.  The new-generation A350 is a longer-term bet for Airbus and competes with the 787 and Boeing 777. But one market source said Airbus was willing to give up some orders for the newer plane in order to keep the A330neo afloat and prevent production cuts.  Airbus has given cautious signals that it is prepared to be flexible in both directions when offering combinations of the A330 and A350, sources said, though it cannot afford to lose too many orders or customers for the more strategic A350 plane.  The wide-body A330neo is part of a pair of upgraded aircraft - the other being the strong-selling A321neo narrowbody - that strategists say Airbus is trying to push into the market to reduce the space for a new 220-260 seat, mid-sized jet being studied by Boeing. A decision on that project is due next year.  Airbus is especially keen to continue A330-series production because it has been a major source of profits and cash.  Airbus also needs an aircraft like the 250-300 seat A330 to offer airlines a step-up into the wide-body market from its largest narrowbody, the A321neo, which holds up to 240 people.  Without it, Airbus's smallest wide-body would be the 315-seat A350-900, which leaves a large gap in Airbus's portfolio above the A321neo for rival Boeing BA.N to exploit.","85":"April 10 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc forecast second-quarter profit above Wall Street expectations and reported a 31 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, boosted by a renewed agreement with credit-card issuer American Express and robust travel demand.  The company said it expects profit for the second quarter to be in the range of $2.05 per share to $2.35 per share.  At the midpoint of the range, the profit forecast was above average analyst estimate of $2.13 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The airline forecast total unit revenue, a closely watched performance metric, to increase 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the second quarter.  The No.2 U.S. carrier\u2019s net income rose to $730 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $557 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Delta earned 96 cents per share, beating expectations of 90 cents per share.  Total operating revenue rose 5.1 percent to $10.47 billion in the quarter.

REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  Bastian said he was \u201chappy with existing\u201d language, or scope clauses, which set guidelines on the size of planes that can be operated by regional feeder carriers, among other things.  Commercial planemakers are closely watching for any change in pilot scope clauses, which bar planes heavier than 86,000 pounds (39,000 kg) with more than 76 seats from regional routes, where pilots are generally paid less than their mainline counterparts. Pilots are fiercely opposed to any changes.  Delta\u2019s contract with its pilots becomes amendable in 2019.  Bastian was speaking at a Montreal-area factory run by Europe's Airbus AIR.PA as the No. 2 U.S. carrier takes delivery of its first A220 jet.  The 110-seat narrowbody aircraft will serve as a \u201ccornerstone of domestic growth\u201d on the carrier\u2019s mainline routes, Bastian said.  United Airlines UAL.O has already faced pushback from pilots after asking for changes to its scope clauses.  American Airlines AAL.O pilots are not expecting any demands from the carrier to change scope clauses when negotiations kick off in January 2019, said Dennis Tajer, spokesman for their union, the Allied Pilots Association.  Scope clauses have become an issue for Brazil's Embraer SA EMBR3.SA and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd 7011.T of Japan, which are building new planes that are too heavy to be flown by regional carriers because they exceed the weight requirement.  Earlier this month, Embraer said it removed a 100-plane order from its backlog due to uncertainty about whether pilots would agree to fly its E175-E2 for U.S. regional carriers, because the plane exceeded scope weight limits.","87":"Breakingviews  Reuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The strength of the recovery will hinge on factors such as the pace of vaccine rollouts and people\u2019s appetite for flying after a year that nearly brought global travel to a halt.  In the first quarter, the Atlanta-based airline expects revenue to fall by 60% to 65% from a year ago and its scheduled flight capacity to shrink by 35%.  As it continues to block middle seats at least through March 30, it expects the actual capacity it sells to fall by around 55%.  \u201cWhen the demand for air travel picks up because of confidence, that\u2019s going to be the indication that we start selling those middle seats,\u201d Bastian said.  Business travel should pick up in the second half of the year but remain muted for a period of time, he said.  A recovery in international travel, which has been hit hard by travel bans, will take at least another year and Bastian said the airline would continue to burn through $10 million to $15 million a day in the first quarter.  It lost an average of $12 million a day in the fourth quarter, but remains on track to halt its cash burn in the spring, the airline said.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  Global airline industry body IATA believes a return to positive cash flow for the industry might not happen this year, Chief Economist Brian Pearce said on Thursday, as a resurgence in lockdowns has killed off a fragile bookings upturn.  Delta expects to have $18 billion to $19 billion of liquidity by the end of March, including an additional $3 billion in government payroll support, while carrying around $18 billion in net debt.  It had $16.7 billion in liquidity in 2020 after a series of capital raisings.  FIRST ANNUAL LOSS SINCE 2009  Delta, the first U.S. airline to post 2020 results, reported a $12.4 billion loss - its first since 2009 - on operating revenue of $17 billion. It recorded a $4.8 billion profit a year earlier.  It lost $755 million in the fourth quarter, or $1.19 per share. The adjusted loss per share was $2.53, versus analyst estimates for $2.51.  Delta shares jumped 2.2% in pre-market trading following the results.  Delta booked $1 billion in COVID-19 related charges in the quarter, though total adjusted operating expenses fell by $4.6 billion or 47% on lower fuel, maintenance and salary costs.  Delta has avoided furloughs but said nearly 18,000 employees, or 20% of its workforce, decided to leave the company in 2020.  It does not intend to furlough any employees once the second round of government payroll support for airlines expires in March.  The company expects to retire nearly 400 jets through 2025 as it simplifies its fleet to nine families of aircraft.  Bastian has previously hinted at the possibility of purchasing Boeing Co\u2019s 737 MAX.  The U.S. government will hopefully lift its international travel ban by the spring or summer if the virus is contained, Bastian said.  Turning to disruption on recent U.S. flights by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, Bastian said Delta has placed passengers involved in incidents that targeted senators Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham on its no-fly list.","90":"April 14 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines confirmed on Tuesday that it has taken over an order for 10 Airbus A350 jets from Latam Airlines Group, but said it has deferred several of the near-term deliveries and was working with Airbus on options across its entire order book.

The news boosted shares of rivals, with United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines Co all up between 1 percent and 3 percent in morning trading.  Delta\u2019s announcement could soothe some nerves as investors were expecting the groundings of Boeing 737 MAX jets, a U.S. government shutdown and more-than-expected outages to pressure profits in the industry.  The quarter started with the longest shutdown in U.S. government history and ended with worldwide groundings of Boeing jets. This led to widespread cancellations in travel plans, with several airlines warning of a potential hit.  Last month, Southwest Airlines cut its financial outlook for the year after being forced to pull its new fleet of 34 Boeing 737 MAX planes out of service.  On Tuesday, Atlanta-based Delta said it expects first-quarter profit of 85 cents to 95 cents per share, compared with its earlier forecast of 70 cents to 90 cents per share. Analysts currently expect earnings of 80 cents per share.  Delta also estimated capacity to be up 5 percent in the March quarter and sees a bump of about 2 percent to its total revenue per available seat mile, a closely followed measure of an airline\u2019s performance.  The airline said it now expects operating revenue for the first quarter to rise about 7 percent, compared with the 4 to 6 percent rise it had forecast earlier.  As of Monday\u2019s close, Delta shares have risen about 4 percent to $52.2 this year.","92":"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: An Air France Airbus A321 lands at Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris, France, May 9, 2018.

Airlines for America - which represents American Airlines Co, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and others - asked Biden in a letter seen by Reuters to \u201callow air carriers to maintain their existing policies and practices which are aimed at de-escalating conflict in-flight and allowing the aircraft to continue while providing a consequential enforcement backstop on the ground.\u201d  The airline group noted airlines have been enforcing the requirements and prohibiting passengers that do not comply from flying for the duration of the pandemic.  \u201cThousands of passengers have been barred to date,\u201d the letter to Biden read, saying it hopes the Democrat applies the legal requirement to airports as well.  The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which has demanded a federal face covering mandate since early in the pandemic, said the mandate would provide one standard across U.S. aviation and back up flight attendants and other airline workers who must enforce compliance.  Republican President Donald Trump opposed legally requiring airline, train and public transit passengers and workers to wear masks amid the pandemic, and the White House rejected efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to require face coverings.  Biden in October said he would mandate masks in all interstate U.S. transportation and he has recently reiterated that plan. The Biden transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.  The airlines called on Biden to apply the rules to all modes of public transport and to \u201crequire all passengers 2 years and older to wear a mask, without exception.\u201d They also called for allowing \u201cexisting practices for food and beverage consumption, medical distress and other necessary flexibilities included in air carrier operational policies.\u201d  They also asked Biden not to extend the legal requirement to crew members.","94":"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N sees the momentum behind 6.5% quarterly revenue growth continuing throughout the year, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said, citing strong domestic demand that drove an increase in its full-year profit forecast.  FILE PHOTO: Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, speaks during a keynote address at the 2019 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo  Shares in Delta gained about 2 percent in premarket trading after the No. 2 U.S. carrier posted a 39% surge in quarterly profit, benefiting from higher fares and fuller planes.  Atlanta-based Delta is the first of U.S. major airlines to report second-quarter earnings, which investors are scouring for signs of weakening consumer demand and the impact of supply constraints due to the three-month grounding of Boeing Co's BA.N 737 MAX.  Delta does not operate the MAX, which remains grounded following two fatal crashes, allowing it to avoid fleet headaches that have plagued North American MAX carriers, including Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N, American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O and United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O, while picking up passengers that rivals did not have enough aircraft to fly.  Bastian said the MAX grounding had a \u201cmarginal benefit\u201d on second-quarter results, but attributed the real growth driver to demand strength and higher premium ticket prices.  \u201cWe had five of the top 10 revenue days in our history just within our last 30 days and we see that momentum continuing to grow throughout the year,\u201d Bastian said in a telephone interview.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much the MAX as Delta that\u2019s driving that,\u201d he said.  As a result, Delta lifted its full-year profit forecast to between $6.75 and $7.25 per share from a previous range of $6 to $7 per share.  Supply constraints related to the 737 MAX are expected to help second-quarter unit revenues, a closely watched measurement of revenues per available seat mile, across the sector, even for MAX operators. For Delta, adjusted unit revenues rose 3.8% in the quarter, driven by growth in both leisure and corporate travel.  \u201cDelta\u2019s operation is clearly executing well to extract maximum value from the searing demand for air travel we are observing this summer,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Jose Caiado said.  Strong U.S. air travel demand is expected to continue in the coming months, though going forward the company is closely watching volatile fuel prices and global economic development, Bastian said.  He said Delta, which is seeking to grow internationally, remains committed to investing around $100 million to acquire about 10% of ailing Italian flag carrier Alitalia, which the Italian government is trying to rescue for the third time.  Delta continues to vet potential partners alongside Alitalia and the Italian government, Bastian said, noting: \u201cI think Alitalia has a promising future with the right ownership structure in place.\u201d  Infrastructure group Atlantia ATL.MI is seen as a possible investor in Alitalia, alongside Ferrovie dello Stato.  Delta\u2019s net income rose to $1.44 billion, or $2.21 per share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $1.04 billion, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier.

Atlanta-based Delta said it has parked about 40% of its fleet and cut its capacity by about 60% in the September quarter from last year as it continues to burn through $27 million in cash each day.  U.S. airlines have cut costs and raised debt to survive what they call an unprecedented industry crisis. Travel demand is hovering around 30% of last year\u2019s levels and the situation is not expected to improve until there is a meaningful recovery in demand.  With its latest financing deal, Delta said it will not pursue a $4.6 billion federal loan available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, although it continues to lobby for a second round of federal payroll grants.  Delta is among U.S. airlines to have tapped funds under a $25 billion made available primarily in grants under the CARES Act to cover employees\u2019 payroll through September, but not a separate $25 billion package in secured loans.  The loan program has attractive financing terms but restricts executive compensation and share buybacks.  The airline has said it could furlough nearly 2,000 pilots in October without more federal aid, but believes it can avoid any flight attendant furloughs through the winter thanks to strong demand for voluntary departures or leaves.  Delta had $15.7 billion in liquidity at the end of June, which it said equaled about 19 months of financial runway at a daily burn rate of $27 million.  It still has unencumbered assets worth $6 billion to $7 billion, primarily in the form of spare aircraft parts and engines, if needed, officials said.  Delta did not disclose the value of the loyalty program, or the terms of the new financing, which mirrors a debt deal by United Airlines in June backed by its $20 billion MileagePlus program.

Of the top four U.S. airlines, Delta is the only one without the MAX. An order from the Atlanta-based carrier, whose relations with Boeing have been frayed in recent years, would be a surprise, market sources said.  Its $14.2 billion in commitments as of June 30 are primarily for Airbus jets. Battling the pandemic, Delta has parked jets and Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in July he was seeking to minimize deliveries over the next two years and did not intend to spend cash on aircraft \u201cfor some period of time.\u201d  Boeing\u2019s unsolicited offer illustrates one of the key challenges it faces once a modified MAX with safety upgrades receives approval to fly again.  These include restoring confidence in the plane, clearing a backlog of undelivered jets at a time when the industry is shrinking, and boosting production rates.  Boeing has built some 460 737 MAXs whose delivery has been frozen since the March 2019 grounding. Jefferies analysts estimate that ties up $16 billion in inventory.  Customers have scrubbed more than 400 737 MAX orders this year after delays exceeded a year, triggering a walkaway clause, and analysts say dozens of these come from the stockpile of aircraft already built and waiting to be delivered.","101":"(Reuters) - A group of U.S. senators is urging Delta Air Lines Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp to immediately reverse their decisions to reduce employees\u2019 hours, calling them contrary to the requirements of taxpayer-funded payroll assistance.

In a matter of months, U.S. airlines like Delta have gone from expansion to survival, searching for ways to raise and save as much cash as possible in an environment where flight cancellations outnumber new bookings.  Atlanta-based Delta swung to a $534 million net loss in the first quarter that ended March 31, or a $0.84 loss per share, from a $730 million net profit a year earlier.  Total operating revenues fell 18% to $8.59 billion, with the airline burning $100 million per day at the end of March as it continued to operate previously-scheduled flights that were nearly empty.  The last time the airline posted a first-quarter loss was in March 2011, when it lost $318 million, according to Refinitiv data.  Between April and June, Delta is reducing its flight schedule by about 85%, including an 80% cut for domestic flights and 90% for international flights, which experts expect will be the slowest to recover.  The capacity cuts - in addition to other measures including executive pay reductions and unpaid leaves - should slow the airline\u2019s daily cash burn to about $50 million by the end of June, it said, with total expenses also declining by about 50%, or $5 billion, in the second quarter.  Delta, the first U.S. airline to post first-quarter results, is among those receiving a government bailout meant to cover six months of payroll on the condition that it not lay off employees until October and retain a certain number of flights.  It received half of its $5.4 billion payroll aid on Monday; the remainder will arrive over April, May and June.  Between that money, cost-saving steps and capital raisings, Delta expects to end June with $10 billion in liquidity, up from $6 billion in March.  The airline is also considering applying for an additional $4.6 billion in secured government loans under the CARES Act, it said.  Airlines could benefit in the coming quarter from a recent plunge in oil prices, though with so few planes flying the impact may not be substantial.  Delta\u2019s fuel expenses decreased 19% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. It paid $1.81 per gallon, including a $29 million benefit from its refinery.  Delta has parked more than 650 aircraft in the midst of the crisis. Some of those jets may never fly again as airlines look to downsize and retire older planes. (Reporting by Tracy Rucinski.

Led by a Republican majority, state lawmakers passed a tax bill that excludes a jet fuel tax exemption designed to benefit Delta, the state\u2019s largest private employer. It was the most significant blowback yet after the carrier said last week it was cutting ties with the NRA following a Florida school massacre.  Delta said it was ending a discount program for NRA members and had asked the gun rights group to remove its information from the group\u2019s website after the Feb. 14 slaying of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland. The killings reignited the long-running U.S. debate over gun ownership laws  Delta did not respond to a request on Thursday for comment about the Georgia tax bill. In a statement on Saturday, the carrier said it supports the Second Amendment, which grants Americans the right to bear arms, and that it wished to stay neutral in the emotionally charged debate.  Georgia Republicans had criticized the airline\u2019s move to cut its ties to the NRA. They were led by Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, president of the state senate, who vowed to kill any tax legislation that benefited Delta. The bill that passed the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate on Thursday had previously included tax exemption language that had been projected to save Delta some $40 million a year in jet fuel tax.  Georgia Governor Nathan Deal had on Wednesday criticized the decision to exclude the exemption as \u201cthe type of antics that tend to plague election years,\u201d but said he would still sign the bill after it passed.

Delta, the first of U.S. airlines to publish quarterly results, posted a 13.1 percent rise in net income to $1.5 billion in the quarter to Sept, 30 on total adjusted revenue of $12.6 billion, up 6.5 percent from a year earlier.  Adjusted earnings per share reached $2.32, beating analysts\u2019 expectations for profit of $2.26 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe size of the demand surprised us,\u201d Bastian said in a telephone interview, attributing the earnings growth to strength in its core product and markets, as well as incremental pick-up of demand that rivals who own the idled Boeing 737 MAX were not able to meet.  Unlike its main U.S. competitors, Delta does not own the 737 MAX, which has not flown since a worldwide grounding in March that is forcing more than 100 daily flight cancellations at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines.  As a result, Delta is increasing its flight capacity while growth at rivals that own the 737 MAX remains stuck. It is forecasting capacity growth of around 4.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  That growth, however, comes at a cost.  The airline paid pilots a record amount of overtime between May and August, double the same period in 2018, Reuters reported on Wednesday.  \u201cGiven the high volume that we\u2019ve experienced and the demand for the product, it\u2019s created a need for additional resources across all of our work groups (...) and getting this staffing in sooner,\u201d Bastian said.  Growth will continue in the fourth quarter, with the holiday travel season looking \u201chealthy,\u201d Bastian said, even as concerns of a global economic slowdown and trade disputes dampen some estimates for international travel demand.  \u201cI know there\u2019s always a lot of speculation on the strength of the economy but in our business we\u2019re heavily levered toward the U.S. consumer and the U.S. consumer is still doing quite well,\u201d he said.  Still, Delta is among the U.S. airlines hardest hit by a new 10% tariff on European-made Airbus planes.  Bastian said the tariff is not expected to have an impact this year because its remaining Airbus deliveries will come from the European planemaker\u2019s plant in Mobile, Alabama, which is exempt from the levy.  He declined to provide a breakdown of 2020 Airbus deliveries but said the airline is \u201clooking at all of our options to make sure that we don\u2019t incur any increases to our already negotiated prices with Airbus.\u201d  Last month before the tariff news, Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s, which are assembled in Europe, as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group.

Specific details could still change, the people said on condition of anonymity, citing the uncertain timing of a recovery from the coronavirus crisis that has decimated air travel demand.  Delta has publicly said that it will limit first class seating capacity at 50% and main cabin at 60% through June 30, and earlier announced that it was resuming some flights next month.  \u201cWe announced a policy on seating capacity through June 30. Nothing has been decided beyond that but we are continuing to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary,\u201d Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said.  Social distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry\u2019s main group IATA has said that airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, unless they drastically increased airfares.  In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.  While major U.S. airlines\u2019 middle seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings, and they have all slashed their flying schedules by as much as 90% in an effort to stem a cash bleed amid withering demand.  Still, Bastian said on a quarterly investor call that fewer airplanes in the skies could be an \u201copportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience.\u201d  Industrywide, U.S. airline load factors have recently been about 33%, with some airlines reporting load factors in the 40% range as passenger traffic inches off historic lows. But it is still down about 90% over 2019 levels.  Adding more flights could bring in more revenues but also costs. Delta, which does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years, has said it aims to halve its daily cash burn to $50 million in June.  In an effort to reassure passengers, U.S. airlines have also intensified cabin cleaning protocols, in many cases using electrostatic cleaning and fogging procedures. They have also endorsed temperature screenings by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), though this has yet to be implemented.","130":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DAL.N expects to add about 1,000 flights in August but not many more for the remainder of the year, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in an internal memo on Thursday that mentioned a resurgence of COVID-19 in parts of the country.  Airlines including Delta have added back some summer capacity after modest improvements in domestic travel demand in May and June, but analysts say a spike in cases in some states, which have prompted three Northeast states to order quarantines for some travelers and Disneyland to delay its reopening, could dampen the recovery.  Bastian said Delta continues to see slow but steady increase in passenger volumes two weeks into the summer travel season, but warned that the airline expects overall demand this summer to be only 25% of last summer\u2019s revenue.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see flights returning (...) we likely remain at least two years away from a return to normal,\u201d Bastian said.  To prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus on airplanes, U.S. airlines have recently cracked down on passengers who do not follow new requirements to wear face coverings by threatening to remove their future flight privileges.

REUTERS\/Stefano Rellandini\/File Photo  Alitalia was put under special administration in 2017 after workers rejected the latest in a long line of rescue plans.  Italy\u2019s populist government, which has made the re-launch of the flagship carrier one of its priorities, is sponsoring a plan that would see state-owned railway Ferrovie inject fresh funds and revamp the carrier together with industrial partners.  Delta and easyJet, which have expressed interest in Alitalia, are in talks with Ferrovie, but the three investors do not see eye to eye on the structure of the deal.  Without an industrial partner fully on board, Alitalia could soon find itself in trouble since neither Ferrovie nor the state have the skills to run the carrier, the source said.  EasyJet has said several times it is interested in Alitalia\u2019s short-haul operations and positions at primary airports, adding the alliance should be commercially viable.  The British low-cost carrier would be open to taking a stake of 15 percent in the Italian airline but only if it wins control of certain Alitalia assets, the source said.  That condition has irritated the three special commissioners in charge of the airline, who fear it could lead to a break-up of the company. The administrators have the power to decide on the offers.  At the same time Delta is also planning to take a 15 percent stake, spending around 100 million euros in the proposed 900 million euro ($1 billion) rescue plan, but does not want to inject more than that, the source said.  A participation of 30 percent or less by the industrial partners, compared with a stake of around 40 percent Ferrovie was counting on, would force the government to find additional investors, probably among state-controlled companies, a second source said.  Ferrovie is expected to take a stake of between 30 and 49 percent in the new carrier, the second source said, making a full involvement of Delta and easyJet crucial.  According to Italian newspaper Il Messaggero, Ferrovie CEO Gianfranco Battisti will fly to Atlanta in the coming days to try to convince Delta\u2019s CEO Ed Bastian to pump more money into the rescue plan.  Ferrovie, easyJet declined to comment on the issue, while Delta was not immediately available for comment.  Ferrovie is racing against the clock to meet a March 31 deadline set by the Italian government to present a rescue plan for Alitalia.  Should that deadline be missed, it would jeopardize the repayment of 900 million euro state loan to the airline, which must take place by the end of June.","139":"SEOUL (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N should abstain from voting at an upcoming shareholders meeting that is likely to decide who leads Korean Air Lines 003490.KS as the U.S. firm has pledged to be a passive investor, the top shareholder in the Korean carrier's parent firm said.  FILE PHOTO - The logo of Korean Air Lines is seen on a plane at its aviation shed in Incheon, South Korea, February 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji\/File Picture  Korean Air's parent firm Hanjin Kal 180640.KS is in the midst of an intense proxy fight. On one side is Korean Air CEO Walter Cho who is a friend of Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian and is widely believed to backed by Delta. Together, with other Cho family members, they would command about 40% of the voting rights for Hanjin.  On the other is activist fund KCGI, which has built up a near 18% stake to become the top shareholder in Hanjin and has joined hands with Walter Cho\u2019s older sister Heather, a former executive at the airline who lost her job after a famed \u2018nut rage\u2019 incident in 2014.  Their camp has roughly 37% of Hanjin\u2019s voting rights and are backing Kim Shin-bae, a former CEO of a telecom company, to replace Walter Cho as a Hanjin board member.  Delta took 4.3% in Hanjin last year, two years after announcing a joint venture with Korean Air and after Walter and Heather Cho\u2019s father died. It has been increasing the stake and new data released on Thursday showed the holding now stands at 13.98%.  That stake build-up is at odds with a public filing Delta made last year that says it will not influence Hanjin\u2019s management, Kang Sung-boo, head of KCGI or Korea Corporate Governance Improvement Fund, told Reuters.  Under Korean law, investors with a stake of 5% or more must declare if they are a passive investor or plan to influence management; if the latter, they are subject to higher scrutiny by regulators.  Kang added that he believes if Delta votes at a March 27 shareholder meeting, it would suggest that the U.S. firm intends to influence management and he might pursue legal action to find out more information.  \u201cI have concerns that Delta\u2019s board and top executives could be violating Korea\u2019s securities laws,\u201d he said, adding that his legal advisor said Delta should have made a filing which made clear its intent to exert influence.  KCGI said it would decide in the coming days whether it would make a direct request to Delta to abstain.  Delta declined to comment on Kang\u2019s remarks. It has made no public comments about the increase in its stake in Hanjin or whether it backs Walter Cho. But its stake buildup has been interpreted as support for Walter Cho, with the market doubling Hanjin\u2019s stock price this year on expectations of a cut-throat proxy war.  Bastian said last June shortly before the announcement of Delta\u2019s initial purchase in Hanjin that his friendship with Walter Cho stretches back 20 years.  Legal and corporate governance experts contacted by Reuters said that under South Korean law, Delta can be a passive investor and still retain the right to vote at a shareholders meeting.  The run-up in Hanjin\u2019s share price this year to record levels comes despite Korean Air having to cut 80% of its capacity and put its cabin crew members on leave due to the spread of the coronavirus.  The airline\u2019s labor union has said it opposes KCGI and Heather Cho\u2019s proposals, arguing their candidates do not have sufficient airline industry experience and has urged shareholders to vote against them.","140":"FILE PHOTO: Delta Air Lines passenger planes are seen parked due to flight reductions made to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. March 25, 2020.

Airbus announced an order for 10 of the 300-seat aircraft in its latest monthly order update on Friday, but withheld the name of the buyer for the Oct. 30 deal.  Two industry sources, asking not to be named, said Delta was the buyer. A third said Delta had been looking to expand an existing order for 25 A330neo aircraft.  Airbus declined comment. Delta was not immediately available for comment.  If confirmed, the deal would mark the second order for the slow-selling A330neo in as many weeks after Kuwait Airways ordered eight of the long-haul planes in mid-October.  Airbus is aggressively seeking more orders for the latest version of its profitable A330 franchise after sales of the engine-upgraded A330neo model fell short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from the newer Boeing 787.  However, industry sources have questioned how far recent orders represent net new sales for the European giant, saying they could replace at least some earlier orders for the A350.  The new-generation A350 is a longer-term bet for Airbus and competes with the 787 and Boeing 777. But one market source said Airbus was willing to give up some orders for the newer plane in order to keep the A330neo afloat and prevent production cuts.  Airbus has given cautious signals that it is prepared to be flexible in both directions when offering combinations of the A330 and A350, sources said, though it cannot afford to lose too many orders or customers for the more strategic A350 plane.  The wide-body A330neo is part of a pair of upgraded aircraft - the other being the strong-selling A321neo narrowbody - that strategists say Airbus is trying to push into the market to reduce the space for a new 220-260 seat, mid-sized jet being studied by Boeing. A decision on that project is due next year.  Airbus is especially keen to continue A330-series production because it has been a major source of profits and cash.  Airbus also needs an aircraft like the 250-300 seat A330 to offer airlines a step-up into the wide-body market from its largest narrowbody, the A321neo, which holds up to 240 people.  Without it, Airbus\u2019s smallest wide-body would be the 315-seat A350-900, which leaves a large gap in Airbus\u2019s portfolio above the A321neo for rival Boeing to exploit.

REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  The House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to impeach Trump on charges of incitement one week after his supporters rampaged in the Capitol following a speech in which the Republican urged them to fight President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Trump falsely claims he lost due to widespread voting fraud.  Representative Diana DeGette, one of nine Democratic impeachment managers who will argue the House\u2019s case against Trump, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was working out with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when to transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate, triggering the trial process.  \u201cThis is a situation where you have the crime pretty much being committed on national television,\u201d DeGette, a former trial lawyer, said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a shockingly evident case.\u201d  In a 232-197 vote on Wednesday, Trump became the first president to be impeached twice and will likely be the first to face an impeachment trial after leaving office.  Ten Republicans joined the majority Democrats in supporting impeachment, while others argued Trump\u2019s remarks were protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which defends free speech.  The action is highly unlikely to lead to Trump\u2019s ouster before Biden takes office next Wednesday. McConnell has said no trial could begin until the Senate was scheduled to be back in regular session on Tuesday.  Impeachment managers will be working through the weekend to compile a list of witnesses they want to call to testify and honing their arguments for conviction, DeGette said.  If Trump has left the White House, the Senate could convict him and then vote to ban him from running for office again.  Biden, a Democrat, has urged Senate leaders not to allow the impeachment trial to get in the way of other priorities in his first days in office such as an economic stimulus bill, coronavirus vaccine distribution improvements and confirming crucial Cabinet nominees.  Biden\u2019s inauguration has been scaled back due to security concerns and the COVID-19 pandemic. The West Front of the Capitol building, where the swearing-in occurs, is now fortified by fencing, barriers and thousands of National Guard troops.  The U.S. Capitol Police said on Thursday that the Capitol complex was closed to the public and its grounds would not be accessible on Inauguration Day, warning that anyone trying to enter unlawfully would be met with force and arrested.  FIRST AMENDMENT DEFENSE  The article of impeachment - equivalent to an indictment in a criminal trial - charged Trump with \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d in his incendiary speech to thousands of supporters on Jan. 6. The mob disrupted Congress\u2019s certification of Biden\u2019s victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead, including a police officer.  A two-thirds majority in the Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to join the Democrats.  Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who has already called for Trump to resign over his actions on Jan. 6, said on Thursday that the House\u2019s impeachment was appropriate. In a statement, she said that when the case comes before the Senate: \u201cI will listen carefully and consider the arguments of both sides, and will then announce how I will vote.\u201d  In the trial, Trump\u2019s legal team may argue that his comments were not a call to violence and were protected under the First Amendment, some legal experts said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  They said that all sorts of lawful rhetoric could be proper grounds for impeachment, however, and that Congress had wide latitude to define \u201cincitement\u201d as it sees fit in the impeachment process.  \u201cEven if his speech was protected by the First Amendment, he can still be impeached for it,\u201d said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. \u201cHigh-ranking officials get fired for their speech all the time.\u201d  Trump\u2019s team could also argue that holding an impeachment trial after he has left office would violate the Constitution.  But there is precedent for Congress impeaching former federal officials and the Constitution explicitly says that impeachment is not just for removing officials but also for disqualifying them from future office, the experts said.  Trump also may face state legal actions on leaving office, including a criminal probe in New York into whether he inflated asset values to obtain loans and tax benefits in his business dealings.  The House impeached Trump in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The Senate in February 2020 voted to keep Trump in office.  No U.S. president has ever been removed from office via impeachment. Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868 but they also were acquitted by the Senate.

FILE PHOTO: A Delta Air Lines flight is pushed put of its gate at the airport in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., January 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The surge in overtime highlights a split in the fortunes of U.S. airline workers as carriers like Delta, which does not fly the MAX, scramble to meet demand while staff at rivals like Southwest Airlines LUV.N and American Airlines AAL.O sit at home on basic pay.  Delta issued a record 40,554 \u201cgreen slips\u201d - double-pay for overtime flying - between May and August, double the same period in 2018, according to pilot union Delta Master Executive Council, a unit of the Air Line Pilots Association.  \u201cThere were weekend days that I would get up to 10 calls a day to pick up an extra shift or an extra flight,\u201d Delta pilot Dana Dann-Messier, who flies a Boeing 717, told Reuters.  \u201cThere were times when the pace of the summer was so hectic that guys wouldn\u2019t be volunteering because they were so wiped out,\u201d said Dann-Messier, who is based in Atlanta.  Delta, due to publish third-quarter results on Thursday before the market opens, last week raised its estimate for growth in third-quarter cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel costs, to about 2.5%, in part due to employee wage increases.  \u201cMaintaining the operational reliability customers have come to expect and love about Delta required additional pilot flying this summer, largely due to severe weather impacting our operation and some incremental flying above our previous plan,\u201d Delta spokesman Michael Thomas said.  He played down the 737 MAX grounding as a major contributing factor.  Still, Delta\u2019s third-quarter capacity growth is expected to outpace that of U.S. rivals whose capacity has stagnated or even fallen as slimmer fleets without the MAX force over 100 daily flight cancellations.  Part of that growth, which Delta has estimated at around 4% for the third quarter, reflects flying that it has covered for partners Aeromexico AEROMEX.MX and WestJet WJA.TO, which both own the MAX.  \u201cThey had an opportunity for more flying,\u201d Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said, while adding that challenging weather this summer, particularly where Delta has a lot of operations in the U.S. Southeast, also likely contributed to the overtime hours.  While overtime is voluntary for pilots, the union has argued that Delta needs to increase the pace of its hiring to better cushion its ranks.  Delta said it continues to hire pilots this year and plans to add more than 900 in 2020.  Meanwhile, Southwest, the world\u2019s largest Boeing 737 MAX carrier, has delayed pilot hiring while the jetliner remains grounded.  Its pilot union this week sued Boeing Co BA.N for an alleged $100 million-plus in lost wages they attribute to reduced flying time because of the grounding, now in its seventh month.  American Airlines\u2019 pilots have demanded compensation over lost pay but have not filed any lawsuits.  The Boeing 737 MAX was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes that killed 346 people within five months.","154":"FILE PHOTO: An airport worker guides a Delta Air Lines Airbus A319-100 plane on the tarmac at LAX in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 6, 2020.

The aviation industry accounts for roughly 2% of global carbon dioxide emissions and has set out a plan to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020, even as air travel is forecast to accelerate.  Facing increasing demands from customers, individual airlines like Delta have taken additional steps to mitigate their carbon impact with measures ranging from eliminating single-use plastics to investing in biofuels and purchasing more fuel-efficient aircraft.  With this new investment, Delta intends to become the first carbon-neutral airline globally while helping to fund research and projects involving clean air technologies and the reduction of carbon emissions and waste.  \u201cThere\u2019s no challenge we face that is in greater need of innovation than environmental sustainability, and we know there is no single solution,\u201d Delta\u2019s chief executive, Ed Bastian, said in a statement.  The airline provided no details on how it will invest the money.  Bastian is an advocate of air travel as a way to connect people and economies across the globe but has been vocal about the industry\u2019s responsibility in ensuring environmental sustainability.  As of now, there are not many quick options available for airlines to reduce their carbon footprint. Biofuels are in short supply and take years to develop, and there are no immediate prospects of newer jet engines that are more fuel-efficient than those currently in the market.  Airlines say small steps like single-engine taxiing and the use of lighter materials are cutting around 1-2% of emissions each year, but more needs to be done.  In the absence of more impactful short-term options, the industry has committed to a carbon-offset program that allows airlines to invest in verified environmental projects to offset their emissions.  Delta, for example, previously pledged to cap its greenhouse gas emissions at 2012 levels even with 20% growth by purchasing carbon offsets.  But that is not the target of the new $1 billion investment, which will begin in March.  \u201cWe are on a journey, and though we don\u2019t have all the answers today, we know that our scale, along with investments of time, talent and resources will bring meaningful impact to the planet and ensure the sustainability of our business for decades to come,\u201d Bastian said.","158":"WASHINGTON\/MONTREAL (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Friday it had tentatively approved a proposed alliance agreement between Delta Air Lines DAL.N and Canada's WestJet that is expected to expand travel options between the United States and Canada.

As part of the order, Delta also confirmed it was deferring delivery of 10 pricier A350 jets to 2025-26. The agreement contains the right to convert the A350 orders to A330-900s.  Delta previously had 25 of each type of plane on order but said last year it was reviewing its wide-body requirements.  \u201cExpanding our A330 order book not only ensures that Delta\u2019s near-to-medium-term widebody needs are taken care of, but also drives our strategic, measured international growth,\u201d Delta Chief Operating Officer Gil West said.  The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce's RR.L new Trent 7000 engine, which offers fuel savings.

With the new deal, Atlanta-based Delta\u2019s A330neo order will grow to 35 from 25 jets. The airline also operates around 40 earlier A330 models that use a previous generation of engine.  For Airbus, it is the second order for the A330neo in as many weeks after Kuwait Airways ordered eight of the long-haul planes in mid-October.  Airbus is aggressively seeking more orders for the latest version of its profitable A330 franchise. Sales of the engine-upgraded A330neo model fell short of expectations in the face of heavy competition from Boeing Co's BA.N newer 787.  Industry sources say Airbus is prepared to use the power of its successful A350-900 order book to boost the A330neo by selectively allowing airlines to adjust existing orders for the newer and costlier A350 in favor of the A330neo.  Kuwait Airways has also struck a deal with Airbus allowing it to defer some A350 planes as it orders the A330neo, a person familiar with the matter said.  Delta currently operates 11 A350-900 aircraft and expects to take delivery of two planes in both 2019 and 2020.

Following the results on Sunday of a so-called \u201csurplus\u201d bid in which employees were asked to petition available positions at one of Delta\u2019s seven U.S. pilot bases, the airline will be shifting around 7,000 pilots to different locations or aircraft types, while 2,327 have not been assigned to any category, Delta\u2019s Master Executive Council (MEC) of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) said in a statement.  Delta confirmed the release of the results of the bid \u201cto better align our staffing with our future flying demand\u201d and said it is \u201clooking at all options to mitigate or minimize furloughs and will continue working with ALPA in the coming weeks to explore those options.\u201d  Atlanta-based Delta, with around 91,000 employees, announced on Thursday details of early out options for non-union employees that include cash severance, full healthcare coverage and travel benefits.  Major U.S. airlines, which have received billions of dollars in taxpayer aid for payroll, have all warned that they will need to reduce their workforce once a government-imposed ban on job cuts expires on Sept. 30.  After air travel demand virtually disappeared in April, U.S. airline executives have pointed to some green shoots, but the industry is not expected to return to pre-pandemic passenger traffic for at least three years.  ALPA said it was continuing to meet with Delta on potential early-out or voluntary leave programs, saying it is \u201coptimistic that management will continue to engage with ALPA to protect pilot jobs.\u201d","184":"FILE PHOTO: A Delta plane passes a Delta bus on the tarmac at LAX airport in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 10, 2018.

REUTERS\/Rodrigo Garrido\/File Photo  CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DAL.N on Thursday announced a deal to buy a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group LTM.SN for $1.9 billion, creating a major new airline partnership and shaking up the Chilean carrier's longtime ties with American Airlines.  The surprise deal, which Delta will fund with newly issued debt and available cash in its largest investment since its merger with Northwest Airlines a decade ago, could upend American's AAL.O stronghold on the Latin American region.  LATAM has been a member of the Oneworld alliance since 2000 alongside longtime partners American, British Airways and Iberia, with which it had been pursuing a deeper route alliance that was rejected by the Chilean Supreme Court last May.  Delta does not expect regulatory obstacles for its tie-up with LATAM, where it will gain representation on the board of directors. The plan envisions growth for both carriers, which currently overlap on only one route, Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a great fit,\u201d he said.  Atlanta-based Delta, which is part of the SkyTeam alliance, expects the LATAM deal to be accretive to earnings per share over the next two years and add $1 billion in revenue growth over five years, Bastian said.  Delta will also provide LATAM an additional $350 million to help it transition out of Oneworld and plug into Delta\u2019s network.  The two can start code-sharing before they receive government, regulatory and anti-trust approval for the larger tie-up, a process Bastian said he expects to take between 12 and 24 months.  As part of the deal, Delta will also acquire four A350 aircraft from LATAM and assume LATAM\u2019s commitment to purchase another 10 A350s to be delivered between 2020 and 2025 for an undisclosed sum.  Delta also owns stakes in Grupo Aeromexico AEROMEX.MX, Air France KLM AIRF.PA, China Eastern 600115.SS, Brazil's Gol GOLL4.SA, Virgin Atlantic and Korean Air Lines Co's 003490.KS parent company.

FILE PHOTO - A Delta Air Lines flight is pushed put of its gate at the airport in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., January 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The Atlanta-based airline hired investment banks last year to organize the sale of a stake in its Monroe Energy refining subsidiary, signaling it wanted to share the risk of running an energy business.  The offer failed to attract sufficient interest because a refinery on the East Coast is viewed as an undesirable asset given the rising costs of acquiring crude oil.  The airline, the largest in the United States by market capitalization, now wants to sell the entire plant with an eye toward finding a buyer that would agree to a long-term contract with Delta to buy the plant\u2019s jet fuel, the sources said.  Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant declined to comment on the potential sale and shift in strategy, but pointed to comments made by chief financial officer Paul Jacobson last month when asked for an update on the search for a partner in Monroe Energy.  \u201cWe have continued with that process and have received some interest in having discussions with parties. There\u2019s no update on the strategy broadly as we articulated,\u201d Jacobson said in a January 15 earnings call.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking for ways to enhance the value and the strategic value to Delta of the refinery through a partnership and those discussions can be complicated,\u201d he said.  The airline acquired the 185,000-barrel-per-day refinery in 2012 for $150 million in a bet that it could lower its cost of jet fuel, among the highest expenses for any airline. The refinery also makes gasoline and diesel for profit.  The U.S refining industry has been consolidating into larger players that can use scale to lower their cost of buying raw materials and paying for regular overhauls. This week, oil giant Chevron announced plans to buy a small Gulf Coast refinery to increase its crude processing capabilities.  Four refineries on the U.S. East Coast have closed in the past decade. East Coast refiners got a lifeline for a few years from the Bakken shale boom in North Dakota earlier this decade when high production forced producers to offer them steep discounts.  The discounts have vanished in recent years as more pipeline capacity came online, however, reverting to the poor economics that hurt East Coast refiners a few years earlier.  Delta has argued that keeping the refinery open by buying it was crucial. It said jet fuel prices would have risen across the Northeast if the facility had closed, hurting the airline\u2019s results.  More recently Delta has run the plant like a traditional refinery, choosing to make more of whatever refined product offered the highest margin.","197":"PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM AIRF.PA and its U.S. partner Delta Air Lines DAL.N are studying ways of keeping Alitalia inside the Skyteam alliance - but without Air France-KLM being a buyer, Chief Executive Jean-Marc Janaillac said on Friday.  \u201cWe are not a potential buyer so we did not participate in the process,\u201d Janaillac told a news conference, adding the Franco-Dutch airline group has not had access to Alitalia data.  Lufthansa LHAG.DE, which leads the rival Star Alliance and has its own North Atlantic joint venture, has said it would be interested in a bid but only if Alitalia could be restructured.  Janaillac said that given the publicly-known offers so far, there was a risk that Alitalia could leave Skyteam and the North Atlantic joint venture, which would have a negative impact for Air France-KLM.

Colonial connects Gulf Coast refineries with markets across the southern and eastern United States through more than 5,500 miles of its pipeline system, delivering gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products.  In the new filing, the companies request that FERC set a hearing for the complaints against Colonial, saying that the delay by FERC is \u201cabnormal,\u201d while \u201cprejudicing\u201d the companies.

Colonial has previously said the complaint filed in November has no merit and that the shippers manipulated data \u201cand made improper and highly unrealistic assumptions in an effort to strengthen their arguments.\u201d  The U.S. Congress set Colonial\u2019s rates in 1990s-era legislation. In 2001, FERC allowed Colonial to charge market-based rates from the Gulf Coast to the Philadelphia and New York areas, on the understanding that Colonial lacked monopoly power over those markets.

Safety concerns are an issue at the FAA, which is grappling with a review of Boeing Co\u2019s grounded 737 MAX in the wake of two crashes that killed 346 in October and March and broader questions about how it certifies aircraft and whether it delegates too much authority to manufacturers.  The Senate will vote on former Delta Air Lines executive Stephen Dickson\u2019s nomination. The FAA has been without a Senate-confirmed chief for more than 18 months.  The Senate must first vote to end debate on the nomination before it can proceed to a final vote, expected later this week.  This month, the Senate Commerce Committee voted 14 to 12 along party lines to approve the nomination.  Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the panel, raised concerns about Delta\u2019s treatment during Dickson\u2019s tenure of a whistleblower pilot who raised concerns about pilot training on the A-330 when it came to automation and ensuring that pilots were getting enough rest time.  \u201cHe is not the right person for the safety culture that we need at the FAA,\u201d Cantwell said Tuesday on the Senate floor.  Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, said the panel spent two months \u201creviewing any and all information\u201d about the issue. Dickson was never accused of retaliating against any whistleblower, Wicker added.  U.S. President Donald Trump in March said he would nominate Dickson to run the 45,000-employee agency, which oversees U.S. airspace. Dickson left Delta in October after 27 years.  The FAA, which has been run by an acting chief Dan Elwell since January 2018, is facing mounting questions over its certification of the 737 MAX from federal prosecutors, lawmakers and the Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general.  Elwell needs a waiver from Congress to remain in his job because both he and Dickson are former U.S. military officers.  Dickson\u2019s nomination had been in the works for months before the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash.  Last year, Reuters and other outlets reported that Trump was considering his longtime personal pilot, John Dunkin, to lead the FAA, an idea that came under criticism from some lawmakers.  The FAA is also dealing with such issues as how to integrate drones into the nation\u2019s airspace, modernizing air traffic control and addressing other regulatory issues including setting minimum rest periods for airline flight attendants.

REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo  ATLANTA (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said on Tuesday he was confident U.S. planemaker Boeing Co would resolve issues relating to its 737 MAX jet following two deadly crashes involving that type of aircraft.  Delta does not own the MAX, which was flown in the United States by its rivals Southwest Airlines Co, American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines until a global grounding last month following an Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10. That came five months after a similar crash involving Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air. All on board both were killed.  The global 737 MAX suspension came as Boeing was moving toward the decision of a decade: whether to launch an all-new jet program with a niche midsized airplane, known so far as the NMA.  Boeing\u2019s proposal was aimed at addressing the so-called middle of the jet market, between traditional narrowbody jets with one aisle like the 737 and long-distance widebody planes like the 787.  Speaking at an aviation conference in Atlanta, Bastian said Delta was \u201cvery interested\u201d in Boeing\u2019s proposed new midsized airplane, though he said the world\u2019s largest planemaker was focusing first on dealing with the crisis surrounding the MAX.  Bastian has said that Delta was looking to replace some 200 Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft over the next decade as it seeks to grow internationally.  He declined to comment on Tuesday on whether Delta would invest in Italy\u2019s flag carrier Alitalia. The Italian government has been seeking a buyer to save the airline, which was put under special administration in 2017 after a series of failed rescue plans.  Atlanta-based Delta is due to publish first-quarter results on Wednesday.  Its shares have surged about 10 percent since the No. 2 U.S. airline raised its first-quarter profit estimate earlier this month on the back of strong business travel demand.","210":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DAL.N is set to furlough 1,941 pilots in October, the carrier said in a memo to employees on Monday that noted the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and plunging air travel demand.

The aid, which covered employees\u2019 pay, was meant to help them weather the pandemic and preserve jobs until a recovery, but travel remains depressed.  \u201cWe are six months into this pandemic and only 25% of our revenues have been recovered. Unfortunately, we see few catalysts over the next six months to meaningful change this trajectory,\u201d Delta\u2019s head of flight operations John Laughter said in the memo.  He said the airline is \u201csimply overstaffed.\u201d  Atlanta-based Delta had originally estimated a surplus of 2,558 pilots but reduced the number of involuntary furloughs following early retirement and voluntary departure programs, a spokeswoman said.  But there were still roughly 11,200 active pilots on Delta\u2019s roster, Laughter said, with only about 9,450 needed for the summer 2021 schedule, which the carrier expects will be the peak flying period for the next 12-18 months.  The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Delta\u2019s pilots, said it was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d in the decision.  Pilots are the only unionized work group at Delta, which last month said furloughs could be avoided if pilots agreed to a 15% cut to minimum pay.  U.S. airline unions, however, have been reluctant to negotiate pay cuts, having only recently recouped wages lost after the 2001 Sept. 11 attacks and a string of bankruptcies and mergers that followed.  Peers such as American Airlines AAL.O have said they are trying to keep as many pilots as possible on board due to the costly and timely training required to bring them back in a recovery.  Airlines and unions have been lobbying Washington to extend another $25 billion in aid to protect jobs through March, but talks are at a standstill.  Delta also announced on Monday the retirement of Chief Operating Officer Gil West, who helped lead the integration of Delta and Northwest after joining the company in 2008.","211":"MILAN (Reuters) - An Alitalia rescue plan ran into trouble on Wednesday when its main sponsor, railway group Ferrovie dello Stato, said conditions were not in place to set up an investor consortium to save the struggling Italian carrier.  Alitalia, which has been run by administrators since May 2017, is burning through cash reserves and is expected to run out of money at the end of this year.  The company risks liquidation if no credible investor makes an offer and injects fresh funds.  Ferrovie\u2019s comments came a day after infrastructure group Atlantia, touted to be one of the key potential investors in Alitalia together with a foreign airline, said it was not ready to join a consortium.  Ferrovie and Atlantia have been discussing a joint investment in Alitalia for months with U.S. carrier Delta and, more recently, Germany\u2019s Lufthansa.  Delta Air Lines Inc has stuck to a pledge to invest up to 100 million euros ($110.70 million) for 10% of Alitalia, but sources say it has not reached any agreement with Ferrovie and Atlantia over the Italian carrier\u2019s long-haul business.  \u201cOur interest and vision have been well expressed to Ferrovie dello Stato and Italy\u2019s Ministry of Economic Development,\u201d Delta said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.  \u201cWe are open to working with other parties to develop a coherent, like-minded consortium of investors,\u201d it said.  Ferrovie also said it was still committed to talks to save the Italian carrier, adding it was awaiting indications from administrators over what measures to take.  A deadline for binding bids for Alitalia expires on Thursday at midnight after several postponements.  One source close to the matter said Alitalia administrators would meet Italy\u2019s industry minister Stefano Patuanelli on Thursday to discuss the situation.  \u201cI believe there is still room ... with Delta, Lufthansa... to reach a conclusion,\u201d Patuanelli said on CNBC TV on Wednesday evening.  But he added he did not want to postpone the expected closing date of end-March for any rescue package, by which time any deal should have secured all necessary approvals.  Patuanelli said Lufthansa should \u201cmake a small effort\u201d to take a stake in the Italian carrier from the off. On Tuesday the German carrier sent a letter to Ferrovie offering merely a commercial partnership for Alitalia.  The minister also asked Delta to make an additional effort to improve its offer.","212":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will nominate former Delta Air Lines executive Steve Dickson to head the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the White House said on Tuesday, as the aviation agency grapples with fallout from two fatal crashes in Boeing airplanes.  Reuters reported on March 8 that Trump was expected to soon nominate Dickson to run the 45,000-employee agency that oversees U.S. airspace. Dickson left Delta in October after 27 years.  The FAA, which has been run by an acting chief for 14 months, is facing mounting questions over its certification of the Boeing 737 MAX from federal prosecutors and lawmakers. Dickson\u2019s nomination had been in the works for months before the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general office said it planned to audit the FAA certification of the Boeing 737 MAX.  The office is developing the scope and objectives of the review and is expected to formally announce and begin audit work as soon as possible, an official told Reuters.  The FAA declined to comment, while Boeing said it would cooperate in the audit.  Last year, Reuters and other outlets reported that Trump was considering his longtime personal pilot, John Dunkin, to lead the FAA, an idea that came under criticism from some lawmakers.  At Delta, Dickson oversaw more than 13,000 pilots and an internal support team of 400 employees.

U.S. airline shares .DJUSAR.lost 5% in morning trade, with Delta down 5.8%.  \u201cThe continued growth of the virus through the Sun Belt, coupled with quarantine restrictions being implemented in large markets in the northern part of the country, give us renewed caution about further schedule additions at this time,\u201d Bastian said.

It has added 1,000 flights in July and another 1,000 this August, but had already said it was unlikely to add many more for the rest of the year.  Its July schedule is still only about 30% of what it would normally fly.  Atlanta-based Delta is among U.S. carriers that have boosted liquidity and cut costs to stem a daily cash burn, but they need revenue to recover and will need to shrink in size as they wait for demand to return.  Bastian again warned the recovery \u201cis likely to be lengthy and slow\u201d and encouraged employees to sign up for early exit packages by a July 13 deadline to minimize involuntary furloughs in the fall.

FILE PHOTO: Captain Natalia Weiss and co-pilot Thays Goncalves of Brazilian Airline GOL prepare before taking off with a full female crew in the mark of International Women's Day, in Sao Paulo, Brazil, March 8 2020. REUTERS\/Rahel Patrasso\/File Photo  If Gol fails to repay - which ratings agencies say is looking more likely - Delta would have to honor the debt on Gol's behalf, honoring the five-year-old agreement. But just like Gol, the Atlanta-based carrier, which said in July it was burning $27 million a day here, has little cash to spare due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Gol\u2019s struggles are just the latest challenge for Delta, whose investments in Latin America, once seen as a growth area, have faltered due to COVID-19.  Delta's 49% stake in Aeromexico and 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group are at risk of dilution or being wiped here out as both airlines undergo bankruptcy restructurings.  For Gol, Brazil\u2019s largest carrier, the due date of the Delta-backed private loan comes amid a severe cash crunch. The loan was extended by unidentified private investors.  \u201cGol is facing constant cash burn without refinancing possibilities,\u201d said Amalia Bulacios, who covers Gol for S&P Global Ratings, which rates its debt as CCC-, at risk of default.  By Monday, before repaying the loan, Gol could have just 1.6 billion reais ($285.19 million) left in cash, Reuters calculated. The calculation is based on Gol\u2019s cash and cash equivalents, as well as its liquid investments, as of June 30, minus its expected cash burn of 3 million reais a day.  \u201cWe are three business days away from the deadline and the company has been very silent; it\u2019s not even clear if there is a negotiation under way,\u201d she added.  Gol and Delta declined to confirm if any negotiations were occurring. A source familiar with the matter said negotiations were indeed taking place.  The situation echoes that of Colombia's Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN in May, when it filed for bankruptcy because of a debt repayment deadline the next day. Analysts, however, said Gol's restructuring needs are much simpler than Avianca's and could potentially happen out of court.  Raising cash at the 11th hour, however, appears unlikely.  While Brazil\u2019s government has offered Gol 2 billion reais ($356.49 million) in loans, two sources said it would not release the money unless Gol manages to postpone its debt deadline. Brazil wants the funds to be used on the airline\u2019s operations, not to repay creditors.  Meanwhile, Gol executives acknowledged last month that the airline has little prospect of raising fresh capital.  \u201cThere\u2019s a certain aversion to Brazil, a certain aversion to airlines, and then we\u2019re kind of in the cross-set of that bucket,\u201d Gol\u2019s CFO Richard Lark said during the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIt\u2019s not really there, the private market.\u201d  DEBT UNDERPLAYED  Gol\u2019s debt troubles show how quickly the coronavirus upended the balance sheets of airlines around the world.  For years, Gol underplayed the significance of the $300 million loan. Executives said not only that they would repay it in full but that they would do so ahead of schedule.  As late as Feb. 25, even as the pandemic raged in Asia and Europe, a Gol presentation said the airline had \u201cno relevant maturities in next five years.\u201d  Now, Gol\u2019s future hangs in the balance because of the once apparently insignificant loan coming due.  Delta, which has long expanded worldwide by buying into other carriers, in 2015 injected $56 million of equity into Gol and guaranteed the $300 million loan. At the time, Gol executives said they could not have raised the debt without Delta\u2019s backing.  Delta sold its stake in Gol in 2019 to buy its stake in Gol rival LATAM Airlines but maintained the loan guarantee.  If Gol fails to make the payment and Delta is forced to step in, Delta will have the option of seizing the Brazilian airline's stake in its publicly traded loyalty program, Smiles Fidelidade SMLS3.SA, which secured the loan.  But Gol\u2019s stake in Smiles is only worth 954 million reais ($170.04 million). And the loyalty program has little strategic value given that Delta ditched Gol for LATAM Airlines.  \u201cIf Delta does that, it will strangle Gol\u2019s cash position, put Gol\u2019s survival at risk and become a shareholder of Smiles, a company that itself needs Gol to be successful,\u201d said Ricardo Fenelon, a former head of Brazil\u2019s aviation regulator ANAC.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d  ($1 = 5.6103 reais)","218":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N said on Friday it will suspend service to 10 U.S. airports where it services a nearby airport until at least September amid the massive travel falloff due to the coronavirus outbreak.

REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  With the timing and shape of a recovery still uncertain, Delta and other airlines have focused on cutting costs, boosting liquidity and restoring customer confidence.  But quarantines, fresh COVID-19 outbreaks in Europe and the United States, and uneven public health measures remain a deterrent, Bastian said.  Shares were down 3.2% in midday trading.  To boost demand and ease travel restrictions, Delta is betting on increased COVID-19 testing and contact tracing and increasing data showing the risk of COVID-19 transmission on airplanes is \u201cremarkably low,\u201d Bastian said.  Revenues at Delta, which is blocking middle seats into early January, fell 76% to $3.1 billion in the third quarter from a year earlier, with little improvement seen this year.  Business travel will recover in 12 to 24 months, though not to 100%.  Costs, however, will trend lower, helping drive an improvement in daily cash burn to around $10 million in December from $18 million in September and $27 million in June.  Delta had previously said its cash bleed would stop before the end of the year.  \u201cDelta achieved much of their cost objectives; now it is about recovery in demand and revenue,\u201d Cowen analyst Helane Becker said.  With no immediate need for new jets, the company has delayed the delivery of Airbus and Bombardier aircraft and postponed more than $2 billion of payments originally due this year and $5 billion due through 2022.  It also accelerated the retirement of nearly 30% of its fleet, or 400 aircraft, by 2025, causing a $2.2 billion restructuring charge.  Overall flight capacity will be down 40% this year.  It took a $3.1 billion charge after some 18,000 employees took voluntary separation and early retirement programs aimed at slimming its workforce.  With fewer employees, Delta still has $1.3 billion in grants left from some $5.5 billion it received in aid from Congress in March to cover airlines\u2019 payroll costs for six months and protect jobs.  \u201cWe\u2019ve stretched those dollars out,\u201d Bastian said. The money can be used in the fourth quarter, on top of any additional aid if lawmakers finally approve another $25 billion payroll support program for U.S. airlines.  An industry push for more aid has broad bipartisan backing but is stalled amid a Washington deadlock over wider COVID-19 economic relief.  Unlike its two major rivals, Delta has avoided the furlough of flight attendants and other frontline employees after reducing work hours, but it could still furlough some 1,700 pilots on Nov. 1 without a union agreement or more federal aid, Bastian said.  Atlanta-based Delta ended the quarter with $21.6 billion in liquidity, after a $9 billion capital raising in September secured by its loyalty program. Adjusted net debt totaled $17 billion.  Delta, the first U.S. airline to report third-quarter results, plans to start paying down its debt next year once it has positive cash flow, Bastian told investors.  The company swung to a $5.4 billion net loss, or $8.47 per share, in the quarter from a $1.5 billion profit a year ago. On an adjusted basis the loss was $3.30 per share.","224":"FILE PHOTO: Passengers wait to check in for their flights at the departure area of Latam airlines inside of the Commodore Arturo Merino Benitez International Airport in Santiago, Chile April 25, 2019.

Two of the largest U.S. airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, said on Wednesday they have seen a slight improvement in bookings but are still burning through nearly $1 billion a month of cash.  Airlines do not expect a meaningful recovery in demand until there is a widely accepted COVID-19 treatment or vaccine, which could stimulate pent-up demand and the need for trained workers to service a recovery.  The global race for a coronavirus vaccine suffered a setback on Wednesday when AstraZeneca suspended its global trials after an unexplained illness in a participant, and Delta Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson warned that any vaccine must be followed by broad vaccinations, a process he said could take between six and 12 months.  Airlines are lobbying for a six-month extension of a $25 billion payroll support package they received in March under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

FILE PHOTO: A Delta Air Lines Boeing 737-800 plane arrives in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., January 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The airline no longer wants to be involved in marketing the motor fuels, which are a major part of the refinery\u2019s output, but does want retain Monroe\u2019s jet fuel production for its own uses, sources familiar with recent discussions between managers and employees said.  Delta said late on Wednesday it had hired investment banks Barclays and Jefferies to pursue the sale of a undisclosed stake in Monroe Energy LLC, the subsidiary that runs the 185,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Trainer, Pennsylvania.  Possible investors could include gasoline retailers that would take on the motor fuels business but are less interested in Monroe\u2019s jet fuel production, company managers told employees, according to the sources.  The sources requested anonymity because the matter has not been made public. Delta declined to comment for this story.  The company\u2019s move to unload a stake in Monroe Energy could represent the first step in unwinding a bet that owning a refinery would lower its jet fuel costs, among an airline\u2019s highest expense. The 2012 deal was criticized by some investors who saw the airline\u2019s $150 million purchase as drifting from its core business.  The East Coast plant relies largely on imported crude, lacking access to less expensive shale and Canadian crude that benefits U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast refineries. That means any Monroe sale would need to be at a deep discount to other recent refinery-related transactions, analysts said.  One possible scenario would be to allow a buyer to finance any purchase using the plant as collateral, reducing the initial capital required, analysts say.  \u201cI think a trading company or private equity firm are the two ... most likely (bidders),\u201d said Neil Earnest, president of energy consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co. \u201cI don\u2019t see an existing refiner or producer or retail guy that stands out as wanting that asset or needing that asset.\u201d  Delta\u2019s desire to retain a stake in the plant also means energy traders may be reluctant to bid on a plant they cannot fully control, he added.  While some gasoline retailers have bought refineries, the Trainer plant's lack of an existing distribution network reduces the number of potential buyers, Earnest said. When Canadian retailer Parkland Fuel Corp PKI.TO acquired Chevron Corp's CVX.N refinery in Burnaby, British Columbia, last year, the main draw was the affiliated retail assets, and not the plant itself, he said.","228":"BRUSSELS\/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The European Commission will next month present a set of rules for the safe reopening of air travel when coronavirus lockdowns end, including social distancing in airports and planes, while some U.S. airlines are taking their own protective measures.  FILE PHOTO: A woman passes a departure board at Dulles International Airport a day after U.S. President Donald Trump announced travel restrictions on flights from Europe to the United States to contain the spread of the coronavirus, in Dulles, Virginia, U.S., March 12, 2020. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque  EU Transport Commissioner Adina Valean said on Wednesday that measures under consideration would include the wearing of masks and disinfection of planes and airports.  \u201cAll this should be part of those guidelines and probably by mid-May we can put forward this strategy we are working on,\u201d Valean said on Twitter.  The move came as debate heats up in the United States, the world\u2019s busiest domestic market, on how to apply rules on social distancing or protective gear to air travel.  It is unclear if the Federal Aviation Administration has the authority to compel passengers or flight crews to wear face coverings on airplanes.  Last week, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson told a pilots\u2019 union that the agency and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention planned to update guidance for airline flight crews amid concerns from pilots, but regulators are not mandating new safety requirements.  Some U.S. airlines have implemented their own measures including blocking middle seats, pausing automatic upgrades and changing the boarding process.  Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N would like to see consistency among government requirements to help streamline processes for passengers and employees, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  Earlier, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian warned of a choppy recovery in air travel that would ultimately depend on people feeling safe.  \u201cWhen you ask people, what\u2019s the most important thing to get them to start traveling again, it\u2019s going to be confidence in their safety,\u201d Bastian said on a conference call after the carrier posted its first quarterly loss in eight years.  Delta is encouraging passengers and employees to wear protective gear, Bastian said, noting that at least 80% of its customers now wear face masks when they travel.  In Canada, regulators started requiring passengers on Monday to wear a non-medical mask or face covering during the boarding process and flights.  BLOCKING MIDDLE SEATS  In Europe, Ryanair RYA.I Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has described proposals for planes to fly with empty middle seats when the coronavirus travel restrictions end as \"mad,\" saying they would be \"hopelessly ineffective\" as well as unaffordable.  Instead, the company backs the introduction of mandatory temperature checks and masks for passengers and crew when flights resume.  Airlines have raised concerns that measures to slow the spread of the pandemic could blight profitability long after the travel restrictions end. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated that the crisis could cost airlines a total of $314 billion.  The EU\u2019s Valean said it was impossible to say when the industry could resume operations, but noted that she expected social-distancing requirements to remain in place for as long as there is no COVID-19 treatment or vaccine.  \u201cWe expect the crisis to stay with us and the virus to stay with us,\u201d she said.","229":"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is in talks to buy a 49% stake in Africa's RwandAir and is interested in doubling its holding in LATAM Airlines Group LTM.SN to 20%, its chief executive said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Abbas Al Baker attends an interview with Reuters at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russia June 6, 2019. REUTERS\/Maxim Shemetov\/File Photo  A stake in an African airline would widen its reach in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing aviation regions and potentially help it to bypass restrictions imposed on it by some Arab states.  \u201cWe are very tough negotiators ... we will take our time to negotiate,\u201d CEO Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Doha.  State-owned Qatar Airways already owns stakes in British Airways parent International Airlines Group ICAG.L, China Southern 600029.SS, Cathay Pacific 0293.HK and LATAM.  It bought some of its holdings in other airlines after the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia banned it from their airspace after a regional political dispute.  Qatar Airways, which flies to more than 160 destinations, has been forced to fly longer routes to avoid the blocked airspace of some of its neighbors.  The ban does not apply to non-Qatari airlines flying to Qatar, meaning that RwandAir could potentially carry passengers from Africa over the blocked airspace to the state-owned airline\u2019s Doha hub without restrictions.  RwandAir flies to 29 destinations, mostly in Africa, but also to Dubai, Mumbai and Brussels.  Its CEO, Yvonne Manzi Makolo, confirmed to Reuters that talks to sell a stake were under way but declined to comment further.  Qatar Airways agreed in December to take a 60% stake in a new airport in Rwanda.  Baker, one of aviation's most well-known executives, also said the airline could be interested in increasing its holding in LATAM and working with fellow shareholder Delta Air Lines DAL.N.  \u201cWhen the right opportunity comes, and at the right price, we will look at increasing our investment in LATAM,\u201d he told Reuters, adding that it would be interested in having the same size stake as Delta. Delta has a 20% holding, double the 10% owned by Qatar Airways.  Delta surprised the industry when it announced in September that it was taking a $1.9 billion 20% stake in the South American airline group.  Qatar Airways has had a contentious relationship with Delta and other major U.S. carriers, which have accused Gulf airlines of receiving unfair government subsidies, distorting competition and costing Americans jobs. The Gulf carriers have rejected such accusations.  However, Baker said there is no ill-feeling towards Delta and Qatar Airways is willing to work with the U.S. airline at its hub in Atlanta.  \u201cWe can transfer passengers on each other. We are the only Middle Eastern carrier going into their hub, so there is huge opportunity,\u201d he said.  Qatar Airways has also expressed interest in taking a stake in India\u2019s IndiGo and Morocco\u2019s Royal Air Maroc.","230":"MILAN (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines should consider increasing its planned investment in the rescue of Alitalia, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Saturday as talks over the relaunch of the Italian flagship carrier drag on.

REUTERS\/Stefano Rellandini\/File Photo  The U.S. airline is part of a group of investors led by Italian railway group Ferrovie dello Stato behind a possible rescue of the loss-making airline.  The potential investors, which also include infrastructure group Atlantia and Italy\u2019s treasury, plan to create a new company that will take the control of the struggling carrier and inject around 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).  Delta has so far pledged to take a stake of 10%, with Ferrovie and Atlantia poised to become key investors.  Speaking at an event in Rome, Conte called on Delta to play a bigger role in the project.  \u201cA 10% stake seems to me a bit low to have a strong business involvement,\u201d Conte said.  The group of potential rescuers has been given more time to submit a rescue plan amid claims by some sources that there is a lack of agreement on key aspects of the project.  A management reshuffle at Atlantia, following the resignation of long-serving Chief Executive Giovanni Castellucci, could also impact the rescue talks.  Atlantia, which is expected to take around 30% in the new airline, is struggling to deal with the fallout of the collapse last year of a road bridge in Genoa operated by its motorway unit.  Since the disaster in which 43 people died, the group controlled by the Benetton family has been under fire from ruling coalition party 5-Star Movement, which has called for Atlantia\u2019s lucrative motorway concession to be scrapped.  Analysts, however, said the group\u2019s involvement in the Alitalia rescue could soften the government stance on the concession.  Conte said the government considers the rescue of Alitalia and the motorway concession \u201cas two completely different issues\u201d. He declined to say whether the resignation of Castellucci could pave the way for a more constructive dialogue between Atlantia and the government.","231":"WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday it had fined American Airlines $1 million and Delta Air Lines Inc $750,000 for violating federal rules prohibiting lengthy tarmac delays at U.S. airports.

The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, began after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun laws.  In tweets on Saturday, Delta and United said they were no longer offering NRA members discounted rates and that they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website.  NRA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In recent days, NRA spokespeople have lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites are politicizing the deadly rampage in Florida to erode gun owners\u2019 rights.  The issue of gun control, and the NRA\u2019s role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate after a former student killed 17 people on Feb. 14 at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.  The attrition of NRA corporate partners began on Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA\u2019s contract to issue a co-branded Visa card.  By Friday, the list of defectors grew to include Symantec Corp, which ended a discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs.  Chubb Ltd said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc , also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA.  The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms.

Given the additional fuel costs, however, the airline also said that it planned to cut less profitable flights in its new schedule for the second half of this year.  \u201cWith strong revenue momentum, an improving cost trajectory, and a reduction of 50-100 bps (basis points) of underperforming capacity from our fall schedule, we have positioned Delta to return to margin expansion by year end,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said.  As developing middle classes in the world\u2019s big emerging economies including China and India fly more, global air passenger traffic has risen every month this year.  While that has bolstered airlines across the board, they are also facing the fallout of a more than doubling of crude oil prices since early 2016.  The Atlanta-based airline reiterated it expected its fuel bill for the year to rise by $2 billion after a 38.8 percent jump in fuel costs in the second quarter.  Those costs prompted Delta to cut its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $5.35 to $5.70 per share from $6.35 to $6.70 per share, months after bigger rival American Airlines Group Inc AAL.O also cut its full-year outlook.  Delta expects unit revenue to grow 3.5-5.5 percent in the third quarter. The company\u2019s board approved a 15 percent hike in dividend for the third quarter to 35 cents.  On an adjusted basis, Delta earned $1.77 per share in the second quarter, beating an estimate of $1.72, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Delta\u2019s total operating revenue rose 9.6 percent to $11.78 billion in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $11.72 billion.

Of 12 new slots agreed with Japan, the DOT has tentatively allocated five for Delta, four for United, two for American Airlines Group Inc and one for Hawaiian Airlines.  The extra slots for U.S. airlines, which are still pending final government approvals, were unlocked after Japan reached an agreement with the U.S. Air Force to open up new flight paths around a nearby U.S. air base, a move needed to boost Haneda movements in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

Union leaders met with senior congressional Democrats to discuss aid after a proposal from the Republican-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday for additional coronavirus relief did not include new government assistance for U.S. airlines or airports.  Republicans and Democrats have been jockeying for months over the next phase of coronavirus aid. Officials expect discussions to accelerate in the coming weeks, though it was not clear whether an agreement would be reached before the first $25 billion runs out this month.  Airlines continue to suffer a drastic downturn in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the largest carriers each burning through around $1 billion of cash monthly.  The sector does not expect a meaningful recovery until there is a widely accepted COVID-19 treatment or vaccine, which could stimulate pent-up demand and the need for trained workers.

United also said it had reached an agreement in principle with its pilots union that could avert job losses for up to 2,850 pilots.

Shares of the parent, Hanjin Kal Corp, tumbled 15 percent on Friday, as Delta\u2019s move dashed investor hopes of a battle to control the family-run group that had driven up shares since the death of patriarch Cho Yang-ho in April.  Korean Air, which has a joint venture with Delta since last year, said on Friday it believes Delta\u2019s 4.3 percent stake buy intends to ensure the \u2018stable management\u201d of the company and support for its leadership.  Should the No. 2 U.S. carrier raise its stake to 10% in Hanjin Kal, the airline\u2019s founding family and its allies will have a total stake of 39%, versus the 16% stake held by the activist fund, Korea Corporate Governance Improvement (KCGI).  \u201cDelta played a role as a white knight for Hanjin,\u201d said Choi Nam-gon, an analyst at Yuanta Securities.  \u201cNow it would be impossible for KCGI to take control of the group.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The No. 2 U.S. carrier said it is targeting full-year revenue growth of 5 to 7 percent, an increase from 4 to 6 percent previously, with the American Express deal expected to add about $500 million to 2019 revenue.  Total operating revenues grew 5.1 percent to $10.47 billion in the first quarter to March 31, as growth in premium ticket sales and the airline\u2019s maintenance business helped offset lower cargo volumes.  \u201cDemand for Delta\u2019s product has never been stronger,\u201d President Glen Hauenstein in a statement.  Shares rose 1.6 percent to close at $57.86 midday, off a session high of $58.95.  So far this year, Atlanta-based Delta\u2019s stock has outperformed U.S. rivals that own the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded worldwide in March following two fatal crashes.  Southwest Airlines Co, which has the world\u2019s largest MAX fleet with 34 jets, has cut its 2019 financial outlook, while American Airlines Group Inc trimmed its first-quarter revenue forecast on Tuesday after cancelling 1,200 flights due to the MAX grounding in the United States.  Delta did not update its own 2019 profit target but executives said on a conference call they were \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that earnings would come in toward the top-end of guidance.  Chief Executive Ed Bastian declined to comment on whether the carrier was picking up customers from competitors that are cancelling flights due to the MAX suspension.  Delta expects second-quarter profit in the range of $2.05 per share to $2.35 per share, above the average $2.13 per share analysts had estimated, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The carrier forecast total unit revenue, a closely-watched measurement of revenues per available seat mile, to increase 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the second quarter.  \u201cWe think Delta\u2019s relatively higher share of business travelers, unit revenue premium to peers and stronger-than-peer cash generation argue for a premium valuation,\u201d said CFRA analyst Jim Corridore.  Net income rose to $730 million in the first quarter ended March 31 from $557 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Delta earned 96 cents per share, beating expectations of 90 cents per share.  The results relieved investor concerns about the impact of a U.S. government shutdown in January and severe weather during the period.","267":"Jan 3 (Reuters) - Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc dropped 10 percent on Thursday, after the U.S. carrier warned fourth-quarter unit revenue would be slightly below its prior forecast due to the lower-than-expected improvement in last-minute fares booked by travelers.  The No.2 U.S. airline said it now expects total revenue per available seat mile - a closely followed measure of airline performance - to rise about 3 percent, compared with the 3.5 percent growth it forecast earlier.  Shares of bigger rival American Airlines Group Inc fell 11 percent to $29.2, while smaller rivals United Continental Holdings Inc, Southwest Airlines Co, and JetBlue Airways Corp were down 5-7 percent in morning trading.  The broader U.S. markets fell sharply after Apple Inc\u2019s rare sales warning added to fears of a global slowdown.  \"While close-in yield momentum continues, the pace of improvement in late December was more modest than anticipated,\" Delta said. (bit.ly\/2Rwcp1t)  Atlanta-based Delta also said it expects fuel price per gallon to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, about 10 cents below its earlier guidance.  Airlines usually take advantage of lower fuel costs to add more flights and seat capacity, a measure that can also drive down unit revenues.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The plans come as the second largest U.S. airline seeks to grow internationally, though Bastian said at a conference that the company had not yet decided whether to invest in struggling Italian carrier Alitalia.  Atlanta-based Delta\u2019s potential fleet order, which analysts say would be worth over $10 billion, could boost proposals by Boeing Co to launch a new plane in that segment while Airbus is preparing to counter with a new version of A321 and the larger A330neo.  Delta is \u201cvery interested\u201d and in discussions with Boeing about its proposed new midsized airplane, known as the NMA, Bastian said. Boeing will decide in 2020 whether to produce the plane which industry sources say would have two aisles and seat seven across.  The plane aims to address the so-called middle of the jet market between traditional narrowbody jets with one aisle and long-distance widebody planes.  \u201cHopefully they\u2019ll decide to go,\u201d Bastian said.  Delta is already in the process of replacing one-third of its mainline fleet, one of the largest and oldest among U.S. airlines, in the next five years.  Delta shares were up 2.5 percent at $50.03 in afternoon trading after Bastian said spring and summer travel demand was solid.  ALITALIA INVESTMENT?  Bastian said it was too early to decide whether to invest in Alitalia, which was put under special administration in 2017 after workers rejected the latest in a long line of rescue plans, leaving the Italian government seeking a buyer to save the airline.  Italy\u2019s state-controlled railway Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) said last month it would start negotiations with Delta and EasyJet Plc to draft a rescue plan, the third in a decade, for the struggling airline.  Delta executives have held talks in Rome in recent weeks, according to Italian industry sources, but doubts remain whether an outside investor would be willing to take a minority stake in the strike-prone airline.  Bastian said that the numbers being thrown around for Alitalia are \u201cpretty large\u201d and \u201cnot the kind of numbers that we\u2019re considering, just to quell any concerns.\u201d  Still, he said it makes sense to consider an investment in Italy, an important market for U.S. consumers, and noted that Delta\u2019s global growth over time will skew toward international rather than congested domestic markets.  That growth could come through direct investments in overseas carriers.  \u201cYou can\u2019t actually own partner carriers so you have to find ways to influence them beyond just a commercial contract as a partner, and what we have found is that by making an investment into these businesses we can get actually inside the board room and help to start shape the strategy.\u201d","269":"Jan 1 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo on Friday that he continues to expect that the company will achieve positive cash flow by the spring.  \u201cAs difficult as 2020 was, in many ways I expect the next 12 months to be even more challenging,\u201d he added.","270":"WASHINGTON\/CHICAGO (Reuters) -U.S. airlines were awaiting progress on COVID-19 relief proposals in Washington that could include another $17 billion in payroll support for an industry bracing for a renewed slump in air travel as cases spike across the country.

An initial $25 billion in payroll support for airline employees expired in October, prompting tens of thousands of furloughs.  Airlines have lobbied for fresh relief, arguing their infrastructure is critical to quickly and widely distributing COVID-19 vaccines.  A summary of the draft legislation seen by Reuters would provide payroll aid through the end of March, protecting workers and banning share buybacks and dividends and limiting executive compensation during that period.

The jets are made at a plant in the Canadian province of Quebec. Production is set to begin for U.S. customers at an Airbus SE plant in Mobile, Alabama, after the European planemaker closes a deal this year to acquire a majority stake in the CSeries program.  \u201cDelta still intends to take as many deliveries as possible from the new Airbus\/Bombardier facility in Mobile, Alabama, as soon as that facility is up and running,\u201d the carrier said.  Delivering to Delta from Canada, as opposed to waiting for the new U.S. plant, would help Bombardier meet its target of 40 CSeries deliveries this year, up from 17 in 2017.  On Wednesday, the International Trade Commission said it rejected hefty U.S. duties on the CSeries jets partly because Boeing Co had lost no sales or revenue during the Delta deal.  Boeing is reviewing the panel\u2019s decision, a company spokesman said on Thursday. The planemaker claimed Bombardier was selling its 110- to 130-seat CSeries in the United States below their cost.  Boeing could appeal the decision, but risks straining its relationship with Canada after applying to stay in a race to supply 88 fighter planes to the country.

The airline said it would use the loyalty program as collateral to secure the new loans and issuance, as it continues to burn through about $27 million in cash each day.  U.S. airlines have cut costs and raised debt to survive what they call an unprecedented industry crisis. The situation is not expected to improve until there is a meaningful recovery in demand.  With its latest financing deal, Delta will not pursue a $4.6 billion federal loan available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, officials said, even as it continues to lobby for a second round of federal payroll grants.  Atlanta-based Delta is among U.S. airlines to have tapped funds under a $25 billion made available primarily in grants under the CARES Act to cover employees\u2019 payroll through September, but not a separate $25 billion package in secured loans.  The loan program has attractive financing terms but restricts executive compensation and share buybacks.  The airline has said it could furlough nearly 2,000 pilots in October without more federal aid, but believes it can avoid any flight attendant furloughs through the winter thanks to strong demand for voluntary departures or leaves.  Delta had $15.7 billion in liquidity at the end of June, which it said equaled about 19 months of financial runway at a daily burn rate of $27 million.  It still has unencumbered assets worth $6 billion to $7 billion, primarily in the form of spare aircraft parts and engines, if needed, officials said.  Delta did not disclose the value of the loyalty program or the terms of the new financing, which mirrors a debt deal by United Airlines in June backed by its $20 billion MileagePlus program.

Atlanta-based Delta is among large U.S. airlines that have been trying to encourage workers to leave voluntarily before a government ban on forced job cuts expires on Sept. 30, when they warn they must shrink given depressed demand in the coronavirus pandemic.  The deadline for most Delta employees to accept early departure or early retirement packages was Monday.  Delta, which is due to present second-quarter results on Tuesday, declined to comment.  Because labor contracts require airlines to furlough in reverse order of seniority, those that can encourage more senior people to leave could have generally lower labor costs as they brace for a slow rebound.

Delta, the first U.S. airline to report quarterly results, posted a $2.8 billion adjusted net loss, or $4.43 per share, for the second quarter as passenger revenue plummeted 94% during a season that some analysts call the worst in aviation history.  It had $15.7 billion in liquidity at the end of June and has not decided whether to take a $4.6 billion secured loan under the CARES Act as it eyes other financing involving similar collateral.  It already received $5.4 billion in taxpayer funds to cover payroll through September.  Large U.S. airlines have warned of furloughs in October when the stimulus runs out, but Bastian said he hoped to avoid furloughs after more than 17,000 employees opted for buyouts.  Over 45,000 employees have taken varying short-term leaves.  LIMITED SEATING  Delta may continue blocking middle seats beyond September thanks to demand for comfort but warned it cannot make money filling only 60% of its planes.  \u201cYou can\u2019t raise prices high enough, particularly when your competition isn\u2019t blocking middle seats and has a lot more supply out there,\u201d Bastian said.

Delta will not allow travelers flying to Washington area airports to check firearms on its flights before the inauguration, Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Thursday.  The actions follow the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week by supporters of President Donald Trump and disturbances on flights and at airports. Officials have warned of plans for armed protests in Washington and all 50 states.  Hotels, airlines and other businesses ramped up security as authorities planned to deploy at least 20,000 National Guard troops in the city.  \u201cWe\u2019re all on high alert based on the events over the last couple of weeks in Washington,\u201d Bastian told CNBC. He told Reuters his airline had placed passengers on a no-fly list for their involvement in disruptive incidents that, for example, targeted Republican U.S. Senator Mitt Romney.  In Washington, the perimeter of a high fence surrounding the Capitol was pushed out to encompass the U.S. Supreme Court and the Library of Congress. Nearby roads were closed, and some businesses said they would shut down.  U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA case officer with a background in terrorism, warned of possible political violence after the inauguration.  \u201cWe\u2019re certainly preparing for those potential results over this weekend and at the inauguration, but it doesn\u2019t end there,\u201d she told CNN.  The National Park Service said a decision had yet to be made on whether to close the National Mall running from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial.  The park service closed the Washington Monument to tours and Mayor Muriel Bowser asked visitors to stay away from the city.  Trump\u2019s vice president, Mike Pence, was expected to speak at a briefing on inauguration security on Thursday at the headquarters of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday voted to impeach Trump on charges of incitement after his supporters rampaged through the Capitol, leaving five dead, following a speech by the Republican president reiterating his false claim that Biden, a Democrat, beat him because of widespread fraud.  The storming of the Capitol is being investigated by federal authorities, who have arrested dozens of people so far.  More than 30 House Democrats, including Spanberger and U.S. Representative Mikie Sherrill, have asked the acting House and Senate sergeants-at-arms and the acting head of the Capitol Police for visitor logs, videos and other information about who was in the building that day.  Sherrill, who has accused Republicans of inciting the Trump mob, said she saw colleagues leading groups on \u201creconnaissance\u201d tours of the Capitol the day before the Jan. 6 attack.","294":"(Adds details on aircraft certification, travel demand, updates shares, background on Airbus planes)  Jan 15 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc posted a slight beat in fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday but warned of a decline in revenue growth this quarter and difficulties in introducing new aircraft because of the U.S. partial government shutdown.  As the shutdown entered its 25th day on Tuesday, non-essential work at the Federal Aviation Administration was on hold, delaying the certification of new aircraft.  Delta, the No. 2 U.S. carrier, said it may delay the Jan 31 start date for its Airbus 220 airplanes, and the commercial use of other jets such as the Airbus A330neos.  The A220 is a small, single-aisle aircraft that Airbus is producing in partnership with Bombardier. The A330neo sports a newer cabin and larger engines than existing A330 long-haul jets.  Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said the shutdown will cost about $25 million per month due to reduced government travel and related effects. He said the company has not seen any impact on corporate travel or bookings.  Still, the carrier sees unit revenue, a closely watched metric of revenues per mile flown, ranging between flat to 2 percent higher in the first quarter, compared with 3.2 percent growth in the fourth quarter. It cited the timing of when Easter falls this year and increasing foreign exchange headwinds as negative factors.  JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker warned that Delta\u2019s first-quarter target for unit revenue could be at risk if the shutdown drags on past January.  Delta operates about 86 daily flights from Washington-area airports, less than rivals like United Airlines Holdings inc , which has a hub at Washington Dulles and has about 264 Washington-area flights per day.  United is due to report fourth-quarter results on Tuesday after the markets close.  Beyond the shutdown, which has been causing long airport lines as more security screeners, who are not being paid, fail to show up for work, Delta said leisure and corporate travel demand remained healthy, with strong bookings through the U.S. spring break period.  Delta forecast first-quarter earnings between 70 cents and 90 cents per share, below analysts\u2019 estimate of 94 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Both Delta and larger rival American Airlines Inc lowered estimates earlier this month for fourth-quarter unit revenue, raising concerns about airlines\u2019 ability to raise fares in an uncertain global economy. The forecasts sent their shares sharply lower.  On an adjusted basis, Delta earned $1.30 per share in the fourth quarter, above the $1.27 per share expected by analysts.  Total operating revenue rose 5 percent to $10.74 billion, in line with the Wall Street estimate.  Shares rose 0.3 percent to $47.89.

Delta is the first company with a BB or better rating to hit the US syndicated loan market since the final week of February, according to data from Refinitiv LPC. In doing so, it has provided Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) with a rare opportunity to buy a syndicated loan for a company that still carries an investment grade rating from one of the three major ratings agencies.  The US CLO market is the single-largest buyer of new leveraged loans, but as CLO creation remains low, new leveraged transactions will struggle to be broadly syndicated among investors. The coronavirus\u2019 impact has also led to a wave of downgrades to loans owned by CLOs. These vehicles can only hold a limited amount of facilities rated CCC, which is just a few steps above default. Otherwise, the funds run the risk of triggering tests within the CLO that can limit returns for equity holders.  Already this month, 14 institutional term loan borrowers have defaulted on their debt, just one shy of the record set back in 2009, according to a report from Fitch Ratings on Wednesday.  Delta\u2019s new loan, however, is rated Baa2 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. It offers investors not only the safety of a higher credit rating, but security through airport slots and returns typically found in riskier single B rated deals.  \u201cIf CLOs have some powder, they will probably provide a bid given the ratings and the spread on offer,\u201d said Tim Gramatovich, chief investment officer at investment advisory firm Gateway Credit Partners.  Delta\u2019s short three-year US$1.5bn loan is being offered at 500bp over Libor at a discount of 97 cents on the dollar, which equals a yield-to-maturity of approximately 7.3%, according to two bankers familiar with the deal terms.  Moreover, if Delta seeks any incremental debt to this loan in the future, it will have to cough up an extra 50bp to lenders in the so-called \u2018most favored nation\u2019 protection.  The airline must also maintain at least US$2bn in unrestricted liquidity throughout the life of the loan and has secured the debt against airport slots and routes that Delta operates to Europe and Latin America.  \u201cCLOs are looking for a combination of security, (high) ratings and coupon. Some new issues will meet all three of these and are a great offset to some of the CCC sales,\u201d said Michael Herzig, a managing director at investment firm First Eagle Investment Management.  Barclays is arranging the loan. Lenders have until April 27 to commit to the terms on offer, the sources said.  A spokesperson for Delta did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesperson for Barclays declined to comment.  NOSE DIVE  In January, peer American Airlines, rated Ba3 by Moody\u2019s and BB- by S&P Global Ratings, was able to amend its US$1.2bn term loan with investors to a razor-thin margin of 175bp over Libor and extend the maturity to 2027 from 2021, Refinitiv LPC reported at the time.  Fast-forward three months, however, and the higher-rated Delta is offering a significantly juicier coupon with higher ratings to obtain investor support.  Atlanta, Georgia-headquartered Delta posted its first quarterly loss in more than five years, according to the company\u2019s earnings report on Wednesday.  Revenues nose-dived in the first three months of 2020 to US$8.59bn from US$10.47bn in the first quarter of 2019 as the airline took a hit from coronavirus.  Moody\u2019s, which rates Delta as investment grade at Baa3 and its term loan at Baa2, said the passenger airline sector is \u201cmost significantly\u201d affected by the pandemic given the exposure to travel restrictions, the ratings agency said in a report on Thursday.  Last month, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Delta to BB from BBB- due to the drop in passenger demand.  Despite the headwinds, Delta\u2019s new term loan is expected to draw strong demand from investors due to the collateral package on offer and the airline\u2019s significant liquidity, according to a third banking source.  Delta has made a concerted effort to raise cash in the last month.  The term loan was launched alongside a US$1.5bn bond sale on Thursday, the company\u2019s first as a high-yield issuer, according to Refinitiv data.  On March 20, Delta said it obtained a US$2.6bn secured credit facility and also drew down US$3bn from its revolving credit lines, according to a company press release.","297":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  MILAN (Reuters) - Alitalia's administrators said they had no preferred option between Delta Air Lines DAL.N and Lufthansa LHAG.DE, the two groups talking with rail operator Ferrovie dello Stato about a rescue for the troubled Italian carrier.  Ferrovie, which is leading a state-orchestrated effort to rescue Alitalia, will have to choose between the two foreign carriers in the next weeks as the financial performance of Alitalia was deteriorating, the administrators said.  \u201cWe do not have any preference about the industrial partner for Alitalia, we are unbiased,\u201d Daniele Discepolo, one of the three administrators in charge of the airline told a parliamentary hearing.  Delta and Lufthansa belong to rival respective airline alliances and are both interested in the lucrative Italian market, one of the world\u2019s top tourism destinations which is seeing good growth in foreign visitors.  Lufthansa wrote to Ferrovie recently offering a commercial partnership with Alitalia and saying it could take a stake in the carrier under certain conditions to be agreed with other partners.  The German carrier, however, has so far refrained from indicating precisely how much it was prepared to pay and under what conditions. In the letter Lufthansa only said it could invest more than Delta, which, so far, has committed around 100 million euros ($111 million) for Alitalia.  Discepolo and fellow administrators Enrico Laghi and Stefano Paleari said the government\u2019s planned grant of a fresh 400 million euros bridge loan was needed to keep Alitalia\u2019s airplanes flying until the rescue was successfully finalised.  The state has already granted a 900 million euro loan for the carrier and analysts calculate that Italian taxpayers have spent more than 9 billion euros to support Alitalia, which has undergone two previous failed rescue attempts.  Paleari said Alitalia\u2019s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were negative to the tune of 164 million euros in the first half of this year, worsening from a 124 million euro loss in the same period last year partly due to higher fuel costs.","298":"FILE PHOTO: Passengers check in at a counter of Delta Air Lines in Mexico City, Mexico, August 8, 2016.

In the second quarter, Delta expects earnings per share of $1.80 to $2, with improving costs and lower U.S. corporate tax rate helping to mitigate higher fuel prices - a big worry for airlines as crude prices hover around three-year highs.  \u201cWe are seeing Delta\u2019s best revenue momentum since 2014, with positive domestic unit revenues, improvements in all our international entities, strong demand for corporate travel and double-digit increases in our loyalty revenues,\u201d Delta President Glen Hauenstein said.  \u201cWe expect to maintain this momentum and deliver total revenue growth of 4 to 6 percent for the full year.\u201d  The carrier said total unit revenue - a key metric which compares sales with flight capacity - would increase 3 to 5 percent in the second quarter.  It also forecast an increase in quarterly unit costs, excluding fuel and profit sharing, of 1 percent to 3 percent compared with the preceding year.  \u201cDelta is seeing a strong pricing environment.

In the quarter through March, Delta said operating expenses had swelled by $817 million to $9.13 billion from $8.1 billion the previous quarter, driven by higher fuel and labor costs, and a higher depreciation expense.  Still, Delta said it was on track to reach its target goal of flat to 2 percent growth in full-year unit costs.  First-quarter revenue rose 9.5 percent in the first quarter, while net income fell to $547 million from $561 million a year earlier due to a spike in fuel prices and severe winter storms cost it $44 million.

The approval of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for the post comes as the FAA grapples with an ongoing review of Boeing Co\u2019s grounded 737 MAX planes following two crashes that killed a total of 346 people in October and March, as well as broader questions about how it certifies aircraft and whether it delegates too much authority to manufacturers.  The FAA had been without a Senate-confirmed chief for more than 18 months.  Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao praised the confirmation Wednesday, while Democrats have criticized Dickson\u2019s handling of a case involving a whistleblower who raised concerns over safety at Delta.  \u201cWith decades of experience in the airline industry overseeing flight operations, and service to our country as a United States Air Force officer, Captain Dickson is highly qualified to lead the FAA,\u201d Chao said.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said Dickson \u201cis very simply not the right person for this job.\u201d  The 45,000-employee FAA has faced questions about why it lagged other countries in grounding the 737 MAX, and has since repeatedly said it will not allow the plane to fly again until it is safe to do so.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc was sued on Tuesday by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for damage caused when a jet skidded off a runway at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport during a March 5, 2015, snowstorm.  The complaint seeks $750,047 for property damage and other costs that allegedly occurred when Flight 1086 veered off Runway 13 after touchdown, struck a fence and came to rest on an embankment, just short of plunging into frigid Flushing Bay.  According to the Port Authority, which operates the airport, the incident \u201cwas caused solely by the negligence of Delta and its agents,\u201d including the pilot of the MD-88 aircraft.  The complaint filed in the state supreme court in Manhattan did not specify what damage occurred.  Delta declined to comment. The Port Authority had no immediate additional comment.  A September 2016 report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said the incident was probably caused by the pilot\u2019s use of excessive reverse thrust, resulting in an \u201cinability to maintain directional control\u201d of the airplane.  It said other factors were the pilot\u2019s focus on other aspects of the landing, and stress resulting from concern about stopping on the relatively short, snow-covered runway.  None of the 127 passengers and five crew members was seriously injured, though 29 passengers suffered minor injuries, the NTSB said. here  The case is Port Authority of New York and New Jersey v Delta Air Lines Inc et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 450357\/2018.","309":"CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines and Delta Air Lines are requiring all passengers on flights from the United Kingdom to the United States to present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The decision follows the emergence of a highly infectious new coronavirus variant in Britain that has prompted many countries to shut their borders to travelers from there.  Delta\u2019s policy, expanded from its decision on Monday to require the screenings on UK flights to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, is effective Dec. 24, while United\u2019s requirement begins Dec. 28.  Passengers will be asked to show proof of a negative molecular COVID-19 test or antigen test, and same-day, pre-flight rapid tests will be available for ticketed passengers at a Heathrow testing center.  Earlier this week members of a White House coronavirus task force recommended that the U.S. government impose COVID-19 screenings for passengers from Britain. But the Trump Administration decided not to take action, people briefed on the decision told Reuters.  The administration has repeatedly refused to issue mandates for many federal COVID-19 safety policies for air travel, leaving any requirements to the airlines.  On Monday, the three airlines that fly from London to JFK - Delta, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic - agreed to a request from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that they screen passengers from Britain.  Delta also flies between London and Atlanta.  United currently has four daily flights from London Heathrow to Chicago, Newark, N.J., Washington Dulles and San Francisco. It announced earlier this month that it will operate only two daily flights in January, to Chicago and Newark.  U.S. airlines have already drastically scaled back flying to the United Kingdom, as well as the rest of Europe.  American Airlines, with one daily flight between London and Dallas, has yet to announce any test requirements.","310":"FILE PHOTO: Delta Air Lines passenger planes are seen parked due to flight reductions made to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport in Birmingham, Alabama, U.S. March 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DAL.N said late on Friday it will soon send warning notices to about 2,500 pilots regarding possible furloughs at the airline, as the industry takes a huge blow after the coronavirus pandemic slashed air travel demand.  \u201cIn an effort to best prepare our pilots should furloughs be needed, Delta will send required notices to approximately 2,500 pilots,\u201d a Delta spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the so-called \u2018WARN\u2019 notices will be sent next week.  Delta also reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) labor union on a pilot-specific voluntary early retirement option.  The early-out plan is a meaningful step as the carrier is working to manage the impact of the pandemic and align staffing with expected flying demand, the company said.  A spokesperson for ALPA said after reaching the tentative agreement, Delta sent a letter, detailing pilot furloughs and early retirement option, that has been \u2018received poorly\u2019 by the pilots.  \u201cEarly retirements alone likely won\u2019t be enough to avoid pilot furloughs altogether, Senior Vice President of Flight Operations at Delta, John Laughter, said in the internal memo on Friday, adding that the carrier hopes it will not have to reduce jobs involuntarily.  The airline will continue its discussions with the union on an all-inclusive agreement that would contain a no-furlough commitment for two years, Laughter said.  On Thursday, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian had informed employees that the company is planning to add about 1,000 flights in August but not many more for the remainder of 2020.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s encouraging to see flights returning ... we likely remain at least two years away from a return to normal,\u201d Bastian said.","311":"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's largest brewing company Delta Beverages, part-owned by Anheuser-Busch Inbev ABI.BR, said it has abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments to cope with a crippling shortage of U.S. dollars, after the government intervened.  Delta Beverages announced on Wednesday that it would only take payments in U.S. currency and would no longer accept electronic dollars known as \u201cZollars\u201d, or a quasi-currency known as \u201cbond notes\u201d, amid a severe shortage of hard currency in Zimbabwe.  However, the country\u2019s commerce minister said on Thursday that the government opposed the plan and Delta, 40 percent-owned by Anheuser-Busch Inbev, scrapped the plan following a meeting with senior politicians and reserve bank officials.  \u201cDelta withdraws the notice to sell its products exclusively in hard currency, in the spirit of the multi-currency framework,\u201d Delta and Zimbabwe\u2019s reserve bank said in a joint statement late on Thursday.  The reserve bank said it would endeavor to provide the foreign currency required to ensure that Delta continues to trade \u201con the current basis\u201d.  In a separate statement on Friday, Delta said shortages of its products, particularly soft drinks, would persist while the arrangement gets underway.  Zimbabwe\u2019s currency crisis is undermining President Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s efforts to win back foreign investors who were sidelined under his predecessor Robert Mugabe.  Zimbabwe abandoned its currency in 2009, adopting the U.S. dollar in an effort to tame hyperinflation, but a severe shortage of physical notes has seen dollars in bank accounts lose value compared with cash.  Companies such as Delta have been left struggling because they have to spend U.S. dollars overseas, but their takings consist of Zollars or \u2018bond notes\u2019, which are worth far less.  Zimbabwe began issuing \u2018bond notes\u2019 in late-2016 in an effort to ease the worsening cash crunch. The quasi-currency was supposed to trade in parity with the U.S. dollar but it wasn\u2019t long before it devalued sharply on the street.  As inflation shot up, the reserve bank in October ordered banks to separate dollars and the electronic \u201cZollars\u2019 in customer accounts, effectively recognizing the country has two currencies.  That spooked investors and Zimbabweans panicked amid acute shortages of fuel and basic goods, piling pressure on Mnangagwa as he attempts to rebrand Zimbabwe after decades of international isolation under Mugabe.","312":"March 10 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc:  * DELTA AIR LINES - REDUCING SYSTEM CAPACITY BY 15 POINTS VERSUS PLAN, WITH INTERNATIONAL CAPACITY REDUCED BY 20-25%, DOMESTIC CAPACITY REDUCED BY 10-15%  * DELTA AIR LINES INC SAYS COVID-19 IS MATERIALLY IMPACTING REVENUE AS BOOKINGS DECLINE AND TICKET CANCELLATIONS ACCELERATE - PRESENTATION  * DELTA AIR LINES - UNDERTAKING COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, INCLUDING INSTITUTING COMPANY-WIDE HIRING FREEZE AND OFFERING VOLUNTARY LEAVE OPTIONS  * DELTA AIR LINES - UNDERTAKING COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, INCLUDING PARKING AIRCRAFT, AND EVALUATING EARLY RETIREMENTS OF OLDER AIRCRAFT  * DELTA AIR LINES - WITHDRAWING MARCH QUARTER AND FY FINANCIAL OUTLOOK; CURRENTLY EXPECT MARCH QUARTER UNIT REVENUE TO BE DOWN MID- TO HIGH-SINGLE DIGITS  * DELTA AIR LINES - MADE CASH FLOW DECISION OF DEFERRING $500 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  * DELTA AIR LINES - MADE CASH FLOW DECISION OF DELAYING $500 MILLION OF VOLUNTARY PENSION FUNDING AND SUSPENDING SHARE REPURCHASES  * DELTA AIR LINES - IDENTIFIED CAPACITY-RELATED & INCREMENTAL COST REDUCTIONS OF $1.8 BILLION IN 2020  * DELTA AIR LINES - EXPECTING AT LEAST $5 BILLION LIQUIDITY AT MARCH QUARTER END Source text: (bit.ly\/38IiKeB) Further company coverage:","313":"FILE PHOTO: Elaine Chao, U.S. Secretary of Transportation speaks at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit 2019 (GES 2019) in The Hague, Netherlands June 4, 2019.

But \u201cwe\u2019re not growing,\u201d he added.  Atlanta-based Delta posted a $2.8 billion adjusted net loss, or $4.43 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30 as passenger revenues plummeted 94% during a season that some analysts call the worst in aviation history.  Delta stuck to its target to halt a daily cash burn, which hit $100 million at the start of the pandemic, by the end of the year, though Bastian warned it hinges on demand.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of risk because it\u2019s hard forecasting what\u2019s going to happen with the virus,\u201d he said.  The airline slowed its daily cash burn to about $27 million in June and sees a similar rate in July, with improvements as economies open and people feel more comfortable traveling.  Delta had $15.7 billion in liquidity at the end of June. It has not decided whether to take a $4.6 billion secured loan under the CARES Act - available until Sept. 30 - as it eyes other options involving similar collateral, Bastian said.  It already received $5.4 billion to cover payroll through September under the U.S. government stimulus package.  Large U.S. airlines have warned of furloughs in October when those funds run out, but Bastian said he hoped to avoid furloughs after more than 15,000 employees opted for buyouts and thousands more for extended unpaid leaves.  LIMITED SEATING  Delta may continue blocking middle seats beyond September thanks to demand for comfort, but warned it cannot make money filling only 60% of the plane.  \u201cYou can\u2019t raise prices high enough, particularly when your competition isn\u2019t blocking middle seats and has a lot more supply out there,\u201d he said.  Southwest Airlines too is limiting seating capacity through September, but rivals American Airlines and United Airlines have added thousands of flights with all seats for sale on hopes of picking up leisure summer demand.  Delta, the first of the U.S. airlines to report quarterly results, is more geared toward business travel, which will be slower to recover, but Bastian said its SkyMiles loyalty data showed business customers traveling for personal reasons and willing to pay a premium.  \u201cThis is something that will take two to three years for us to walk through and we\u2019ll be very disciplined as to how we walk it back up,\u201d he said.  Delta, which had been expanding aggressively through international partnerships, wrote down $1.1 billion against its recent LATAM Airlines investment and $770 million against Grupo AeroMexico after their Chapter 11 filings, and booked a $200 million charge against its stake in Virgin Atlantic, which is also restructuring.  Delta flew 93% fewer passengers in the quarter, while its fuel expense was $372 million versus $2.3 billion a year ago.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The profit beats boosted airline shares in after-hours trading, with United Continental Holdings up nearly 6 percent, while Delta rose 1 percent. Shares of American Airlines Group AAL.O and Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N also rose, up 2.4 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.  However, No. 2 U.S. carrier Delta warned of a fall in revenue growth in the current quarter due to lost government business and of difficulties in introducing new aircraft because of the U.S. government shutdown that has dragged into a fourth week.  United said it had placed orders for four Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and 24 737 MAX planes, though the commercial use of new planes could be delayed as non-essential work at the Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for certifying new aircraft, remained on hold due to the shutdown.  The FAA said on Tuesday it is calling back 1,700 aviation safety inspectors, but does not have immediate plans to recall employees who handle certifications of new aircraft.  \u201cThere continues to be growing concerns around the macro environment with the government shutdown and slowing economies in Europe and Asia,\u201d Cowen and Company analyst Helane Becker said.  Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said the shutdown will cost about $25 million per month due to reduced government travel and related effects. He said the company has not seen any impact on corporate travel or bookings, which overall look healthy through the U.S. spring break period.  Delta operates about 86 daily flights out of Washington area airports.  United, with a hub at Washington Dulles, could be more exposed to a prolonged shutdown, operating about 264 Washington area flights per day in January.

United attributed fourth-quarter growth to a strategy launched last January to expand its domestic network by adding flights and more options for connections through its seven main hubs, with a particular focus on Chicago, Denver and Houston.  Delta reported adjusted profit of $1.30 per share for the fourth quarter, beating analysts\u2019 estimates by 3 cents.

The U.S. filing is an ancillary proceeding tied to a separate action filed in a British court, where Virgin Atlantic obtained approval Tuesday to convene meetings of affected creditors to vote on the plan on Aug. 25.  An airline spokeswoman said the restructuring plan was before a British court \u201cto secure approval from all relevant creditors before implementation.\u201d She added the \u201cprocess is proceeding with the support of the majority of our creditors.\u201d  Bloomberg reported Virgin Atlantic told a London court it could run of money in September if a restructuring deal is not approved.

The reorganization is expected to be completed towards the end of this summer and be spread across the next 18 months.  The airline, 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group and 49% by U.S. airline Delta, closed its Gatwick base and cut more than 3,500 jobs to contend with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has grounded planes and hammered demand for air travel.  \u201cDelta said it supported the plan and was \u201coptimistic\u201d that it would help Virgin Atlantic \u201cmaintain its position\u201d in the travel market.

The flights will operate twice a week in June and once a week starting July from Seattle and Detroit, Delta said. (bit.ly\/2YqmLCR)  Last week, the U.S. Transportation Department said the United States and China would each allow four weekly flights between the two countries, easing the standoff on travel restrictions in the midst of the novel coronavirus pandemic.  However, the United States on Friday rejected a request by Chinese airlines for additional weekly flights between the two countries, but said the decision was not meant to escalate tensions over travel restrictions.  United Airlines UAL.O had also said it was looking to re-launch flights to China in the coming weeks.  Delta, which added 100 domestic flights in June as state-wide lockdowns were lifted, has said it expects to end the year with $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Airlines for America, which represents American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and other major carriers, also urged the Trump administration in a letter to Vice President Mike Pence \u201cto move ahead with recommendations to rescind current entry restrictions on travelers from Europe, the United Kingdom and Brazil as soon as possible ... concurrently with the testing program.\u201d  In November, Reuters reported that the White House was considering rescinding restrictions that ban most non U.S. citizens from traveling to the United States from the 26 members of the Schengen area that allow travel across open borders in Europe, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Brazil.  \u201cWe believe a well-planned program focused on increasing testing of travelers to the United States will further these objectives in a much more effective way than the blanket travel restrictions currently in place,\u201d the airlines\u2019 letter said.  Airlines support a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposal to implement \u201ca global program to require testing for travelers to the United States,\u201d the letter added.  A senior administration official said the CDC proposal to expand international testing requirements faces significant opposition at top levels of the administration, including in Pence\u2019s office. The White House coronavirus task force is expected to meet Tuesday and the issue is scheduled to be discussed, officials said.  The CDC on Dec. 28 began requiring all airline passengers arriving from Britain - including U.S. citizens - to test negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of departure.  A CDC spokeswoman declined to comment Monday but the agency said last week that \u201cefforts are currently ongoing in the U.S. to assess the risk reduction associated with testing and other recommended preventative measures... and gain some level of agreement on standards for a harmonized approach to testing for international air travel.\u201d  Airlines are seeking at least 14 days before new requirements take effect and \u201cconsideration of inadequate testing and results availability in specific countries rather than a blanket worldwide requirement is also needed,\u201d the letter said.  Starting Thursday, Canada will require that air travelers five and older test negative for COVID-19 before arrival."}}
