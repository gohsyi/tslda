(Reuters) - Britain\u2019s billionaire Issa brothers and private equity group TDR Capital have bought Asda from Walmart in a deal which gives the British supermarket chain an enterprise value of $8.8 billion and the buyers a platform to roll out smaller stores.  Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who founded petrol station operator EG Group nearly two decades ago, are taking Asda back under British ownership for the first time since 1999, when U.S. retail giant Walmart WMT.L paid 6.7 billion pounds for it.  \u201cThe Issa brothers have a reputation for good brand partnerships, for convenience and for growth and that\u2019s really what we were interested in for Asda,\u201d Judith McKenna, President and CEO of Walmart International told Reuters on Friday.  McKenna said the deal was not about job cuts and the new owners said they are targeting growth by expanding into convenience shops from its large supermarket and online operations, bringing Asda more in line with market leader Tesco TSCO.L and No. 2 Sainsbury's SBRY.L.  The Issas said they wanted to utilise their experience to help \u201cbuild a differentiated business\u201d at Britain\u2019s third-biggest supermarket chain, in which Walmart will retain an unspecified minority stake, as well as a commercial relationship and a board seat.  British retail veteran Roger Burnley will remain as CEO of Asda in a deal which ratings agency Moody\u2019s said allows Walmart to continue to refocus its international efforts on markets with more long-term upside, such as India and China.  McKenna would not say for how long Walmart has committed to remain an investor or comment on the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO).  \u201cThe brothers and TDR will help make decisions about what that future path looks like,\u201d she said.  CONVENIENCE SHIFT  The new owners said they will invest more than 1 billion pounds over three years to keep prices low, develop supply chains and in e-commerce, in addition to convenience stores.  British finance minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the deal, which will see Asda retain its headquarters in the northern English city of Leeds.  Last year Walmart\u2019s attempt to sell Asda to Sainsbury\u2019s for 7.3 billion pounds was thwarted by Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority and McKenna said she expected the regulator to also consider the new deal.  Britain\u2019s highly competitive supermarket sector has been upended by the COVID-19 crisis, which sparked a jump in sales - and costs - as shoppers stocked up on goods during lockdowns.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  While Asda\u2019s sales rose, it still lagged the growth of its biggest rivals, partly due to a lack of convenience stores that have thrived as Britons shop closer to home.  All of the big four chains also face fierce competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl and there are fears recession triggered by the crisis will spark a margin damaging price war.

FILE PHOTO: Caution tape hangs at the entrance of a temporarily closed Walmart store, where a number of employees tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and one employee died, in Quincy, Massachusetts, U.S., May 5, 2020. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  Yet by early May, visits to Walmart had rebounded and were outpacing visits to supermarkets, according to the analysis.  The data offers a snapshot of some of the dramatic changes in Americans\u2019 shopping patterns in the weeks before and after the United States implemented lockdowns intended to curb the spread of coronavirus.  Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart gets more than half its U.S. revenue from grocery sales. The retailer on Tuesday will report its first-quarter revenue and earnings, providing a look at how it fared as COVID-19 hit a growing number of states.  Reuters compared foot traffic observed by SafeGraph from the first week of March through early May. SafeGraph compiles anonymized location data from mobile devices and compares it with building footprints to measure traffic. The number of mobile devices recorded by SafeGraph fluctuates, so Reuters adjusted the data based on the number of devices SafeGraph reported each day.  \"During panic buying time, it was 'I want to get my groceries, and that's all I want to do. I want to do it safely, I want to get in and out,'\" said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank, which owns shares of Walmart, Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O and others. Some shoppers might have concluded that \"Walmart is one of the worst places for lines,\" he said.  Walmart declined to comment.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Walmart saw an 18% increase in foot traffic from March 13 to March 17 compared to the first week of March, Reuters found. That\u2019s about half the 37% increase at supermarkets and other grocery stores during the same time period, when consumers stocked up on goods in advance of coronavirus lockdowns implemented around the United States.  During the same period, Target Corp TGT.N saw a 14% rise in foot traffic, less than half the increase at grocery stores. Major dollar store chains saw a 26% increase in foot traffic.  A Target spokeswoman referenced an April 23 press release, which said the company experienced a \u201csurge in traffic and sales\u201d in mid-March followed by a decline in in-store sales as \u201cguests across the country began to shelter in place\u201d and turned to online orders. She declined further comment.  (For a graphic, see: )  After that initial surge in visitors, traffic to Walmart and other big box and grocery stores fell in late March and early April, Reuters found. Walmart lost more traffic than most supermarkets, but it still performed better than Target and Amazon.com Inc's Whole Foods AMZN.O, which saw traffic drop by 26% and 33%, respectively, during the first two weeks of April.  An Amazon spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.  Walmart has announced that stores would allow no more than five customers per 1,000 square feet, or roughly 20 percent of store capacity. Despite this, as of May 6, foot traffic to Walmart stores had rebounded and was up 16% compared to the first week of March.  \u201cThey\u2019ve made a lot of investments in grocery and they did it at the right time,\u201d said Huntington\u2019s Hare, highlighting Walmart\u2019s plans to have more than 2,000 stores where they can deliver groceries within two hours. \u201cIf COVID would have happened two years ago, they wouldn\u2019t have been ready.\u201d  The SafeGraph data does not include transaction size, and it is possible that some shoppers made fewer trips but purchased more items per trip. The foot-traffic data also includes traffic by retail employees and gig workers fulfilling shoppers\u2019 orders placed online.  Analysts have forecast Walmart will post its best quarterly sales in at least three years on Tuesday, but that is likely to come at the cost of profits as the retailer, much like Amazon, has invested millions to tackle the pandemic.","6":"MUMBAI\/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian shopkeepers and traders affiliated to a local lobby group held scattered sit-in protests across the country on Monday against Walmart Inc's WMT.N proposed $16 billion acquisition of e-commerce firm Flipkart.  The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) had hoped to gather one million protesters at various cities in the country to voice opposition to the deal, but the numbers were far fewer, witnesses.  \u201cThis is the first phase of our protest. And if the government doesn\u2019t listen, we will decide our future course of action at our national convention in Delhi later this month,\u201d Praveen Khandelwal, the CAIT secretary general told Reuters.  The group says the U.S. retail giant\u2019s buyout of Bengaluru-based Flipkart will create a monopoly in the retail market and drive mom-and-pop stores out of business. India currently allows 100 percent foreign direct investment in e-commerce firms that operate on an online marketplace-based model.  The sit-in in Delhi, where CAIT is based, attracted just about 50 traders and shopkeepers by noon, according to a Reuters witness. Attendance in other cities was also sparse.  Satinder Wadhwa, a watch seller who attended the Delhi demonstration, said a cash-rich Flipkart will be a major threat to small businesses like his own, which were already suffering due to a ban on high-value currency notes in Dec. 2016 as well as a nationwide sales tax that was introduced a year ago.  In Guwahati, one of the main cities in the northeastern Assam state, about 300 traders gathered to protest against the Walmart-Flipkart deal, said Rupam Goswami, vice president of CAIT. They also demanded simplification of the nationwide sales tax, he added.  Small sit-in protests were also held in different districts of India\u2019s eastern West Bengal state.  The CAIT in a statement, however, maintained that a million traders had participated in the demonstrations.  Bentonville, Arkansas-headquartered Walmart announced in May that it was acquiring roughly 77 percent of Flipkart, a deal that now awaits the approval of India\u2019s anti-trust regulator.  Multiple sources and lawyers close to the deal have previously told Reuters that while the Competition Commission of India will consider all arguments, the CAIT did not pose a challenge to the acquisition.  Walmart, which currently runs 21 cash-and-carry stores in India, said on Monday it had been supporting local manufacturing in India by sourcing from small and medium suppliers, farmers and businesses run by women.  \u201cOur partnership with Flipkart will provide thousands of local suppliers and manufacturers access to consumers through the marketplace model,\u201d Rajneesh Kumar, senior vice president, Walmart India, said in a statement.","7":"ALPHARETTA, Ga. (Reuters) - Jeff Leonard slides behind the wheel of his burgundy Honda Accord and heads to a nearby Walmart Inc store, where he picks up the package of groceries waiting for him.  Roughly an hour later, the 62-year-old delivers vegetables, flavored water and cleaning supplies to a shopper\u2019s front door. It is one of nearly 100 such Walmart deliveries for Leonard since July, when he first signed up to courier for the world\u2019s largest retailer.  But he does not wear a uniform or collect a traditional paycheck. He is not on Walmart\u2019s staff.  Leonard is one of hundreds of local independent drivers for DoorDash, the San Francisco-based online delivery service that Walmart uses to handle same-day delivery of groceries to shoppers\u2019 homes outside of Atlanta.  Leonard and his cohort of some 16.5 million American \u201cgig\u201d workers - people who currently work in contingent jobs or as on call workers - come at a lower cost for Walmart than full-time employees, according to interviews with drivers, delivery companies and Walmart documents reviewed by Reuters. But they lack loyalty when there are better paying deliveries out there, adding risk to Walmart\u2019s latest attempt to win more online grocery customers.  \u201cThis affords me the ability to make my own hours,\u201d said Leonard, who pays for his own fuel, car insurance and gets no health insurance, retirement plan or other employee benefits. He and other gig drivers in the area collect $7 to $10 per Walmart delivery. Walmart has deemed $11 an hour as minimum wage for its own employees.  The world\u2019s largest retailer began bolstering its partnerships with third-party courier firms to reach consumers in 100 U.S. cities last year to better compete with Amazon.com Inc. The move came as it ended initiatives to use Uber and Lyft drivers, and struggled with using Walmart\u2019s own employees, to deliver packages.  Walmart told Reuters it benefits from the speed as well as the driver contacts of its seven partner firms, such as DoorDash. The move allows same-day grocery delivery to 40 percent of households across the United States, without the burden of hiring employees. The retailer is able to keep costs down by negotiating pre-determined delivery rates with the firms, namely by breaking down delivery costs by zones in cities, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the situation, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.  The amount that drivers are paid is determined largely by the distance from a store to the shopper\u2019s home or location. For example, for all deliveries within 5 miles of the pick-up point, the retailer agrees to pay a certain amount. It works similarly for distances of 10 or 15 miles from the store as the pick-up point.  Jeff Leonard, a DoorDash driver, waits to pickup an order at a Walmart online grocery pickup parking lot in Cumming, Georgia, U.S., November 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Nandita Bose  \u201cThat (payment) gets defined ahead of time and that is fixed,\u201d said a source, referring to the company\u2019s agreement with Walmart. The retailer, the source said, then charges the customer a delivery fee.  The strategy helps Walmart avoid paying surge pricing - higher fares when demand for delivery drivers spikes due to rush hour, bad weather or popular meal times - that can dramatically drive up delivery costs.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said speed is a big factor in Walmart\u2019s reliance on the delivery companies, who have existing contracts with drivers and technology to dispatch them on demand. \u201cTo develop that on our own in each market would take us much longer to roll out,\u201d she said.  Walmart\u2019s partnership approach to grocery delivery is in contrast to Amazon Flex, which taps freelance drivers directly as needed, and pays them $18 or more per hour. Amazon is also launching its own branded delivery service for Amazon packages, providing couriers with access to leased Mercedes delivery vans and discounted insurance. Amazon did not respond to request for comment.  By working with partners who hire out drivers \u201con demand\u201d as contractors who can then also earn money from other outlets, Walmart is also able to lower liability risk from labor-related driver lawsuits, which are growing in number around the United States.  Walmart\u2019s Blakeman said the drivers are paid by the delivery, not by the hour, and the all-in average delivery time is 35 minutes. The delivery companies then make decisions about payments to drivers and how they are distributed, she said.  In Georgia and Ohio where these drivers deliver for Walmart as well as local restaurants, Reuters found nearly two dozen drivers take in compensation of less than $11 an hour when they made deliveries for Walmart. And some took in less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. All but one of the 22 deliveries, Reuters tracked, took over an hour to finish.  In a statement, DoorDash Chief Operating Officer Christopher Payne said a majority of drivers earn over $11 an hour while completing Walmart deliveries and a significant portion of the drivers earn over $15 an hour. Reuters was not independently able to verify the higher end of the hourly pay scale.  Walmart partner Deliv paid drivers by the hour, sources said. Reuters reported earlier this week that Deliv, one of Walmart\u2019s partners in Miami and San Jose, ended the relationship altogether.  LACKING LOYALTY  The risk to Walmart\u2019s new strategy is driver loyalty. None of the drivers in Georgia and Ohio Reuters interviewed said they would commit to handling Walmart deliveries over more lucrative gigs from local restaurants, especially during busy hours.  Garrick Clark, a 44-year-old driver making deliveries for Walmart in Alpharetta, said he would prefer dropping packages for Amazon over delivering groceries for Walmart because Amazon pays $18 to $24 an hour for similar deliveries.  A source with direct knowledge of why the relationship between Walmart and Deliv ended, said delivering large orders over long distances was a hurdle to the tie-up. Walmart charges $7.99 to $9.99 delivery fee on a minimum order size of $30 for online grocery orders, and customers willing to pay for same-day delivery often do not live close to a Walmart store, the person said.  Further, many Walmart\u2019s stores are in low-income neighborhoods which generated fewer online grocery orders for Deliv\u2019s same-day delivery, two sources said.  \u201cTo get drivers to agree to $7 or so to drive 15 miles to deliver 40 items was a big problem. Most drivers were like, \u2018We don\u2019t want to do Walmart anymore,\u2019\u201d one of the sources said. According to Spend Management Experts, Walmart would have to spend at least $141.76 per employee, per day if it hired them to make deliveries for 8 hours at $11 an hour in Atlanta. The cost analysis, which the firm performed on behalf of Reuters in December, includes what Walmart would pay for fuel, car insurance and car maintenance. But it excludes the cost of employee benefits.  Leonard, the driver here in Alpharetta, said getting a guaranteed minimum wage from delivery companies for the hours he logs would be a big help.  \u201cBut they don\u2019t, and that\u2019s the nature of the beast,\u201d Leonard said.

REUTERS\/Phil Noble\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s competition regulator said on Tuesday it expected to publish its final report on supermarket group Sainsbury\u2019s proposed 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) takeover of Walmart-owned rival Asda on Thursday, April 25.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had said in its provisional report in February that the deal, agreed last April, should either be blocked entirely or require the sale of a significant number of stores, or even one of the brands.  The regulator identified 629 areas where there could be a substantial lessening of competition (SLC) in supermarkets, 290 areas where online competition could be reduced and 65 local overlaps in smaller convenience stores.  Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda said last month the CMA\u2019s analysis was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d but said they were willing to sell 125-150 stores to get their deal past the regulator - a number well short of what the CMA had said it was looking for.  Given the CMA\u2019s concerns that the combination could lead to higher prices, most analysts and competition lawyers believe it is highly unlikely the deal will proceed.  That expectation has been reflected in Sainsbury\u2019s share price, which has fallen 17 percent over the last three months.","9":"March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission:  * GRACO RECALLS HIGHCHAIRS DUE TO FALL HAZARD; SOLD EXCLUSIVELY AT WALMART  * U.S. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION SAYS GRACO RECALLS ABOUT 36,000 HIGHCHAIRS DUE TO FALL HAZARD; SOLD EXCLUSIVELY AT WALMART  * U.S. CPSC SAYS GRACO HAS RECEIVED 38 REPORTS OF REAR LEG OF HIGHCHAIRS PIVOTING OUT OF POSITION, INCLUDING FIVE INJURIES TO CHILDREN Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","10":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N, Target Corp TGT.N and Best Buy Co BBY.N have made changes to their gift card programs to reduce the risk of fraud as consumers enter the holiday shopping season.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Barbara Underwood and Josh Shapiro, the attorneys general of New York and Pennsylvania, announced the changes on Tuesday, as part of a more than year-long initiative to thwart scam artists.  The changes include reducing purchase limits on store-branded gift cards in a single transaction, limiting how much can be loaded onto the cards, and prohibiting the redemption of store-branded gift cards for other gift cards.  Walmart, Target and Best Buy also bolstered training to help employees spot scams and warn potential victims.  \u201cBy working collaboratively with these retailers, we\u2019ve created a way for businesses to take proactive steps to prevent scams,\u201d Underwood said in a statement.  The National Retail Federation said gift cards are the most popular item on consumers\u2019 wish lists for the 12th straight year, requested by 60 percent of 7,313 people surveyed.  Last month, the Federal Trade Commission said 26 percent of victims reporting scams between January and September said they paid with gift cards, up from just 7 percent in 2015.  Losses through September from gift and 'reload' cards totaled $53 million, up from $40 million for all of 2017, with a median loss of about $500 per incident. (here)  Regulators said scammers often use retail gift cards to buy third-party cards such as iTunes, Steam and Google Play that can be resold on the black market, and impersonate other people to swindle unwitting victims.  Common impersonations include grandchildren claiming they got into trouble, such as arrests or accidents, and needed money for bail or lawyers; Internal Revenue Service agents claiming, often angrily, that taxes were owed; and tech support employees seeking payments to fix alleged viruses on victims\u2019 computers.  Underwood and Shapiro said retail gift cards cannot be used for such expenses, and that the IRS does not cold-call people.  They also said consumers should not volunteer gift card numbers to people they don\u2019t know, and should contact state consumer officials or law enforcement if they believe they were targeted.","11":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc is aggressively expanding its advertising business after years of stuttering progress, even as a proposed deal to buy a stake in video-sharing app TikTok remains stuck in limbo.  FILE PHOTO: A shopper is seen wearing a mask while shopping at a Walmart store in Bradford, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The world\u2019s largest retailer is making better use of its wealth of shopper data to link promotions on its website and app with ads inside its network of 4,700 U.S. stores, according to Reuters interviews with six advertising agencies and Walmart ad tech partners, three major brands plus bankers and ex-employees.  The refocused strategy was born early last year when Walmart cut ties with its external advertising partner and took the business in-house, calling it Walmart Media Group.  The company bet it could do a better job of bridging online and offline data for its advertisers and give itself a shot at developing an ad platform that could take on Amazon.com Inc, the sources said.  The shift has been paying off, according to one source briefed on the company\u2019s plans who said Walmart Media Group was on track to earn nearly $1 billion of advertising sales this year, more than double the amount it brought in last year.  Walmart declined to comment on the sales estimate, but it explained its approach to the ad business. \u201cOne thing we do at Walmart Media Group is make sure that the advertising we\u2019re placing is additive to the customer experience, that we\u2019re not just throwing ads on anything anywhere, that we\u2019re really strategic,\u201d Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.  The big challenge now, according to the source, is figuring out how it can continue to expand the ad business into one that will matter to investors for a company that earned about $524 billion in total revenue in fiscal year 2020.  \u201cIt\u2019s going well, and they want it to go very, very well,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere have been very material gains but it doesn\u2019t yet put a dent in Amazon\u2019s lead or Walmart\u2019s top or bottom line.\u201d  A deal for TikTok, which reaches 100 million U.S. users a month, was supposed to supercharge the strategy by helping Walmart\u2019s ad machine engage with younger audiences that may not shop regularly at Walmart. But the talks to invest in the Chinese-owned TikTok remain shrouded in political uncertainty.  That, however, has not stopped Walmart from moving ahead with its strategy, the advertising agencies and brands said.  Yet it\u2019s early days in the drive for Walmart, which has historically struggled to create new lines of business and has never turned a profit form its e-commerce business. Some advertisers and ad agencies said the retailer still had a distance to go on the technology front, including tracking how ads translated into sales - a key selling point for brands.  Walmart faces a huge task chasing Amazon, which is expected to generate about $13 billion in ads this year according to eMarketer, while it is also battling smaller rivals including Target and Kroger which are building their own ad platforms.  Another challenge it must overcome: Walmart disclosed this month that Stefanie Jay, leader of Walmart Media Group, will leave the company for a \u201cnew opportunity.\u201d Rich Lehrfeld, Walmart\u2019s former interim chief marketing officer, will now lead Walmart Media Group.  \u2018ALWAYS IN, ALWAYS ON\u2019  In meetings with brands and advertising technology partners, Walmart\u2019s executives have summed up its goals with a tagline - \u201cAlways In, Always On\u201d - a reference to how its store network will help advertisers reach more customers, Walmart told Reuters.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cWhether it\u2019s online or in the shopping aisle on a screen in the grocery section, they want that brand message through the whole ecosystem,\u201d said Nich Weinheimer, general manager of e-commerce at ad tech firm Kenshoo, which works with Walmart.  Walmart has used its data to improve targeting of ads and convinced some advertisers to sign long-term advertising contracts, brands and former employees say. The company told Reuters that its deals, which include store and digital ads, are typically worth low double-digit millions of dollars.  Dan Cooke, head of e-commerce at jam-maker JM Smucker Co which places ads with Walmart, told Reuters that the retailer had gathered better data on consumers and their purchases this year.  Walmart has uses the data to improve its online display advertising, give clients a better idea of how their ads are performing and provide \u201ccritical\u201d online tools that makes it easier for them to monitor and control campaigns themselves, he added.  \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an arms race that\u2019s going on - Amazon has certainly been a trailblazer,\u201d said Cooke, adding that Walmart was responding \u201cvery aggressively.\u201d  KNOWING WHAT SELLS  Walmart executives view the advertising drive as significant to the success of the retailer\u2019s e-commerce business as a whole, according to the source briefed on the company\u2019s plans.  Nearly 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart, according to the retailer\u2019s website. This is a strength that Walmart needs to leverage more, according to the ad agencies and brands, as it has an insight into consumers\u2019 shopping habits.  Walmart\u2019s stores and Walmart.com together count about 160 million visitors a week, data from investment bank Cowen shows.  Walmart\u2019s advertising strategy has nonetheless been somewhat hit or miss over the decades.  The retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, dabbled with the advertising business in the late 1990s and early 2000s with an in-store TV network that aired commercials. It expanded the business about 15 years ago to include its website through Triad Retail Media.  The retailer cut ties with Triad in February 2019 and brought all ad operations in-house under Walmart Media Group.  \u2018GLITCHES\u2019 COMPLAINTS  The company still faces a series of challenges.  It needs to improve ad-measuring capabilities to show exactly how certain ads lead to specific sales, Smucker\u2019s Cooke said.  Some advertisers have also complained about \u201cglitches\u201d where ads occasionally disappear from Walmart.com or don\u2019t show up at all. Kimberly Williams, a former campaign manager at Walmart Media Group, said this happened \u201call the time\u201d, recalling an ad for Mars Inc\u2019s M&M candies that disappeared for several hours.  According to brands, this happens from time to time on other retailers\u2019 platforms as well. Walmart declined to comment.  Longer term, the challenge for Walmart is to figure out an overarching media content strategy to keep customers engaged for longer periods, according to the industry players interviewed.  Walmart considered launching a subscription video service in 2018 but decided against it, according to sources. In other forays, it invested $250 million in a joint venture to develop interactive content and struck a deal with \u201cJames Bond\u201d studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to create content for the Vudu video-on-demand service, which it sold last April.  Walmart is also going after a new channel of ad revenue called \u201cbrand advertising,\u201d typically reserved for TV, by offering more formats like online display ads, said George Manas, chief media officer at ad agency OMD USA.  Executives hope successful advertising relationships could help it secure promotional tie-ins with the Walmart+ subscription service, its version of Amazon Prime.  Losing the TikTok deal won\u2019t be a disaster, but landing it would help Walmart flesh out a competitive media strategy, said Mark Boidman, managing director and head of media and tech services at PJ Solomon, which advises Walmart.  \u201cAmazon surrounds the consumer in a 360-degree manner,\u201d Boidman said, referring to Amazon Prime and the free video-streaming service that comes with it.  Walmart is still \u201cgetting there.\u201d  (This story adds dropped word \u201cformer\u201d in paragraph 13)","12":"(Reuters) - As more school districts roll back their reopening plans to curb the spread of coronavirus, major retailers in the United States, EU and UK are aggressively discounting back-to-school backpacks and uniforms and airing new advertisements featuring students happily taking classes at home.

Another ad shows a mom packing up a backpack with school supplies for her daughter to use while performing a chemistry experiment in the backyard.  In Europe, retailers would normally expect increased traffic for at least a week in August depending on when schools reopen, according to Sensormatic Solutions.  But shopper footfall in June and July was down substantially this year\u2014by 60% in Britain, 50% in Spain, Italy and France and more than 30% in Germany. That could spell trouble for retailers where back-to-school is a key sales driver on par with Christmas, according to Thomas Schnabel of the German retailer association HBS.  In Germany, parents tend to start buying just before summer holidays and throughout August, Schnabel said, highlighting how it was lucky lockdowns lifted when they did as he doubted back to school sales would transfer easily online. \u201cPeople want to try the pens and feel the fit and the fabric of rucksacks,\u201d Schnabel said.  In England, all kids are expected to return to school in September, while schools in Los Angeles and San Diego \u2013 California\u2019s two largest public-school districts - are set to resume classes online only in August.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a plan for reopening schools in September with a \u201cblended learning\u201d schedule that would have students alternating between classrooms and their homes.  U.S. laptop sales may boom as parents anticipate the COVID-19 pandemic will keep at least some classes online, retailers say, citing survey data. But spending on clothing is likely to take a hit. A Deloitte survey of 1,200 U.S. parents in July found they plan to spend 18% less on apparel and 28% more on technology.  Alycia Zimmerman, 38, a Brooklyn, New York, mother of a 3- and a 5-year-old, said she intends to buy fewer outfits for her kids this fall. \u201cThere will be a lot of time spent at home when I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re wearing the same thing four days in a row - and they don\u2019t have to look presentable,\u201d she said.  Several retailers - from department store operators Macy\u2019s Inc M.N, Nordstrom Inc JWN.N to discount stores like Ross Stores Inc ROST.O - canceled summer orders from suppliers at the onset of COVID-19.  To better manage inventory, Jane Elfers, Chief Executive of Children\u2019s Place said on a June 11 earnings call that the Secaucus, New Jersey-based company had invested in services like ship-from-store.  In the UK, retail executives expect parents to make fewer shopping trips, to fewer retailers. Most schools have a uniform requirement, and generally, there\u2019s a compulsory product - a crested blazer, special tie, a games jersey available only at a particular supplier, while parents can get generic products like a white shirt or black trousers from anywhere, including Marks and Spencer.  \u201cParents who have to go to a store to go and buy that blazer and tie are then saying, \u2018let me buy my trousers and my shirts from here because I don\u2019t want to go to another store,\u2019\u201d said Mark Stevenson, co-chair of the Schoolwear Association, a UK group that represents uniform manufacturers.  M&S said Monday it would cut 950 jobs as part of a store management revamp.  Several American makers of uniforms applied for aid from the United States Paycheck Protection Program, which injected about $521.4 billion in taxpayer cash to businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Walmart and Google parent Alphabet Inc will buy up to 75 percent of Flipkart, the two sources familiar with the matter said, declining to be named as the talks are private.  Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart will acquire a stake of about 60 percent in Flipkart, while Alphabet will get a roughly 15 percent stake in the online marketplace for about $3 billion, one of the sources said.  Reuters had previously reported that Walmart was in advanced talks to acquire 51 percent or more of the e-commerce player for between $10 billion to $12 billion, valuing the firm at some $18 billion to $20 billion.  Both sources said that Flipkart Group Chief Executive Binny Bansal held a closed-door meeting with the firm\u2019s top leadership at its Bengaluru headquarters on Monday, with one of them adding that Bansal announced that Flipkart\u2019s co-founder Sachin Bansal would exit after the Walmart deal is sealed.  Flipkart last year named Kalyan Krishnamurthy, a former executive of investor U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management, as the head of its core business, while Binny Bansal took the broader strategic role of group CEO. Sachin Bansal remained as executive chairman.  The Flipkart Group includes fashion portals Myntra-Jabong, payments unit PhonePe and logistics firm Ekart.  Sachin and Binny Bansal, both former Amazon.com Inc employees, founded Flipkart in 2007, and, just like their U.S. rival, began by selling books.  Walmart is expected to get three board seats at Flipkart and will also have a say in the appointments of the group\u2019s finance, legal and compliance heads, one of the sources said.  Krishnamurthy and Binny Bansal will remain in their current roles after the deal, the two sources said.  Early Flipkart investors Tiger Global and venture fund Accel will sell a majority of their stakes, one of sources said.  Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, which owns roughly a fifth of Flipkart through its Vision Fund, is expected to completely exit, Reuters has previously reported.  SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund had invested close to $2.5 billion in Flipkart via primary and secondary share purchases last year.  Flipkart will hold a townhall for employees on Friday, with Walmart CEO Doug McMillon likely to attend, one of the sources said. Other top Walmart executives will also be in India for the announcement, the other source added.  A third source said Flipkart had scheduled multiple batches of townhall meetings with employees on Friday, sparking chatter within the ranks that a deal is likely imminent.  Flipkart, Walmart, Alphabet, Tiger Global and Accel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Target Corp TGT.N, Kohl's Corp KSS.N and Macy's Inc M.N also posted disappointing holiday sales in 2019, while Amazon.com AMZN.O logged record sales for the period.  Heavy investments to spruce up stores, enhance websites, improve delivery options and promote deals underscore the battle retailers are up against as they try to keep shoppers from going to Amazon.  \u201cWalmart\u2019s results show it\u2019s a food fight out there, with Amazon re-accelerating holiday sales growth,\u201d Evercore analyst Greg Melich said on Tuesday.  Walmart said it expects online sales to grow about 30% in fiscal 2021, down from last year\u2019s growth of 37%. For the holiday quarter, the company reported a 35% increase in online sales - the slowest in nearly two years.

Results were hit by a shorter holiday season and lower demand for apparel, toys and electronics.

REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski\/File Photo  \u201cThere were few weeks before Christmas where general merchandise sales and few categories in the stores were softer than anticipated and it was pretty much limited to apparel, toys, media and gaming,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters.  \u201cThere were some things in apparel, which we could have done differently in hindsight. We were a little more seasonal there than we should have been,\u201d he added.  Despite a weak holiday for toys and clothes, Walmart\u2019s grocery operation, its largest business, helped drive growth in online sales in the quarter.  Walmart has been expanding store capabilities to push speedy delivery and pickup services for groceries as it competes with similar options from Amazon and Target.  The company also said it would expand the services to add general merchandise items such as t-shirts and charger cables and not just groceries in a bid to boost online orders.  \u201cWe feel good about the year though our fourth quarter was not our best,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said.  The company forecast full-year profit to be between $5 and $5.15 per share, below expectations of $5.22, while it expects U.S. comparable sales to grow at least 2.5%.  The forecast excludes any potential financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak in China, Walmart said. However, it expected some financial impact in the current quarter and potentially into the second quarter from the epidemic.  Walmart shares were up marginally at $118.44.  Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.38 per share, but missed the average estimate of $1.43.  Total revenue rose 2.1% to $141.67 billion, missing the estimate of $142.49 billion.","19":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Target Corp will raise its U.S. minimum wage to $13 an hour in June, from $12, increasing its payroll costs and putting new pressure on rival Walmart Inc to follow suit, given a labor market that is among the tightest in half a century.  FILE PHOTO: A newly constructed Target store is shown in San Diego, California May 17, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Minneapolis-based Target, the eight largest U.S. retailer by sales and fifth largest by employee count, runs 1,845 stores and employs more than 300,000 workers in the United States. The discount chain is investing billions of dollars to improve its supply chain, expand online sales and improve delivery of merchandise to shoppers\u2019 homes.  Target previously raised minimum hourly pay to $12 in March 2018 from $11. In 2017, Target, said it was committed to raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by end of 2020. The wage increase will affect \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of employees, a Target spokeswoman said.  Retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers, with U.S. unemployment at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while there has been growing political pressure on companies to pay workers a fair living wage.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer and the largest U.S. private sector employer, pays entry-level workers $11 an hour. Walmart declined comment on the issue. The retailer\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said in February that a Walmart worker earns $17.55 on average with wages and benefits. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable that we\u2019ve got the appropriate wage investments to get the talent we need,\u201d he said.  Amazon.com Inc raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in October after facing harsh criticism over poor pay and working conditions. The online retailer said at the time that it would lobby Washington for an increase in the federal minimum wage.  The $15 minimum wage movement has found support from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats swept into office this year on a liberal platform.  \u201cCroissants at LaGuardia (New York airport) are going for seven dollars a piece,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 1. \u201cYet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??\u201d  Amid the growing political pressure, other companies have also moved to raise wages. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp raised its minimum wage twice in a year and since March has been paying employees at least $15 an hour.  In a blog post due to be published on Target\u2019s website on Thursday, the company\u2019s chief human resources officer, Melissa Kremer, tied the minimum wage hikes to the company\u2019s strong holiday performance, saying it \u201cmade a big difference.\u201d  In March, Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates after a strong holiday season.  \u201cWe were able to start them all (seasonal hires) at $12 or more - and that helped us reach our seasonal hiring goal ahead of schedule, which gave our teams a lot of extra time to train and prepare for our busiest season of the year,\u201d Kremer said.  It was not immediately clear if Target employees who already make $13 an hour will also see an increase in pay.  Target\u2019s spokeswoman said the company would evaluate hourly pay rates for such employees and make adjustments as appropriate. With some of Target\u2019s previous wage hikes, such employees have been entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike.","20":"NEW YORK\/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walmart Inc said it is preparing to offer COVID-19 vaccinations in seven more states, as well as in Chicago and Puerto Rico, this week and next, expanding beyond the two states where its pharmacists are offering inoculations.

REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  The move from the world\u2019s largest retailer comes as U.S. President Joe Biden races to accelerate a frustratingly slow vaccination campaign that has stranded about half of the nearly 40 million shots distributed in freezers rather than in arms.  This week and next, Walmart will start providing inoculations in Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and Texas as well as in Chicago and Puerto Rico, a company spokeswoman told Reuters late on Thursday.  The shots will only be available to specific populations decided by each state and only at a handful of stores in each state.  Walmart is already vaccinating healthcare workers in New Mexico and its home state of Arkansas.  Alabama\u2019s health officer, Scott Harris, on Thursday said the state would partner with Walmart to provide COVID-19 vaccinations. Walmart confirmed that deal, which falls under a federal partnership that Biden on Thursday said would launch in early February.  Harris said another deal, with a major pharmacy chain, is coming soon.  Health officials in Oklahoma and Mississippi told Reuters on Friday they are having or have had conversations with Walmart about partnering to administer shots. Walmart did not provide comment.  Walgreens, CVS, Kroger and Rite Aid are among the other chains that have stepped up to vaccinate Americans in what is the largest and most complex immunization effort in U.S. history. Those shots are needed to help stop the virus, which has killed more than 405,000 and infected more than 24 million people in the United States.  The Trump administration punted vaccine planning to states, which were asked to come up with their own plans, a move that left many pharmacy chains and supermarket-based pharmacies in limbo.  \u201cWe\u2019re having to be flexible as we try to operate state-by-state, but we feel like it\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do, to lean into this and help figure it out,\u201d Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said at the Consumer Electronics Show last week. \u201cThat\u2019s the approach that we\u2019re taking.\u201d  He said Walmart is \u201cmaking sure that we can handle the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine and do so appropriately and safely.\u201d  Walmart said in a blog post on Friday it expects to be able to deliver 10 million to 13 million doses per month at full capacity, using its network of more than 5,000 pharmacies in the United States and Puerto Rico.  The retailer also said it is positioned to serve \u201chealthcare deserts\u201d - rural areas lacking in healthcare facilities - and will host COVID-19 vaccination events in underserved communities at churches, stadiums and youth centers.  The Texas Department of State Health Services said many of Walmart\u2019s pharmacies have enrolled as vaccine providers in the state, but that \u201conly a handful\u201d have received the doses so far due to limited supply. \u201cOnce there\u2019s a broader supply and we can regularly start allocating to more pharmacies, they will be included,\u201d spokesman Chris Van Deusen said.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said in an emailed statement to Reuters it plans to \u201ccontinue and expand\u201d its existing partnership with Walmart, and that as \u201cadditional vaccine doses become available, Walmart has agreed to be a key part of our distribution plan.\u201d","21":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Target Corp TGT.N, Walmart Inc WMT.N and toy importer LaRose Industries were sued on Thursday over the sale of lead-contaminated children's toys, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said.  The lawsuit, filed in New York state court in Albany, is over \u201cCra-Z-Jewelz\u201d jewelry-making kits that were imported by LaRose and sold by Target and Walmart. Tests conducted by the attorney general\u2019s office found that the kits contained levels of lead that were up to 10 times higher than the federal limit, according to the complaint.  Although the kits were recalled, the complaint says the companies failed to take \u201cmeasures sufficient to ensure that they do not again import, distribute, and sell toys that place New York children at risk of adverse health consequences from lead exposure.\u201d  The lawsuit seeks civil penalties collectively ranging from $70 to $6,000 for each \u201cCra-Z-Jewelz\u201d kit the companies sought to sell in New York.  It also seeks an order directing LaRose and Target, when it acts as an importer, to implement a quality control program for overseas manufacturing operations and a testing program for lead levels, and seeks a separate order directing that Target and Walmart, as retailers, confirm compliance certificates for toys imported for sale in New York and a testing program for lead levels.  Walmart said it removed the toys from its shelves and online as soon as LaRose informed the recall nearly three years ago and it did not sell the products thereafter.  \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this matter with the New York Attorney General\u2019s office and will address the allegations and demands with the court,\u201d a Walmart spokesman said.  Target said it stopped selling the toy in April 2016 immediately after the New York Attorney General informed them about the problems with the product.  LaRose did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.","22":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc said on Tuesday it would start taking the temperature of employees and provide them with masks as it addresses growing safety concerns among retail workers laboring through the coronavirus crisis.  The retailer, which is the largest employer in the United States, also said it was in the process of sending infrared thermometers to all its locations in the next one to two weeks and would send back workers who record a temperature of 100 degrees or more.  Walmart's announcement comes a day after warehouse, delivery and retail gig workers in the United States went on strike to call attention to safety and wage concerns.

On Monday, 15 workers at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York, walked off the job following reports of coronavirus cases among the facility\u2019s staff.  Walmart, like its peers Target and Kroger, has undertaken a number of safety measures such as reducing hours for cleaning and restocking as demand for food supplies and essentials skyrockets on concerns that lockdowns to curb the virus might crimp supply.  Many service industries across the globe have adopted similar safety measures. Casinos in Macau that reopened last month have been tasked by the government to enforce temperature checks, mask protection and health declarations for staff and guests.  Restaurant Brands said on Monday it was deploying 15,000 infrared thermometers at Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeye outlets, while Starbucks said it regularly sterilizes containers and that its delivery staff have their temperature taken daily.  Global fast-food chains, including McDonald\u2019s, have also started contact-less delivery in China, where the virus originated.  Walmart\u2019s executive vice president of corporate affairs, Dan Bartlett, said the retailer would need more than 7 million masks per week to adequately supply its workforce across the country.  The first shipment of thermometers and masks will be deployed at the company\u2019s warehouses and as further supply becomes available, it will be sent to stores, Bartlett told reporters on a conference call.  He also said Walmart continues to see a \u201clot of pressure\u201d for essential items, including household cleaning supplies and toilet paper.  \u201cIt\u2019s just an astonishing volume that we are going through.\u201d","23":"(Adds Sonae denial)  SAO PAULO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Portuguese retail conglomerate Sonae SGPS SA denied an interest in Walmart Inc\u2019s Brazilian operations after Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico reported on Wednesday that the company could partner with buyout firms.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Walmart is seen on shopping trolleys at their store in Sao Paulo, Brazil February 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker\/File photo  The world\u2019s biggest retailer has been looking to jumpstart its overseas business by retreating from lower-growth markets and investing in places like China and India. Brazil had for a decade been the focus of expansion but the unit stumbled in recent years as operational issues compounded the effects of a deep recession.  Walmart did not disclose the value of the transaction but said it would record a noncash charge of roughly $4.5 billion related to the deal in the second quarter. The retailer will retain the remaining 20 percent stake in Walmart Brazil.  Shares in Walmart rose more than 2 percent, with analysts saying the deal allows the company to focus on more promising markets.  Two people involved in the deal said that the charge is close to the value of the Brazilian unit on Walmart\u2019s books, meaning the deal value was close to zero. The sources declined to specify the exact value of the deal and one of the sources said the final value of liabilities was not yet determined.  Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the retailer will not receive payment for the unit but could receive up to $250 million from Advent based on the unit\u2019s performance. Walmart does not disclose detailed financial statements for Brazil.  The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is trying to catch up with competitors ranging from grocer Aldi Inc to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in key markets. Walmart's underperforming international business made up less than one-quarter of total revenue of $500.3 billion in fiscal 2018.  In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run the international unit.  Walmart recently sold a majority stake in its UK arm ASDA to J Sainsbury Plc SBRY.L and paid $16 billion for a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart.  Steven Roorda, portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors and holds Walmart shares, said the retailer has struggled outside North America and \u201cCEO McMillon (is) picking markets that he thinks he can scale and win in.\u201d  The move is credit positive as it allows Walmart to make investments in places that have more long-term potential, said Moody\u2019s retail analyst Charlie O\u2019Shea.  Walmart had been looking for buyers for its Brazilian business and sounded out possible investors last year but received no interest from rival retailers, according to a source.  Reuters had reported in January that Walmart was shopping its Brazilian unit to private equity firm Advent and others.  In March, Reuters reported that in the due diligence process potential buyers estimated Walmart owes up to $3 billion in back taxes to state governments in Brazil, potentially adding to pressure for a discount sale.  Walmart entered Brazil in 1995 and had grown into the country\u2019s third-largest retailer following two major acquisitions in 2004 and 2005 and a period of rapid store expansion that came to a halt in 2013.  It operates 471 stores in Brazil, according to the company\u2019s local website. The Brazilian unit reported sales of more than $25 billion Brazilian real ($6.68 billion) in 2017.  Walmart has posted operating losses in Brazil for seven straight years after the aggressive, decade-long expansion left it with poor locations, inefficient operations, labor troubles and uncompetitive prices.

That format has soared in popularity during Brazil\u2019s recent recession, with stores acting as a wholesaler but also attracting bargain-hunting consumers.  The deal includes a commitment from the buyout firm to invest in the business in coming years, the source said, giving Walmart potential upside from its remaining stake.  \u201cWe plan to invest in the business, work with the Walmart Brazil management team ... to create a more agile and modern company,\u201d Patrice Etlin, a managing partner at Advent International in Brazil said in a statement.  The transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and the retailer expects it to close later this year.  A significant portion of the expected $4.5 billion net loss will be due to foreign currency translation losses, and the final loss could fluctuate significantly due to changes in forex rates up to the closing date, the retailer said.  The retailer expects no material impact to earnings per share in the current fiscal year and a slight positive impact next fiscal year.  Walmart was advised by Goldman Sachs and Advent was advised by Credit Suisse and Euro Latina Finance.

REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  Walmart hired SolarCity to install solar panel systems on at least 244 of its stores. Tesla bought SolarCity in 2016, and Walmart alleges that Tesla did not fix the problems it inherited and was negligent itself.  Tesla has not responded to requests for comment or filed a response to the lawsuit. In Walmart\u2019s August 20 filing, though, the U.S. retailer describes its view of how the fight developed over several years.  The following is a timeline based on Walmart\u2019s lawsuit:  2010-2016  Walmart signs at least 244 contracts for solar systems with the company later bought by Tesla.  August 2012-2017  Tesla solar panels cause fires at Walmart stores in Long Beach, California, Milpitas, California and Lakeside, Colorado. They are not treated as related or systematic problems.  March-May 2018  Walmart stores in Beavercreek, Ohio, Denton, Maryland and Indio, California experience roof fires. Hours before the Indio fire started, Tesla had dispatched personnel to the store; Walmart believes this was to attend to a possible alert.  Walmart and Tesla begin joint inspections of sites lasting until December 2018.  Over the course of Walmart inspections it says it finds hotspots in solar panels\u2019 cracked sheets, compromising electrical insulation. It blames Tesla for failing to properly \u2018hire, train and supervise\u2019 its contractors.  It found Tesla put wires near sharp points and metal edges, used incorrect connectors that built up heat and failed properly to tighten connectors, used plastic tools with insufficient strength and plumbing tools, and improperly grounded systems, and kept poor records. During inspections, Walmart said, Tesla searched for problems with drones that lacked sufficient resolution to find panel \u201chotspots\u201d and put tape on hotspots which exacerbated heat buildup.  By August 2019, Walmart says it received 29 inspection reports from Tesla itself. Those identified 157 \u201caction items\u201d, 48 of which Tesla characterizes as \u201creflecting conditions that rendered the sites unsafe or potentially unsafe\u201d. Issues include improper wiring, poor grounding, broken solar panels with \u2018hotspots\u201d.  May 31-June 1, 2018  Walmart demands Tesla disconnect all of the solar systems, says that agreements materially breached. Tesla responds that it did not breach contract but agrees that it would be \u201cprudent\u201d to disconnect, inspect and fix systems. It subsequently disconnects the systems.  November 29, 2018  Walmart discovers a roof fire from a disconnected solar panel system on a store in Yuba City, California, due to sparking wires after insulation degrated.  Walmart says Tesla did not inform it about a ground fault alert it received between June 5 and Sept. 11, that year, at the same store. Walmart said such issues revealed Tesla\u2019s \u201cutter incompetence or callousness, or both.\u201d  January 2019  Tesla tells Walmart it has significantly enhanced its inspection protocols and begun a renewed series of site inspections aimed at reconnecting solar systems.  July 2019  Walmart concludes that Tesla is not doing what is needed to ensure safety. It sends its second notice of breach of contract and gives it 30 days to fix. Tesla responds to Walmart with what the retailer called \u201cunsubstantiated allegations\u201d, says fires were \u201cregrettable\u201d and that some issues did exist. It says it is willing to satisfy most of the requirements by Walmart.  Walmart concludes its plan is \u201cboilerplate\u201d and falls short.  August 2019  Walmart and Tesla trade letters. On Aug 20, Walmart files lawsuit against Tesla in New York State Supreme Court. It says: \u201cTesla has not reacted with the urgency that one would expect from a company that had installed solar panels that were catching on fire. Far from it: Tesla\u2019s cavalier responses have only confirmed Walmart\u2019s worries that its contractual counterparty is incapable of providing maintenance and inspection services sufficient to ensure the safety of Walmart\u2019s customers, employees, and property\u201d.","33":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, rebounding from huge losses triggered by the coronavirus pandemic and crowning one of the most dramatic recoveries in the index\u2019s history.  Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have made Wall Street flush with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities. Amazon and other high growth technology-related stocks have been viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis.  The S&P record confirms, according to a widely accepted definition, that Wall Street\u2019s most closely followed index entered a bull market after hitting its pandemic low on March 23. It has surged about 55% since then.  That makes the bear market that started in late February the S&P 500\u2019s shortest in its history.  Since the March 23 closing low, the S&P posted the largest gain in a 103-day period in 87 years, according to Refinitiv data.  Doubts about the underlying health of the economy, however, persisted in Tuesday\u2019s session, with lukewarm reactions to bumper results from Home Depot and Walmart limiting gains.  The S&P 500 flirted with all-time highs for several sessions before finally hitting a new record, raising questions about whether this run of gains could last.  \u201cThe S&P 500 has been impressive and has created a lot of wealth, but I am not sure that reflects the overall health of the economy,\u201d said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital.  \u201cThe rally has more to do with asset inflation, which is fueled by all the liquidity and all the continued support in the economy as well as the weakening dollar,\u201d he added.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 66.84 points, or 0.24%, to 27,778.07, the S&P 500 gained 7.79 points, or 0.23%, to 3,389.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.12 points, or 0.73%, to 11,210.84.  Amazon, which rose 4.1%, was the largest gainer in the S&P 500.  Meanwhile Nasdaq clocked its 18th record closing high since early June, when it confirmed its recovery from the coronavirus sell-off. Tuesday\u2019s record was its 34th record close so far this year compared with 31 record closing highs in 2019 and 29 in 2018.  Consumer discretionary rose the most among major S&P sectors on strength in Amazon while technology stocks provided another major support to the benchmark index.

That further added to market optimism.  Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent meeting due on Wednesday may provide some insight into how the central bank sees the recovery playing out. The Fed has cut rates to near zero to bolster business through the pandemic.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The largest U.S. arms retailer also said it would discontinue handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it sells these guns.  Walmart will stop selling short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber after clearing current stock. While this type of ammunition is commonly used in some hunting rifles, they are also used in large capacity clips on military-style weapons, the company said.  Sales of handgun ammunition will also be discontinued, it said.  The retailer, which has been under pressure to change its policies on gun sales, said it took the action following the death of 31 people in mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, one of which took place in a Walmart store.  Just last month, Walmart asked employees at its U.S. stores to take down signs and playable demos of violent video games, but made no changes to its policy on selling firearms.  \u201cAs a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in a letter to Walmart\u2019s associates.  The retailer, however, said it would continue to cater to hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts, selling long barrel deer rifles and shotguns.  The company added that its latest actions would reduce its market share of ammunition from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%.  \u201cWe believe it will likely drift toward the lower end of that range, over time, given the combination of these changes,\u201d McMillon said.

Shippers, retailers and restaurants are experimenting with robots, drones and self-driving cars in a bid to use automation to drive down the high cost of delivering gadgets, groceries and even cups of coffee the \u201clast mile\u201d to consumer doorsteps.  FedEx is teaming up with DEKA Development & Research Corp, whose founder Dean Kamen invented the Segway stand-up scooter and iBot stair-climbing wheelchair, for its project. The delivery company said the robots could become part of its SameDay service that operates in 1,900 cities around the world.  The battery-powered robots look like coolers on wheels. Cameras and software help them detect and avoid obstacles as they roam sidewalks and roadways at a top speed of 10 miles (16 km) per hour.  The project must win approval in test cities, including the shipper\u2019s hometown of Memphis, and the first deliveries will be between FedEx office stores.  On average, more than 60 percent of merchants\u2019 customers live within three miles of a store location. FedEx said it is working with its partners, which also include AutoZone Inc and Target Corp, to determine if autonomous delivery to them is a viable option for fast, cheap deliveries.

FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski\/File Photo  The event marks Walmart\u2019s first effort to grow its nascent advertising business and heralds the retailer\u2019s rising challenge to online ad leaders Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc.  The event, called \u201c5260,\u201d is named after a Walmart store near the retailer\u2019s hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas, which is known for being a test lab for retail innovation, Walmart told Reuters.  It is likely to be attended by hundreds of companies ranging from Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Coca Cola to Mattel, Glaxosmithkline and NBC Universal, multiple sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The country\u2019s top marketing and advertising firms are also likely to be in attendance, the sources, who did not wish to be named, added.  Walmart declined to name the attendees.  Walmart\u2019s pitch will be simple: encourage some of the biggest advertisers to shift their spending to Walmart and away from rivals like Google, Facebook Inc and Amazon. And Walmart says that its massive customer base and data on what shoppers purchase give it a compelling edge.  As consumer behavior has shifted, a growing number of shoppers now begin their product searches on Amazon instead of Google, forcing companies to move their ad budgets to Amazon - a significant change that bodes well for Walmart.  Walmart heralded its ambitions at its shareholder meeting last year when Chief Executive Doug McMillon said, \u201cWe have a tiny ad business. ... It could be bigger.\u201d  Since then, Walmart has bought its website advertising in-house, consolidated ad sales for its stores and website under the Walmart Media Group and acquired a startup called Polymorph Labs to boost the business.  The move could help Walmart shore up sales and margins at a time when revenue is likely to come under stress from tariffs on Chinese imports, and margins are under pressure from its billions of dollars in e-commerce investments.  Stefanie Jay, vice president and general manager of Walmart Media Group, told Reuters the company\u2019s \u201ccore differentiator\u201d is that its ad offerings are informed not just by online purchase behavior and intent but also by data on what people are buying in stores before and after they see an ad, something its online rivals are unable to see.  Eighty-seven percent of shopping in the United States still happens in stores, she said.  Over 300 million customers visit Walmart\u2019s stores every month, and over 300 million shopped with Walmart online as recently as January, drawing in more shoppers than Amazon, Google and Facebook, according to research firms.  \u201cAdvertisers are always looking for that complete picture to better understand where they should spend their ad dollars,\u201d Jay said.  Walmart\u2019s ad offerings will include sponsored search and display ads, which drive awareness and engagement. Jay said Walmart will add video ads this year.  Along with Jay, other senior Walmart executives attending the event include Steve Bratspies, chief merchandising officer; Janey Whiteside, chief customer officer; and Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food for Walmart U.S.  The opportunity for Walmart will be capitalizing on the share Google is losing, consultants said. Although spending on Google search ads continues to grow and is expected to be up 17% this year to $40 billion, Google\u2019s market share is expected to slip to 71% by 2020 as Amazon grows, according to research firm Marketer.  Even so, Walmart faces an uphill task.  Beyond search ads, Amazon offers display ads, TV-like ads in live sports telecasts and targeted ads to people as they travel around the web.  Amazon\u2019s global digital ad revenue is expected to rise by more than 52% in 2019 to reach $14.03 billion, according to eMarketer. Pivotal Research estimates it will reach $38 billion by 2023.

It also allows Walmart to compete with Amazon\u2019s two-hour Prime Now service for shoppers of its loyalty program.  The expanded service allows the Bentonville, Arkansas based retailer to get its store shoppers to transact with the company online, where they spend twice as much.

[nL2N1PI023]  The biggest tax liabilities stem from local retail tariffs in different states, with the highest numbers in the states of Santa Catarina and Pernambuco, where Walmart acquired regional supermarket chains during an ill-fated expansion more than a decade ago, the sources said.  Both states are suing Walmart and at least two former chief executives in the country over the tax bills, according to regional court documents seen by Reuters.  The U.S. retailer is paying lawyers to defend its former executives, one person with knowledge of the matter said.  State treasury officials declined to comment on the tax liabilities, citing tax secrecy laws.  The state taxes ultimately paid could be less than the bidders\u2019 estimates, and other potential buyers may value the liability differently.  Walmart has had operational problems handling its taxes for years in Brazil as it tried to adapt its proprietary management software to deal with the complex calculations of Brazilian retail taxes, according to one of the sources.  The huge tax liability will make it even harder for Walmart to profit on the sale of about 540 stores in Brazil, which generate almost 30 billion reais ($9.4 billion) of revenue in 2016 but have struggled to turn a net profit. (reut.rs\/2DWNOtp)  Given the lack of profitability, at least one of the buyout firms intends to break up Brazil\u2019s Walmart operations after acquiring control, the sources added.  Cash-and-carry division Maxxi and regional supermarket Bompre\u00e7o, with nearly 60 stores in the northeast Brazil, could be sold to local rivals. Operations in the south, where Walmart has around 130 stores operating under four brands, could also be sold as an independent unit, according to sources.  Membership-only retail chain Sam\u2019s Club, one of the few profitable unit in Brazil, could be prepared for an initial public offering, said a source close to one of the bidders.  The other buyout firms may attempt a more traditional turnaround, improving profitability without breaking up current Walmart operations, sources said.","49":"FILE PHOTO: Ellen DeGeneres during a commercial break in taping of the Ellen Show in Burbank, Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 13, 2016.

The partnership is likely to help Walmart recover lost ground against Amazon.com Inc and others in the rapidly growing fashion category.

REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  It also pushed the world\u2019s largest retailer to say it discontinue the sale of fruit-and dessert-flavored electronic nicotine delivery systems.  In March, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) put 15 national retailers, including Walmart, Kroger, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Family Dollar Stores, on notice for allegedly selling tobacco products such as e-cigarettes to minors. In April, Walgreens and Rite Aid said they would raise the minimum age to buy tobacco products to 21.  Last month, U.S. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell said he plans to introduce legislation to raise the minimum age for buying tobacco products, including vaping devices, to 21 from 18.  E-cigarettes have been a bone of contention in the public health community. Some focus on the potential for the products to shift lifelong smokers onto less harmful nicotine products, while others fear they risk drawing a new generation into nicotine addiction.  The increased pressure on retailers comes at a time when states and cities across the United States have moved to raise the legal age for purchasing tobacco in an effort to prevent addiction at young ages. A 2015 study from the National Academy of Medicine found that among adults who became daily smokers, about 90 percent started using cigarettes before they were 19.  The study found that raising the minimum legal age to 21 would prevent 223,000 premature deaths.  So far 12 states have enacted laws to raise the minimum age to 21, including New Jersey and California. Lawmakers in New York state and Maryland have also approved legislation.  Walmart said the FDA had conducted approximately 12,800 compliance checks involving minors at Walmart stores and Sam\u2019s Club locations around the country since 2010. Over that period, Walmart stores passed 93 percent and Sam\u2019s Club cleared 99 percent of those checks.  In 2018, the Walmart stores cleared 94 percent of the 2,400 FDA checks and Sam\u2019s Club passed 100 percent of its 15 checks.  \u201cWhile we have implemented a robust compliance program, we are not satisfied with falling short of our companywide goal of 100 percent compliance,\u201d John Scudder, U.S. chief ethics and compliance officer, said in a letter to the FDA.  \u201cEven a single sale to a minor is one too many,\u201d he said.  In the letter, Walmart also assured the regulator that it would remained focused on improving its compliance rates and any sale-to-minor violation would be dealt with promptly.  Walmart said it had increased disciplinary action against store workers who failed to check ID\u2019s for shoppers who appeared to be under 40. It will also use internal and external data, including FDA data, to implement alerts, controls, training and monitoring to reduce the risk of a sale to an underage customer.  In 2019, the retailer said it would conduct 8,000 secret-shopper visits, and stores and that workers who fail the checks would be required to complete a \u201ccorrective action plan.\u201d  \u201cGoing forward ... a cashier who fails a secret-shopper check will be subjected to disciplinary action, up to and including termination,\u201d Scudder said in the letter.","52":"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc posted a bigger-than-expected increase in quarterly same-store sales on Tuesday as a 79% surge in its online business powered overall rises in spending on electronics, apparel and groceries.

The appeal will likely be heard later this month at a time when both Amazon and Flipkart are battling slowing sales and logistical challenges during India\u2019s lockdown to tackle the coronavirus which has resulted in supply chain disruptions.  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in January ordered an investigation into business practices of the two e-commerce giants, but the High Court in Karnataka state put it on hold after Amazon argued the CCI did not have sufficient evidence to order it.

FILE PHOTO: Conveyors are seen at a Walmart Stores Inc distribution centers in Bentonville, Arkansas June 6, 2013. REUTERS\/Rick Wilking\/File Photo  On April 25, Amazon said it plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club Prime in just one day and expects to spend $800 million toward the shipping goal in the second quarter alone.  Walmart\u2019s offer applies to fewer products. As many as 220,000 items, which are the most frequently purchased, ranging from laundry detergent to toys and electronics will qualify for one-day shipping. The orders have to be worth at least $35 to qualify.  The Walmart deal will be available to online shoppers in Phoenix and Las Vegas and then expand to Southern California in the coming days, the head of its U.S. ecommerce service, Marc Lore, told Reuters in an interview.  The service will be rolled out gradually, with a plan to reach approximately 75% of the U.S. population this year, which includes 40 of the top 50 U.S. metro areas, Lore said.  One-day shipping marks the latest salvo in a fight between two retailers that have consistently tried to outdo each other in everything from online order delivery to grabbing a bigger share of the online grocery market.  Walmart started offering same-day pickup in its stores in 2011 and caught up with Amazon\u2019s two-day free shipping two years ago by offering it without a membership fee. It has made progress in closing the gap with its e-commerce rival by rolling out services such as curbside grocery pickup and same-day grocery delivery - options that have quickly become popular with shoppers.  Amazon, on the other hand, has hastened to reproduce the assets of brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart and has a mixed record with those projects. It is now racing to open shops with top-selling items ranging from books to cell phones; rolling out same-day curbside grocery pickup and gearing up to accept returns at all U.S. Kohls Corp department stores.  \u201cWe have been working on this since I have gotten here...we have been building out the infrastructure for the last few years to support this,\u201d said Lore, who joined the retailer in 2016 when it acquired his company, Jet.com.  The vast majority of the order volume for such a service comes from the \u201cfirst couple of hundred thousand\u201d products, he said.  The move will cost Walmart less as orders will be delivered from warehouses closer to the customer and arrive in a single box instead of multiple packages, Lore said.  \u201cIt is counter-intuitive... but the way we have structured our network, we will see improved profitability as a result of lower shipping cost,\u201d he said.  Walmart sends out boxes from multiple warehouses around the country under its two-day shipping program, but with one-day shipping, it is stocking inventory in the closest single warehouse to the shopper, Lore said.  In a note on Monday, investment bank UBS anticipated a move to one-day shipping from brick-and-mortar retailers and estimated the price tag.  \u201cThe bottom line is that these costs are pretty manageable,\u201d the note says.  Walmart will put down $215 million of incremental investment. The U.S. business could see a drag on operating margins of 5 basis points on an annualized basis and 3 basis points for Walmart overall over a similar period if they follow Amazon\u2019s one-day shipping offer, the note says.  Lore told Reuters the math in the note was not accurate.  He also said the recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports will not hurt demand as most are best-sellers and popular items that shoppers will keep buying even if prices rise.","65":"FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018.

But it is significant as U.S.-China trade tensions escalate and comes before a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the June 28-29 G20 summit in Osaka, Japan. Trump has said he wants to meet Xi there and will decide on whether to extend tariffs to almost all Chinese imports after that.  With less than three weeks to go before talks between Chinese and U.S. leaders, expectations for progress toward ending the trade war are low. Sources have told Reuters there has been little preparation for a meeting even as the health of the world economy is at stake.  \u201cWe remain concerned about the escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs,\u201d the new letter sent on Thursday said. \u201cBroadly applied tariffs are not an effective tool to change China\u2019s unfair trade practices.

Walmart, the largest U.S. private sector employer and the world\u2019s largest retailer, has said tariffs will increase prices for U.S. consumers.  \u201cTrade overall has been good for Americans, good for consumers ... and I realize it gets criticized at times,\u201d Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said last week. He urged the Trump administration focus on how trade helps a broad number of people in the country and \u201cnot just those it harms.\u201d  Additional 25% tariffs on $300 billion in imports, on top of those already levied, would wipe out more than 2 million U.S. jobs, the letter said, citing estimates from international consultancy the Trade Partnership.

The logo of Flipkart is seen on the company's office in Bengaluru, India, May 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa  Minority investors holding 60 percent of Flipkart's shares \"acting together, may require Flipkart to effect an initial public offering\" (IPO) four years after the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in a May 11 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The IPO should be done at no less a valuation than that at which Walmart invested in the Indian e-commerce firm, the filing said. Walmart announced earlier this week that it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart in what is the U.S. retail giant's largest-ever deal and a move to take on arch rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in a key growth market. The investment implies a valuation of nearly $21 billion for Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart.  Minority shareholders after the deal include co-founder Binny Bansal, China's Tencent Holdings 0700.HK, U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.  The deal now awaits clearance from India\u2019s anti-trust regulator and is expected to close later this year.  As part of the deal, Walmart will initially appoint five directors to Flipkart\u2019s board, two directors will be named by minority shareholders while Bansal will take one board seat, according to the filing.  Walmart said it may, in future, appoint a sixth board member with the approval of the majority of the Flipkart directors.  It also said it could appoint or replace Flipkart\u2019s chief executive and other key executives of group companies in consultation with Bansal and the board.  Walmart or its units could ask Flipkart to issue new ordinary shares of up to $3 billion before the close of the \u201ctransactions and on or before the first anniversary of the closing\u201d, it said.  Reuters previously reported that Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O was in talks to invest about $3 billion for a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart.  That deal could be sealed before the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction or immediately after, a source told Reuters, declining to be named as the talks are private.  Walmart also said no party would be liable to pay a termination fee if a share issuance or purchase agreement with Flipkart were terminated.  The Economic Times newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, which owns a roughly 20 percent stake in Flipkart, was rethinking its exit due to tax liabilities and because it saw further value in Flipkart.  SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has said that their investment in Flipkart had grown to almost $4 billion. That growth came just 9 months after SoftBank used its Vision Fund to invest about $2.5 billion in Flipkart.  A spokeswoman for SoftBank in India declined comment.  Former Amazon employees Sachin and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 and, just like Amazon, began by selling books.","71":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued Walmart Inc on Tuesday, accusing the world\u2019s biggest retailer of fueling the opioid crisis in the United States, ignoring warning signs from its pharmacists and filling thousands of invalid prescriptions.  FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  In a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Delaware, the government said Walmart failed to take its gatekeeping duties as a pharmacy seriously, allegations the company rejected.  Walmart, whose shares closed down 1.2% following the news, said in a statement that the \u201cJustice Department\u2019s investigation is tainted by historical ethics violations, and this lawsuit invents a legal theory that unlawfully forces pharmacists to come between patients and their doctors, and is riddled with factual inaccuracies.\u201d  Walmart created a system that turned its 5,000 in-store pharmacies into a supplier of highly addictive painkillers, dating as early as June 2013, the lawsuit said.  The lawsuit marked one of the most significant actions the Justice Department has taken in response to the epidemic targeting companies accused of contributing to it.  Last month, prosecutors secured a guilty plea from Purdue related to its sales of opioids and it previously prosecuted multiple executives at the opioid maker Insys Therapeutics accused of bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive drug.  Insys filed for bankruptcy last year after striking a deal with the government in which a subsidiary pled guilty to fraud charges.  The three largest drug distributors - McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health - along with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson are in talks with state attorneys general to resolve the opioid lawsuits for a combined $26 billion.  OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and the drugmaker Mallinckrodt have filed for bankruptcy protection as part of their own multibillion dollar proposals to resolve the lawsuits.  The companies have denied the underlying allegations.  Walmart\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d actions helped \u201cfuel a national crisis\u201d and had \u201cdisastrous consequences,\u201d Jeffrey Bossert Clark, the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, said at a press briefing.  Asked if the government was planning on bringing criminal charges, Clark said \u201cyou should not draw any inferences about any criminal matters\u201d from the civil filing.  Walmart called the lawsuit a \u201ctransparent attempt to shift blame from the (Drug Enforcement Administration) well-documented failures in keeping bad doctors from prescribing opioids in the first place.\u201d  Acting DEA Administrator Timothy Shea said in a statement \u201cwhen pharmacies routinely fill illegitimate prescriptions, we will hold accountable anyone responsible, including Walmart. Too many lives have been lost because of oversight failures and those entrusted with responsibility turning a blind eye.\u201d  More than 3,000 lawsuits have been filed nationally by states, counties and municipalities seeking to hold drug manufacturers and distributors responsible for fueling an opioid addiction epidemic that according to U.S. government data resulted in 450,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018.  According to the lawsuit, Walmart \u201cunlawfully filled thousands upon thousands of invalid controlled-substance prescriptions.\u201d The lawsuit said that \u201cfor years, Walmart kept in place a system that it knew was failing to adequately detect and report suspicious orders.\u201d  The government accused Walmart of violating the Controlled Substances Act. If found liable, it could face civil penalties of up to $67,627 for each unlawful prescription filled and $15,691 for each suspicious order not reported.  Walmart said on Tuesday that \u201cby demanding pharmacists and pharmacies second-guess doctors, the Justice Department is putting pharmacists and pharmacies between a rock and a hard place with state health regulators who say they are already going too far in refusing to fill opioid prescriptions.\u201d  In October, Walmart filed a lawsuit in Texas against the federal government seeking clarity on the roles and legal responsibilities of pharmacists and pharmacies in filling opioid prescriptions.","72":"NEW YORK\/DALLAS\/SAN FRANCISCO\/LONDON\/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.

Snap on Tuesday reported a slight second-quarter miss in daily active user growth, which increased by 17% to 238 million compared to the same period last year. Shares dropped some 7% in early trading Wednesday after the disappearing-message app said the jump in users due to the coronavirus-induced lockdowns disappeared faster than expected.  Snapchat\u2019s owner may have been hurt by the surge in popularity of viral video app TikTok, but Evan Spiegel\u2019s firm can also take advantage of its rival\u2019s headaches. The U.S. government sees the ByteDance-owned service as a national-security risk and wants to ban it.  Snap has already gained from the ad boycott at Facebook, which helped spur a 17% jump in Snap\u2019s revenue. Alluding to his bigger competitor\u2019s troubles, Spiegel said the growing focus on brand safety and privacy puts Snap in a unique position. He could say the same about TikTok. Oh snap! (By Gina Chon)  LONG WINTER. European airlines are flying into gloomier trading conditions. That was the message from the chief executives who met virtually on Wednesday, as they pressed to extend a waiver on rules governing landing slots. In normal times, carriers are required to use 80% of their slots or forfeit these highly valued assets. European regulators eased the rules during lockdown, but only until October.  Executives including Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith and Kenton Jarvis, CEO of TUI Aviation, say returning closer to normality will take longer. Airlines typically lose money in the winter anyway, but lockdown and fears of catching Covid-19 in the skies have dampened demand further. The airlines, many of which have raised capital or sought government support, have talked of an eventual recovery in passenger numbers. Smith has reassured investors he is ramping up flight frequencies. First, however, carriers need to get through a harsh winter. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME IMPROVEMENT. The end of lockdown has done little to dampen the DIY boom. Consumers who were confined at home tackled home repairs and gardening jobs with such enthusiasm that Kingfisher, the 5 billion pound operator of B&Q in the United Kingdom and Castorama in France, on Wednesday released an unscheduled trading update. Sales soared 25% in June from a year earlier, having increased 15% in May. Online sales, however, were the clear winner as demand for items that can be delivered, such as wallpaper, fences and plants, leapt 225%.  Running a DIY retailer is also getting cheaper. Although Kingfisher had to pay for protective equipment for staff, including barriers and hand sanitiser, its advertising and marketing budget fell as customers needed little encouragement to enter their stores. Kingfisher\u2019s share price rose nearly 10% on Wednesday. The longer consumers\u2019 desire to upgrade and refurbish persists, the happier investors will be. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME SICK. Hong Kong is shutting down once again. The financial hub has recorded a spike in Covid-19 cases since July 13, logging over 50 cases daily and a high of 108. Foreign students were blamed for a second wave in March, and now fingers are being pointed at flight crews, sailors and senior executives exempted from quarantine.  The local government has defended the exceptions. Financial services, trade and logistics account for a total of two-fifths of Hong Kong\u2019s economy, and they can\u2019t work well, or at all, unless their staff can move across borders. So authorities are hesitant to impose stricter measures, perhaps with an eye on fellow hub Singapore, which reported a 41% fall in GDP after its own lockdown. But of course a third major outbreak will cancel the benefits of selective relaxation. It is a harrowing warning for what\u2019s ahead of the curve for the many metropolises still trying to flatten it. (By Jamie Lo)  MIND THE GAP. London\u2019s Central Line emptied out in March, as did the coffers of the tube\u2019s parent organisation. Transport for London, chaired by Mayor Sadiq Khan, needed a 1.6 billion pound government bailout back in May. That prompted parallel funding reviews to be launched this week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government and Khan.  There\u2019s a clear opportunity to improve. TfL is one of the few major transport networks in Europe that receives no funding for its operations from the central government. If fares dip, and it can\u2019t borrow to cover the gap, bailouts are likely. It would be simpler for the state to formalise a financial backstop to allow investment to be maintained and ensure trains are clean post-pandemic. Fares may be lower for some time given emptier trains and buses. The state, which has the lowest cost of funding, is the best placed to pick up the bill.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The efforts are key to Walmart\u2019s aggressive plan to achieve a more than tenfold increase in its advertising business within five years, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Reuters previously reported Walmart\u2019s annual advertising revenue was expected to be nearly $1 billion in 2020.  The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, with nearly 5,000 stores nationwide, has set a goal to become one of the top 10 advertising platforms in the United States within the next five years, a \u201cslightly conservative,\u201d goal, the source said.  Walmart has expanded its advertising business after years of sputtering progress, even as a deal to buy a 7.5% stake in video-sharing app TikTok remains in limbo.  Walmart refocused its strategy starting in early 2019, cutting ties with its external advertising partner and taking the business in-house as Walmart Media Group. Now, it will be named Walmart Connect, the company said.  \u201cThis is about us really digging in and pivoting the business from one which was really focused on search and display with our biggest suppliers,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief customer officer, Janey Whiteside, told Reuters. \u201cWe want to continue to do that, leverage our physical properties, and find ways to help advertisers make better use of their dollars.\u201d  Walmart said it will build a new advertising platform in partnership with ad technology company Trade Desk Inc. It will allow brands to use Walmart\u2019s ample shopper data to make ads more effective, even on websites and apps Walmart does not own.  Brands will be able to target ads to audiences using Walmart\u2019s data on shopping behavior across categories and brands. Advertisers can then monitor sales inside Walmart stores in real time and adjust ad campaigns as needed, Whiteside said.  Accurately measuring whether an ad led to a purchase has been a long-term technological challenge. Walmart is betting that allowing brands to use its data on ads across streaming video or smart TVs will draw in more ad dollars.  The retailer said it will take advantage of its brick-and-mortar stores to compete with online retailer Amazon, and will sell ads on over 170,000 screens inside more than 4,500 U.S. stores, including on TVs and screens of self-checkout kiosks.  \u201cWe have this unparalleled source of data that we can bring to bear,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201cWho else can actually tell you if a customer saw something online and then a week later, physically bought it in the store?\u201d  Mark Boidman, managing director and head of media and tech services at boutique investment bank PJ Solomon, also said Walmart\u2019s plans to grant ad buyers more marketing options in-store would be an advantage.  \u201cThe ability to use on-premise media, and in particular digital signage and digital out-of-home media, allows brands and retailers to be reactive and provide contextually relevant content and advertising,\u201d said Boidman. \u201cThink coffee promotions in the morning or marketing hot chocolate or snow shovels ahead of a big snow storm.\u201d","76":"FILE PHOTO: Small toy figures are seen in front of a Tiktok logo in this illustration taken, September 9, 2020.

FILE PHOTO: A Walmart sign is pictured at one of their stores in Mexico City, Mexico March 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido\/File Photo  Some 35,000 elderly Mexicans, most between 60 and 74 years old, pack groceries at Walmart stores and other chains through a government-backed volunteer program, earning just tips.  The program, already criticized by labor activists, is under renewed scrutiny as fears about coronavirus have prompted many Mexicans to self-isolate and work from home.  On Friday afternoon, Walmart de Mexico said it would suspend the program, following a large online petition and a Reuters story about mounting pressure on the retailer, which is the largest in Mexico.  \u201cTaking into account that elderly people are an especially vulnerable group, we\u2019ve decided to go without the presence of the elderly people who provide valuable support as volunteer grocery baggers,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Walmart de Mexico also said it would offer the workers \u201ceconomic support,\u201d but did not provide details.  The company previously said it would keep bag packers in its stores in line with recommendations from the government\u2019s National Institute for Elderly People (INAPAM), which oversees the program and had been reluctant to adopt measures that would damage workers\u2019 incomes.  Mexican grocery chain Soriana stopped using the elderly volunteers on Friday and said it would ask shoppers to leave donations for the volunteers, which the company would match.  People 65 and older account for eight out of every 10 deaths from coronavirus in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In China, where the virus first took hold, about 80% of deaths have been among people 60 and older, said the CDC, citing Chinese data.  A petition on Change.org demanding the senior workers in Mexico be allowed home with compensation had gathered more than 83,000 signatures by Friday afternoon, less than a week after going online.  At Superama, one of Walmart\u2019s stores, the company had put hand sanitizer at cashiers, supplied cleaning wipes for checkout counters, urged frequent hand-washing and checks the temperatures of grocery baggers, several workers told Reuters earlier this week.  Walmart also recommended surgical masks, said Guillermo Valdez, 65, who packs groceries at a Superama in Mexico City\u2019s upscale Polanco neighborhood, but added none were available.  Even so, Valdez, helping collect shopping carts outside the store, said he had few worries.  \u201cI\u2019m not scared of death. When it comes, it comes,\u201d he said.  Mexico, with 164 coronavirus cases and one death, has so far fared better than countries such as China and Italy grappling with thousands of deaths. However, critics question President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s resistance to travel bans or work shutdowns.  His toughest measures have been canceling large events and suspending classes as of next week.  Before heading inside to pack more bags, Valdez joked that a traditional Mexican remedy would keep the virus at bay.  \u201cI protect myself with alcohol.

The end of the Walmart partnerships, which has not been previously reported and was confirmed by Walmart and Uber, undercuts a vision the ride-hailing companies laid out: a service that can efficiently deliver anything on-demand, including people and cargo, at the touch of a smartphone app.  \u201cIt is incredibly hard to deliver people and packages together,\u201d said a source with a delivery company that works with Walmart and has direct knowledge of the matter. \u201cThey are two completely different business models.\u201d  The decision marks an abrupt end to a business relationship that Walmart and Uber announced with much fanfare less than two years ago. At Walmart's shareholders meeting in June 2016, CEO Doug McMillon touted the company's investments in technology and spoke about the partnerships in front of a cheering crowd of 14,000 employees. goo.gl\/xJdN2e  Soon after, Uber\u2019s grocery delivery service was launched and expanded to four markets. As recently as March, just before Uber ended the arrangement, Walmart said Uber would be a partner in its plans to deliver groceries to more than 40 percent of the country.  \u201cThere was clearly some lack of communication there,\u201d said one of the sources with knowledge of the partnerships ending.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman confirmed the end of the tie-ups when asked by Reuters, but did not detail the reasons behind the decision. She said Walmart will use other delivery service providers in the four markets where it had previously used Uber.  \u201cCustomers shouldn\u2019t notice any difference as the transition takes place,\u201d said Blakeman, who added that the partnership with Lyft never expanded beyond the initial test market of Denver.  Blakeman said the end of the partnerships will not impact Walmart\u2019s plans to scale grocery delivery as they are not tied to any single provider.  Uber put a stop to the grocery partnership when it informed Walmart in March that it would cease delivery operations on June 30, Uber spokeswoman Ellen Cohn told Reuters. The retailer was Uber\u2019s largest partner for its \u2018Rush\u2019 service, which delivered groceries as well as clothes, flowers and other goods.  Uber will shutter the entire Rush program at the end of next month.  FILE PHOTO: A customer pushes a shopping cart at a Walmart store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. November 23, 2016. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski\/File Photo  \u201cWe are coordinating with Walmart to make this change as seamless as possible,\u201d Cohn said.  Lyft declined comment and deferred to Walmart on the issue.  For Walmart, which is the country\u2019s largest grocer and gets 56 percent revenue from groceries, the partnerships offered a fast solution to expand its online grocery offerings and improve overall revenue from internet shoppers.  For example, Walmart delivers groceries in China through a partnership with ecommerce company JD.com Inc JD.O, and in Japan through an alliance with Rakuten.  But the retailer was recently punished for its fourth-quarter online sales performance, which investors say is key to the company\u2019s future.  LAST-MILE COMPETITION  Last-mile delivery of packages is an intensely competitive business, with companies ranging from Amazon to United Parcel Services Inc UPS.N, FedEx Corp FDX.N and the U.S. Postal service, as well as startups like Instacart and Deliv, vying for a share.  Since the dot-com boom, companies have tried to crack the business model for online grocery delivery. The rush to solve the technological and logistical challenges has gotten even more frenzied since Amazon acquired high-end grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, a deal that has intensified competition in the sector.  Former Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick touted the idea of carrying a person in the backseat and a bag of groceries in the trunk as the ultimate cash-generating transportation service in a smart-phone era.  The delivery service marked the first time Uber publicly committed to a business outside of ride-hailing that was supposed to be meaningful to its bottom line and support its stratospheric valuation, although the private company never offered exact dollar projections.  But startup investors and experts in on-demand delivery say there is a much different set of logistical and economic challenges for moving around cargo than people, requiring a single company to be proficient in two distinct business models.  Uber\u2019s Cohn said Rush was \u201can experiment\u201d and the company has turned its focus and resources to UberEats, a restaurant delivery service that in the fourth quarter last year generated $1.1 billion, or about 10 percent of Uber\u2019s overall revenue.  NEW PARTNERS  Walmart has added startups Deliv, Postmates and DoorDash to its list of delivery partners. These companies have the singular business of delivering goods, not people, and drivers have more experience safely transporting perishables.  It remains unclear if these startups will step in and replace Uber in the various markets they served.  A particular challenge for companies such as Postmates, however, will be offering rush delivery in suburban and rural areas, where most Walmart stores are located. Such startups have been most successful in urban centers, where there is a high density of customers and couriers can use bicycles or walk to deliver multiple packages in one trip.  \u201cDensity has been a challenge historically for all types of delivery companies, all the way back to the Pony Express,\u201d said Ben Narasin, a partner at venture capitalist firm NEA who has been critical of the on-demand delivery business model. \u201cThe reality is that the far-away drives will likely be subsidized.\u201d","86":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of a Walmart Superstore is seen during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Rosemead, California, U.S., June 11, 2020.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The project is the latest to grow out of Ford\u2019s broader effort to develop businesses that could use automated delivery vehicles. Ford was working with San Francisco-based Postmates already to develop delivery services that could employ automated vehicles.  The Walmart pilot, which will take place in the Miami area, initially will use human-driven vehicles operated to simulate how a self-driving vehicle would behave, Ford said. Ford has said it expects to launch commercial production of automated vehicles by 2021.  Ford and its partners are using Miami as a testing ground for automated delivery service ideas and automated vehicle technology.  The new pilot project will offer customers delivery by Postmates of goods ordered at Walmart stores. Brian Wolf, an executive of Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicle unit, wrote in a blog post that the companies will work over the next \u201ccouple of months\u201d to figure out what goods can be delivered successfully, especially perishable groceries.  \u201cBefore self-driving cars can go mainstream, we must get a better sense of how people want to interact with them,\u201d Tom Ward, Walmart senior vice president for digital operations, said in a statement on Thursday.  That could require new designs or equipment for vehicles, Wolf wrote. Among the challenges Ford has said it is working on is designing on-board storage systems that are easy for customers to open to retrieve a pizza or a package.  Postmates, according to its website, operates in 385 U.S. cities, as well as Mexico. It offers delivery from brick-and-mortar restaurants and stores.  Walmart is competing with online retailer Amazon.com AMZN.O and other rivals to cut the cost of delivering goods over what industry executives call \u201cthe last mile\u201d to customers who order online.  Replacing human delivery van drivers with robotic systems could reduce last-mile delivery costs. But the technology is still expensive, and the industry is still waiting for regulations that could help protect automated vehicle owners or manufacturers from liability claims.  Ford has emphasized commercial uses of autonomous vehicle technology, such as goods delivery, in contrast to rival General Motors Co GM.N, which is working to build a robot taxi service at its GM Cruise unit.  Ford is in discussions with German automaker Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE about a possible investment in its self-driving vehicle unit, people familiar with the situation said. No deal has been announced.  In July, Ford said it would create a new business unit, Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, to house its self-driving vehicle operations. The automaker said it would invest a total of $4 billion in the unit through 2023.","90":"(Repeats to wider audience)  WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - A petition started by a junior Walmart Inc worker in California to protest the retailer\u2019s sale of firearms, following two mass shootings over the weekend left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio, has gathered more than 45,000 signatures.  Thomas Marshall, a 23-year-old category manager in San Bruno began his protest by emailing fellow employees and asking them to call in sick on Tuesday, leave work early on Wednesday, and to sign a Change.org petition.  The petition here, which is open to the public, is steadily approaching its goal of 50,000 signatures.  \u201cIn light of these recent tragedies -- a mere snapshot of the gun violence epidemic plaguing the United States -- and in response to Corporate\u2019s inaction, we as employees are organizing several days of action, to protest Walmart\u2019s profit from the sale of firearms and ammunition,\u201d the petition says.  Marshall told Reuters he and other organizers would send the petition to the company\u2019s Chief Executive Doug McMillon after it reaches its target.  Marshall said he was shut out of the company\u2019s email and messaging networks temporarily earlier this week after he started the protest, but that he has since been granted access.  Employees in San Bruno and in Portland, Oregon had walked out on Wednesday in protest of the company\u2019s policy of selling firearms, Marshall said, adding that some Walmart employees in New York also held a minute of silence that day.  Walmart said 40 employees in San Bruno protested by walking out but did not confirm the other details.  \u201cA lot more employees have been reaching out to me to express their support but a majority of those employees are very afraid of retaliation from the company,\u201d he said.  NO CHANGE IN GUN SALE POLICY  Earlier this week, Walmart told Reuters there had been no change in its policy on gun sales after the recent mass shootings, one of which took place in a Walmart store.  Years of public pressure led Walmart, the largest U.S arms retailer, to end assault-rifle sales in 2015 and to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21 in 2018.  Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether.  Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said on Thursday the company continued to feel there were more appropriate ways for employees to engage with the retailer, including through discussions with top leadership.  He said the company\u2019s policy on selling firearms had not changed.  \u201cWe have worked very hard to be a responsible firearms retailer...Walmart does more in the area of background checks than what the federal law requires,\u201d Hargrove added.  The retailer\u2019s Chief Executive Doug McMillon sent a message to employees on social media late on Tuesday, assuring them the company was listening to their concerns.  \u201cWe will be thoughtful and deliberate in our responses, and we will act in a way that reflects the best values and ideals of our company,\u201d McMillon said.

The U.S.-only promotion, effective from Nov. 5, waives the $25 minimum that customers outside Amazon\u2019s loyalty club Prime must hit for free shipping. The deal lasts until Amazon can no longer promise items in time for Christmas with free delivery, which typically takes five to eight business days.  The announcement could help Amazon sustain its rapid sales growth. Shares of the world\u2019s largest online retailer were hammered last month after it forecast the slowest rise in revenue at least since the start of 2016. The current quarter typically is Amazon\u2019s biggest.  Amazon cut its order minimum for free shipping to $25 from $35 indefinitely in May 2017.  Monday\u2019s news will pile pressure on Walmart and Target Corp , which in recent years have chipped away at Amazon\u2019s lead with their own offers of free two-day shipping. While Walmart has maintained its $35 order threshold this holiday, Target has scrapped its minimum until Dec. 22.  Just over half of all U.S. households have a Prime subscription, analysts estimate. Prime remains the cornerstone of Amazon\u2019s business because shoppers buy more from the retailer once they pay $119 for the year-long membership. Perks include same-day shipping and video streaming.  Amazon is now courting those outside the club, hoping its brand and wider selection will set it apart. Free shipping can apply to hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, versus hundreds of thousands on Target. Target promises to deliver the items faster, however.  It was unclear how free delivery on small-ticket items would impact net income for Amazon, which last month touted improvements in efficiency.  According to the Seattle company\u2019s latest annual filing, shipping costs nearly doubled from 2015 to 2017, reaching $21.7 billion.

As was the case in 2017, no dividend was paid to Walmart.  Under Chief Executive Roger Burnley, Asda is following a strategy focused on lower prices to narrow the gap with the discounters, a step-up in innovation in own-brand products, and better store environments and product availability, along with improvements in its e-commerce operations and use of technology.  Burnley told Reuters in May the timescale for a possible flotation was two to three years.  Last month Asda reported a small rise in underlying sales for the second quarter of its 2019 year.

CVS Health Corp earlier this week said it would stop the sale of the medicines, while pharmacy chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Rite Aid Corp have also moved to remove the drugs off their shelves.  Some of the heartburn drugs containing the key ingredient ranitidine were found to have traces of the impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), leading to Novartis AG halting global distribution of its versions of the popular drug commonly known as Zantac.  U.S. and European health regulators said last month they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine, while Canada requested makers of the drug to halt distribution as it gathers more information.

The world\u2019s largest retailer is known for its sprawling stores, a factor that could have worked against it as shoppers migrate online. But Walmart is also the top U.S. grocer, providing a lure for customers to visit stores, where they may also make other impulse buys.  Walmart has also overhauled its website and worked to use physical locations as distribution points for online orders of groceries and other goods, helping retain buyers who increasingly expect quick, cheap shipping.  Consumers spent more on categories like grocery, apparel and seasonal merchandise in the second quarter, helping sales rebound after a slow start in April. Walmart has recorded four straight years of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retailer.  \u201cWe saw strong performance in fresh food,\u201d U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran said on an earnings conference call, praising sales in produce, meat and bakery. Grocery sales rose the most in nine years.  Walmart benefited from improved weather in May, the first month of the quarter, seeing the biggest quarterly gain in customer traffic in more than six years, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters.  Rising wages, lower unemployment and tax cuts that have put more money in U.S. consumers\u2019 pockets this year also helped.  \u201c(This) is a reflection of Walmart\u2019s various in-store and online initiatives, and likely an indication of solid market share gains, and an overall healthy consumer backdrop,\u201d Credit Suisse analysts said in a note.  Walmart\u2019s U.S. e-commerce growth ticked higher than previous quarters, driven by a website redesign and continued expansion of online grocery offerings.  A Walmart logo is displayed above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., August 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Sales growth has come at some cost, however, with the company citing continued margin pressures driven by cutting prices, higher freight costs due to a shortage of truck drivers and e-commerce investments.  Walmart\u2019s shares were up 10 percent at $99.08. The company\u2019s stock had fallen around 9 percent since the start of the year.  STRONG ONLINE SALES  Walmart raised its sales and earnings outlook for the full year, excluding any impact from its acquisition of Indian e-commerce company Flipkart, which it is still in the process of closing.  E-commerce sales grew 40 percent in the quarter, up from 33 percent growth in the previous period, and the retailer said U.S. online sales are on track to rise 40 percent for the full year.  Walmart now offers curbside pickup of online grocery orders in 1,800 U.S. stores, and the service is bringing in new customers, Biggs said.  A sharp online sales slowdown during the crucial holiday months had spooked investors, who worried the retailer would not be able to keep pace with Amazon.  Cowen & Co estimates that 86 percent of Walmart shoppers also shop on Amazon.  Still, e-commerce losses could be higher this year than last year as it continues to invest in the business, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce chief Marc Lore said on the call.  Gross margins fell for the fifth consecutive quarter and were down 17 basis points, the company said.  OVERSEAS SALES JUMP  International sales were up 3.1 percent at $29.2 billion on a constant currency basis, helped by strong comparable sales in Mexico, Britain, Canada and China.  Separately, Asda, Walmart's British supermarket arm, reported a 2.6 percent rise in quarterly sales on Thursday, ahead of an expected takeover by bigger rival Sainsbury's SBRY.L.  Walmart sold a majority stake in ASDA to Sainbury\u2019s in April.  In June, Walmart sold an 80 percent stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International. It paid $16 billion for a majority stake in Flipkart.  The retailer also reached agreements to sell its banking operations in Walmart Canada and Walmart Chile.  Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 4.5 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, higher than analyst forecasts of 2.38 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Excluding one-time items such as a loss related to the sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, Walmart earned $1.29 per share, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.22 per share.  Total revenue increased 3.8 percent to $128 billion, beating estimates of $125.97 billion.  For the full year, Walmart expects to earn between $4.90 and $5.05 per share, up from a range of $4.75 to $5 a share. The retailer said same-store sales in the United States should rise about 3 percent in fiscal 2019, up from a prior target of at least 2 percent.","104":"FILE PHOTO: Shoppers walk from a Walmart store in Mexico City, August 15, 2012.

The acquisition should add to Landec\u2019s earnings beginning in fiscal year 2020, the company said in a statement.

Costco, which sells everything from personal computers to groceries, has been adding more organic and fresh food products as it takes on Walmart's WMT.N Sam's Club, which after shutting some stores last year has amped up competition.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a little bit more margin pressure as there\u2019s been a little bit more retail competitive pressure out there, not only from supermarkets but Sam\u2019s as well,\u201d Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said, referring to its grocery business.  Costco also raised hourly minimum wages for about 130,000 store employees by $1 to between $14 and $14.50 in June, as it becomes harder to find workers in a tight job market.

Walmart has been looking to prop up Vudu\u2019s monthly viewership that remains well below that of competitors like Netflix Inc and Hulu LLC, which is controlled by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.  Media outlets had reported the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company was looking to launch a subscription streaming video service to rival that of Netflix and make a foray into producing TV shows to attract customers.  Walmart is not planning such a move, company sources have told Reuters. The retailer continues, however, to look for options to boost its video-on-demand business and offer programs that target customers who live outside of big cities.  Walmart and MGM will make the announcement at the NewFronts conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday. It will include the name of the first production under the partnership, which Walmart will license from MGM.  \u201cUnder this partnership, MGM will create exclusive content based on their extensive library of iconic IP (intellectual property), and that content will premiere exclusively on the Vudu platform,\u201d Walmart spokesman Justin Rushing told Reuters.  The focus will be on family-friendly content that Walmart customers prefer, Rushing said.  The financial deals of the deal were not disclosed.  Licensing content is a cost-effective strategy at a time when producing original content has become a costly venture. As of July, Netflix said it was spending $8 billion a year on original and acquired content. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s programming budget for Prime Video was more than $4 billion, while U.S. broadcaster HBO, owned by AT&T Inc, said it would spend $2.7 billion this year.  Walmart acquired Vudu in 2010 to safeguard against declining in-store sales of DVDs. Walmart bet that customers would continue to buy and rent movies and move their titles to a digital library, which Vudu would create and maintain for viewers.  But the video site has not posed a significant challenge to rivals that dominate the segment even though it is pre-loaded or can be downloaded to millions of smart televisions and video-game consoles.  Vudu offers 150,000 titles to buy or rent, while its free, ad-supported streaming service, called Movies On Us, includes 5,000 movies and TV shows.  There are currently more than 200 video services that bypass cable providers and stream content directly to a TV, laptop, phone or game console. That is up from 68 five years ago, according to market researcher Parks Associates.

Earlier this year, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, said they would form a company aimed at cutting healthcare costs for their U.S. employees.  \u201cThe risks (for Walmart) of becoming entangled in the complex U.S. healthcare industry are considerable, especially at a time when Walmart is grappling with the competitive challenges of a rapidly shifting retail market,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note.  \u201cThe hammering out of any agreement, which would be Walmart\u2019s largest ever corporate deal, would, of itself, be an enormous distraction,\u201d Saunders added.  Walmart currently has a co-branded Medicare drug plan with Humana that steers patients to Walmart stores. The partnership offers a prescription drug plan that can save up to 20 percent in drug costs for customers.  Closer ties between the two companies could allow Walmart to tap into Humana\u2019s patient population, expanding low-level medical services in its pharmacies to avoid ER visits. They could allow it to better manage prescription drug use though access to medical records.  Humana\u2019s biggest business is managing Medicare Advantage health plans for older and disabled people, a heavily regulated business that Walmart would have to take on in an acquisition.  Memberships in retail Medicare Advantage plans - where individuals sign up directly with Humana - rose about 1 percent to 2.86 million, as of Dec. 31. Employer or other group-based Medicare Advantage membership climbed 24 percent to 441,400.  Last month, Walmart reported a sharp drop in profit and online sales growth during the critical holiday period and forecast annual profit at the lower end of expectations.

U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan said the government had not waived its sovereign immunity from Walmart\u2019s \u201csweeping\u201d challenge to the Department of Justice\u2019s and Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s enforcement of laws governing opioid prescriptions by pharmacies and pharmacists.  Walmart said on Friday it will appeal the decision, which the Plano, Texas-based judge issued on Thursday night.  Jordan ruled six weeks after the government filed its own lawsuit against Walmart, claiming its network of more than 5,000 pharmacies was unable to adequately detect and report suspicious opioid prescriptions. It also said Walmart did the opposite, filling thousands of invalid prescriptions.  In its Oct. 22 lawsuit, Walmart had said the government\u2019s lax and confusing oversight left pharmacists with an \u201cuntenable\u201d choice between filling prescriptions and risking criminal or civil liability, or refusing prescriptions and facing the wrath of patients, doctors and state medical boards.  \u201cOur pharmacists and patients deserve better than the current patchwork of inconsistent, conflicting and contradictory demands from federal and state regulators,\u201d the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in announcing the planned appeal.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Responsibility for reining in America\u2019s epidemic of gun violence is widely spread. Politicians, gun owners, retailers, banks and investors all have a role to play, and even modest commitments can make a difference. After a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas became the scene of a multiple shooting on Saturday, the $312 billion U.S. retailer could put that principle into practice.  Walmart has already done much to restrict its peddling of lethal weapons. The company raised the minimum age for purchases to 21 from 18 last year, and no longer stocks assault-style weapons or high-capacity magazines. It shows no signs of moving to an outright ban, which would be bold for the world\u2019s largest retailer by sales. Nonetheless, there are three things it could do that need not be at odds with its imperative to remain profitable.  First, the retailer run by Doug McMillon could ask customers not to bring weapons into its stores, even where state laws permit them to do so. Starbucks put out a \u201crespectful request\u201d to its customers in 2013 asking \u2013 not telling \u2013 them to keep their guns out of its branches. Levi Strauss, Chipotle and Walmart-rival Target have made similar requests while Costco Wholesale, which operates as a member\u2019s club, bans guns.  Second, Walmart could announce a strategic review into the financial impact of selling firearms. Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, which pulled assault-style weapons from its shelves in 2018, is doing just that, and has already said that guns and ammo carry lower margins than other kinds of sporting products. Besides, the case for stocking firearms is weakening. Sturm, Ruger last week said its three-month sales had dropped by one-quarter from a year earlier, tanking its shares by 19%.  Finally, if Walmart is going to sell firearms, it could declare itself open to selling technology-enabled guns that can be fired only by their owner. Dick\u2019s boss Ed Stack did that in November. Such weapons aren\u2019t yet available, and many gun enthusiasts doubt their efficacy. But a pledge of notional support from the world\u2019s biggest retailer would help bring capital into their development.  None of these steps might have made any difference to the mass shootings that took place in recent days. Wider problems \u2013 including the U.S. Senate\u2019s inability to pass legislation that would make background checks mandatory in most gun sales \u2013 are more destructive by far. Still, small steps matter. Walmart can\u2019t fix this problem alone, but it can definitely do more than nothing.","127":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc is close to launching its membership program, a direct competitor for online retail giant Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime service, Recode reported on Tuesday, citing sources.

Avis Budget Group, which keeps Waymo vehicles charged and refueled for an upcoming ride, will provide its customers these self-driving vehicles as a last-mile solution to help them pick up or drop off their rental cars.  Having worked on self-driving cars since 2009 and with 5 million miles (8 million km) driven on public roads under its belt, Waymo is generally considered to be ahead of rivals in the development of autonomous vehicle technology.

CEO Kevin Mayer, a high-profile former Disney executive, is leaving three months after joining TikTok, in the middle of negotiations to sell the Chinese-owned short-form video app\u2019s U.S. operations to Microsoft Corp or Oracle Corp.  TikTok owner ByteDance aims to enter exclusive talks with a bidder in the next 24 to 48 hours and ink a deal by Sept. 15, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  ByteDance declined to comment.  The sale of TikTok is happening as the company is under fire from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential national security risk due to the vast amount of private data the app is compiling on U.S. consumers.  The Trump administration has demanded that China\u2019s ByteDance, which owns TikTok globally, sell its U.S. operations. Earlier this week, TikTok also sued over an executive order effectively banning it in the United States.  Retailer Walmart lauded TikTok\u2019s integration of e-commerce and advertising capabilities in other markets and said that a three-way partnership could bring that integration to the United States. The deal would help Walmart reach customers across virtual and physical sales channels and grow its online marketplace and its advertising business. Shares of Walmart rose 6%.  \u201cWe are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of U.S. TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of U.S. government regulators,\u201d Walmart said in a statement.  Mayer was Walt Disney Co\u2019s top streaming executive before becoming chief executive officer of TikTok and chief operating officer of parent ByteDance on June 1.  ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yiming said in a separate letter reviewed by Reuters that the company was \u201cmoving quickly to find resolutions to the issues that we face globally, particularly in the U.S. and India\u201d.  He said Mayer had joined just as the company was \u201centering arguably our most challenging moment.\u201d  \u201cIt is never easy to come into a leadership position in a company moving as quickly as we are, and the circumstances following his arrival made it all the more complex,\u201d Zhang said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  U.S., INDIA CHALLENGES  Amid growing distrust between Washington and Beijing, Trump complained that TikTok was a national security threat and could share information about users with China\u2019s government.  Trump issued an executive order banning U.S. transactions with TikTok on Aug. 6, effective in mid-September. He issued a separate order about a week later giving ByteDance 90 days to divest of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations and data.  ByteDance has been in talks to sell TikTok\u2019s North American, Australian and New Zealand operations which could be worth $25 billion to $30 billion, people with knowledge of the matter have said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The company has also been targeted in India, where TikTok was one of 59 Chinese apps banned by the Indian government in June following a border clash between India and China.  That month, Mayer wrote to India\u2019s government saying China\u2019s government has never requested user data, nor would TikTok turn it over if asked.  TechCrunch reported earlier this month that ByteDance was in talks with India\u2019s Reliance for investment in TikTok.  TikTok has become a global sensation since ByteDance launched the app in 2017, with operations in countries such as France, South Korea, Indonesia, Russia and Brazil. In April, the app hit 2 billion downloads globally.  LITTLE SURPRISE  Mayer was scheduled to leave TikTok as part of the planned sale, as the global role he had been hired for would no longer exist, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Zhang has been the key person in TikTok sale talks, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  TikTok\u2019s decision to launch a $200 million \u201ccreator fund\u201d in July was spearheaded by TikTok\u2019s former head Alex Zhu, though Mayer was also directly involved, said two of the people. The project was initiated internally much earlier than Mayer\u2019s arrival, one of the people said.  \u201cWhether TikTok reaches an agreement to sell its U.S. business or decides to duke it out in the courts, the role for Mayer will not be anything like that he had envisioned when he joined,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting in Beijing.  Mayer\u2019s departure is not a great boost for company morale right now, Natkin said.","130":"March 17 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc:  * WALMART AND THE WALMART FOUNDATION COMMIT $25 MILLION TO GLOBAL COVID-19 RESPONSE EFFORT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","131":"BENGALURU, May 1 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc-owned e-commerce firm Flipkart is in talks to buy Indian grocery chain Namdhari\u2019s Fresh, CNBC-TV18 reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

FILE PHOTO: The main entrance to a Walmart store is pictured in Sao Paulo, Brazil February 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker\/File Photo  The retailer will pay more than $144 million to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission and about $138 million to resolve parallel criminal charges by the U.S. Department of Justice, according to court and regulatory filings.  In a separate regulatory filing, Walmart said the $282 million was part of a \u201cglobal settlement\u201d and ended all FCPA-related investigations into the retailer and its overseas businesses.  The Justice Department launched an investigation of the retailer after a series of New York Times articles in 2012 described alleged bribes paid by Walmart in Mexico to obtain permits to build stores there.  The reports spurred a wide-reaching investigation by the department into the behavior of Walmart subsidiaries around the globe, including in Mexico, Brazil, China and India.  \u201cWalmart profited from rapid international expansion, but in doing so chose not to take necessary steps to avoid corruption,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division said on Thursday.  \u201cIn numerous instances, senior Walmart employees knew of failures of its anti-corruption-related internal controls involving foreign subsidiaries, and yet Walmart failed for years to implement sufficient controls comporting with U.S. criminal laws,\u201d he added.  The Justice Department said the failures led Walmart\u2019s subsidiaries in Mexico, India, Brazil and China to hire third-party intermediaries and allowed these middlemen to make improper payments to government officials to obtain store permits and licenses.  Walmart did not voluntarily disclose the conduct in Mexico and only disclosed the conduct in Brazil, China and India after the government had already begun investigating the situation in Mexico, the department added.  Charles Cain, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s FCPA Unit, said \u201cWalmart valued international growth and cost-cutting over compliance.\u201d  The retailer\u2019s chief executive said on Thursday Walmart had enhanced its \u201cpolicies, procedures and systems and invested tremendous resources globally into ethics and compliance.\u201d  Walmart also said it had spent over $900 million on related matters, including FCPA inquiries, investigations and its global compliance program, in the past seven years.  WALMART BRAZIL PLEADS GUILTY  As part of the settlement, Walmart Brazil has entered a guilty plea in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the retailer said.  According to court filings, from around 2009 to 2010, Walmart Brazil knowingly led its parent to maintain false records, which then made it into the company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  Walmart Brazil and its employees recorded $527,000 in payments to an intermediary for assistance in acquiring construction permits, as a payment to certain construction companies, the court filings show.  The intermediary\u2019s ability to obtain licenses and permits quickly \u201cby sorting things out like magic\u201d earned the middleman the nickname \u201csorceress\u201d or \u201cgenie\u201d within Walmart Brazil, the court filings said.  In June 2018, the retailer sold a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International.  Walmart has also entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department. That means the department will not prosecute the company, if it meets obligations set forth in the agreement for three years.  In October, the retailer agreed to pay $160 million to settle a class action by investors unhappy with the way Walmart handled the foreign bribery investigation.

The department said Brand will be leaving her post in the coming weeks. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, himself repeatedly criticized by Trump, praised her \u201ccritical role in helping us accomplish our goals as a department.\u201d  Brand, 44, was next in line of succession to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for oversight of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into potential collusion between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and whether the Republican president has unlawfully sought to obstruct the ongoing probe.  She became the latest senior law enforcement official to either resign or be fired since Trump took office in January 2017, a list that includes a Federal Bureau of Investigation director and deputy director, and an acting attorney general. Trump also ousted all remaining U.S. attorneys, the chief federal prosecutors in each state, who had served under Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.  Brand\u2019s resignation is different in that she was hand-picked for the job by Trump, assuming her post just five days after Mueller\u2019s appointment in May 2017.  News of Brand\u2019s departure came a week after Trump approved the release of a previously classified memo written by Republican lawmakers that portrayed the Russia investigation, initially handled by the FBI and now headed by Mueller, as a product of political bias against Trump at the FBI and Justice Department.  After just nine months on the job, Brand had become more and more uneasy with Trump\u2019s escalating attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI, which she and other law enforcement professionals feared was beginning to undermine the rule of law, according to sources familiar with her thinking.  In a statement, Brand defended her department, saying, \u201cThe men and women of the Department of Justice impress me every day.\u201d  The attacks have escalated in recent weeks as Republicans in Congress have criticized the handling by the Justice Department, FBI and the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court of warrants for surveillance of a Trump campaign advisor, Carter Page, who had ties to Russia. Trump called the matter \u201ca disgrace.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  In a statement, Walmart said Brand will join the company as executive vice president for global governance and corporate secretary. \u201cWe are fortunate to have a leader of Rachel Brand\u2019s stature join the company,\u201d President and CEO Doug McMillon said.  \u2018BLOCK OUT THE TURMOIL\u2019  Mary McCord, who served as acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division from October 2016 until April 2017 and helped oversee the FBI investigation into the collusion matter, said Brand\u2019s resignation would further shake morale at the department.  \u201cWhen the associate attorney general steps down after just nine months in the midst of a barrage of attacks on the department from the White House and Capitol Hill, it is another blow to the career women and men of the department who have been doing their jobs diligently while trying to block out the turmoil around them,\u201d said McCord, now a visiting professor at Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.  The department is also facing a major backlog on leadership positions that still need confirmation by the U.S. Senate.  Rosenstein oversees Mueller\u2019s investigation because Sessions recused himself from the matter last year. Trump also has criticized Sessions for recusing himself. Brand on Friday lauded Sessions\u2019 \u201ccommitment to the rule of law.\u201d  Rosenstein is the only official with legal authority to fire Mueller, and it is widely believed he would resign if ordered to do so without good cause. If Rosenstein resigned, that authority would have fallen to Brand under the department\u2019s succession line. With her gone, the next person in line is Solicitor General Noel Francisco.  Any permanent replacement for Brand would have to be confirmed by the Senate and would likely face tough questioning about their willingness to preserve the Russia probe\u2019s independence.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Trump could use a 1998 law on executive branch vacancies to appoint a temporary replacement of his choice, as long as that person was an experienced Justice Department employee or another administration official already confirmed by the Senate.  Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the agency\u2019s Russia investigation, in May 2017, saying he took the action because of \u201cthis Russia thing.\u201d  The FBI\u2019s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, stepped down in January after Trump repeatedly criticized him on Twitter. McCabe\u2019s wife previously ran as a Democrat for a seat in Virginia\u2019s state Senate and received donations from then-Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a close ally of Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton.  Brand oversees the Justice Department\u2019s civil, antitrust, tax and environmental and natural resources divisions. She played a crucial role in helping push for Congress to reauthorize the National Security Agency\u2019s warrantless internet surveillance program after it faced opposition from some privacy-minded lawmakers in both parties. The measure passed, and Trump signed it into law in January.  A Justice Department official said that Jesse Panuccio, the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General, will temporarily take over Brand\u2019s job until a replacement is named.  He previously served as acting associate attorney general until Brand was confirmed and sworn in.","147":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Walmart is seen on shopping trolleys at their store in Sao Paulo, Brazil February 14, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: A shipment moves on a conveyor belt at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre (BLR7) on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS\/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  India is considering revising the rules after traders in the country accused Amazon\u2019s Indian division and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass investment regulations, Reuters reported this month.  The U.S. companies deny any wrongdoing.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers but local traders say the U.S. giants promote select sellers and offer deep discounts, which hurts business for smaller local retailers.  In 2018, India changed its foreign direct investment (FDI) rules to deter foreign firms offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  The government is now considering tightening those rules again to include sellers in which a foreign e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake through its parent, Reuters reported.  Such a change could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India, Cloudtail and Appario.  Citing the Reuters story in a Jan. 28 letter, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged the Indian government not to make any more material restrictive changes to e-commerce investment rules.  \u201cAny further changes in FDI rules would limit e-commerce firms from leveraging their scale,\u201d USIBC said in the letter seen by Reuters.  USIBC also asked India\u2019s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) to engage in substantive consultation with companies on e-commerce regulation.  USIBC and DPIIT did not respond to a request for comment.  After the Reuters story was published last week, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represents millions of brick-and-mortar retailers, said it has received assurances from India\u2019s commerce minister that policy changes were in the offing.  On Saturday, CAIT in a statement said the USIBC letter was an \u201cuncalled for intervention\u201d which runs against the interest of 85 million traders. \u201cSuch a hue and cry is not understandable,\u201d CAIT said, adding that it had also written a letter in protest to the USIBC President.  The government is also considering prohibiting online sales by a seller who, for example, purchases goods from an e-commerce entity\u2019s wholesale unit, or any of its group firms, and then sells them on the entity\u2019s websites, Reuters has reported.  The 2018 rule changes soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy changes favoured local e-commerce retailers over U.S. companies.  Industry sources told Reuters on Friday that the prospects of such frequent policy changes in India have alarmed Amazon, which has committed $6.5 billion in investments in India, and Walmart, which invested $16 billion in Flipkart in 2018.  The USIBC letter said \u201cinvestments require reasonable policy predictability and fair treatment\u201d.  \u201cUSIBC is concerned that material changes to the FDI policy creates uncertainty and impacts investor confidence, as well as business continuity of existing investments,\u201d it said.  Amazon declined to comment on the USIBC letter. Walmart and Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment.","149":"MUMBAI, July 2 (Reuters) - A lobby group of small Indian traders and shopkeepers has asked tens of thousands of its members to hold protests across the country on Monday against Walmart Inc\u2019s proposed $16 billion acquisition of e-commerce firm Flipkart.  The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) says the U.S. retail giant\u2019s buyout of Bengaluru-based Flipkart will create a monopoly in the retail market and drive small store-owners out of business.  Praveen Khandelwal, the secretary general of CAIT, told Reuters he expected a million people in all to join Monday\u2019s sit-in protests across hundreds of Indian cities.  \u201cThis is the first phase of our protest. And if the government doesn\u2019t listen, we will decide our future course of action at our national convention in Delhi later this month,\u201d Khandelwal said.  Bentonville, Arkansas-headquartered Walmart in May announced it was acquiring roughly 77 percent of homegrown Flipkart, a deal which now awaits the approval of India\u2019s anti-trust regulator.  Multiple sources and lawyers close to the deal have previously told Reuters that while the Competition Commission of India will consider all arguments, the CAIT did not pose a challenge to the acquisition.  Walmart, which currently runs 21 cash-and-carry stores in India, said on Monday it had been supporting local manufacturing in India by sourcing from small and medium suppliers, farmers and businesses run by women.  \u201cOur partnership with Flipkart will provide thousands of local suppliers and manufacturers access to consumers through the marketplace model,\u201d Rajneesh Kumar, senior vice president, Walmart India, said in a statement.

REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  On Sunday, Oracle beat Microsoft Corp in the battle for the U.S. arm of TikTok with a deal structured as a partnership rather than an outright sale to try to navigate geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington.  Walmart had teamed up with Microsoft on the unsuccessful bid.  ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, had been in talks to divest the U.S. business of its hugely popular short-video app to Oracle or a consortium led by Microsoft after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the sale last month and said he might otherwise shut it down.  After Microsoft said it had been informed by ByteDance that the Chinese firm would not be selling it TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations, Walmart said it would talk further with ByteDance and \u201cother interested parties.\u201d  Asked on Monday whether the other parties include Oracle, a Walmart spokesman declined to comment.  For Walmart, a relationship with TikTok could supercharge the world\u2019s largest retailer\u2019s battle against Amazon.com Inc in e-commerce and online advertising.  But transforming TikTok from a platform where some 50 million U.S. daily users share short-form videos of people dancing and lip-synching into a shopping powerhouse will be a challenge for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, analysts say.  In the United States, TikTok advertisers currently place video ads for merchandise such as headphones or fast foods in-between user-uploaded videos. They can also pay for promoted \u201chashtag challenges,\u201d where users post videos about the brands\u2019 products.  In June, TikTok courted advertisers with a new program called \u201cTikTok For Business,\u201d which lets brands buy ads that appear when users first open the app. \u201cDon\u2019t make ads, make TikToks,\u201d the company told advertisers, which now include Nike Inc, eBay Inc and Colgate-Palmolive Co among others.  While TikTok is already on its way to building a robust advertising business, it has yet to articulate a comprehensive plan to sell goods on the app.  Rivals are far ahead. Facebook Inc has prioritized building out shopping and payments products in recent years across its suite of apps, which include fast-growing Instagram and WhatsApp as well as its namesake \u201cblue\u201d app, suggesting ambitions to emulate do-it-all Chinese super apps like WeChat. SOCIAL COMMERCE  If Walmart seeks inspiration on how to narrow the gap between TikTok and other big digital platforms and also catch up to Amazon, it need look no further than TikTok\u2019s Chinese counterpart.  Douyin, the ByteDance-owned app that resembles TikTok but is available only in China, started selling merchandise in 2017 and now operates a growing e-commerce operation where more than 400 million daily users shop.  Users can watch short videos and livestreams and make purchases directly through the store on the app or click on links to other e-commerce platforms from the videos. Creators are also encouraged to create shops within Douyin.  While Douyin has relied on and brought new business to China\u2019s big e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba, TikTok\u2019s e-commerce ambitions could be underpinned by Walmart.  The retailer has already accelerated e-commerce plans since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Walmart has explored new ways to court shoppers who make fewer trips to their stores. It has invested in curbside pickup and next-day and two-day deliveries.  But it could do much more, say analysts. Walmart could expand into so-called social commerce by hosting TikTok influencers\u2019 online storefronts, and enable shopping directly from the videos and livestreams, said Scott Smigler, president of e-commerce marketing agency Exclusive Concepts.  A partnership with TikTok, Smigler said, \u201cwould give Walmart a compelling edge over both Amazon and Google, who struggle to help consumers discover new products they didn\u2019t know they needed. That\u2019s the true power of social commerce.\u201d  All this could go a long way toward attracting a broader and younger audience. The average age of Walmart shoppers is 47, according to data provider Kantar.  \u201cTikTok is valuable because it\u2019s used every day by kids ... so as long as they (Walmart) gear their ads towards the audience on TikTok, it will be a success and they could be a real leader in advertising and e-commerce,\u201d said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank. \u201cIf they start advertising yard tools and things like that, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get much traction.\u201d","152":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N raised its annual outlook on Thursday as a robust economy boosted purchases at its stores and website and the retailer picked up market share in food and other groceries, earning praise from U.S. President Donald Trump.  The world\u2019s largest retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, comparable sales and e-commerce growth in its largest market during the third quarter. It has now posted a more than five-year streak of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retail chain.  Walmart's shares were up 1% in mid-morning trade, and helped lift other retailers, including Target Corp TGT.N and Macy's Inc M.N.  Trump used Walmart\u2019s performance to say U.S. tariffs, imposed by his administration on imports from China, have had little impact on consumers.  \u201cWalmart announces great numbers. No impact from Tariffs (which are contributing $Billions to our Treasury)...,\u201d Trump said in a tweet.  Consumer spending going in to the crucial holiday season remains healthy, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. Retailers earn a sizeable chunk of their annual revenue during November and December.  \u201cThe consumer remains in pretty good shape, employment situation is good, fuel prices are low \u2026 wage growth is pretty good,\u201d he said.  Walmart has also managed to minimize the impact from U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, Biggs said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve muted the impact (of tariffs) pretty well up to this point.\u201d  The retailer gets 56% of its revenue from food and grocery sales, which allows it to manage the pressure from tariffs better than many rivals, analysts said.

In October, Walmart said its chief executive for U.S. operations, Greg Foran, who was credited for turning around the business, will leave the company and be replaced by the head of its Sam\u2019s Club warehouse chain unit, John Furner.  The U.S. business has \u201ca lot of momentum,\u201d Furner, who took charge on Nov. 1, told reporters. His priority is to maintain that pace until the end of the holiday season, he added.  The company is focused on spreading out sales during this year\u2019s compressed holiday season, instead of focusing on a few big days, executives said.  Online sales rose 41%, higher than the previous quarter\u2019s increase of 37 pct and greater than the company\u2019s expectation of 35%.  \u201cOur strength is being driven by food, which is good, but we need even more progress on Walmart.com with general merchandise,\u201d CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement.  Food typically has lower margins and does not drive online profitability, which has continued to suffer for the retailer.  Operating income fell 5.4 percent to $4.7 billion as a result of ongoing investments in e-commerce including faster delivery.  Losses at the U.S. e-commerce business could rise to about $1.7 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 2018, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley.  U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore said improving operating profitability is a key area of focus for the company.  Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.2%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended Oct.31. Analysts estimated growth of 2.9%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.16 per share, beating expectations of $1.09 per share.  Walmart forecast earnings per share, including the impact from its acquisition of Indian e-commerce retailer Flipkart, to increase \u201cslightly\u201d from a year ago.  Total revenue rose 2.5 percent to $128 billion.","153":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, said on Tuesday it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its stores across the United States, and called for action on gun safety after a string of mass shootings, including at Walmart stores in Texas and Mississippi.  Walmart also called for a strengthening of background checks for gun buyers and action to take guns out of the hands of those who pose a risk of violence, which was followed by an almost identical message from grocery operator Kroger Co.  Both Walmart and Kroger, which exited the firearms and ammunition business last year when its Fred Meyer unit stopped such sales, said they are now asking customers not to bring guns into their stores, even when allowed by local laws.  The two retailers are among a growing number of U.S. companies, such as Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, that are responding to the debate over guns and gun safety as mass shootings have proliferated, risking backlash from powerful gun owners\u2019 groups while elected leaders consider options.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief executive officer, Doug McMillon, said in a letter to employees. \u201cAs a company, we experienced two horrific events in one week, and we will never be the same.\u201d  Kroger, in a statement from corporate affairs vice president Jessica Adelman, spoke about \u201cthe growing chorus of Americans who are no longer comfortable with the status quo and who are advocating for concrete and common sense gun reforms.\u201d  Kroger said it was \u201cjoining those encouraging our elected leaders to pass laws\u201d on background checks and keeping firearms out of the hands of those at risk for violence.  McMillon said Walmart\u2019s decision follows his visit to El Paso, Texas, on Aug. 6, three days after a gunman went on a rampage at a Walmart store there, killing 22 people.  Walmart Inc said it would stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its stores across the United States. McMillon in the letter described himself as a gun owner and said that company founder Sam Walton was \u201can avid outdoorsman who had a passion for quail hunting.\u201d  Walmart will stop selling handgun sales in Alaska, the only state where it still sells hand guns. The halt on the ammunition and handgun sales will come into effect when current inventory is sold out.  Kroger had sold guns in 43 of its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska before announcing in March 2018 that it would exit the firearms business.  PRAISE AND CRITICISM  The retailers\u2019 latest moves sparked immediate reaction from groups on both sides of the gun control debate.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThe tide is turning,\u201d said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. The announcements \u201csend a strong cultural signal that when lawmakers don\u2019t protect their constituents, companies will protect their customers.\u201d  The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group with deep political ties, said Walmart was succumbing to pressure from \u201canti-gun elites.\u201d  \u201cLines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America\u2019s fundamental freedoms,\u201d it said. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kroger move.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Walmart said its latest actions would reduce its share of the ammunition market from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.  U.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.  The move reflects growing corporate activism on guns.  Walmart, like rival Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, had previously ended sales of assault rifles and raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21.  Bank of America last year said it would no longer lend to companies making military-style firearms for civilians, and airlines Delta and United last year said they were no longer offering discounted rates to the NRA.  The latest move will leave Walmart focused on weapons for hunting, including deer rifles, shotguns and related ammunition.  \u201cThe general principle is if we don\u2019t sell the firearm we wouldn\u2019t sell the ammunition,\u201d a spokesman for Walmart told Reuters.  Just last month, Walmart said it would not change its policy on selling firearms even as it took down signs and playable demos of violent video games.  On Friday, McMillon in his letter to employees said he would send letters urging action on \u201ccommon sense measures\u201d to the White House and the Congressional leadership, calling for debate of the reauthorization of a ban on assault weapons, to determine its effectiveness, as well.","154":"March 31 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc said on Tuesday it would start taking the temperature of its employees before the start of their shift and ask them basic health screening questions as its steps up safety measures to counter the rapidly spreading coronavirus.

(Reuters) - Walmart Inc will restart a service that offers the delivery of groceries directly to shoppers\u2019 refrigerators - part of its attempts to find unconventional ways to offer cheap and rapid delivery of online orders.  Walmart had started testing the service in 2017 with smart security company August Home and third-party courier firm Deliv, which used gig workers to make the deliveries. It ended the test a year later.  This time, Walmart will use its own workers, who have been with the retailer for at least a year, and use its own vehicles. Walmart will also use smart entry technology and a proprietary, wearable camera to access shoppers\u2019 homes, the company\u2019s head of U.S. ecommerce, Marc Lore, said, letting customers control access into their home and watch a delivery remotely.  Starting this fall, the service will be available to over 1 million customers across three cities \u2013 Kansas City, Missouri; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Vero Beach, Florida.  Walmart recently launched one-day delivery without a shipping fee, weeks after Amazon.com Inc announced a similar offer.

It\u2019s the whole point of class actions! The class mechanism streamlines the process to enable the vindication of claims by hundreds or thousands or even millions of people that might otherwise be too small to justify litigation.  For the system to work, all of those people are entitled to know if those who purport to be representing their interests \u2013 lead plaintiffs and class counsel \u2013 are fulfilling that responsibility. Federal judges overseeing class actions are supposed to protect the interests of absent class members. But in the end, it\u2019s class members themselves who release claims when class actions settle. Their interests are at stake.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  I\u2019m making these basic and perhaps obvious points because class counsel in a Florida class action against Walmart are arguing, along with Walmart, that the public \u2013 including absent class members \u2013 should not have access to a document that raises questions about a proposed $9.5 million settlement in the case. In a joint brief filed Friday, Walmart lawyers from Greenberg Traurig and class counsel from Morgan & Morgan asked U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez of Miami to seal an objector\u2019s declaration that, in turn, reproduces a troubling declaration from the class action\u2019s lead plaintiff. Judge Martinez struck the lead plaintiff\u2019s declaration from the public case docket in September.  In Friday\u2019s brief, Walmart and Morgan & Morgan argued that the objector, a disbarred California lawyer named Steven Helfand, is violating Judge Martinez\u2019s previous sealing order. In a Nov. 9 brief, Helfand responded that millions of class members should not be denied access to a document that calls into doubt the legitimacy of the settlement \u2013 and the adequacy of the lead plaintiff and class counsel to protect the interests of the class.  This is all easier to understand if you know the specifics of the case, which I first wrote about last month. The lead plaintiff in the case is a Florida man, Vassilios Kukorinis, who noticed a few years ago that Walmart appeared to be overcharging him for certain items whose price was based on their weight. Kukorinis traveled around to Walmart stores in Florida to document these alleged overcharges. He brought his evidence to Morgan & Morgan, which, in February 2019, filed a class action complaint against Walmart with Kukorinis as the prospective lead plaintiff.  Walmart denied the allegations but last summer agreed to settle the case for a minimum of $4.5 million and as much as $9.5 million, depending on the volume of class claims. The settlement called for Morgan & Morgan to be paid as much as $2.375 million in attorneys\u2019 fees. Class counsel moved for preliminary approval on Aug. 2. Judge Martinez granted the motion two weeks later.  Then Kukorinis sent a stunning letter to the judge. The lead plaintiff\u2019s 25-page, Sept. 22 letter asserted that Morgan & Morgan had reached the settlement with Walmart without Kukorinis\u2019 knowledge or consent. Kukorinis said he hadn\u2019t heard from his lawyers in months and only found out that his case had settled because he happened to Google the case caption. \u201cI don\u2019t want to participate to this fiasco\/cover up and betrayal to all class action members, orchestrated without my knowledge,\u201d Kukorinis told Judge Martinez.  As I told you in my previous report on Kukorinis\u2019 letter, John Yanchunis of Morgan & Morgan told me by email that his client was \u201cwas always informed of the progress and status\u201d of the case. Kukorinis, he said, traveled to a November 2019 Walmart mediation alongside class counsel. In response to my specific question about whether Morgan & Morgan sought Kukorinis\u2019 consent before moving for preliminary approval of the settlement, Yanchunis said by email, \u201cYes, of course we did.\u201d  Kukorinis\u2019 letter was docketed on Sept. 25. The judge ordered it struck from the docket three days later, scheduling a hearing on the matter for early October. Before the scheduled hearing, Morgan & Morgan submitted a new declaration from Kukorinis, who said he had misunderstood the scope of releases in the proposed settlement but had received an explanation from Yanchunis that satisfied his concerns. Kukorinis\u2019 new declaration did not address his initial assertion that Morgan & Morgan did not obtain his consent before asking Judge Martinez to approve the settlement.  Kukorinis\u2019 original letter to the judge remained publicly available, despite being struck from the docket. I was able to download the letter from a docket monitoring service in late October. My Oct. 27 story about Kukorinis\u2019 dispute with his counsel included a link to the lead plaintiff\u2019s letter.  The Walmart objector, Helfand, has been trying to get Judge Martinez to unseal the Kukorinis letter since it was first struck. Helfand asked last month for permission to attend the scheduled conference about the letter, Walmart and Morgan & Morgan opposed his participation. In a joint brief filed on Oct. 5, Walmart and Morgan & Morgan argued that regardless of Helfand\u2019s participation in any conference before Judge Martinez, the objector should be barred from accessing Kukorinis\u2019 letter because it \u201cinadvertently divulged privileged attorney-client communications and attorney work product, as well as privileged mediation communications protected by Florida, federal and local rules.\u201d  With no ruling from Judge Martinez on the public disclosure of the letter, Helfand short-circuited the process on Friday. In a filing styled as a \u201cdeclaration in support of mootness,\u201d Helfand argued that Kukorinis\u2019 letter is publicly available, whatever the docket says, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to continue to \u201ccloak the document with secrecy.\u201d To underscore that point, Helfand attached the letter to his filing \u2013 and it\u2019s still publicly accessible on the docket of the class action.  Walmart and Morgan & Morgan, as I mentioned, immediately moved to seal Helfand\u2019s declaration. By attaching the Kukorinis letter, they said, Helfand\u2019s filing, \u201cplainly reveals information protected by the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine, as well as confidential and privileged mediation communications.\u201d The joint brief contended that disclosure of the Kukorinis letter by outside websites does not constitute a waiver of the \u201csacred\u201d attorney-client privilege.  Helfand\u2019s Nov. 9 response is his best-yet explanation for why class members deserve to see the letter. Kukorinis\u2019 letter, he said, asserted that Morgan & Morgan did not obtain his consent to settle the case filed in the name of the lead plaintiff. Morgan & Morgan said that it did. Those accounts, Helfand said, cannot be reconciled \u2013 and the disparity means that either the lead plaintiff or class counsel is not adequately representing the class.  Helfand also said that Morgan & Morgan\u2019s Yanchunis breached privilege by selectively disclosing his communications with Kukorinis, including in Yanchunis\u2019 response to some of my email questions. Because class counsel had \u201cventured into the public debate to make partisan commentary favorable to Morgan & Morgan,\u201d Helfand said, \u201cthe complete file must be fully divulged and this court should not participate in secrecy efforts or rancor instigated by the settling parties.\u201d  A Walmart spokesman said the company had no comment beyond its filing Friday. Yanchunis did not respond to my detailed email query, which, among other things, sought his comment on Helfand\u2019s argument that the irreconcilability of accounts provided by him and his client is evidence that one or the other of them is not protecting the class.  Helfand is an imperfect messenger, as Walmart and Morgan & Morgan have told Judge Martinez. He was disbarred in February after defaulting in a disbarment case in which the California State Bar alleged that Helfand committed numerous violations of the California business code and rules of professional conduct in his representation of objectors to a class action against J.C. Penney.  But Helfand told me by email that his history doesn\u2019t diminish the merits of his argument. \u201cThe messenger is, in fact, ultimately, irrelevant,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that matters, at the final approval stage, is whether the settlement, as proposed, is fair, adequate and reasonable and whether the protective order requirements of Rule 23 are met. The settling parties should welcome and invite criticism, from any class member, no matter their background or, alleged, flaws.\u201d  As of midday Monday, Helfand\u2019s declaration, and with its attached version of the otherwise sealed Kukorinis letter, remains in the public docket.","159":"NEW DELHI, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc, the world\u2019s largest retailer, has fired around 50 of its India executives as part of its restructuring in the country, three sources with direct knowledge told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: The entrance to a Walmart store is seen in Bradford, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The U.S. company did not disclose the size of the deal for retail operations involving more than 90 stores, but said it would record about a $1 billion after-tax, non-cash loss related to the divestiture in its fiscal third quarter next year.  The sale comes as Argentina, mired in recession since 2018, has just emerged from a sovereign default and is grappling with a currency crisis. The government has been fending off talk that international firms are looking for the exit.  \u201cIn Argentina you see a phenomenon of firms divesting, and companies changing hands, reflecting a lack of confidence in the direction of the country,\u201d said Guido Lorenzo, economist at consultancy LCG, adding there was huge uncertainty over policy.  \u201cArgentina lacks clear rules of the game.\u201d  Walmart sold the majority of its unit in Brazil in 2018, though it maintains major operations in Chile and Mexico. The exit from its business in Argentina, where it began operating in 1995 and currently has some 9,000 employees in 92 stores, would include its popular Changomas and Punto Mayorista chains.  Banorte analyst Valentin Mendoza said Walmart\u2019s exit from Argentina indicated it was doubling down on operations where it was already a market leader in Latin America such as Mexico, where it could leverage its dominant position better.  \u201cMYTH OF AN EXODUS\u201d  Argentina is headed for an economic decline of nearly 12% this year, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.  The country has imposed capital controls as it battles a currency crisis, and recently restructured over $100 billion of foreign currency debt with local and international creditors.  The economic malaise and uncertainty have hit corporations in the country and led to others pulling back, including LATAM Airlines Group and department store owner Falabella.  The government has sought to downplay the narrative that international firms are ditching the country over what critics have described as anti-investment policies, and say plans to revive growth will attract funds once again.  \"Although the global and local scenario is complex, and despite the myth of an 'exodus', the truth is there are firms continuing to bet on the country and announce investments every week,\" the ministry of development said in a report here this month.  Thomaz Favaro, a regional director at consultancy Control Risks, said firms were concerned about Argentina\u2019s public finances along with a \u201cwide range\u201d of political risks including capital controls, export taxes and expropriations.  \u201cWe advise companies in investments across emerging markets and declining interest in Argentina over the past two years is notable,\u201d he said.  Following the acquisition, family-owned Grupo de Narv\u00e1ez will own 656 stores, including supermarkets, and apparel and home appliance outlets in nine countries, including Ecuador and Uruguay, and employ more than 24,500 workers.","162":"May 16 (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc on Thursday reported an estimate-beating jump in first-quarter U.S. comparable sales, but overall revenue growth and online sales slowed.

The government discussions coincide with a growing number of complaints from India\u2019s brick-and-mortar retailers, which have for years accused Amazon and Walmart Inc-controlled Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass federal rules, allegations the U.S. companies deny.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers. It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.  Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart were last hit in Dec. 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  Now, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.  The changes could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect equity stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India.  Amazon, Walmart and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Yogesh Baweja, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which is working on the issue, confirmed to Reuters any changes will be announced through a so-called \u201cpress note,\u201d which contains foreign direct investment rules. He did not give any details.  \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Baweja said, adding an internal meeting on the subject last took place about a month ago.  \u201cOf course Amazon\u2019s a big player so whatever advice, whatever suggestions, whatever recommendations they make, they are also given due consideration.\u201d  FRAYED TIES  The 2018 rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to rework their business structures and soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy change favoured local e-tailers over U.S. ones.  India\u2019s e-commerce retail market is seen growing to $200 billion a year by 2026, from $30 billion in 2019, the country\u2019s investment promotion agency Invest India estimates.  Domestic traders have been unhappy about the growth. They see foreign e-commerce businesses as a threat to their livelihoods and accuse them of unfair business practices that use steep discounts to target rapid growth. The companies deny they are acting unfairly.  \u201cThe way the government is thinking is that marketplaces are not doing what they are supposed to do. The government wants to tinker with the nuts and bolts of the policy,\u201d said one of the sources who is familiar with the talks on the policy changes.  LIMITING WHOLESALE TIES  India\u2019s trade minister Piyush Goyal has been critical of e-commerce companies in private meetings and told them to follow all laws in letter and spirit, Reuters has previously reported.  In the face of growing trader complaints and an antitrust investigation, Goyal last year said Amazon was not doing \u201ca great favour to India\u201d by making fresh investments.  Among other changes, the government is considering changes that would effectively prohibit online sales by a seller who purchases goods from the e-commerce entity or its group firm, and then sells them on the entity\u2019s websites, two of the sources said.  Under existing rules, a seller is free to buy up to 25% of its inventory from the e-commerce entity\u2019s wholesale or another unit and then sell them on the e-commerce website.  A boom in e-commerce in India accelerated last year when the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online. Flipkart, in which Walmart invested $16 billion in 2018, and Amazon are among the top two players.  \u201cEcommerce has already made its mark for itself in the country, particularly during COVID-19,\u201d Commerce Ministry\u2019s Baweja said. \u201cThey are bound to grow and a conducive environment should be there, which is good for the brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce.\u201d (Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Krishna Das in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Aftab Ahmed; Editing by Euan Rocha and Barbara Lewis)","171":"FILE PHOTO: Walmart shopping carts are seen on the parking lot ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. November 27, 2019.

Rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O made a similar move earlier this week, announcing it would hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States as the virus outbreak boosts online orders.  Walmart also said it plans to pay a special cash bonus of $300 to full-time hourly workers and $150 to part-time associates. The company will accelerate the next scheduled quarterly bonus, it said.  The 150,000 new workers being hired through the end of May will work in Walmart\u2019s stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers, the company said, adding that they would be temporary at first but many would convert to permanent roles over time.  \u201cWalmart associates have gone above and beyond the call of duty in serving our customers during these unprecedented times,\u201d President and Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said.  A rush to stores by shoppers fearing quarantines or product shortages has cleared shelves, prompting retailers to boost stock of food and hygienic items, and have employees on hand for in-store work or delivery.

Walmart\u2019s gross margin, which has fallen for four consecutive quarters, was down 23 basis points in the quarter ended April 30. Within the U.S. division, operating income fell 3.1 percent from the prior year.  Shares of the world\u2019s biggest retailer traded 1.6 percent down in afternoon trade after initially opening higher. The stock has fallen around 20 percent from an all-time high in January.  \u201cThe Street is trying to digest the margin performance and there are concerns around when they can make money given the large investments in e-commerce,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones.  The weak margins overshadowed strong first-quarter results and progress in Walmart\u2019s efforts to keep pace with rivals like Amazon.com Inc.  Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales grew 33 percent, above the 23-percent growth in the previous three months. It said it is on track to increase U.S. e-commerce sales by 40 percent for the full year.  The e-commerce rebound comes after a sharp slowdown during the crucial holiday quarter, which sent its shares down over 10 percent and wiped out $31 billion from its market capitalization.  \u201cOnline grocery continued to accelerate and we also have new brands in e-commerce including the partnership with Lord and Taylor, so there are a lot of different things driving growth there,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview. He said free two-day shipping boosted growth, and the Walmart.com site redesign helped late in the quarter.  The site redesign also boosted traffic to the company\u2019s online grocery business by 10 percent to 20 percent, e-commerce chief Marc Lore told reporters on an earnings conference call.

REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker\/File photo  INTERNATIONAL BOOST  International sales were up 4.5 percent at $28.3 billion on a constant currency basis, helped by an early Easter, Biggs said.  The company is in the process of fixing its international business portfolio and recently said it will acquire a 77-percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for $16 billion, its largest deal ever, to compete with Amazon.com Inc in an important growth market. It plans to sell a majority stake in its UK grocery chain Asda Group Ltd to J Sainsbury PLC.  Walmart also recently reached agreements to sell its banking operations in Walmart Canada and Walmart Chile, it said on Thursday.  Excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $1.14 per share. The average analyst estimate was $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.1 percent excluding fuel, in line with analyst forecasts, according to Consensus Metrix. Walmart has recorded nearly four straight years of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retailer.  Walmart said some consumers may have felt the pinch from rising gas prices, but consumer demand remained robust.  \u201cIn terms of (demand), this quarter is reasonably similar to what I have seen last year and we are comfortable with our strategy,\u201d Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO Greg Foran said on a media call.  The comparable sales increase was driven by a jump in the price of items sold and by e-commerce. The company\u2019s U.S. grocery business and higher branded drug prices also boosted growth.  Competition in the U.S. grocery sector intensified as rival Kroger Co struck a deal with British online grocery company Ocado Group to build and deliver groceries from robot-staffed warehouses.  Customer traffic at Walmart stores was up 0.8 percent during the quarter, slower than the 1.5 percent growth during the same period a year ago. A delayed spring hurt demand in weather-related categories and led customers to consolidate trips.  Biggs said demand in those categories rebounded this month.

The S&P 500 racked up its biggest weekly increase in five years last week, easing fears that a deeper market correction was taking hold after a handful of large daily losses at the start of February.

The misconduct accusations followed an allegation of sexual assault, two people familiar with the matter said.  The departure of Binny Bansal, 37, one of the co-founders of Bangalore-based Flipkart, could be a setback for Walmart's efforts to compete with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in India's huge consumer market. A tech-savvy billionaire, Bansal took over as CEO of Flipkart in 2016. He became the chairman and group CEO of the e-commerce company this year.  Walmart paid $16 billion for a roughly 77-percent stake in Flipkart in May. The investment is the U.S. retailer\u2019s biggest acquisition and was a major move in its efforts to compete against Amazon\u2019s growing market share at home and abroad.  Walmart announced it would acquire the stake in Flipkart in May and completed the deal in August. In a note sent to Flipkart employees, which was seen by Reuters, Bansal said recent events led him to step down from his role as chairman and CEO. He said the events related to a claim of misconduct against him, \u201cwhich was uncorroborated after a thorough investigation completed by an independent law firm.\u201d  Bansal did not give details of the nature of the claim. \u201cThe allegations left me stunned and I strongly deny them,\u201d he wrote.  \u201cThe investigation, however, did bring to light lapses in judgment, particularly a lack of transparency, related to how I responded to the situation,\u201d he said, without elaborating further.  Neither Bansal nor his representatives responded to requests for comment. Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment.  A person in the United States familiar with the Walmart investigation said \u201ca claim of sexual assault against Binny\u201d came to its attention in late July. The accusation dated to a few years earlier and was made by a former Flipkart associate, who was not with Flipkart at the time, the person added.

ACCELERATED TRANSITION  Hailing from the northern Indian city of Chandigarh, Bansal is one of India\u2019s best known entrepreneurs after starting Flipkart in 2007 with Sachin Bansal. The duo, who hail from the same city but who are not related, formed Flipkart shortly after quitting Amazon.  Originally an online bookstore run out of a two-bedroom apartment in India\u2019s technology hub of Bengaluru, Flipkart grew over the next decade to become India\u2019s most valuable technology start-up. Its units include Flipkart, which sells general merchandise, the clothing and accessories retailer Myntra, the fashion portal Jabong and PhonePe payments app. Walmart has said it may make an initial public offering of Flipkart publicly within the next four years.  A separate source directly briefed on the matter in India, who did not wish to be named, said Bansal is still a shareholder in Flipkart and has not expressed any desire to sell his stake. Walmart has not offered to buy him out, the source added.  Walmart said Bansal had been contemplating a transition for some time and that the companies had been working together on a succession plan, which had now been accelerated. In his note to Flipkart employees, Binny Bansal said that he recently had thought he might continue as CEO for \u201ca few more quarters.\u201d  Kalyan Krishnamurthy, who heads the company\u2019s main Flipkart e-commerce operation, would now act as chief executive for a broader group of businesses including apparel websites Myntra and Jabong, Walmart said  Ananth Narayanan, who is the CEO of Myntra and Jabong, will continue in those roles and will now report to Krishnamurthy.

The world\u2019s biggest retailer, which employs 1.5 million people in the United States, also said it is raising wages to more than $15 per hour on average. About half of Walmart\u2019s hourly U.S. workers will earn $15 an hour or more, though there are some roles that will still start at $11 an hour, the company said.  Shares in Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart closed down 6.5% on Thursday. The company has invested heavily in online, advertising and healthcare businesses over the past year, using pandemic-led sales momentum to diversify beyond brick-and-mortar retail.  \u201cGuidance was muted, locking in gains from last year but stalling profit expansion in favor of critical investments in people and platform,\u201d Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink said.  Walmart forecast adjusted net sales to grow in the low single digits in fiscal 2022 which ends Jan. 31, much lower than the 8.5% growth seen in the preceding year. It also expects earnings per share to be flat-to-slightly up, below the 2.2% growth analysts had been expecting, according to Refinitiv.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to invest more aggressively in capacity and automation to position ourselves to earn the primary destination with customers, we are absolutely playing offence here,\u201d Chief Executive Doug McMillon said at Walmart\u2019s investor day conference.  Walmart expects capital expenditure to increase 27% to about $14 billion this year, focusing on key areas like supply chain and automation.  WAGE HIKE, STIMULUS BOOST  Walmart\u2019s announcement to increase wages comes at a time when pressure to increase the federal minimum wage has gathered fresh momentum. President Biden has made the issue a priority and reiterated his support for a base wage hike. He is also pushing to get $15 minimum wage added to his COVID rescue package.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cPeople who we are raising wages for tend to have been with us for a longer period of time than someone who might be earning the entry wage,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cWe will raise our starting wage rate over time.\u201d  Driven by an early holiday season and government stimulus checks, fourth-quarter sales at Walmart\u2019s U.S. stores open at least a year surged 8.6%, excluding fuel, well above analysts\u2019 expectations for a 5.6% rise.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The retail industry is expecting another wave of stimulus-driven consumer spending in coming months as the U.S. Congress considers the Biden administration\u2019s recovery plan that includes sending a $1,400 check to households.  \u201cThe guidance that we\u2019re going to give this morning really doesn\u2019t include any material stimulus because we just don\u2019t know what will happen. If we get more stimulus certainly that\u2019s a tailwind for us,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters in an interview.  Walmart missed expectations for fourth-quarter profit as it took on about $1.1 billion in pandemic-related costs during the quarter, including higher wages for warehouse workers, bonuses for store employees and costs related to keeping its stores clean.

The outcome illustrated the challenge facing Asda\u2019s new boss Roger Burnley, who succeeded Walmart veteran Sean Clarke as chief executive at the start of January. Burnley re-joined Asda in 2016 as chief operations officer after a stint at Sainsbury\u2019s .  Parent company Walmart itself reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period, prompting a slump in its shares.  Burnley, and his predecessor Clarke, have focused on attempting to re-establish Asda\u2019s competitiveness by cutting prices, improving quality and availability of product ranges and making its stores more attractive. Like industry rivals they have also attacked costs.  Asda, the UK\u2019s third largest supermarket group, said like-for-like sales rose 0.5 percent in last three months of 2017.  Although below a rise of 1.1 percent in the previous quarter it did mark a third straight quarter of underlying sales growth. Prior to that Asda had endured three years of sales falls.  \u201cWe know we have more work to do in the UK, however we are encouraged by recent results in key areas of our business,\u201d said Walmart CEO Doug McMillon.  Last month market leader Tesco reported like-for-like sales growth of 1.9 percent in its Christmas trading update, second-ranked Sainsbury\u2019s reported a 1.1 percent rise, while fourth-placed Morrisons\u2019 underlying sales were up 2.8 percent.  However, discounters Aldi and Lidl outperformed all of the big four.  Shares in Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons were up 0.2, 1.2 and 0.4 percent respectively at 1425 GMT.  FOOD INFLATION  Asda was up against weak comparative numbers as fourth quarter 2016 sales had fallen 2.9 percent.  The supermarket also benefited from food price inflation across the industry, which was 3.7 percent in the 12 weeks to Dec. 31, according to market researcher Kantar Worldpanel.  \u201cLast year, we really improved our offer for customers \u2013 combining great product innovation with a focus on value and an easy shopping experience,\u201d said Burnley.  He said Asda attracted over 348,000 new customers to its stores in December which meant it was the only one of Britain\u2019s big four grocers to retain its market share in that month.  However, Kantar Worldpanel\u2019s data showed Asda\u2019s market share was 15.3 percent over the longer 12 week period, down 0.2 percentage points year-on-year, indicating it still lost market share to the discounters.  Of Britain\u2019s major players analysts reckon Asda was hurt the most by the rise of the discounters as its traditional price advantage was eroded.  Walmart said last year it was too slow in starting the repositioning of Asda and had not focused enough on using its leverage as a parent.  Bryan Roberts, global insights director at retail specialist tcc global, said Asda was showing \u201cencouraging signs\u201d.  \u201cThis is a heartening turnaround - but it\u2019s happening slowly. A focus on re-capturing a year-round family appeal could catalyse its ongoing recovery,\u201d he said.

A gull flies near an Asda store in west London, Britain, April 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville  Asda attributed the sales decline to the timing of the busy Easter trading period this year - Easter Day was April 21 this year rather than April 1 in 2018.  Walmart said this week that it would look at a stock market listing for Asda after Britain\u2019s competition regulator blocked the 7.3 billion pound ($9.3 billion) takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s, saying it would mean higher prices for consumers.  The pair had wanted to combine to boost scale and buying power to better compete with market leader Tesco and counter the march of fast growing German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, and Amazon.  Asda said its like-for-like sales fell 1.1% in the three months to March 31. That compares with a rise of 1% in the previous quarter and ends a run of seven straight quarters of growth.  However, adjusting for the later Easter, Asda\u2019s like-for-like sales, excluding petrol, increased 0.5%, it said.  Asda said its gross profit rate and operating income both declined in the quarter, while higher operating expenses partly reflected costs associated with the failed merger.  \u201cWe remain entirely focused on delivering our strategy, without the benefits the proposed merger with Sainsbury\u2019s would have delivered,\u201d said Asda Chief Executive Roger Burnley.  He also cautioned: \u201cWhat has got us here, won\u2019t get us where we need to go \u2013 with the rate of change accelerating, we have a tough job to do and need to go even faster.\u201d  Burnley\u2019s strategy is focused on lower prices, more innovation in own-brand products, better store standards and improvements in its e-commerce operations.  He highlighted a 10% increase in online grocery sales in the quarter and increased penetration of Asda\u2019s own brand products. Asda plans another 80 million pounds of price cuts in the balance of 2019.  STOCK MARKET LISTING?  Of Britain\u2019s big four grocers Tesco appears to have the most momentum, having last month reported a 34% jump in full-year operating profit.  However, all of the big four, including No. 4 Morrisons, are still losing market share to the discounters.  The Sainsbury\u2019s deal had offered a potential exit route for Walmart from the UK.  When the deal was blocked analysts speculated that Walmart could try to sell Asda to private equity.  However, Walmart, which purchased Asda for 6.7 billion pounds in 1999, said on Tuesday it was \u201cseriously considering\u201d a path to a public listing for Asda, though it cautioned that any preparations for an IPO would \u201ctake years\u201d.  \u201cWe\u2019re focused on continuing to execute the strategy to strengthen Asda\u2019s long-term success, including the potential of an IPO at some point in the future,\u201d Walmart Chief Financial Officer, Brett Biggs said on Thursday.  \u201cWe\u2019ll be thoughtful and measured in our approach,\u201d he said.

The complaint, filed by the Rosen Law Firm and Farnan, alleged Walmart failed to inform shareholders that its pharmacies filled thousands of suspicious opioids prescriptions under a company policy that, according to the suit, kept pharmacists under pressure to fulfill orders instead of asking questions about prescribing doctors. The plaintiffs' firms claimed that the truth emerged on Dec. 22, when the Justice Department brought a sweeping enforcement action against the company, claiming Walmart committed thousands of violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The stock market reacted to the revelation of the alleged fraud, according to the complaint, by pushing Walmart\u2019s share price down by $2.75 per share after DOJ filed its suit. The shareholder firms described the $2.75 decline, from $146.23 high on Dec. 22, as \u201cprecipitous,\u201d although the drop was less than 2% of Walmart\u2019s share price.  I have questions.  I should say first that Walmart denies the Justice Department\u2019s allegations, arguing that the government\u2019s flawed legal theory \u201cunlawfully forces pharmacists to come between patients and their doctors,\u201d and the DOJ\u2019s suit is \u201criddled with factual inaccuracies and cherry-picked documents taken out of context.\u201d A Walmart spokesman said the company also disagrees with the allegations in the new shareholder fraud class action. \"We take these matters seriously,\" he said by email. We will defend this matter vigorously.\u201d  My big doubt about the class action is its assertion that the Justice Department\u2019s suit on Dec. 22 was a revelation to the market. Walmart itself revealed two months before the DOJ suit that it was under government scrutiny for its opioid prescription practices. The company filed an unusual declaratory judgment suit, in federal court in Sherman, Texas, seeking a judicial ruling that the government\u2019s interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act was wrong. Walmart\u2019s complaint disclosed that DOJ had previously contemplated a criminal case against the company \u2013 Walmart said the indictment threat was entirely unwarranted and was intended to extract a big payout to the government \u2013 and that even after ditching the prospect of criminal charges, the Justice Department was planning a civil enforcement action against the company.  Walmart filed that suit on Oct. 22. That day, its opening share price of $144.11 declined to a closing price of $143.03, although it was back up to nearly $144 by the opening of trading on Oct. 23. The market, in other words, did not react with particular alarm to Walmart\u2019s disclosure that it was in DOJ\u2019s crosshairs.  That could be because the market already knew, even by the time of Walmart\u2019s declaratory judgment suit in October, that DOJ was scrutinizing Walmart\u2019s opioid prescription practices. Pro Publica reported in March 2020 that Texas prosecutors had been investigating Walmart\u2019s opioid dispensing protocols for two years and had tried to convince high-ups in Washington to bring a criminal case. Pro Publica\u2019s story was published on March 25. Walmart\u2019s share price declined more than $3 that day, from nearly $113 to an opening price on March 26 of $109.40.  After the Pro Publica story, three institutional investors demanded to see Walmart corporate records documenting the board\u2019s knowledge of the company\u2019s opioid dispensing practices as well as the board\u2019s response to private and government investigations of those practices. The pension funds ended up suing in Delaware Chancery Court to obtain access to Walmart books and records. In October, Vice Chancellor Travis Laster ordered the company to turn over a broad swath of corporate documents to plaintiffs' lawyers from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, Labaton Sucharow and Berman Tabacco.  Walmart argued in the Delaware books-and-records case that it had disclosed its exposure to liability for its opioid prescription policies all the way back in 2018. In an SEC filing in June 2018, the company said it had \u201cbeen responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from government entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing practices involving the sale of opioids.\u201d  When I reported in October on the Walmart books-and-records case, I predicted that plaintiffs' lawyers were gearing up for a breach-of-duty case against the company\u2019s board. The prospects for a fraud class action, I said at the time, seemed less attractive because the company\u2019s share price didn\u2019t respond dramatically to revelations of its potential liability for filling allegedly suspicious opioid prescriptions. So far, there\u2019s been no breach-of-duty suit against Walmart board members. Lawyers from Bernstein Litowitz and Labaton didn\u2019t respond to my emails asking about their plans.  I still think shareholders will have an uphill fight in a fraud class action in which they will ultimately have to show that Walmart\u2019s alleged failure to disclose problematic opioid dispensing practices impacted the company\u2019s share price. Between the March Pro Publica story that first revealed DOJ\u2019s contemplation of criminal charges and the DOJ enforcement action in December, Walmart\u2019s share price actually rose by $30. And since the DOJ suit, Walmart shares have generally traded within a narrow range of prices between $144 and $149 \u2013 slightly higher, if anything, than the share price before DOJ filed its enforcement action.  Laurence Rosen and Phillip Kim of The Rosen Firm didn\u2019t respond to my email asking about when the alleged Walmart fraud was actually disclosed. And I know, initial shareholder fraud class actions are often a skeletal version of the amended complaint filed by lead counsel after the lead plaintiff selection process. It will be up to whomever is picked to head the case to develop a cogent theory of the alleged fraud\u2019s impact on the market for Walmart shares.  I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s not going to be easy.","192":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N said on Monday it will partner with U.S. movie studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to create content for its Vudu video-on-demand service, which the retailer bought eight years ago.  Walmart has been trying to prop up Vudu's monthly viewership that remains well below that of competitors like Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Hulu LLC, which is controlled by Walt Disney Co DIS.N, Comcast Corp CMCSA.O and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOXA.O.  Media outlets have reported that Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart was looking to launch a subscription streaming video service to rival Netflix and make a foray into producing television shows to attract customers.  But company sources have told Reuters that Walmart is not planning such a move and the company does not intend to spend billions of dollars on producing or acquiring exclusive content as of now. The retailer continues, however, to look at options to boost its video-on-demand business and offer programs that target customers who live outside of big cities.  Walmart and MGM will make the announcement at the NewFronts conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday and unveil the name of the first production under the partnership, which Walmart will license from MGM.  \u201cUnder this partnership, MGM will create exclusive content based on their extensive library of iconic IP (intellectual property), and that content will premiere exclusively on the Vudu platform,\u201d Walmart spokesman Justin Rushing told Reuters.  The focus will be on family-friendly content that Walmart customers prefer, Rushing said.  These shows will be exclusively licensed for a period of time to Vudu for North America, and available on Vudu\u2019s free, ad-supported service Movies On Us. Vudu will also commission and license original shows from other sources.  The first MGM-produced short-form original series for Vudu is likely to debut in the first quarter of 2019 on Movies On Us.  The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  Licensing content is a cost-effective strategy at a time when producing original content has become costly. As of July, Netflix said it was spending $8 billion a year on original and acquired content. Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O programming budget for Prime Video was more than $4 billion, while U.S. broadcaster HBO, owned by AT&T Inc T.N, said it will spend $2.7 billion this year.  Walmart also plans to roll out a new video ad format for Movies On Us, which will allow viewers to make purchases from Walmart.com.  Walmart acquired Vudu in 2010 to safeguard against declining in-store sales of DVDs. Walmart bet customers would continue to buy and rent movies and move their titles to a digital library, which Vudu would create and maintain for viewers.  But the video site has not posed a significant challenge to rivals that dominate the segment even though it is preloaded or can be downloaded to millions of smart televisions and video-game consoles.  Vudu offers 150,000 titles to buy or rent, while its free, ad-supported streaming service, called Movies On Us, includes 5,000 movies and TV shows.  There are currently more than 200 video services that bypass cable providers and stream content directly to a TV, laptop, phone or game console. That is up from 68 services five years ago, according to market researcher Parks Associates.","193":"NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc on Thursday reported a 33-percent rise in U.S. e-commerce sales during the first quarter, slower than during the same period a year ago but faster than the previous quarter\u2019s 23-percent advance.

On Tuesday, CVS said the companies had failed to agree on pricing and that Walmart was leaving the pharmacy network for prescription drug plans that CVS manages for companies and health insurers and for the government-run Medicaid program for low-income people.  Walmart and CVS also said on Tuesday they were still in discussions.  CVS shares gained 1.6 percent to $64.76 in premarket trading, recouping some of the stock\u2019s losses on Tuesday.  \u201cWe view the agreement positively for CVS,\u201d Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper said in a research note, explaining that the loss of Walmart pharmacies could have negatively impacted CVS\u2019 ability to sign up customers for its 2020 prescription drug plans.  Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the speed at which the dispute was resolved likely points to the negotiating strength of pharmacy benefit managers in contract discussions. Consumers historically move to where their insurance is accepted, and Walmart likely would have lost out on the estimated 15 million to 20 million prescriptions it receives from CVS customers, Muken said.  In 2012, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA.O and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, now part of Cigna Corp CI.N, failed to come to contract terms. Walgreens sales fell as it stopped filling prescriptions for Express Scripts customers, and the two companies reached a new agreement in the middle of the year that put Walgreens back in its network.  In addition to its retail pharmacies and stores, CVS is one of the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy benefit managers and, after buying Aetna, one of its top health insurance companies. Its prescription plans for those on the government-run Medicare program were unaffected by the contract dispute as was its Sam\u2019s Club agreements.

AIOVA\u2019s case alleged Flipkart was not adhering to a section of India\u2019s anti-trust laws that says companies should not abuse a dominant market position through \u201cunfair or discriminatory\u201d pricing.  \u201cLooking at the present market construct and structure of online marketplace platforms market in India, it does not appear that any one player in the market is commanding any dominant position at this stage of evolution of market,\u201d the Commission said in its ruling.  The Commission added its \u201cconsidered opinion\u201d was that Amazon has also not broken the rules.  AIOVA has also brought a similar case against Amazon, alleging it favors merchants that it partly owns, such as Cloudtail and Appario.  Chanakya Basa, a lawyer for AIOVA, said his client planned to appeal the decision.  \u201cBy their own admission Flipkart claims they are the dominant player,\u201d he said.  Flipkart and Amazon could not be immediately reached for comment. Amazon has previously denied the allegations against it.  India has a burgeoning e-commerce market, with almost 500 million Indians using the internet in 2018. The market is tipped to grow to $200 billion in a decade, according to Morgan Stanley.

FILE PHOTO - A worker walks past the pharmacy in a new Walmart Express store in Chicago July 26, 2011. REUTERS\/John Gress  Large U.S. companies have started tightly managing how employees and their family members use these popular discount, or copay, cards for everything from multiple sclerosis treatments to widely-used rheumatoid arthritis medications sold through a specialty pharmacy.  The move reflects their frustration that the coupons, which lower patient out-of-pocket spending, can be a disincentive to seeking less expensive treatments and drive up health plan costs.  For certain therapies, the insurance programs extract more money from the drugmaker or redirect the employee to a cheaper medicine, according to benefits experts.  Home Depot's program, run by CVS Health CVS.N, has a particular focus on therapies for cystic fibrosis, hepatitis C, cancer, HIV, psoriasis, pulmonary arterial hypertension and hyperlipidemia, or extremely high cholesterol, according to health plan documents provided to Reuters.  The company, which has 400,000 employees, said the program affects fewer than 1 percent of its plan members.  Yet those participants can have an outsized impact on spending because of how costly it is to treat their conditions.  Specialty drugs can account for more than half of a corporate health plan\u2019s spending on medicines, according to benefits consultant Mercer.  Employers who use the most comprehensive program at CVS can save up to 7 percent on their total specialty medication costs, CVS told Reuters.  Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O, the largest U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits and the manager of Walmart's program, has a similar broad-reaching program across specialty medications. But it also offers a more aggressive focus on hepatitis C, oral oncology drugs and hereditary angioedema treatments.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  CONCERNED DRUGMAKERS  The programs, known as copay \u201caccumulators\u201d and copay \u201cmaximizers,\u201d are expected to expand in the next two years, from about 25 percent of U.S. employers to as much as 50 percent, according to the National Business Group on Health.  Drugmakers \u201care concerned about it because the bottom line is that it will cost them more money,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, the group\u2019s chief executive.  Drugmakers are worried about the hit to profits if many more employers sign on. They are also concerned because they cannot easily track when the programs are being used.  Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N executives said last week that copay accumulator programs were having an impact on its Taltz psoriasis drug and Forteo for osteoporosis, but that it did not feel there was \"significant exposure.\"  Pfizer PFE.N and AstraZeneca AZN.L executives said in recent interviews with Reuters that they are monitoring the effect of these programs.  \u201cThe impact on our business is relatively limited, but it is a concern,\u201d said Ruud Dobber, who heads Britain-based AstraZeneca\u2019s U.S. commercial operations.  AbbVie ABBV.N, maker of top-selling arthritis treatment Humira, said in April it expects moderately higher spending on copay assistance this year.  BYPASSING THE COPAY  More than 170 million Americans have health coverage through their employers and pay some portion of their prescription drug costs, amounting to up to thousands of dollars a year in copayments. Employers say that keeps workers aware of the rising cost of medicines and more likely to accept cheaper alternatives, where possible.  Drugmakers have tried to bypass that requirement to keep patients using their medicines. They offer discount cards that keep the patient\u2019s payment low, say at $25, when they fill a prescription. The drugmaker pays the remainder required by the health plan, thwarting employers\u2019 intentions.  Pharmaceutical industry spending on copay cards has more than doubled to $7 billion over the past five years, mostly due to coupons offered on higher-cost specialty drugs, according to consultancy ZS Associates.  The programs at Express Scripts and CVS, which manage prescription drug benefits for employers, change how this works.  A copay \u201caccumulator\u201d recognizes when an employee uses a drugmaker discount card and makes sure that money does not apply toward their annual out-of-pocket spending requirement.  When the copay card runs out of money, a patient must either cover the full copay cost, get a new discount card, or stop filling the prescription. The program can apply to almost any drug coupon used at a pharmacy working with the pharmacy benefit manager.  A copay \u201cmaximizer\u201d is more limited in scope, but potentially as costly to the drugmaker. They apply only to a short list of drugs that employees purchase from specialty pharmacies run by Express Scripts and CVS.  In maximizer programs some benefit managers, including Express Scripts, make sure patients sign up to receive copay cards from the manufacturers. They then raise the patient\u2019s required copayment to tap the discount cards for the maximum amount set by a drugmaker, which can be more than $10,000 annually for pricey drugs.  New Jersey-based pharma and managed care consultancy Zitter Health Insights estimates that there are more than 41 million Americans in plans that use an accumulator and 9 million in plans with the maximizer approach. It is not clear how much overlap there is between the two as some employers use both.","203":"LONDON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of Walmart, paid its parent a 1.15 billion pound ($1.52 billion) inter company dividend of surplus cash in March this year, according to Asda\u2019s annual report and accounts for 2019 published on Friday.

The world\u2019s largest retailer applied for six patents last year on drones that aim to prevent damage to crops, control pest attacks on farms and cross-pollinate plants, according to U.S. Patents and Trademark Office documents that were made public last week and seen by Reuters.  Groceries make up 56 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue and Walmart may see drone technology as one way to get food from farms to store shelves faster and more cheaply to compete with Amazon.com Inc, following its purchase of Whole Foods Market last year and the expansion of discount chains like Aldi and Lidl.  In one application, Walmart seeks to patent a system that would use drones to identify crop-damaging pests and then dispense insecticides on the critters. Another suggests the use of drones carrying pollen dispensers to successfully pollinate crops.  Using technology to precisely apply pesticides rather than spraying entire fields can benefit the environment and save money for farmers. As part of a sustainability push in recent years, Walmart has also worked with suppliers to reduce the amount of fertilizer used to grow crops because it can pollute the environment.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company always looks for new ways to serve shoppers better but had no comment on the filings. The retailer applies for dozens of patents a year and many do not result in commercial products.  Walmart previously applied for a patent involving drones that could monitor crops\u2019 growing conditions and send data to stores about when and from where produce might arrive, said Zoe Leavitt, a senior analyst from data intelligence firm CB Insights, which analyzes corporate patent filings. The series of six applications indicates Walmart is looking into farming more seriously, she said.  Walmart has so far applied for 46 patents for using drone technology, mostly to facilitate its delivery and logistics operations, or for use within warehouses to do things such as track inventory, according to data from CB Insights.  In U.S. agriculture, drones are most often used to survey farms that can span hundreds of acres. The devices fly above fields and take photos that help growers estimate the size of upcoming harvests or identify problems, such as weed infestations and nutrient deficiencies.  Other industries have also turned to drones, with AT&T Inc using the devices to look at cellphone towers in Texas last year after Hurricane Harvey. Insurers such as Allstate Corp use them to assess property damage. \u201cThe technology is very powerful and using that to control the supply chain as far out as possible will offer Walmart a distinct advantage over rivals,\u201d said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click.  The market for agricultural drones will top $1 billion by 2024, up from about $338 million in 2016, according to research firm Global Market Insights. However, Walmart\u2019s patent applications stand out because they indicate the company sees greater potential to address problems on farms, rather than simply spot them, said David Dvorak, chief executive officer for Field of View, a U.S. company that sells drone camera systems. \u201cIt sounds like Walmart is trying to develop a complete system that can actually do something about it,\u201d Dvorak said.  The patent push involving agricultural technology harks back to McDonald Corp\u2019s efforts in the 1960s to patent the processing of potatoes into French fries so it could reliably deliver consistent quality fries at the lowest cost in massive volumes.  \u201cCompanies like Walmart for a long time have created sustainability initiatives and this is really where the rubber is meeting the road,\u201d said Jayson Lusk, head of agricultural economics at Purdue University.  Such environmental-focused initiatives can be attractive to consumers, Lusk said. Eventually Walmart, which is courting more urban, higher income and health conscious shoppers for their online grocery business, could require suppliers to buy food from farmers who use agricultural technology to reduce chemicals to produce crops, he said.  \u201cA way how this might come down is the imposition of standards on their suppliers,\u201d Lusk said.","205":"Feb 8 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc :  * WALMART - WALMART BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADDS SQUARE INC CFO SARAH FRIAR  * WALMART - BOARD APPOINTED SARAH FRIAR, CFO OF SQUARE INC, AS NEW INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR TO CO'S BOARD, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY Source text: (bit.ly\/2nVr1GL) Further company coverage:","206":"Walmart Inc was sued on Tuesday by an advertising agency that claimed the world\u2019s largest retailer used its copyrighted photo of a smoked ham without permission.

Shares of the world\u2019s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer fell more than 9 percent after the company reported a lower-than-expected profit and posted a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period.  Target dipped 2.6 percent, while Costco Wholesale dropped 1.6 percent, dragging the S&P consumer staples index down 1.62 percent.  Amazon was up 0.9 percent.  Other big decliner was Qualcomm, which fell nearly 4 percent after the chipmaker raised its offer to buy NXP Semiconductors NV to $127.50 per share from $110. NXP shares rose 6.2 percent.  \u201cThe markets were indicating a lower open last night and an increase to the downside came after Walmart reported an earnings miss. We\u2019re also seeing yields move up above the 2.80\/2.91, and that has markets a little bit concerned,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth in New York.  At 9:37 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.32 percent at 25,138.98 and the S&P 500 fell 0.17 percent to 2,727.46. The Nasdaq Composite was down just 0.01 percent, at 7,238.57.  The S&P 500 racked up its biggest weekly increase in five years last week, easing fears that a deeper market correction was taking hold after a handful of large daily losses at the start of February.  The spark for those falls was a rise in U.S. bond yields, however, and benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yields hit four-year highs of 2.8950 percent on Tuesday.  The S&P financial index was up 0.7 percent, led by gains in Wells Fargo and JPMorgan & Chase.  \u201cThe market views rising interest rates as potentially getting a little bit ahead of themselves. The bond market is oversold, the yield environment is overbought, but that has not stopped the slowdown in equities,\u201d said Pavlik.

Traders are pricing in an 83.1 percent chance that the Fed will raise its main rates again in March, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool.  Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the CBOE volatility index, also edged up to 20.9, slightly above Friday\u2019s close of 19.46, but way off the 50 points it hit during the peak of the sell-off.  Rite Aid rose 6.3 percent after grocery chain operator Albertsons Companies said it would buy the part of the drug retailer that is not being bought by Walgreens Boots .  Snapchat operator Snap slid 5.4 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to \u201csell\u201d, arguing negative reviews on an app redesign might lead to a decline in users.  Home Depot rose nearly 1.6 percent after the largest U.S. home improvement chain\u2019s quarterly profit beat market estimates for the sixth straight quarter.  Of the 399 companies in the S&P 500 that reported fourth quarter earnings through Friday, 76.4 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.

The tough tactics come as the two giants battle for supremacy in one of their most important foreign markets, one that Walmart currently dominates.  Walmart last year demanded discounts from food businesses whose products it found priced lower on the Mexican website of Amazon.com Inc, the people said, even though suppliers had no say in the Seattle retailer\u2019s decision to undercut Walmart on price.  Two suppliers told Reuters they moved swiftly to pull their brands from Amazon, wary of jeopardizing their relationship with Walmart de Mexico. The companies, both of which sell common pantry goods, said Walmart accounts for more than half their supermarket sales in Mexico.  Walmart would not discuss its competition with Amazon in Mexico or the allegations made by suppliers. It told Reuters it does not dictate with whom vendors can do business. But it acknowledged it always presses for the lowest prices, particularly if competitors are giving shoppers a better deal.  \u201cWe could never tell anybody that they can\u2019t sell to someone else,\u201d Ignacio Caride, Walmart Mexico\u2019s e-commerce head, told Reuters.  \u201cIf we think there\u2019s an opportunity to lower our prices, because we see better prices at other retailers, we\u2019re going to negotiate for that access,\u201d he said.  The company said in a statement that it aims to offer the lowest possible prices to benefit consumers, and doesn\u2019t subsidize losses for some products with revenues from others.  Amazon declined to comment.  Walmart is Mexico\u2019s largest retailer, commanding nearly 60 percent of the country\u2019s supermarket sales through more than 2,400 Walmart, Superama, Sam\u2019s Club and Bodega Aurrera stores. Its online business in Mexico is growing fast, but it represented just 1.4 percent of revenue last year.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Amazon launched its Mexican website in 2015 and is now one of the country\u2019s biggest online retailers. It began selling groceries here in August.  Supermarket analyst Bill Bishop said Walmart wants to avoid a repeat of its experience in the United States, where Amazon quickly took the lead in online grocery sales. Walmart Inc\u2019s Mexico unit is its second-largest overseas market by sales after the United Kingdom, on par with Canada.  \u201cThey\u2019re worried that Amazon will grow in Mexico,\u201d said Bishop, co-founder of retail advisory firm Brick Meets Click in Barrington, Illinois.  \u201cThey\u2019re saying: Be aware of the fact that we\u2019re not going to make it easy for you to grow here,\u201d he said.  The two Mexican suppliers who spoke to Reuters said they were caught in the crossfire. They said their wholesale prices were the same for both retailers, but that Amazon chose to sell their products to consumers more cheaply than Walmart did.  Instead of lowering its retail prices to match those of Amazon, Walmart took it out on them, the vendors said. Walmart docked their payments by the retail price difference, multiplied by the amount of stock in its inventory, a move that cost them tens of thousands of dollars collectively, the people said.  Both said they entered into talks with Amazon shortly afterward to drop their products. They said they could not afford continued financial clawbacks from Walmart. Nor could they risk losing their biggest customer, despite the huge sales potential offered by Amazon\u2019s platform.  \u201cIt\u2019s a threat, and it\u2019s coercion,\u201d one of the people said of Walmart\u2019s strategy.  Emails between Amazon and one of the food companies, seen by Reuters, support the version of events described by suppliers. Two other people familiar with the matter who have expertise in e-commerce in Mexico gave similar accounts.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  A cellphone message sent by another supplier to one of the e-commerce professionals discussing its woes with Walmart, reviewed by Reuters, likewise confirmed the situation.  PLAYING HARDBALL  Experts say Walmart\u2019s pressure on its suppliers in Mexico is unlikely to have legal repercussions. Miguel Flores, a former member of Mexico\u2019s competition commission, said a government investigation into abuse of dominant market power would be complex, lengthy and hard to prove.  Mexico\u2019s competition regulator declined to comment.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest bricks-and-mortar retailer, and Amazon, the No. 1 online seller, are vying for consumer loyalty worldwide.  Both companies have been pressuring suppliers for the lowest prices on goods from t-shirts to bicycles. And Walmart has spent big to build up its shopping website, delivery network and cloud computing infrastructure to compete with Amazon online.  Still, Amazon has raced ahead in online food shopping. It notched $3.4 billion in U.S. grocery sales last year compared with Walmart\u2019s $2 billion in U.S. online food sales, according to Boston-based research firm Edge by Ascential.  Amazon\u2019s grocery selection in Mexico currently is limited to non-perishables, such as coffee, beer, pasta and canned vegetables. Walmart offers a wider selection, including fresh foods such as lettuce and chicken.  Walmart brought its concerns about Amazon\u2019s lower prices to a number of food suppliers in Mexico, including multinational firms, around the time that Amazon launched its food and drinks web page, said two of the people in Mexico\u2019s e-commerce industry who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of business relationships.  They said some of the biggest firms figured out ways to appease Walmart, such as packaging their products for Amazon in sizes different from those sold at Walmart, they said.  But many of the smaller companies lacked the know-how to negotiate, they said.  Bishop, the supermarket analyst, said Mexican suppliers feel enormous pressure to stick with Walmart, at least for now.  \u201cThe dilemma is that Amazon is a very rapidly growing channel,\u201d he said.","209":"A group of pharmacy operators including Walmart Inc, CVS Rx Services Inc and Walgreen Co that they would not agree to go to trial on Nov. 9 in a case accusing them of contributing to the opioid epidemic because of the risks posed by COVID-19.

Flipkart and Amazon began their flagship annual sales on Saturday, with both vying for customers during the October-December festive season when Indians make most of their big-ticket purchases.  This comes as growth slows in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy, denting sales of everything from cars to cookies, and prompting the government to step in with tax cuts and a raft of other measures to revive growth.  Amazon reported record sales of about 7.5 billion rupees ($7.07 million) in 36 hours in the premium smartphone brands category, while Flipkart said all major categories, including beauty, baby care, private labels and furniture, saw double-digit sales growth from a year ago in the first day.

Earlier this month, a leading trader body asked the government to ban the festive sales, citing that the deep discounts they offered was violating the country\u2019s foreign investment rules for online retail.

He also cited pickup towers in stores to boost online sales and various e-commerce delivery options.  Grocery sales make up 56 percent of Walmart\u2019s revenue, and McMillon emphasized Walmart\u2019s advantage in the food category, an area that Amazon is trying to crack, particularly following its acquisition last year of organic grocer Whole Foods. He said Walmart can offer fresh food within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population.  Walmart is doubling down on online grocery delivery and pickup options. By the end of the year, 800 U.S. stores will offer grocery delivery and more than 2,000 will offer a pickup service.  The company also said it has brought more merchandise in the toy category this year and has permanently expanded space to stock toys in 235 stores in order to win the category after the collapse of Toys R Us.  \u201cThere is a lot of toy volume up for grabs this year,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said.  Walmart\u2019s shares were up 1.99 percent at $95.69 per share in afternoon trading.  E-COMMERCE GROWTH TO SLOW  Walmart\u2019s earnings next year will be eroded by its $16 billion acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart in May, its largest-ever deal, to compete with Amazon in an important growth market. Walmart at the time had indicated the deal would lead to a per-share earnings hit of 25 to 30 cents this fiscal year and 60 cents next fiscal year.  The lower forecasts for earnings and online sales come after Walmart posted its best quarterly U.S. sales growth in a decade for its second fiscal quarter ended July 31, helped by lower unemployment and tax cuts that boosted consumers\u2019 spending power.  Walmart now expects to earn between $4.65 and $4.80 per share for fiscal 2019, down from an earlier forecast of $4.90 to $5.05 per share.  Walmart estimates a 35 percent growth rate for its online business in the fiscal year ending in January 2020, against expectations for 40 percent growth in the current fiscal year. Walmart said the 35 percent growth rate will be off a bigger base. The company\u2019s e-commerce business is also expected to post a slightly greater operating loss next year, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said.  The company has made several efforts in the past year to boost online traffic. These include a website redesign, more online grocery offerings and acquisition of fashion brands to improve its appeal to millennial shoppers, who typically have avoided purchasing on the retailer\u2019s websites.  Walmart has been on an acquisition spree in the U.S. online fashion space, buying lingerie retailer Bare Necessities last week after purchasing plus-sized clothing startup Eloquii a week earlier.  Over the years, Walmart has worked to use physical locations as distribution points for online orders of groceries and other goods in order to retain buyers who increasingly expect quick, cheap shipping.  With a steady rise in online shopping, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales growth has been outstripping brick-and-mortar sales, leading the company to slash new store openings. The retailer plans to open fewer than 10 U.S. stores in the next fiscal year.  For fiscal 2020, Walmart expects comparable sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. That follows expected growth of about 3 percent this year, which would be the fastest pace since 2008.  Overall sales growth during fiscal 2020 is likely to be 3 percent or more, but could be negatively impacted by the sale of operations in Brazil and a planned reduction in tobacco sales at Walmart-owned warehouse chain Sam\u2019s Club.  Walmart also expects earnings to decline by a low single-digit percentage range compared with fiscal 2019 due to the Flipkart deal. Excluding the impact, it is expected to rise by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage range.","212":"Nov 13 (Reuters) - Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Walmart-owned Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart Group, Binny Bansal, has resigned effective immediately, Walmart Inc said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.  \u201cHis decision follows an independent investigation done on behalf of Flipkart and Walmart into an allegation of serious personal misconduct,\u201d Walmart said in a statement, adding that Bansal has strongly denied the allegations.

The near-doubling of online sales in the second quarter helped the retailer trounce Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit and same-store sales.  The results showed that the unprecedented spike in demand seen by big-box retailers at the peak of the coronavirus lockdowns has remained strong even as restrictions ease, with shoppers using their stimulus checks to shop for discretionary items like sneakers and clothes.

Department store chain Kohl's KSS.N also pointed to softer trends for its back-to-school selling season due to the uncertainty around reopenings. Kohl's shares were down 12%.  Despite recording $1.5 billion in COVID-19 related expenses, that include higher wages and bonuses for employees, Walmart said its margins improved in the quarter, helped by stimulus checks that had consumers spending on bigger ticket items like home furnishings and apparel.  Walmart\u2019s online and grocery businesses have been bright spots, seeing rapid growth as it expands same-day delivery options and pick-up services.  Its U.S. online sales rose 97% in the quarter.

Judith McKenna, the Walmart International CEO, told Asda managers at an event in Leeds, northern England, on Tuesday: \u201cWhile we are not rushing into anything, I want you to know that we are seriously considering a path to an IPO - a public listing - to strengthen your long-term success.\u201d  But she cautioned that any preparations for an IPO would \u201ctake years\u201d, according to comments released by Asda afterwards.  Britain\u2019s competition regulator ruled Sainsbury\u2019s 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) takeover of Asda could not proceed, blocking one potential exit route for Walmart from the UK.  The decision prompted analysts to speculate that Walmart would try to sell Asda to private equity or consider a stock market listing for the business, which it paid 6.7 billion pounds to acquire in 1999.  McKenna\u2019s comments are the first time Walmart has publicly addressed its future strategy for Asda since the Sainsbury\u2019s deal collapsed.  \u201cWalmart does not have a one-size-fits-all approach to operating its international markets, but a consistent focus on strong local businesses powered by Walmart,\u201d she said.  Asda has reported seven consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth thanks to a strategy focused on lower prices, more innovation in own-brand products, better store standards and improvements in its e-commerce operations.  Monthly industry data produced by researcher Kantar indicates that Asda will likely report an eighth quarter of growth when it updates on trading on Thursday.  CEO Roger Burnley told managers at the Leeds meeting there would be 80 million pounds of price cuts throughout the rest of 2019.  Asda\u2019s strategy is working, he said, but noted it would be harder to deliver the strategy at the same pace without the synergies that the Sainsbury\u2019s deal would have provided.","216":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A union representing workers at Walmart Inc\u2019s Mexico unit said on Monday it would go on strike next month if it did not secure better pay and conditions for thousands of employees.

(Reuters) - Britain\u2019s competition regulator on Thursday blocked Sainsbury\u2019s proposed 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) takeover of Walmart-owned Asda - a huge blow to the supermarket groups who wanted to combine to overtake market leader Tesco.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ruling is also a major setback for Sainsbury\u2019s Chief Executive Mike Coupe, the architect of the deal and the group\u2019s boss since 2014. For Walmart , the deal was a way to exit Britain, one of the weakest performers in its global portfolio, as it moves to revamp its international operations.  Sainsbury\u2019s Coupe made unwanted headlines when he was caught on camera singing: \u201cWe\u2019re in the money\u201d shortly after the deal was announced last April. Analysts said questions will be raised over his future after it failed to win approval.  The deal would have resulted in a substantial lessening of competition at both a national and local level, with prices rising in stores, online and at petrol stations, the CMA said.  Coupe took issue with the CMA\u2019s analysis.  \u201cThe specific reason for wanting to merge was to lower prices for customers,\u201d he said in a statement.  \u201cThe CMA\u2019s conclusion that we would increase prices post-merger ignores the dynamic and highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market. The CMA is today effectively taking 1 billion pounds out of customers\u2019 pockets.\u201d  Sainsbury\u2019s, Walmart and Asda said they had mutually agreed to terminate the transaction, opting not to challenge the CMA\u2019s ruling through the courts.  Walmart International CEO Judith McKenna said she was disappointed but will focus on positioning ASDA as \u201ca strong UK retailer delivering for customers. Walmart will ensure Asda has the resources it needs to achieve that,\u201d she said.  Analysts and investors in the United States said the deal\u2019s failure is a setback for Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, slowing the drive toward profitability in its overseas operations.  The U.S. retailer has been focused on turning around its international business by targeting higher growth markets such as China and India and exiting or tying up with local players elsewhere. For instance, it sold a majority stake in its Brazilian business and acquired a majority interest in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart in its biggest-ever deal last year.  Nevertheless, analysts believe the company will recover.  \u201cIt is a sticking point but not a disaster,\u201d said Laura Kennedy, vice president, retail sales and shopper practice at Kantar Consulting. \u201cThey were going to keep share in ASDA and were not completely cutting it loose.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Shopping bags from Asda and Sainsbury's are seen in Manchester, Britain April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Phil Noble\/illustration  Jason Benowitz, fund manager with the Roosevelt Investment Group, said Walmart can afford to be patient with ASDA.  \u201cThis news is an obstacle to maneuver around but hardly a crisis from Bentonville\u2019s perspective,\u201d he said, adding that UK sales at Walmart make up only 6 percent of its total worldwide revenue.  A source with direct knowledge of the matter said Walmart is in no rush to make a decision on the fate of the business, pointing to ASDA\u2019s recently improved performance.  ASDA has reported seven consecutive quarters of growth, helped by improvements in its e-commerce operations and low prices. It also leapfrogged Sainsbury\u2019s last month to become the second-biggest supermarket operator behind Tesco Plc in the UK, according to data from Kantar.  Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s were down 4.7 percent in London, extending their losses over the last three months to 23 percent. Walmart was up 0.1 percent per share in New York.  SHOPPERS WORSE OFF  After delivering a damning provisional report in February, the CMA\u2019s final report was equally stern, finding that UK shoppers and motorists would be worse off if Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda combined.  \u201cWe have concluded that there is no effective way of addressing our concerns, other than to block the merger,\u201d said Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA inquiry group.  In the past year, Sainsbury\u2019s share of the UK grocery market has dropped from 15.8 percent to 15.3 percent, while Asda\u2019s has fallen from 15.6 percent to 15.3 percent, according to Kantar data.  All of the UK\u2019s big four grocers have lost share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which now have a combined 13.6 percent share. Tesco has 27.4 percent.  Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda have argued their share of the total market for food was smaller than the data indicated because of the emergence of new players like delivery services, but the regulator was not persuaded.  Coupe said he was confident in Sainsbury\u2019s strategy, which focuses on own-brand products, and on the quality, provenance and ethical credentials of its food.  IMPLICATIONS  The implications of the deal failing are likely to be significant. Some analysts believe Sainsbury\u2019s will have to undergo a major shake-up that could see new Chairman Martin Scicluna part company with Coupe.  Analysts at Jefferies believe the risk of a reinvigorated market leader Tesco continuing to recover customers historically lost to Sainsbury\u2019s needs to be urgently addressed.  With one potential exit route from Britain for Walmart blocked, analysts have said the U.S. group might instead consider a stock market listing of Asda or try to sell it to private equity.  Walmart acquired ASDA in 1999 and the acquisition has since generated cash and paid more than 3 billion pounds ($3.87 billion) in dividends to its U.S. parent.  The Sunday Times reported in February that private equity group KKR was mulling an offer for Asda.  But both of these avenues are problematic.  \u201cThe problem with the idea of private equity is that the only way PE makes money is to have its own exit, and there isn\u2019t one because you can\u2019t break-up Asda now,\u201d one senior UK supermarket director told Reuters.  \u201cThe problem with an IPO is \u2013 what growth prospects are you selling? The story to investors is not a very good one,\u201d he said, adding that Walmart may decide to run Asda as a profit center and simply instruct CEO Roger Burnley to make them more money.","224":"(Reuters) -  Shopping carts are seen outside a new Wal-Mart Express store in Chicago July 26, 2011. REUTERS\/John Gress\/Files  U.S. retailer Walmart Inc is in early-stage talks with health insurer Humana Inc about developing closer ties, with the acquisition of Humana being discussed as one possibility, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  Should the talks lead to a tieup, it would be the latest deal to bring together a retail chain and a health insurer in the last few months, following CVS Health Corp\u2019s $69 billion deal to acquire Aetna Inc and Cigna Corp\u2019s $54 billion deal to buy Express Scripts Holding Co.  Walmart approached Humana earlier this month and the deliberations are preliminary, two of the sources said. While the conversations have focused on new partnerships, an acquisition of Humana by Walmart is also something being discussed, the sources added.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Humana and Walmart declined to comment.  Walmart and Humana have market capitalizations of $264 billion and $37 billion, respectively.  An acquisition of Humana would represent a significant strategic shift for Walmart, which is the world\u2019s largest retailer and has been focused on fending off Amazon.com Inc in online shopping.  Amazon has also been looking at entering the healthcare sector. Earlier this year, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co, said they would form a company aimed at cutting healthcare costs for their U.S. employees.  \u201cThe risks (for Walmart) of becoming entangled in the complex U.S. healthcare industry are considerable, especially at a time when Walmart is grappling with the competitive challenges of a rapidly shifting retail market,\u201d Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note.  \u201cThe hammering out of any agreement, which would be Walmart\u2019s largest ever corporate deal, would, of itself, be an enormous distraction,\u201d Saunders added.  Walmart currently has a co-branded Medicare drug plan with Humana that steers patients to Walmart stores. The partnership offers a prescription drug plan that can save up to 20 percent in drug costs for customers.  Closer ties between the two companies could allow Walmart to tap into Humana\u2019s patient population, expanding low-level medical services in its pharmacies to avoid ER visits. They could allow it to better manage prescription drug use though access to medical records.  Humana\u2019s biggest business is managing Medicare Advantage health plans for older and disabled people, a heavily regulated business that Walmart would have to take on in an acquisition.  Memberships in retail Medicare Advantage plans - where individuals sign up directly with Humana - rose about 1 percent to 2.86 million, as of Dec. 31. Employer or other group-based Medicare Advantage membership climbed 24 percent to 441,400.  Last month, Walmart reported a sharp drop in profit and online sales growth during the critical holiday period and forecast annual profit at the lower end of expectations.","225":"Feb 10 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc's plan to buy TikTok's U.S. operations has been pushed back indefinitely, as President Joe Biden reviews Donald Trump's efforts to address potential security risks from Chinese tech companies, the Wall Street journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Walmart will offer the service in upstate New York, while ShopRite and Amazon will service the New York City area.  Food stamps are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides free food to some 40 million Americans, or about 12 percent of the total U.S. population.  \u201cPeople who receive SNAP benefits should have the opportunity to shop for food the same way more and more Americans shop for food \u2013 by ordering and paying for groceries online,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company has nearly 275 stores that offer grocery pickup in the nine states eligible for the pilot.  Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, in a blog post on Thursday said New York customers can shop on AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry without requiring a membership fee.  \u201cAmazon believes the program will dramatically increase access to food for more remote customers and help to mitigate the public health crisis of food deserts,\u201d the retailer said.

Some critics have said the hike was insufficient and note that Amazon paid zero U.S. federal income tax on more than $11 billion in profits before taxes in 2018, and received a $129 million tax rebate from the federal government.  Walmart\u2019s executive vice president of corporate affairs, Dan Bartlett, responded to Bezos by tweeting, \u201cHey retail competitors out there (you know who you are) how about paying your taxes?\u201d  Walmart, which has raised its minimum wage twice since 2015, pays an entry wage of $11 per hour. CEO Doug McMillon has said Walmart\u2019s average U.S. hourly wage is $17.50 including bonuses based on store performance, and excluding healthcare benefits.  The two retailers, which are fierce rivals, rarely go after one another other publicly.  Amazon\u2019s wage hike came as U.S. unemployment was at a near two-decade low, with retailers and shippers competing for hundreds of thousands of workers for the all-important holiday shopping season.  Bezos said in his letter that the wage hike has benefited more than 250,000 Amazon employees and over 100,000 seasonal employees who worked during the last holiday season at Amazon sites in the United States.  Amazon\u2019s third party sales in 2018 accounted for 58 percent of total sales, up from 56 percent in 2017, Bezos said.  Amazon has said that it pays all the required taxes in every country where it operates, including $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years.  \u201cCorporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits remain modest given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business,\u201d according to recent Amazon statements.","228":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A petition started by a junior Walmart Inc WMT.N worker in California to protest the retailer's sale of firearms, following two mass shootings over the weekend left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio, has gathered more than 45,000 signatures.

Walmart said 40 employees in San Bruno protested by walking out but did not confirm the other details.  \u201cA lot more employees have been reaching out to me to express their support but a majority of those employees are very afraid of retaliation from the company,\u201d he said.  NO CHANGE IN GUN SALE POLICY  Earlier this week, Walmart told Reuters there had been no change in its policy on gun sales after the recent mass shootings, one of which took place in a Walmart store.  Years of public pressure led Walmart, the largest U.S arms retailer, to end assault-rifle sales in 2015 and to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21 in 2018.  Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether.

Walmart currently has a co-branded Medicare drug plan with Humana that steers patients to Walmart stores. The partnership offers a prescription drug plan that can save up to 20 percent in drug costs for customers.  In June, the insurer announced it would partner with Walgreens, with its unit operating senior-focused primary care clinics inside two Walgreens stores in Kansas, a move some analysts said at the time ended any speculation over a deal with Walmart.  Reuters reported in March that Walmart was in early talks with Humana about developing closer ties, with a possible acquisition on the table.  \u201cBoth of them (ties to Walmart and Walgreens) are complementary,\u201d Broussard said, adding partnering with one does not restrict the other deal.  Unlike its rivals, Humana has said it will focus on partnerships and smaller deals while cementing its dominance in the Medicare Advantage business, which powered a better-than- expected second quarter profit.  Humana, in the past few months, has joined hands with private equity firms to buy health care services companies, creating the largest hospice operator in the United States.  RAISES FORECAST  Humana also raised its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast to about $14.15 per share from its previous forecast of $13.70 to $14.10 per share.  The company\u2019s adjusted consolidated benefit ratio, the percentage of premiums spent on claims, deteriorated to 84.3 percent in the quarter, missing consensus estimate of 83.9 percent according to brokerage Evercore ISI.  Over the past few quarters, insurers have kept a tight leash on medical costs and even a slight slip has weighed on stocks.  Earlier this month, the largest U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group UNH.N reported quarterly medical costs slightly higher than expected, overshadowing a second quarter profit beat.  Excluding items, Humana earned $3.96 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $3.77, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Revenue rose 5.4 percent to $14.26 billion, above the average estimate of $14.16 billion.","233":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc\u2019s Jet.com said on Tuesday it will open a new fulfillment center in New York City this fall, making the largest city in the United States one of its first markets for same-day delivery.

Profits are expected to come under pressure as the retailer plans annual spending of up to $3.2 billion \u2014 up from $3 billion last year \u2014 to overhaul stores and improve its online business under a program called \u201cRestock Kroger\u201d launched over a year ago.  \u201cWe realized business transformations are hard,\u201d Kroger Chief Executive William McMullen said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cBut I want to emphasize we are on track to deliver on our Restock Kroger commitments.\u201d  The Cincinnati-based company has built robot-aided warehouses and is trying out self-driving vehicles to improve delivery, while introducing shelves in hundreds of stores that play videos and show nutritional information.  Such moves are expected to help Kroger better compete with the likes of Amazon, which is looking to expand in the grocery business, according to media reports.  Kroger said it had finished most of its store remodeling last year, and going forward, its work would be more targeted and less disruptive to customers.  The retailer, which also runs gas stations, forecast full-year earnings of between $2.15 and $2.25 per share, which fell short of Wall Street expectations of $2.26.  \u201cWe expect 2019 to be a transition year with only modest operating income growth,\u201d Moody\u2019s Vice President Mickey Chadha said of Kroger.  Its net income plunged to $259 million in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, from $854 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 48 cents per share, below analysts\u2019 estimates of 52 cents.  Revenue fell to $28.09 billion, missing estimates of $28.38 billion, mainly due to higher gas prices that discouraged customers from buying fuel.  Kroger\u2019s shares were last down 9.5 percent at $25.76 in afternoon trading.","235":"(Reuters) - Even as dealmakers bicker over who will actually own TikTok Global, another question emerged after President Donald Trump agreed over the weekend to keep the wildly popular video-sharing app running in the United States for another week: how can they possibly create 25,000 new jobs in the United States?  That vow, repeated by the president on Saturday at a campaign rally in North Carolina, was part of a concession that dealmakers offered to convince Trump to green-light a transaction in which a new board comprised of U.S. citizens would oversee a new U.S.-based company and co-owned by Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc.  But the lofty hiring target will be tough to justify, experts said. Such a high number suggests an expectation for massive revenue growth at a time when TikTok faces unprecedented global challenges.  If TikTok operated at anywhere near the efficiency of other internet companies such as Twitter, TikTok would need to generate up to 19 times more revenue over the next few years.  TikTok is expected to generate about a billion dollars in revenue by the end of 2020, Reuters previously reported.  Many of the new American jobs will likely be in engineering, content moderation and security roles, given the U.S. government\u2019s intense focus on the app\u2019s data privacy policies, said Dan Ives, a technology analyst at Wedbush Securities.  \u201cFrom a security and infrastructure perspective, they\u2019re going to have to hire a few thousand alone to focus on that issue...given the sensitivity,\u201d he said.  TikTok recently announced a $1 billion creator fund that will pay popular TikTok influencers for making videos. Counting those content creators would help TikTok reach 25,000 jobs, said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad agency GroupM.  Beyond that, it gets harder to justify a bigger staff. Because ByteDance will still own the algorithm that runs TikTok and license it to the new U.S.-based company, the new company will not need to hire large teams that work on artificial intelligence.  FILE PHOTO: TikTok's logo is displayed on the smartphone while standing on the U.S. flag in this illustration picture taken, November 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  Those types of jobs account for a large chunk of Facebook Inc and Twitter\u2019s headcount, said Abishur Prakash, a geopolitical futurist at the Center for Innovating the Future, a technology and geopolitics consulting firm, raising questions about what job roles TikTok could hire for.  Oracle and Walmart could also create divisions within their companies to serve TikTok that could contribute to the job count, he added.  A source familiar with the deal discussions said the 25,000-job figure was based on similarly sized organizations that serve as many users as TikTok, without offering details. The source added that the job figure was actually conservative in an effort to under-promise and over-deliver.  Another tech company, Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn, promised in 2017 to bring 13,000 new jobs to Wisconsin. The deal to create a new factory in the United States was praised by Trump as the \u201ceighth wonder of the world\u201d and as proof of his ability to bring jobs back to America.  A filing with the Wisconsin state economic development division showed Foxconn employed about 600 people in 2019 in the region, according to a CNBC report.  PEER REVIEW  The ambition of TikTok\u2019s hiring goals can better be understood by comparing it against the revenue that workers make for other internet companies.  On average, Twitter\u2019s 4,800 workers each generated close to $720,000 or total annual revenue of $3.5 billion in 2019. Snap Inc\u2019s 3,195 workers each generated about $537,000, for a 2019 annual sum of $1.7 billion.  ByteDance currently employs more than 1,000 workers in the United States, mostly in California with some in other locations such as Texas, Reuters previously reported.  At similar efficiency levels, TikTok\u2019s new total of 26,000 U.S. workers would be expected to make between $14 billion to $19 billion annually.  Even at the low end, such revenue targets will be difficult for TikTok, Prakash said.  \u201cWe\u2019re in a different phase of TikTok...that comes with a lot of baggage,\u201d he said, adding TikTok is still banned in India, which was previously its largest market. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take them that much longer and be that much harder to reach 14x (revenue).\u201d","236":"FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018.

The company will also set up or renovate more than 10 logistics centers in the country.  The comments followed a meeting between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping over the weekend in Osaka, Japan that rekindled hope for a U.S.-China trade deal.  Walmart has been pushing to integrate its retail network in China with the country's burgeoning \"smart retail\" movement, as retailers and tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N and Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK cut deals to combine online and high-street shopping.  In China, the company last year opened its first small high-tech supermarket, where smartphones can be used to pay for items that are mostly available on the U.S. retailer's store on online platform JD Daojia, an affiliate of JD.com Inc JD.O.  Walmart operates a number of formats in China, including hypermarket, Sam\u2019s Club and Walmart supermarket, with 400 retail units covering more than 180 cities nationwide.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past branches of ASDA and Sainsbury's in Stockport, Britain April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Phil Noble  Britain\u2019s competition regulator last month ruled Sainsbury\u2019s 7.3 billion pound ($9.5 billion) takeover of rival Asda cannot proceed, closing one exit route for Walmart.  Asda, which accounts for 6 percent of Walmart\u2019s turnover, is due to publish a first-quarter update on Thursday, when the world\u2019s biggest retailer posts quarterly earnings.  Analysts have speculated that Walmart will try to sell Asda to private equity or consider a stock market listing for the business it acquired for 6.7 billion pounds in 1999.  But a source with direct knowledge of the matter said Walmart is in no rush to make a decision, partly because Asda is performing relatively well under Chief Executive Roger Burnley.  Asda has reported seven consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth, thanks to a strategy focused on lower prices, more innovation in own-brand products, better store standards and improvements in its e-commerce operations.  A read across from monthly industry data produced by researcher Kantar indicates that Asda will likely report an eighth straight quarter of growth.  Walmart has been focused on turning around its international business by targeting higher growth markets such as China and India and exiting or tying up with local players elsewhere.  When the Sainsbury\u2019s deal was blocked on April 25 Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, said its focus was on \u201ccontinuing to position Asda as a strong UK retailer\u201d.  Walmart \u201cwill ensure Asda has the resources it needs to achieve that,\u201d McKenna added at the time.  PROFIT RELIEF  Burnley, like his predecessor Sean Clarke, has benefited from Walmart\u2019s 2016 decision to relax profit demands of around 1 billion pounds on Asda, allowing it to cut prices and stem the loss of market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl.  That strategy shift meant Asda\u2019s operating profit fell 13% to 735.4 million pounds in 2017, its latest published accounts.  \u201cThe issue for Asda is what is Walmart going to tell it what its profit target is,\u201d a senior industry executive said.  \u201cIf Walmart says \u2018we would like you to go back to the profitability you had three years ago\u2019, then Asda can\u2019t execute their current strategy. It\u2019s not designed to deliver that level of profit,\u201d he said.  Another source with connections to Asda said that scenario would mean Burnley having to take out unprofitable, or barely profitable, stores, and cut staff numbers.  \u201cBut I suspect they\u2019ll allow the tap to stay on ... because that makes it more attractive for (a future) sale.\u201d  While Sainsbury\u2019s CEO Mike Coupe, the main architect of the deal, has been heavily criticized for its failure, Burnley has emerged relatively unscathed.  With the exception of one bruising appearance in front of lawmakers in June, Burnley has kept a low public profile since the deal was announced, which insiders say partly reflected his ambivalence toward it.

REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski\/File Photo  Walmart\u2019s suppliers, such as Procter & Gamble Co, Unilever Plc and Mondelez International Inc, can deal with one inhouse ad team instead of different groups within and outside the retailer, company executives said.  Walmart will inform suppliers of the change at its annual meeting with them on Tuesday.  The move comes as rival Amazon is boosting profits by letting merchants pay for high placement in its search results. Its ad sales and other revenue jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.  About 300 million shoppers visit Walmart\u2019s stores every month, and millions make online purchases on its website, according to Forrester Research. The retailer draws in more shoppers than Amazon, Facebook and Google, the research firm estimates.  At Walmart\u2019s investor conference in October, Chief Executive Doug McMillon said its ad business was \u201ctiny\u201d and \u201cit could be bigger.\u201d He said the company\u2019s data has not been monetized.  Walmart also said this month its online losses are likely to widen this year due to investments to expand the business, and the advertising push could offset some of that.  \u201cWe have a unique opportunity to leverage our first-party shopping data from online and offline purchases to reach our customers and influence their purchase decisions,\u201d Walmart Chief Merchandising Officer Steve Bratspies said in an interview.  The retailer is consolidating teams into a single group for ad sales and operations, Bratspies said.  \u201cIt can be as simple banner ads on the website ... to in-store capabilities on our TV network,\u201d he said.  Walmart is bringing its digital ad business inhouse and ending its relationship with Triad, a unit of WPP, which sells advertising space on websites. Triad did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The challenge for companies and marketers often is gauging whether their investments are yielding a return. Walmart will address that challenge by connecting data from stores and online and offering a pitch that is \u201cmuch more effective than many others can,\u201d Bratspies said.  Trade marketing, typically used by packaged goods manufacturers to target shoppers, are moving to Amazon, according to analysts. U.S. trade marketing totals an estimated $178 billion a year and makes up most of Amazon\u2019s U.S. ad dollars, Morgan Stanley analysts estimated.  The retailer will also ask suppliers to deliver a full truckload on time at least 87 percent of the time and expects those delivering less than a truckload to be on time at least 70 percent of the time.  Walmart will ask suppliers to deliver full orders a minimum of 97.5 percent of the time, it added.","239":"A group of Walmart Inc employees has accused the retail giant of defying a $65 million settlement agreement by failing to providing seating to the vast majority of cashiers at retail stores in California.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  King, who joined the company in 2011, led a revamp of Walmart\u2019s U.S. e-commerce technology platform by making it faster, more competitive and customer-friendly, all of which have been key to the retailer\u2019s fight against its e-commerce rivals.  Under King, Walmart integrated its massive stores and online systems and began offering shoppers services such as in-store pickup of online orders, easy returns and online grocery pickup, among other benefits.  King also led the company\u2019s technology arm, Walmart Labs, through more than 10 acquisitions and was key in moving the company\u2019s operations to the cloud, which gave the retailer more resources to compete with Amazon. He also oversaw the opening of four new tech offices.  In the past two years, King oversaw the tech transformation of Walmart\u2019s roughly 4,700 U.S. stores.  Fiona Tan, senior vice-president of customer technology, Walmart Labs, will take on more responsibility as King\u2019s replacement is found. She has been asked to become a liaison for the technology team, Walmart U.S. and the U.S. ecommerce leadership team, according to the memo, a copy of which Reuters has seen.  King\u2019s departure comes at a time when Walmart is in the middle of making massive investments in its e-commerce business to compete more effectively. In February, the company said it expects its e-commerce losses to increase this year due to ongoing investments and it is focused on increasing return customer visits and strengthening its online product assortment.  The retailer\u2019s ecommerce success has been erratic over the years but sales growth in the past few quarters has shown signs of consistency.  In the most recent quarter, online sales grew 43 percent and matched the previous quarter\u2019s increase. The company credited that to a broader assortment of goods on its website and improved delivery, as well as store pickup of online grocery orders.  \u201cThe operational decisions made during (King\u2019s) time were key to the success of our technology team and led to more agile ways of working,\u201d said the memo sent on Wednesday to Walmart staff by U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran and U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore.  \u201cDuring Jeremy\u2019s tenure, we created important relationships with Microsoft, Google, NVIDIA and others that will help carry our digital transformation well into the future,\u201d the memo said.

Sam\u2019s Club said the service will be available to shoppers in Austin and Dallas-Forth Worth in Texas, and St. Louis, who can place orders for everything from fresh produce to small appliances without a membership.  The partnership comes at a time of intense competition and disruption in the grocery industry. Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion purchase of organic grocer Whole Foods last year shook up the industry and has prompted grocery retailers to look for ways to profitably deliver fresh food and pantry items.  The delivery offer is also part of a strategic shift by Sam\u2019s new chief executive, John Furner, as he attempts to turn around a business that has underperformed parent company Walmart and rivals like Costco Wholesale Corp. Sam\u2019s recently consolidated its membership structure, shut about a tenth of its stores and laid off more than 10,000 workers.  Instacart, a San Francisco-based startup, handles shopping and delivery of groceries from about 200 retailers including Target Corp and Costco. Its app allows shoppers to order groceries from a preferred store and have them delivered in as little as an hour.  Instacart makes money through delivery fees and also through promotions and coupon deals it has with many consumer goods manufacturers. Earlier this month, it raised $200 million in fresh funding, boosting its valuation and providing it with new resources to compete against Amazon.  In October, Walmart, which sells more groceries than any other retailer, bought same-day New York City delivery company Parcel. Walmart offers grocery delivery in many markets via Uber or Deliv and is testing delivery with its own trucks in Denver. Walmart does not directly partner with Instacart.  Amazon has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market, mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as cereal and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts.

Monday\u2019s decision by U.S. District Judge Vincent Briccetti in White Plains, New York, addressed claims that consumers nationwide overpaid for mislabeled cotton produced by an Indian textile company, Welspun India Ltd.  Egyptian cotton often commands a premium price because of its prestige, and because its long fibers yield a finer, lighter, softer and more durable fabric.  Briccetti said consumers may pursue breach of warranty and negligent misrepresentation claims against the retailers and a U.S. unit of Welspun, and fraud claims against the Welspun unit.  He dismissed fraud claims against the retailers because there was no \u201cstrong inference of fraudulent intent.\u201d New York and California consumers were allowed to sue the retailers under their respective states\u2019 consumer protection laws.  A lawyer for Welspun and Bed Bath & Beyond declined to comment. Lawyers for Walmart and Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The consumers\u2019 lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.  According to the complaint, the retailers sold Welspun\u2019s \u201cEgyptian\u201d cotton well into 2016 even though Target and Bed Bath & Beyond had known for several months, and Walmart had known as early as 2008, that the cotton was mislabeled.  The cotton was sold under the Fieldcrest, Royal Velvet, Better Homes and Gardens, Canopy, Crowning Touch and Perfect Touch brands, court papers show.  Target severed its ties to Welspun in August 2016, and Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling the linens in question later that year.

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart announced in May it was acquiring about 77 percent of Flipkart for roughly $16 billion in the biggest deal for India\u2019s e-commerce sector, which Morgan Stanley estimates will grow close to an annual $200 billion in a decade.  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved the proposed acquisition of Flipkart by Walmart, the agency said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday.  The acquisition of Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart will give Walmart, which runs 21 cash-and-carry stores in India, a stronger foothold in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy where it has struggled to expand in the last decade, partly due to restrictions around foreign investment in bricks-and-mortar retail.  A local trader body, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), had opposed the Walmart-Flipkart deal, saying the combination would create unfair competition and drive local convenience stores out of business.  On Wednesday, CAIT said it was disappointed by the CCI\u2019s approval.  \u201cWe will certainly move the court against the CCI\u2019s decision,\u201d Praveen Khandelwal, CAIT\u2019s secretary general told Reuters. \u201cCAIT has called an emergency meeting of its governing council on August 19 at Nagpur, where we will finalise our strategy for a nationwide movement.\u201d  Walmart has previously said it supports local manufacturing in India by sourcing from small and medium suppliers, farmers and businesses run by women.  \u201cWe believe that the combination of Walmart\u2019s global expertise and Flipkart will position us for long-term success and enable us to contribute to the economic growth,\u201d Walmart said in a statement after the CCI announcement.","246":"July 3 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc has discussed the potential sale of its unprofitable clothing brands Bonobos and Modcloth with buyers, online news portal Vox reported here on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

In an internal memo seen by Reuters, the retailer said growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty were behind its decision.  Walmart\u2019s move comes on the heels of bans on sales of flavored vaping products in New York and Michigan and after the Trump administration announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.  President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials also expressed concern about the growing use of such products as health officials investigate the matter.  One possible culprit identified so far is a line of illicit marijuana vape products sold under the brand names \u201cDank Vapes\u201d and \u201cChronic Carts.\u201d  The New York State Department of Health identified \u201cDank Vapes\u201d and \u201cChronic Carts\u201d as products containing Vitamin E acetate, a thickening agent in THC oil that has been a focus in its investigation of the illnesses.  Leading makers of nicotine e-cigarettes, including Juul Labs Inc, British American Tobacco Plc BATS.L and Imperial Brands Plc IMB.L, said last week their products did not contain Vitamin E compounds.

In May, Walmart raised the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21 in all its stores and said it would stop selling fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. The move came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration called out the company for illegally selling tobacco products to minors.  The regulator also called out other retailers like Kroger KR.N, Family Dollar, which is owned by Dollar Tree DLTR.O, 7-Eleven, Casey's General Stores and Sunoco SUN.N, which were among more than half a dozen convenience store and gas station chains cited for illegally selling tobacco products to minors.

The Flipkart deal, which local daily Economic Times had said here was in the offing in January, comes as e-commerce players including Amazon look to woo India's mom-and-pop stores that are considered the backbone of the economy.  Flipkart also faces competition from local online grocery upstart JioMart, backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries RELI.NS, whose digital arm has raised around $20 billion.  India does not allow foreign investors to control and market their own inventory on their e-commerce platforms, which is seen as giving JioMart and other local players an edge in a key growth market for e-commerce.

TikTok is up for sale as the Chinese-owned company is under fire from the Trump administration as a potential national security risk due to the vast amount of private data the app is compiling on U.S. consumers.

Walmart does not break out revenue from sponsored ads for products sold on its website. But online ads yield much higher margins than product sales, and ad revenue is growing as the retailer boosts investments in the area.  It has been more important than ever for Walmart to find new ways to win market share from its closest e-commerce rival Amazon.com, a fast-growing ad platform, as customers increasingly shop online.  Amazon reported $4.2 billion in advertising and other revenue for the most recent quarter, nearly double what it brought in for the same period two years prior. That amount is up 41% from the year-ago period.  Retailers including Target Corp TGT.N and grocers such as Tesco Plc TSCO.L have aggressively wooed big advertisers to their websites to drive sales through pop-up banners and search-bar keywords.  In July, Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart rolled out new features for its in-house advertising platform Walmart Media Group.  Walmart has seized many opportunities to scoop up online brands like Bonobos, which it purchased for $310 million in 2017, and Art.com, which it bought for an undisclosed amount in 2018.  In 2010, Walmart announced its new video-on-demand service with its acquisition of Vudu, which also offers a free ad-supported streaming option. However, Vudu still lags far behind the monthly viewership numbers that competitors Netflix NFLX.O and Hulu pull in, and Walmart sold it to Comcast Corp-owned CMCSA.O Fandango Media LLC, a movie ticketing service, in April.

The investment was more than the $10-12 billion given by sources close to the deal in the past week.  Walmart said it expected the deal to knock about 25-30 cents off its earnings in fiscal 2019, assuming the deal closes at the end of the second quarter.

Lisa Wadlin told Walmart in January she was considering resigning as senior vice president, chief tax officer, but the company did not learn she was joining Amazon until separation papers were signed on May 15, according to the lawsuit.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, said Wadlin\u2019s knowledge of its strategic plans \u201cwould be of immense benefit to Amazon,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which was filed late Wednesday in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery.

Reuters reported last week that Walmart completed its due diligence on Flipkart and had made a proposal to buy 51 percent or more of the Indian company for between $10 billion to $12 billion.  A deal with Flipkart would step up Walmart's battle with Amazon.com AMZN.O for a bigger share of India's fledgling e-commerce market, which Morgan Stanley estimates will be worth $200 billion in a decade. Local media have reported that Amazon is exploring a possible counter offer for Flipkart.  Both sources declined to be named as the talks are private.  Walmart will buy both new and existing Flipkart shares, with the new shares expected to value the Bengaluru-based firm at at least $18 billion, the sources said. The price for existing shares would value the firm at about $12 billion, one of the people said.  Japan's SoftBank Group 9984.T, which owns roughly one-fifth of Flipkart via its Vision Fund, is unlikely to sell any of its shares due to the low price being offered for the existing shares, this source said.  Reuters has previously reported that early investors such as Tiger Global, Accel and Naspers will likely sell their entire stakes in Flipkart to Walmart if a deal is reached.  FILE PHOTO: A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California, U.S. on April 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  A deal is not yet finalised, and talks between Walmart, Flipkart and its investors are ongoing, one of the people said.  Flipkart also counts eBay EBAY.O, Tencent Holdings 0700.HK and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O among its investors.  Flipkart did not respond to a request for comment, a representative for Walmart in India declined comment while SoftBank said it doesn\u2019t comment on speculation.  BIG INDIAN BATTLE  For Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer known for its superstores, a deal with Flipkart would open up the vast Indian market.  Walmart has for years tried to enter India but has remained confined to a \u2018cash-and-carry\u2019 wholesale business amid tough restrictions on foreign investment. It currently operates 21 such stores in India.  By comparison, Amazon closely trails Flipkart, which along with its fashion units controls nearly 40 percent of India\u2019s online retail market, according to estimates by researcher Forrester.  Flipkart\u2019s investors are concerned that any deal with Amazon would run into regulatory hurdles as a combination would have more than 70 percent of India\u2019s online retail market, one of the sources said.  Walmart's push into e-commerce comes as Amazon has embraced offline retail, with an affiliate of the Seattle-based company picking up a $27.6 million stake in Indian retailer Shopper's Stop Ltd SHOP.NS.  In the United States, Amazon also bought high-end grocer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year.  Walmart\u2019s investment would give Flipkart not just additional funds to fight Amazon, but also arm it with a formidable ally with extensive experience in retailing, logistics and supply chain management.  Former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru.  Like Amazon\u2019s founder Jeff Bezos, they began by selling books, but have diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones, such as those made by China\u2019s Xiaomi, through exclusive flash sales, and now compete with Amazon in almost all product categories.","268":"Varios usuarios de redes sociales replicaron el 28 de diciembre un supuesto comunicado en el que la unidad mexicana de la cadena estadounidense de tiendas Walmart anunciaba que iba a ofrecer la vacuna de la farmac\u00e9utica estadounidense Pfizer durante toda esa jornada a aquellos que quisieran comprarla, a un precio de 20 d\u00f3lares (400 pesos mexicanos).

The retailer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","272":"WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Target Corp will raise its U.S. minimum wage to $13 an hour in June, from $12 currently, increasing its payroll costs and putting new pressure on rival Walmart Inc to attract retail workers in a tight labor market.  Minneapolis-based Target employs over 300,000 workers and runs 1,845 stores in the United States. The discount chain is investing billions of dollars to improve its supply chain, grow its online sales and improve delivery of merchandise to shoppers\u2019 homes.  Target previously raised minimum hourly pay to $12 in March 2018 from $11. In 2017, Target, said it was committed to raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020. The wage increase will affect \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of employees, a Target spokeswoman said.  Retailers have been finding it tougher to attract workers, with U.S. unemployment at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, while there has been growing political pressure on companies to pay workers a fair living wage.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer and the largest U.S. private sector employer, pays workers $11 an hour at entry-level. Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amazon.com Inc raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in October after facing harsh criticism over poor pay and working conditions. The online retailer said at the time that it would lobby Washington for the federal minimum wage to be raised.  The $15 minimum wage movement has found support from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, part of a new crop of Democrats swept into office this year on a stronger liberal platform.  \u201cCroissants at LaGuardia (New York airport) are going for seven dollars a piece,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on April 1. \u201cYet some people think getting a whole hour of personal, dedicated human labor for $15 is too expensive??\u201d  Amid the growing political pressure, other companies have also moved to raise wages. For example, Costco Wholesale Corp raised its minimum wage twice in a year and since March pays employees at least $15 an hour.  In a blog post due to be published on Target\u2019s website on Thursday, the company\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer tied the minimum wage hikes to the company\u2019s strong holiday performance, saying it \u201cmade a big difference.\u201d  In March, Target forecast 2019 profit above Wall Street estimates after a strong holiday season.  \u201cWe were able to start them all (seasonal hires) at $12 or more - and that helped us reach our seasonal hiring goal ahead of schedule, which gave our teams a lot of extra time to train and prepare for our busiest season of the year,\u201d Kremer said.  It was not immediately clear if Target employees who already make $13 an hour will also see an increase in pay.  Target\u2019s spokeswoman said the company would evaluate hourly pay rates for such employees and make adjustments as appropriate. With some of Target\u2019s previous wage hikes, such employees have been entitled to an annual merit raise and a pay-grade hike.

The changes, to take effect at the start of May, will include a wider range of colors, fonts and more informal photographs. The retailer declined to comment on the total cost of the redesign.  The last time Walmart updated its website was in 2014, but the changes were not as dramatic, Walmart spokeswoman Danit Marquardt said.  Walmart\u2019s new homepage will be personalized to customers\u2019 locations, allowing them to buy products that are trending in their towns and see which of these online services their local stores provide, Marc Lore, the head of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business, said in an interview on Monday.  Lore also said the website would soon have different layouts depending on product categories, allowing customers to shop for groceries differently from how they buy clothes and accessories, or home improvement products.  Lore said these changes had been well-received by the website\u2019s brands, which will have more space and different ways to advertise. Retailers, including Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, often give brands space on their websites to increase e-commerce traffic and boost online assortments.  \u201cWe can see from the research that it\u2019s going to appeal to customers,\u201d Lore said.  Walmart said in February that online sales increased 23 percent in the most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. The company posted about $11.5 billion in U.S. e-commerce revenue for the full year. Total U.S. sales were $318.5 billion.  The slowing online sales growth raised concerns among analysts that the retailer might be unable to keep pace with Amazon.

The deal closed on Friday, the retailer said in a blog post.  Earlier this month, Walmart acquired Eloquii, a fashion startup that sells plus-sized clothing.","284":"NEW YORK, April 29 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc\u2019s urgency to stem market share losses to rivals around the world is driving it to partner with local players in the UK and India, even as it scales back in some other markets like Brazil.  The world\u2019s largest retailer is in talks to merge its UK arm ASDA with J Sainsbury Plc in which it will hold a minority stake. Walmart is also looking to acquire a majority stake in India\u2019s leading online retailer Flipkart for $10 billion to $12 billion after years of underperformance there.  The moves underscore Walmart\u2019s renewed focus on catching up with competitors, ranging from grocer Aldi Inc to Amazon.com Inc , in key international markets. The retailer\u2019s underperforming international business contributed less than a quarter to its total revenue of $500.3 billion in fiscal 2018.  \u201cWalmart has simply been too slow to react when it comes to their overseas business,\u201d said Burt Flickinger, managing director, Strategic Resource Group. \u201cThey have finally started taking corrective action and are now dedicating their resources to where they think they can grow,\u201d he said.  It also marks a shift in Walmart\u2019s traditional approach of building a business on its own.  \u201cWalmart is clearly moving away from trying to crack tough foreign markets by itself to striking partnerships because it realizes that is the fastest way to bridge the gap with competitors,\u201d said Laura Kennedy, vice president, retail sales and shopper practice at Kantar Consulting.  A Walmart spokesman declined to comment on the negotiations in the UK and India.  Overall, sales from Walmart International, which runs about 6,300 stores globally, stood at $118.07 billion in the fiscal year ended 2018, down nearly 14 percent from $136.5 billion in 2014. This was in large part due to adverse currency movements, which hurt the money repatriated from its foreign arms, but also because of a series of missteps in major markets around the world. In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit and has indicated it will focus on its core North American markets and growth markets like China and India.  Walmart's international woes have been exacerbated by slow decision-making over the years and even initial talks with India\u2019s Flipkart began as far back as 2016. [reut.rs\/2HYwFE3 ]  Walmart initially entered the Indian market in 2007 through a joint venture with India\u2019s Bharti Enterprises, years before Amazon debuted there. That joint venture was called off in 2013 and its presence in India has remained largely static since then, at least in part due to restrictions around foreign investment in physical retail in India. [reut.rs\/2HBgJbs ] [reut.rs\/2vRkrIC]  Meanwhile, Amazon jumped in with a less regulated online marketplace offering, retail consultants and investors said. Amazon now holds about 27 percent of India\u2019s burgeoning e-commerce market, according to Euromonitor, where Walmart remains a footnote and only operates 21 cash-and-carry wholesale stores in the country that sell to businesses.  Walmart\u2019s slow-footedness means if a deal is announced, Flipkart could be Walmart\u2019s largest acquisition to date, potentially at a steep premium to what SoftBank Group paid for a stake in the company less than a year ago.  INTERNATIONAL BLUNDERS Walmart\u2019s international moves over the years have involved a series of blunders.  For example, Walmart bet on an unprofitable, second-tier online retailer in China in 2011 and has since been behind Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. In 2016, Walmart sold its online business in China to pick up a stake in China\u2019s no 2 retailer JD.com.  In Brazil, Walmart has struggled to gain traction after a decade, while in the United Kingdom it has been unable to stem market share declines to hard discounters like Aldi Inc and Lidl.  Now, Walmart is trying to offload a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International. And on Saturday, Sainsbury said it and Walmart\u2019s British unit Asda are in talks to create the country\u2019s biggest supermarket group.  Their combination, which some said shows Walmart\u2019s retrenching in the market, would surpass Tesco\u2019s grocery market share and be worth up to 15 billion pounds ($20.7 billion).  Whether Walmart\u2019s latest moves will turn Walmart International into the growth engine it once was remains to be seen, consultants said. For now at least, investors have largely supported the decisions to jumpstart global growth made by Chief Executive Doug McMillon as exemplified by the market reaction to the talks in India. \u201cIn the short term, the Flipkart deal may look pricey, but the markets haven\u2019t punished Walmart because investors realize this is probably their best chance to have a fair fight with Amazon in India,\u201d Ken Murphy, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said. Walmart\u2019s shares fell 20 percent from an all-time high in January largely due to concerns around its online performance in the United States. They have, however, risen 27 percent in the past year, outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which rose 12 percent during the same period.

Minority investors holding 60 percent of Flipkart\u2019s shares \u201cacting together, may require Flipkart to effect an initial public offering\u201d (IPO) four years after the close of the Walmart-Flipkart transaction, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in a May 11 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The IPO should be done at no less a valuation than that at which Walmart invested in the Indian firm, the filing said.  Walmart announced earlier this week that it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart in what is the U.S. retail giant\u2019s largest-ever deal and a move to take on arch rival Amazon.com Inc in a key growth market.  The investment implies a valuation of nearly $21 billion for Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart.

FILE PHOTO: A Common myna sits next to the logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart installed on the company's office in Bengaluru, India April 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  Bloomberg reported earlier on Friday, citing unidentified sources, that Flipkart\u2019s board had approved a deal to sell a stake of about 75 percent in the company to a group led by U.S. retail giant Walmart for about $15 billion.  A third source told Reuters that while Flipkart\u2019s board had \u201cin-principle\u201d approved engaging with Walmart based on the terms of an offer before them, taxation related concerns and a few other issues need to be resolved.  The first two sources said Alphabet Inc is also likely to invest in Flipkart alongside Walmart, but terms of the deal may change. Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, the biggest investor in the Indian firm through its private equity fund, is considering selling its roughly 20 percent stake as part of the deal if the price is right, two other sources said.  \u201cSoftBank does not like to be a passive investor,\u201d one of the sources said.  Reuters had previously reported Walmart was in advanced talks with Flipkart to acquire a controlling stake in the Bengaluru-based online marketplace at a valuation of at least $18 billion.  Flipkart has bought back $350 million worth of shares from its investors as it seeks to convert its Singapore-incorporated company to a private limited firm, in a move that could ease the way in for a new strategic investor, regulatory filings show.  Flipkart and Alphabet did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests seeking comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment.  AMAZON OFFER  Earlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported Amazon Inc had made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart and that it had also proposed a $2 billion breakup fee to convince Flipkart to discuss its offer.  Sources told Reuters that Amazon had shown an interest in buying Flipkart, but said a deal with Walmart was much more likely to go through. Amazon is Flipkart\u2019s biggest rival in India.  Amazon\u2019s move to bid for Flipkart may push up valuations of the Indian firm, but engaging with the tech giant could be fraught with risks for Flipkart, said industry insiders and lawyers.  Beyond the risk of opening its books for due diligence and exposing sensitive commercial agreements to its biggest rival in India, an Amazon-Flipkart combination could face significant antitrust hurdles, they said.  Amazon is currently seeking legal opinion to understand how the country\u2019s antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), is likely to view any deal with Flipkart, a lawyer and an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  A former senior CCI official said e-commerce firms were already giving deep discounts and an Amazon-Flipkart union was likely to be in a position to sway the market their way, but the CCI could be convinced to approve a deal if both firms suggested \u201cinnovations or remedies.\u201d  \u201cThis definitely would be a tricky case and not easy to sail through,\u201d he added.  Amazon declined to comment on whether it had bid for Flipkart or was seeking legal opinion for a potential investment in the firm.  Flipkart, together with its fashion units Myntra and Jabong, controls nearly 40 percent of India\u2019s online retail market, while Amazon is a close second with a 31 percent share, according to data from research firm Forrester.  Both Amazon and Flipkart are pouring billions of dollars into winning shoppers in the fast-growing market that is expected to be worth $200 billion within a decade.","287":"Sept 20 (Reuters) - China\u2019s ByteDance Ltd is seeking a valuation of $60 billion for TikTok as Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc take stakes in the short-video app\u2019s business to address U.S. security concerns, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter.  Oracle will take a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global and store all its U.S. user data on its cloud to comply with U.S. national security requirements, the companies said earlier. Retail giant Walmart said it would take a 7.5% stake in TikTok Global.

Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, on Tuesday said it had dropped Alibaba-linked Alipay in all its stores in the western region of the country, after agreeing a tie-up with Tencent to use its popular WeChat payment system.  The move underscores how China\u2019s retail market is dividing into two camps around Alibaba and Tencent, tech behemoths worth a combined $1 trillion who are shaking up the online and offline retail market.  The two firms, who have spent billions of dollars on retail deals since the start of last year, dominate the country\u2019s third-party mobile payment market. Alibaba-linked Alipay leads the field, with Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay catching up fast.  Chinese consumers - and retailers - often have both Alipay and WeChat, which can be used to pay for shopping online or in physical stores by scanning QR codes with a smartphone.  Alibaba is China\u2019s top e-commerce player, while Tencent is strong in social media and gaming and has - along with Walmart - a major stake in number two online retailer JD.com Inc.  A Walmart spokeswoman said the firm had entered into a \u201cpartnership\u201d with WeChat Pay in western China, which was a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to improve customer experience.  The Western China region is a large area including provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu. It is, however, more sparsely populated than the wealthier eastern part of the country.  \u201cIn the future, Walmart will cooperate with more partners to provide payment solutions with more convenience and benefits,\u201d she said in emailed comments, adding the firm accepted payment methods including cash, cards and mobile payments.  Tencent said it welcomed Walmart\u2019s decision and would push forward with plans to help support vendors with digital tools in the \u201csmart retail\u201d arena.  Alibaba and Alipay declined to comment.  The Walmart move comes after Tencent and Alibaba have between them splashed over $10 billion on retail-focused deals, boosting their reach offline and meaning few brick-and-mortar sellers are left without an allegiance to one or the other.","290":"The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2019.

The brothers and TDR on Tuesday said they had completed the acquisition, which gave Asda an enterprise value of 6.8 billion pounds ($9.5 billion), though it remains subject to regulatory approval.  The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an inquiry into the deal in December and initially set a Feb. 18 deadline for a so-called Phase 1 but then stopped the clock on the process while it sought additional documentation.  Its inquiry has been complicated by the buyers\u2019 plan to offload Asda\u2019s 322 petrol stations to their own petrol forecourt business, EG Group, for 750 million pounds when the deal is completed.  The petrol forecourts sale, under which the stations will continue to be Asda-branded, will be considered by the CMA as part of its review of the Asda acquisition.  At the end of the Phase 1 stage, the CMA will either clear the deal or ask for concessions to avoid a more detailed Phase 2 investigation.

Walmart said that \u201cin light of recent events\u201d it was raising the age for purchasers of firearms and ammunition to 21 from 18. The retailer is also was removing items from its website that resemble assault rifles, including non-lethal airsoft guns and toys. Walmart stopped selling assault firearms and accessories in 2015 and only sells handguns in Alaska.  Dick\u2019s, a U.S. retailer of camping supplies, sporting goods and guns, will stop selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. It will not sell any guns to people under age 21, Dick\u2019s chief executive, Ed Stack, said in an open letter on the company\u2019s website.  The announcements came the same day that classes resumed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people, mostly students, were killed two weeks ago in one of the deadliest U.S. mass shootings.  The accused gunman, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, legally purchased a weapon at Dick\u2019s in November, although not the type used in the shooting, Stack said. Cruz, a former student at Stoneman Douglas, is accused of using an AR-15 assault-style weapon to carry out the killing.  The massacre spurred a youth-led wave of protests, and state and national officials are considering whether to pass stricter gun control measures. The powerful National Rifle Association traditionally opposes such curbs, citing the right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment.  Dick\u2019s removed assault-style weapons from its Dick\u2019s-branded stores after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 first graders and six adults, but continued selling them through another retail brand. Wednesday\u2019s move takes them out of its 35 Field & Stream outlets as well, Stack said, adding the measure would be permanent.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Some analysts said the 2012 decision did not hurt the retailer\u2019s sales, likely giving company executives confidence to make Wednesday\u2019s move.  Stack said he knew the company\u2019s decision would upset some customers, but he cited the passionate response by the students and families in Parkland.  \u201cWe have heard you,\u201d he said.  Stack said in his letter that Dick\u2019s respects the Second Amendment and law-abiding gun owners but was obliged to address a national gun epidemic that is killing too many children.  After the Parkland shooting, it was clear there were not enough systemic protections to prevent gun sales to people who are potential threats, Stack said, adding that Congress should tighten background checks to include relevant mental health information.  Dick\u2019s, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, operates about 715 Dick\u2019s-branded stores across the United States. It was the latest company to take action after the Florida shooting. Other businesses have cut ties with the NRA and gun manufacturers.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, the world's largest online retailer, has long prohibited the sale of firearms and explosives on its websites, as well as ammunition and gun accessories in most cases. It declined comment on the issue on Wednesday.  EBay EBAY.O said its policy prohibits the sale of firearms and high-capacity magazines of more than 10 rounds.  Since the Florida shooting, gun-control supporters have called on Amazon as well as Roku, Apple Inc AAPL.O and others to drop the National Rifle Association's programming from their streaming services.  Outdoor goods retailer Bass Pro Shops, which acquired Cabelas Inc last year and sells guns under both retail brands, did not respond to requests for comment.

Margins were impacted as Walmart absorbed higher transportation costs and invested heavily in its online business.  Walmart's shares, which traded up premarket and opened higher, reversed course in early trade. Shares were down 1.04 percent at $100.47 per share as investors were spooked by poor performance from J.C. Penney JCP.N and Dillard's Inc DDS.N, turning bearish on retail stocks, analysts said.

Grocery sales make up 56 percent of Walmart's revenue, and at its investor day last month Walmart's Chief Executive Doug McMillon emphasized Walmart's advantage in the food category, an area that rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is trying to crack, particularly following its acquisition last year of organic grocer Whole Foods. McMillon said Walmart can offer fresh food within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population.  The company has expanded its grocery pickup program, which allows customers to order online and pickup at 2,100 of its U.S. stores. Walmart will also add grocery delivery services to about 800 stores by the end of the year, the retailer\u2019s U.S. CEO Greg Foran said.  Walmart will overtake Apple Inc AAPL.O as the third largest e-commerce retailer by sales this year, behind Amazon and eBay Inc EBAY.O, according to data released Thursday by market research firm eMarketer. Walmart is expected to grab 4 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales, or about $20.9 billion, up from 3.3 percent last year, eMarketer said.  Walmart\u2019s sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.4 percent in the third quarter, excluding fuel price fluctuations, higher than analysts\u2019 estimates of a 2.87 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Walmart has recorded over four straight years of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retailer.  E-commerce sales soared 43 percent, topping the 40-percent growth in the previous quarter. The retailer has said it is on track for e-commerce sales to rise by 40 percent this year.  The retailer has also been on an acquisition spree, buying brands aimed at millennial shoppers who typically don\u2019t shop on the retailer\u2019s website. Walmart recently bought lingerie retailer Bare Necessities after purchasing plus-sized clothing startup Eloquii a week earlier.  The company\u2019s e-commerce business is expected to post a slightly greater operating loss next year, the retailer said during investor day.  Walmart\u2019s international sales grew 1.6 percent to $30 billion excluding currency impact. In India, one of its key overseas markets, Walmart suffered a setback on Tuesday when the chief executive officer of its Indian e-commerce business Flipkart Group, resigned following an allegation of sexual assault.  Walmart paid $16 billion for a roughly 77-percent stake in Flipkart in May, its biggest acquisition and a major move in competing against Amazon.  Walmart\u2019s quarterly total revenue increased 2.4 percent to $126.1 billion, excluding currency changes, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $125.56 billion.  Adjusted earnings came to $1.08 per share, above expectations of $1.01. Consolidated net income attributable to Walmart for the third quarter stood at $1.71 billion versus $1.75 billion a year ago.  Walmart raised its adjusted earnings outlook for fiscal year 2019 to $4.75 to $4.85 per share from $4.65 to $4.80.

The deal, one of Walmart\u2019s various global investments and tie-ups geared at helping the retailer compete with Amazon.com Inc, is slated to close by year\u2019s end.  In the United States, Walmart is the largest seller of groceries but grapples with the challenge of swiftly delivering fresh food to the homes of online customers. The company has promised to make such deliveries in 100 U.S. cities by the end of 2018 and so far covers nearly 50 markets.  In a race to meet its goal, the company is working with several small delivery companies including Doordash and Postmates after ditching partnerships with ride-share companies Uber and Lyft.  Cornershop Chief Technology Officer Daniel Undurraga said in an interview on Tuesday that Cornershop plans to launch in Toronto in the first quarter next year. If it does well, Vancouver and Montreal would follow.  If Canada is successful overall, Undurraga said, the United States could be the next target.  \u201cCanada is a good test market for launching a service in the U.S. It is very similar, but smaller,\u201d he said.  Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Judith McKenna, chief executive of Walmart International, said in September that Cornershop was expected to provide a learning experience for Walmart\u2019s markets beyond Mexico and Chile.  An English-language version of the app will roll out within a month as part of preparation for the Canada launch, Undurraga said.  Cornershop still needs to partner with a local payments company and recruit workers in Canada. About 11,000 people currently work for Cornershop across 11 cities in Mexico and Chile.  Apart from Walmart the platform also offers deliveries from various retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Mexican chains Chedraui and La Comer. Undurraga said Cornershop is building firewalls so that Walmart cannot access customer data from other stores.  The company will also consider raising delivery fees to account for higher labor costs in Canada and the United States. Cornershop generates other revenue through advertising, commissions from retailers and price mark-ups.  The technology, however, is already in place.  \u201cWe have our own tools for being able to do this without a lot of effort,\u201d Undurraga said.

FILE PHOTO: A customer shops for a turkey at a Walmart store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski\/File Photo  The world\u2019s largest retailer said on Wednesday that the move would allow it to ensure supplies of quality Angus beef and meet demands from customers who want to know the origin of their meat.  Normally, Walmart would buy Angus beef from companies like Tyson Foods Inc and Cargill Inc.  Walmart has now arranged to source cattle from Texas rancher Bob McClaren of Prime Pursuits and 44 Farms, who said the retailer will sell no-hormones-added Black Angus beef.  The cattle will be fed at a feedyard that specializes in avoiding hormones, slaughtered in Kansas and packaged in Georgia before the beef hits shelves in about 500 Walmart stores in the southeastern United States.  \u201cHaving visibility to the end-to-end process lets us know we are helping our customers bring a consistently great piece of meat to their table every time they buy with us,\u201d Scott Neal, Walmart\u2019s senior vice president of meat, said in a statement.  Tyson and Cargill said they supported Walmart\u2019s project. Tyson shares slipped 0.9 percent, while Walmart shares rose 0.4 percent.  Walmart\u2019s efforts to exert more control over its meat supply come after it switched to selling high-grade Angus beef in 2017.  The retailer\u2019s latest actions target younger consumers who want more transparency in food production and no growth hormones in their meat, said Cassie Fish, a beef industry expert who formerly worked at Tyson.  \u201cIt\u2019s a play for the millennials,\u201d she said.  Walmart has separately increased its control over its dairy supply by opening a processing plant in Indiana that supplies private-label milk to stores.  Rival Costco Wholesale Corp is meanwhile building a chicken plant in Fremont, Nebraska, that will serve its stores.  \u201cThere appears to be an emerging trend of backwards integration into the ag supply chain,\u201d said Jeremy Scott, an analyst at Mizuho.  \u201cThis is a unique approach by Walmart to pursue a direct link from calf to plate, but it comes with plenty of risk and new variables.\u201d  Walmart would struggle to create a supply chain that covers all its beef needs, Vertical Group analyst Heather Jones said, so the retailer will still need to buy some meat from Tyson.  Processors such as Tyson buy cattle from feedlots in broad geographic areas and own multiple plants that slaughter beef for sale by retailers and restaurants.  Tyson also recently announced a program to trace the origins of beef raised without antibiotics or added hormones.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through several years now of very strong demand for beef,\u201d said David Anderson, an agricultural economist at Texas A&M University. \u201cA big part of that is consumers\u2019 demand for higher quality.\u201d","296":"(Repeats from MAY 10, no changes to text)  * 7.3 bln stg takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s was blocked last month  * Asda to update on first-quarter trading on May 16  * Asda has reported seven straight quarters of growth  LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Asda will be scrutinised for clues on whether U.S. owner Walmart wants to line it up for sale or to compete longer term in the cut-throat British grocery market when it gives its first trading update since a planned Sainsbury\u2019s takeover collapsed.  Britain\u2019s competition regulator last month ruled Sainsbury\u2019s 7.3 billion pound ($9.5 billion) takeover of rival Asda cannot proceed, closing one exit route for Walmart.  Asda, which accounts for 6 percent of Walmart\u2019s turnover, is due to publish a first-quarter update on Thursday, when the world\u2019s biggest retailer posts quarterly earnings.  Analysts have speculated that Walmart will try to sell Asda to private equity or consider a stock market listing for the business it acquired for 6.7 billion pounds in 1999.  But a source with direct knowledge of the matter said Walmart is in no rush to make a decision, partly because Asda is performing relatively well under Chief Executive Roger Burnley.  Asda has reported seven consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth, thanks to a strategy focused on lower prices, more innovation in own-brand products, better store standards and improvements in its e-commerce operations.  A read across from monthly industry data produced by researcher Kantar indicates that Asda will likely report an eighth straight quarter of growth.  Walmart has been focused on turning around its international business by targeting higher growth markets such as China and India and exiting or tying up with local players elsewhere.  When the Sainsbury\u2019s deal was blocked on April 25 Judith McKenna, CEO of Walmart International, said its focus was on \u201ccontinuing to position Asda as a strong UK retailer\u201d.  Walmart \u201cwill ensure Asda has the resources it needs to achieve that,\u201d McKenna added at the time.  PROFIT RELIEF  Burnley, like his predecessor Sean Clarke, has benefited from Walmart\u2019s 2016 decision to relax profit demands of around 1 billion pounds on Asda, allowing it to cut prices and stem the loss of market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl.  That strategy shift meant Asda\u2019s operating profit fell 13% to 735.4 million pounds in 2017, its latest published accounts.  \u201cThe issue for Asda is what is Walmart going to tell it what its profit target is,\u201d a senior industry executive said.  \u201cIf Walmart says \u2018we would like you to go back to the profitability you had three years ago\u2019, then Asda can\u2019t execute their current strategy. It\u2019s not designed to deliver that level of profit,\u201d he said.  Another source with connections to Asda said that scenario would mean Burnley having to take out unprofitable, or barely profitable, stores, and cut staff numbers.  \u201cBut I suspect they\u2019ll allow the tap to stay on ... because that makes it more attractive for (a future) sale.\u201d  While Sainsbury\u2019s CEO Mike Coupe, the main architect of the deal, has been heavily criticised for its failure, Burnley has emerged relatively unscathed.  With the exception of one bruising appearance in front of lawmakers in June, Burnley has kept a low public profile since the deal was announced, which insiders say partly reflected his ambivalence towards it.

Deepening its existing partnership with Humana, or even acquiring the company outright, could be a step toward turning its 4,700 or so U.S. stores into healthcare centers that aim to attract more shoppers over 65.  \u201cThe end goal here is to get more people in their stores, get them to buy drugs and make an additional purchase while they are in the store,\u201d said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.  If Walmart can offer \u201ccompetitive rates\u201d on primary care and other health services, he said, it \u201ccan grow traffic and push store visits.\u201d  Walmart approached Humana this month, and the companies began to discuss closer ties focused on new partnerships, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. An acquisition of Humana by Walmart is also being discussed, the sources said.  Walmart declined comment Friday. Humana could not immediately be reached for comment.  Closer ties between the two could enable the retailer to tap into Humana\u2019s patient roster and possibly put some of its physician clinics in stores to offer medical care to customers.  Walmart is the largest retailer to hit upon the combination of retail and health insurance, but it is not the first.  CVS Health Corp CVS.N has struck a $69 billion deal to acquire Aetna Inc AET.N. Separately, insurer Cigna Corp CI.N has a $54 billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits company Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O.

Humana could provide Walmart with \u201cone more way to checkmate Amazon and equal and eclipse the CVS\/Target partnership and equal and eclipse the CVS\/Aetna partnership,\u201d said Burt Flickinger at marketing consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.  \u201cIt allows them to get ahead of everybody from warehouse club operators like Costco, Target and other retailers who run chain drugstores as well as food and drug combo operators like Kroger and Wegmans.\u201d  Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart already has pharmacies at many store locations and has a co-branded drug plan with Humana that caters to patients using Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over 65. That plan steers patients to Walmart stores for their pharmacy needs, offering customers an opportunity to save up to 20 percent on drug costs, analysts said.  Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana is one of the country\u2019s largest providers of Medicare Advantage plans - a type of coverage offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare.  Humana has 5.1 million seniors on prescription drug benefits and another 3.5 million on full medical benefits, according to Ana Gupte, senior health care analyst with Leerink Partners in New York.  Walmart superstores \u201ccould be a one-stop shop for seniors,\u201d said Gupte, adding that Humana already has about 50 pharmacies sharing locations with doctors\u2019 clinics, and could expand that model using Walmart\u2019s real estate and pharmacies.  DATA ANALYSIS  There is also a potential for Walmart and Humana to benefit from their mass of customer data, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.  \u201cOne thing retailers have is a very good understanding of customers. They know their eating habits and other consumption patterns and that is quite useful in forming insurance decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is certainly something that Walmart would be able to leverage.\u201d  Humana patients are most likely already heavy shoppers at Walmart, according to David Friend at the BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence and Innovation.  \u201cIf you know that somebody is on a certain medicine you can sell them other products and services and that will help keep customer loyalty,\u201d he said.","299":"March 16 (Reuters) -  * WALMART IS SAID NEARING $7 BILLION FLIPKART DEAL IN INDIA PUSH - BLOOMBERG, CITING SOURCES  * WALMART PLANS TO BUY ABOUT THIRD OF FLIPKART , IN PART BY PURCHASING STAKES FROM TIGER GLOBAL MANAGEMENT AND SOFTBANK GROUP- BLOOMBERG, CITING SOURCES  * WALMART DEAL MAY PUSH THE VALUATION OF FLIPKART TO ABOUT $20 BILLION, UP FROM ABOUT $12 BILLION LAST YEAR- BLOOMBERG, CITING SOURCES Source text - bloom.bg\/2IuF7s7 Further company coverage:","300":"Sept 5 (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said on Thursday it would stop shoppers from carrying firearms in its Walgreen stores, joining Walmart Inc and Kroger Co in tweaking its gun policy following several deadly shootings in the United States.  \u201cWe are joining other retailers in asking our customers to no longer openly carry firearms into our stores other than authorized law enforcement officials,\u201d the pharmacy store chain said in an e-mailed statement.

FILE PHOTO: A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California April 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Walmart last week acquired Eloquii, a fashion startup that sells plus-sized clothing.  The company also tied up with comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres to launch a women\u2019s fashion line in August.  In 2017, the Bentonville, Arkansas based retailer partnered with department store chain Lord & Taylor and started offering its products on Walmart.com. Lord & Taylor is owned by Hudson's Bay Co HBC.TO.  Walmart also last year bought ShoeBuy, which specializes in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; Bonobos, which sells men\u2019s clothing and ModCloth, an online seller of women\u2019s apparel.  Walmart's string of small fashion-company acquisitions is designed to help the retailer access younger, millennial customers who do not normally shop on its website, and recover ground lost to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and others.  The deal also reflects a sense of urgency to defend market share. According to a report from Morgan Stanley, Walmart had 8.6 percent of the U.S. apparel market in 2017, followed by Amazon at 7.9 percent and Target Corp TGT.N at 4.8 percent.  The report estimated Amazon will overtake Walmart as the leading retailer in the apparel category in 2018.  \u201cThe acquisition of Bare Necessities fits well into our broader acquisition strategy, which includes two different types of companies: category leaders ... and digital brands that offer unique products,\u201d Denise Incandela, head of fashion, Walmart U.S. eCommerce, said in a blog post.

Nutrien\u2019s push to expand farm loans starting this year comes as low commodity prices have depressed U.S. farm incomes, leaving growers less money to spend on seed and fertilizer.  \u201cWe are trying to provide the fuel for retail to grow,\u201d CFO Pedro Farah, a former Walmart Inc executive, told Reuters. \u201cWe know whoever buys with financing tends to buy a lot more. It increases the depth of the relationship (with farmers) and the stickiness.\u201d  Nutrien has not previously disclosed its target for farm loans. It told a meeting of investors this week that it intends to expand its financial arm.  The Saskatchewan-based company\u2019s current loans to U.S. farmers to buy supplies amount to $2 billion, or 8 percent of the U.S. farm input financing market, in which it competes with commercial banks, tractor-maker Deere & Co and rival farm suppliers such as CHS Inc.  Farah, a 58-year-old Brazilian by birth who joined Nutrien in February from Walmart, is leading the strategy, but adds that Nutrien was developing the idea before he arrived.  Expanding Nutrien\u2019s lending to customers mirrors a broad expansion of financial services by retailers such as Walmart, eBay and Amazon.com, he said.  \u201cAll retailers are recognizing that financial services are a key component of the sales process. It\u2019s something that, as a retailer, we\u2019ve got to offer, especially in a market that\u2019s probably underserved,\u201d Farah said.  Nutrien is seeking the approval of credit rating agencies to raise its debt to equity ratio and lend more, starting this year, Farah said.  Nutrien\u2019s share of U.S. farm retail sales is a market-leading 20 percent, and the company has said it aims to grow further through acquisitions of smaller sellers.  Asked why Nutrien would expand U.S. farm loans when some banks see them as too risky, Farah said the company\u2019s longstanding relationships with farmers is a major difference.  \u201cThey don\u2019t know growers as well as we do,\u201d he said.

The companies said they would work with consultancy KPMG to create a shared blockchain network that will allow real-time monitoring of products in the pharmaceutical supply chain.  The project has been authorized under the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) that was set up to increase regulatory oversight of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated or otherwise harmful drugs.  The FDA has previously used the DSCSA to issue a warning letter to drug distributor McKesson Corp for violations involving opioid medications.  Opioids have been tied to thousands of overdose deaths and state and local governments across the United States have filed lawsuits seeking to hold pharmaceutical companies responsible for the epidemic of abuse.  The new project is aimed at reducing the time needed to track and trace prescription drugs, improving access to reliable distribution information and ensuring products are handled appropriately and stored at the right temperature while being distributed, the companies said in a statement.  Blockchain technology, originally conceived a decade ago as the basis for the cryptocurrency bitcoin, will help stakeholders establish a permanent record and can be integrated with existing systems used to trace products while they are distributed.

The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/Illustration  In late December, India modified rules around foreign direct investment (FDI) in e-commerce, creating additional hurdles for the retail giants. The rules, which kick in on Friday, do not allow e-commerce sites to \u201cexercise ownership or control over the inventory\u201d of sellers.  India does not allow foreign investors to control and market their own inventory on their e-commerce platforms. They are only allowed to operate marketplace platforms where others sell goods to retail consumers.  Traders and rivals say companies such as Amazon and Flipkart have been violating the spirit of these rules by creating proxy sellers or vendors in which they have direct or indirect stakes, allowing firms to give deep discounts that upset off-line trade.  The All India Online Vendors Association, a group of about 3,500 online sellers, has accused both Flipkart and Amazon of using their dominant position to favour selected sellers. Amazon and Flipkart deny the accusations.  Both Amazon and Flipkart sought more time to comply with the new rules. But India said on Thursday, it had, after \u201cdue consideration\u201d decided not to extend beyond Feb. 1 the deadline for the implementation of the modified FDI norms.  In a letter to India\u2019s industries department earlier this month, Flipkart Chief Executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy said the rules required it to assess \u201call elements\u201d of its business operations, a source told Reuters previously.  Flipkart and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on their plans for complying with the new regulations.  EQUITY STAKES  The new rules, meant to close loopholes in the regulations, state that if any seller purchases more than 25 percent of its inventory from the wholesale units or other group companies of an e-commerce firm that runs an online marketplace, then that vendor\u2019s inventory will be deemed to be controlled by the e-commerce company.  That could disrupt the models of Amazon and Flipkart, whose wholesale units buy products in bulk and sell to thousands of vendors on their platform, who in turn sell to consumers.  Flipkart was likely to create a so-called \u201cmiddle layer\u201d firm - in which it would have less than a 25 percent shareholding - between its wholesale arm and vendors on its marketplace, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  This company, which would be classified as a non-group company under Indian law, would be able to freely sell to vendors without the 25 percent sourcing restriction, the sources added.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Another rule blocks entities in which an e-commerce firm, or any of its group companies, owns a stake from selling its products on that firm\u2019s marketplace.  This creates a barrier for India\u2019s Shopper\u2019s Stop to sell on Amazon India, as Amazon\u2019s investment arm has a minority stake in the department store chain.  Cloudtail and Appario, among the top sellers on Amazon India, could also face similar restrictions, because Amazon owns minority stakes in their parent firms.  \u201cBy the letter of the regulation it will not be considered to be an entity in which Amazon has an equity stake, but if the government is wanting to implement the spirit of this rule they might say this doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d one of the sources said.  E-commerce players may also be forced to give up the word \u201cexclusive\u201d when they launch products such as smartphones on their platforms, as the rules mandate that an online retailer cannot push vendors to \u201csell any product exclusively on its platform only\u201d.  Contracts between a brand and e-commerce firms would be reworded to say a brand would not sell to a direct rival, giving it freedom to sell elsewhere, one of the sources said.","311":"May 4 (Reuters) -  * INDIA\u2019S FLIPKART BOARD APPROVES DEAL TO SELL ABOUT 75 PERCENT OF CO TO WALMART-LED GROUP FOR ABOUT $15 BILLION - BLOOMBERG CITING SOURCES  * SOFTBANK TO SELL ALL ITS 20-PLUS PERCENT STAKE IN FLIPKART AS PART OF FLIPKART-WALMART DEAL - BLOOMBERG CITING SOURCES  * GOOGLE PARENT ALPHABET LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE IN INVESTMENT WITH WALMART IN FLIPKART DEAL - BLOOMBERG CITING SOURCES  * A FINAL CLOSE OF WALMART-FLIPKART DEAL IS EXPECTED WITHIN 10 DAYS - BLOOMBERG CITING SOURCES  * WALMART-FLIPKART DEAL TERMS COULD STILL CHANGE AND A DEAL ISN\u2019T CERTAIN - BLOOMBERG CITING SOURCES (Mumbai Newsroom)","312":"FILE PHOTO: The supermarket Lider of the retailer Walmart is seen in Santiago, Chile, July 10, 2019.

Thomas Marshall, a 23-year-old category manager in San Bruno began his protest by emailing fellow employees and asking them to call in sick on Tuesday, leave work early on Wednesday, and sign a Change.org petition.

Earlier this week, Walmart told Reuters there had been no change in its policy on gun sales after the mass shootings, one of which took place in a Walmart store.  Years of public pressure led Walmart, the largest U.S arms retailer, to end assault rifle sales in 2015 and in 2018 to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21. Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether.

Walmart Inc acquired Jet for $3.3 billion in August 2016, a deal that was widely considered a watershed moment for its then-struggling e-commerce operation as it got access to both technology and talent through Jet founder Marc Lore and his team.  \u201cWe both had a keen interest in serving that urban affluent customer,\u201d said Jet\u2019s chief customer officer, David Echegoyen. The relationship with Nike, scheduled for kick-off in October, would \u201cbring customers on Jet a set of everything,\u201d he added.  Nike launched a pilot to sell footwear and apparel on Amazon last year, in a dramatic turnaround after long steering clear of the world\u2019s largest online retailer. That partnership was a signal that Amazon was serious about fighting counterfeit goods on its site and was courting once weary fashion brands. This summer, Nike\u2019s chief executive officer told analysts on a conference call that the partnership was \u201cprogressing well.\u201d  Jet\u2019s relationship with Nike is less about the Nike product and more about how consumers go about discovering a sneaker or running shoe, Jet executives said.  Jet said it is still finalizing the line-up of Nike products to be offered on the site.Jet is separately courting urban millennial customers through initiatives in another category: grocery. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing a grocery experience together with a fashion experience with a home experience that customers can check out in one cart,\u201d Jet\u2019s CEO, Simon Belsham, said.  Through Parcel, the last-mile delivery tech company acquired by Walmart in 2017, most New York City consumers will be able to arrange three-hour scheduled delivery windows for groceries - now including fresh produce - and other merchandise from local shops.

Jet executives said the initiatives were not in response to Amazon Prime Now, the company\u2019s two-hour delivery service that lets customers shop Whole Foods and other local stores in cities around the world.  Many analysts view Amazon as unmatched in handling distribution and delivery for non-perishable goods, meaning other e-commerce players may be challenged to offer the same level of service.

FILE PHOTO: People walk past a closed superstore of Reliance Smart, a superstore operated by Reliance Industries Ltd., at Kharar, on the outskirts of Chandigarh, India, January 8, 2021. REUTERS\/Manoj Kumar  Thousands of farmers from states including northern Punjab have camped for weeks on the outskirts of the capital, in a bid to force Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal the laws they contend will benefit corporates, rather than cultivators.  Fears of farmers\u2019 agitation in Punjab, home to many protest leaders, have stoked companies\u2019 fears over vandalism and the safety of employees, prompting the closure of dozens of shops, store employees and industry sources said.  Since October, more than half the roughly 100 stores of top retailer Reliance Retail in Punjab and Walmart\u2019s 50,000-square-foot (4,645-sq-m) wholesale outlet in the district of Bathinda, a centre of the protests, have been shut, the sources added.  \u201cWe are scared of the protesting farmers,\u201d said a senior official of a shuttered Reliance outlet in Mohali, a prosperous city located in the farm belt.  One industry source said estimated losses for Reliance from its state-wide shutdowns run into millions of dollars. Two other sources said Walmart\u2019s estimated revenue loss from its store, one of 29 such outlets nationwide, has crossed $8 million.  \u201cThe farmers camp outside the Walmart store daily, they don\u2019t let anybody go in,\u201d said one of the sources, adding that the store employed about 250 people.  Thousands of items in the store are gathering dust and have passed their use-by date.  Reliance store officials and the sources, who have direct knowledge of the situation, sought anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to media.  Walmart and its Indian unit, Flipkart, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reliance, India\u2019s largest private company, also did not respond.  Both firms can absorb the losses for now, said Ankur Bisen, head of consumer and retail at consultancy Technopak Advisors, but he added, \u201cThey have to keep their fingers crossed that shutdowns do not extend to other states.\u201d  A Punjab official said authorities were ready to provide security but could do little if companies had decided to keep their stores shut.  For their part, farmer unions have vowed to continue the protests and block stores from opening, even as the Supreme Court this week ordered a temporary suspension of the farm laws as it sets up a panel to examine their complaints.  \u201cOur protests against corporates like Reliance will continue ... there is no question of lifting our sit-ins,\u201d said Kulwant Singh Sandhu, an official of one protesting group, the Democratic Farmers\u2019 Union.  Another farm leader, Jagtar Singh, said protests against Reliance would continue until the government repealed the laws.  India says the laws passed in September will boost farmers\u2019 incomes by letting them deal directly with big companies and bypass government-regulated wholesale markets.  But many of the unions disagree, saying they risk losing their bargaining power and becoming vulnerable to potential bulk buyers such as Walmart and Reliance.  They fear the eventual disappearance of the guaranteed prices the government pays for their grain.  Reliance, controlled by one of Asia\u2019s richest men, Mukesh Ambani, has said it would require suppliers to abide by these prices, known as minimum support prices, or a similar mechanism.  In December, the protests also disrupted Reliance\u2019s nearly 2,000 telecom towers and several petrol pumps in Punjab. Protests along highways linking it to New Delhi have disrupted transport and industries such as textiles.  In November, Punjab estimated economic losses from the protests at $4 billion, while one industry group has pegged the overall hit to India\u2019s economy at $9.6 billion.","319":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - FedEx Corp FDX.N is expanding its retail business, FedEx Office, in the United States by adding 500 new locations within Walmart Inc WMT.N stores in the next two years.

FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  Walmart said it will integrate Jet.com\u2019s retail, technology, marketing, analytics and product teams with its own online business. The current president of Jet.com, Simon Belsham, will leave in early August.  Walmart\u2019s move reduces the scope and importance of Jet.com in its overall U.S. e-commerce business, which competes with Amazon.com Inc, according to interviews with six vendors, two consultants and three Walmart employees.  Jet.com, which was expected to boost Walmart\u2019s reach particularly with city dwellers and millennial shoppers, failed to become a driver for online grocery sales and growing market share in urban areas, the sources added.  Walmart has put more emphasis on shopper perks such as same-day delivery and curbside pickup of groceries ordered online, focusing on food and grocery sales using those delivery methods. Jet, as a platform to sell similar items, has fallen by the wayside, the sources added.  The Jet overhaul is the latest sign that Walmart is attempting to fix the ways it reaches shoppers using different websites and delivery methods. Earlier this year, it ended a delivery partnership with Google-backed Deliv and last year Reuters reported its struggles to use its own employees to deliver products.  Multiple large and medium-sized consumer goods companies that do business with both Walmart and Jet have told Reuters they began noticing Walmart executives buying less of their merchandise to sell through Jet.  The reductions in Walmart\u2019s order sizes for its Jet unit, they said, started in March, when many vendors began discussing business priorities with Walmart for the 2019 fiscal year.  In 2016, Jet forecast revenue of $1 billion and according to recent estimates from consulting firm Kantar, which was shared with some vendors, the company\u2019s sales shrunk to $689 million in 2019.  The data from Kantar also shows the number of U.S. households that shopped on Jet.com in January 2019 was 2%, down from 3% during the same period three years ago, forcing Walmart to recalibrate using Jet as a platform to drive online grocery sales.  Several vendors, who told Reuters they were keen to introduce new packaging and pricing on Walmart.com and Walmart-owned websites like Jet this year, said the retailer told them to look for ways to push more sales on Walmart.com going forward and not spend resources on a new strategy for sales of their merchandise on Jet.  Walmart merchants are also informing grocery, apparel and electronics suppliers that want to introduce new products online that Jet is not a priority, according to vendor sources.  Separately, current and former Jet employees told Reuters that Hoboken, New Jersey-based Jet, is struggling to keep up its sales momentum and hit revenue goals. Two retail consultants, who advise Walmart on e-commerce and online grocery, have confirmed to Reuters that Jet is failing to keep pace with Walmart\u2019s internal sales goals.  They said Walmart has de-prioritized the business and is focusing more on growing sales through its namesake website and offering a broader assortment of fashion and accessories through the multiple smaller brands like Moosejaw, Modcloth, Bonobos, Eloquii, Hayneedle and others it has acquired in the past few years to attract millennials.  The retailer has previously said it expects losses from its online business, including Jet.com, to increase this year, without giving additional details. In the most recent quarter, Walmart\u2019s online sales grew 37% and Marc Lore, founder of Jet.com, who Walmart hired in 2016 to run its U.S. e-commerce operations, is still leading the business.  In 2018, the first cracks in Jet\u2019s business started to appear when Walmart\u2019s CEO said the retailer\u2019s marketing efforts will always be centered on Walmart.com as it is cheaper to acquire a new customer nationally with such a strategy and it is investing fewer ad dollars in Jet. He said the retailer will target Jet\u2019s investments in urban markets, where the business is \u201cwell-positioned to grow.\u201d  A study from a retail analytics firm the same year found shopper traffic on Jet.com had declined in March, a study Walmart said then was inaccurate and not reflective of a trend.  Going forward, Kieran Shanahan, who oversees Walmart\u2019s food, consumables, health and wellness categories, will be responsible for Jet.com\u2019s strategy and management, in addition to his current role.","321":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc launched a program on Thursday to help its Chinese suppliers cut emissions of climate-warming greenhouse gas by 50 million tonnes by the end of the next decade.

Walmart said it had created a specific program for China that would begin with around 100 major Chinese suppliers and provide tools to measure emissions and set targets.  \u201cWe are working with our suppliers on areas such as energy efficiency, renewables, packaging, waste reduction, and thinking about areas like deforestation and improving energy efficiency,\u201d said Laura Phillips, senior vice president for sustainability.  The company aims to eventually expand the program to its entire China supply chain.

Walmart will offer seven bachelor\u2019s degrees and two diplomas in fields such as health science and healthcare management through a program that already offers degrees in the fields of business, supply chain management, computer science and cyber security, the company said.  The new offerings will help the retailer train staff to fill critical healthcare roles across its stores, which include more than 5,000 retail pharmacies as well as vision and hearing centers, it said.  Medical services, which typically have higher margins than retail products on shelves, allow Walmart to not only tap into the healthcare needs of senior citizens and low income shoppers but also boost its retail business by getting customers visiting its pharmacies to pick up additional items along the way.  Last year, Walmart signed a deal with Anthem, one of the country\u2019s largest insurers, to attract more Medicare enrollees to buy over-the-counter medicines and supplies at its stores.  This month, it opened a facility in Georgia to offer low-priced health services that include dental, x-rays, and mental health counseling.  Walmart also runs one of the largest pharmacy chains in the country and has been aggressive in offering low priced generic drugs and prescriptions.  Health and wellness products have accounted for 11% of its merchandise sales in recent years, according to analysts. The company does not separately break out such data.  Walmart\u2019s move is also tied to U.S. retailers struggling to hire and retain talent, especially young workers, with unemployment at its lowest in nearly half a century.  A year after the launch of Walmart\u2019s education program, more than 13,000 Walmart workers have been accepted to at least one of the courses and over 100,000 employees have expressed an interest in joining, the retailer said.

Video of the scene showed heavy police presence around a car riddled with bullet holes in the Walmart parking lot in Duncan, Oklahoma. A white sheet, covering what appeared to be a body, was laid next to it, with blood stains visible on the ground.  The bodies of one woman and one man were found inside the car, with another dead man found outside the car, the Duncan Police Department said on Facebook. A handgun was found on the scene, police said.  The shooter was among the dead, the Duncan Banner newspaper reported citing police.  Duncan is a town of roughly 22,000 people located about 80 miles (129 km) south of Oklahoma City.  The incident came the day after another shooting in Fresno, California, that saw at least four killed as people gathered in a backyard to watch a football game, with at least one shooter still unaccounted for.  California was also hit by a school shooting in Santa Clarita last week in which a 16-year-old boy shot and killed two classmates before turning the gun on himself, and a San Diego shooting on Saturday that saw a man kill his estranged wife and three of their young sons before killing himself.

Walmart\u2019s Spark Delivery is a crowdsourced platform, which works with independent drivers who partner with Delivery Drivers Inc, a separate firm that manages such workers.  The initiative is Walmart\u2019s latest attempt to tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the so-called \u201clast mile\u201d of delivering goods to online customers. Despite having 4,700 U.S. stores within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, the Bentonville, Arkansas based retailer is still trying to figure out how to efficiently make deliveries and has poured billions of dollars into ecommerce in recent years.  Walmart is the largest U.S. seller of groceries and its aggressive expansion into home delivery follows Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, which spurred several traditional retailers to push such services fearing increased competition in the sector.  Walmart has so far had mixed success with its various delivery initiatives. Reuters was first to report the end of Walmart\u2019s delivery partnerships with Uber and Lyft and how in a separate trial the retailer struggled to get its own employees to deliver groceries to customers\u2019 homes after completing their usual shifts of up to nine hours.  In March, Walmart said it will offer home delivery of groceries to 100 U.S. cities covering 40 percent of U.S. households by the end of 2018 and has since tied up with several small delivery companies like Doordash and Postmates, who offer gig-style jobs to workers, to meet its goal.  As of Wednesday, Walmart said its grocery home delivery service is available in nearly 50 markets including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Miami and Seattle.  The company said its work with third-party delivery providers will continue to be a leading part of its delivery strategy even as it runs this pilot.  \u201cSpark Delivery is one way we\u2019re exploring how to get quality groceries from our door to our customers\u2019 doors,\u201d Walmart\u2019s U.S. CEO Greg Foran said in a statement.  Spark uses Walmart\u2019s in-house platform to allow drivers to sign up for time slots that work best with their schedules and offers navigation assistance among other services.  Walmart said its partner Delivery Drivers will handle recruiting, screening, background checks, payment and accounting, among other services for drivers.  A Walmart spokeswoman told Reuters, drivers will earn a fee on each delivery along with the gratuity they receive from customers. Dependent upon the number of orders delivered, driver\u2019s pay can exceed $20 an hour, she said.  Rival Amazon Flex pays independent drivers $18 to $25 an hour for deliveries, and the fuel costs are borne by the driver, according to the Amazon Flex website.

The company last month shut 63 stores, or about 1\/10th of its total, and laid off nearly 10,000 workers after a review of profitability. The layoffs were the largest since the first Sam\u2019s Club opened in 1983.  The moves are a part of a strategic shift by Sam\u2019s new chief executive, John Furner, as he attempts to turn around a business that has underperformed its parent Walmart and rivals like Costco Wholesale Corp.  \u201cWe are creating a new Sam\u2019s Club for our members,\u201d Furner said on a media conference call.  \u201cWe are adding more value to our membership, we\u2019re making strategic choices and changing how we work to drive visible growth,\u201d he said.  Sam\u2019s Club will now offer two membership options, down from three earlier. They will be offered as Sam\u2019s Club for $45 a year and Sam\u2019s Plus for $100 a year.  The company will offer free shipping on 95 percent of the items it sells online, with no minimum order size for Sam\u2019s Plus members, Jamie Iannone, chief executive of SamsClub.com, said on the conference call.  The retailer, which currently relies on Walmart\u2019s supply chain network to make online order deliveries, recently said it will open its own first e-commerce fulfillment center in Memphis, Tennessee, and expects to ship its first package in the spring.  It is also considering other regions, like Texas, Central Florida, Southern California, the Chicago area, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, for new e-commerce warehouses.","331":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N said on Thursday it will begin several healthcare pilot programs for its U.S. employees starting Jan. 1 as it looks for ways to cut healthcare costs - one of the largest expenses for the retailer after wages.

The pilot programs will be held in parts of Arkansas, Florida and Texas.  The company is the largest U.S. private-sector employer with a 1.4 million workforce.  In North Carolina and South Carolina, the company will test a concierge service to address issues with billing, fix appointments, understand a diagnosis and find a provider.  In Colorado, Wisconsin and Minnesota, Walmart will expand a program that allows patients to video chat with a doctor from home for $4 per chat.  The retailer will also offer workers access to fitness clubs for $9 per bi-weekly pay period and add a predictable co-pay of $35 for every visit to a primary care physician under its most popular medical plan. These services will be available nationwide.  In addition to healthcare services for employees, the company is also beefing up its presence in the fast-growing health and wellness market in the country.  Recently, Walmart said it is expanding an education program it began last year by offering healthcare degrees, aimed at filling critical roles at its more than 5,000 retail pharmacies.  Last year, the retailer signed a deal with Anthem Inc ANTM.N, one of the country's largest insurers, to attract more Medicare enrollees to buy over-the-counter medicines and supplies at its stores.  This month, it opened a facility in Georgia to offer low-priced health services that include dental, x-rays, and mental health counseling.

Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s plunged as much as 17 percent on Wednesday after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its provisional view was the deal should be blocked, require the sale of a large number of stores, or even one of the brands.  \u201cClose to the worst possible outcome (for the companies),\u201d said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.  Sainsbury\u2019s, Britain\u2019s second-biggest supermarket chain, and number three Asda agreed the deal last April, aiming to overtake market leader Tesco. They hoped their combined buying power would enable them to better compete with fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, an enlarged Tesco after its purchase of wholesaler Booker and online retailers like Amazon.  If approved, the deal would create a company with annual revenue of about $66 billion, more than 2,800 stores and a grocery market share of 31.2 percent. It would also give the world\u2019s biggest retailer Walmart a way to exit Britain, one of the weakest performers in its portfolio.  The biggest proposed takeover in the UK sector for 15 years, the two groups have pitched it as a way to cut prices for customers in a 185 billion pounds-a-year ($241 billion) market.  But the CMA said it had \u201cextensive\u201d concerns that the deal could lead to higher prices, a poorer shopping experience and reductions in the range and quality of products offered.  It was \u201clikely to be difficult for the companies to address\u201d those concerns, it said, adding it was also worried prices could rise at a large number of Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda petrol stations.  The two companies issued an immediate and angry response, saying they fundamentally disagreed with the findings.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe, who as the architect of the deal could come under investor pressure if it fails, added: \u201cWe will fight right the way through the process\u201d.  At 1250 GMT, Sainsbury\u2019s shares were down 15.4 percent at 243.7 pence. Smaller rival Morrisons, which could benefit from two of its rivals being distracted by a major integration and the exit of Walmart, fell 6 percent.  Tesco\u2019s shares were little changed.  (Graphic: British grocers - tmsnrt.rs\/2EiWU5r)  MOVING GOALPOSTS  The CMA, an independent body which works to promote competition for consumers, will now seek responses and submissions from all interested parties ahead of a final report due by April 30.  It has been led since last June by former lawmaker Andrew Tyrie, who was unafraid to take on the big banks when he chaired the parliamentary committee overseeing financial services.  \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to carry out a thorough assessment of the deal to make sure that the sector remains competitive and shoppers don\u2019t lose out,\u201d the CMA\u2019s Stuart McIntosh said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  It said the presence in any geographical location of the big four supermarkets of Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons prevented the others from raising prices. While discounters Aldi and Lidl do apply their own pressure, they do not do so to the same extent because they offer a smaller range.  As a result, the CMA said were Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda to merge, the combined group could push prices higher because there would be less competition in the market. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda accused the CMA of not understanding market forces.  The unexpectedly harsh verdict meant investors turned their focus to the standalone futures of the two groups. Sainsbury\u2019s has underperformed the wider sector in recent years, while Asda has steadily improved.  \u201cFor Sainsbury\u2019s we see this as a major blow and one that removes the merger premium and so we downgrade to SELL, noting its laggard status in British supermarketing,\u201d Shore Capital said.  Bernstein\u2019s Monteyne said there were now enough worries at Sainsbury\u2019s \u201cto make the shares nearly uninvestable in the next few months\u201d. Jefferies analysts said Asda could be bought by a private equity group.  The CMA\u2019s objections contrast with the relatively easy passage given to Tesco\u2019s takeover of Britain\u2019s biggest wholesaler Booker, which rivals and some analysts had argued would give Tesco an almost unassailable position in UK retail.  \u201cThe CMA has moved the goalposts and its analysis is inconsistent with comparable cases,\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda said.  \u201cWe will be working to understand the rationale behind these findings and will continue to make our case in the coming weeks.\u201d Asked if Sainsbury\u2019s would consider a judicial challenge, CEO Coupe said the group would fight on.  Under the takeover plan, Walmart would receive 3 billion pounds and take a 42 percent stake in the combined business. Walmart has the option of selling down to 29.9 percent after two years and exiting completely after four.  The two groups have said they would lower prices on \u201ceveryday items\u201d by around 10 percent, financed by cost savings from big suppliers.  Both companies have declined to say how many forced store disposals would make the deal unattractive, but a source with knowledge of the two firms\u2019 thinking has told Reuters a figure \u201cinto the hundreds\u201d could scupper it.  UBS, Sainsbury\u2019s house broker, has said the deal\u2019s economics can absorb at least 132 store disposals and potentially dozens more.","334":"Sept 17 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc likely discriminated against 178 female workers by paying less or denying promotions or both because of their gender, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the newspaper said on Tuesday.  The agency urged Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a \u201cjust resolution,\u201d which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart\u2019s employment practices, after finding \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe there was gender discrimination, the newspaper said.  Walmart is the world\u2019s largest retailer, and according to the newspaper has 1.5 million U.S. employees.  Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman, said Walmart told the EEOC it was willing to engage in a \u201cconciliatory process,\u201d though in most cases the agency\u2019s reasonable cause findings were \u201cvague and non-specific.\u201d  He also said the cases involved allegations that were more than 15 years old, and were \u201cnot representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart.\u201d  A lawyer who has acted as a co-counsel for women who filed complaints could not immediately be reached for comment.  In 2011, Walmart convinced the U.S. Supreme Court not to let roughly 1.5 million female workers complaining about pay and promotions sue in a class action, with a majority of justices concluding the women had too little in common to sue as a group.  More than 1,900 women have since pursued cases and filed charges with the EEOC accusing the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer of gender discrimination, the Journal said.  The charges involving the 178 women come from more than 30 states, and it is rare for the EEOC to pursue that many cases against one employer over such a wide geographic area, the newspaper added, citing labor lawyers.  An EEOC spokesman told the newspaper that the agency cannot discuss investigations or the administrative process until litigation is filed.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Asda, now owned by the Issa brothers and private equity group TDR Capital, on Thursday reported a 5.1% rise in same-store sales over the three months to Dec. 31 - an improvement on third-quarter growth of 2.7%.  All of Britain\u2019s major supermarket groups performed strongly in the Christmas period, with coronavirus restrictions closing the hospitality sector and forcing many people to work from home.  \u201cAsda\u2019s growth during the period was driven by a notable shift in shopping behaviour, with customers trading up and spending more on premium categories at Christmas to treat themselves after a difficult year,\u201d it said.  Asda highlighted December sales of premium lines up 30% year on year and a 76% jump in online sales during the quarter.  The billionaire brothers and TDR completed the purchase of a majority holding in Asda from Walmart on Tuesday in a deal giving it an enterprise value of 6.8 billion pounds ($9.5 billion).  The deal still requires regulatory approval, with the parties subject to an enforcement order from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to ensure Asda continues to operate independently from its buyers while it conducts its investigation.  The CMA has set an April 20 deadline for a ruling. The brothers and TDR have said they \u201cremain confident\u201d of a positive outcome.  The brothers and TDR are contributing only 780 million pounds, with the rest of the deal financed through 3.5 billion pounds of debt, the sale of Asda\u2019s 322 petrol forecourt sites to their own EG Group for 750 million pounds and the sale of its distribution centres.  While the brothers and TDR have called the capital structure \u201crobust\u201d, some within Asda are uncomfortable with the level of debt, which is higher than rivals, and the planned sale of the petrol stations, said one source with knowledge of the situation.  The brothers have pledged to invest more than 1 billion pounds in Asda over the next three years.  Walmart will retain an equity investment in Asda, with an ongoing commercial relationship and a seat on the board.","336":"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc WMT.N has decided to sell Japanese supermarket chain Seiyu and has already approached major retailers and private equity funds, the Nikkei business daily reported on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  If realized, the sale could amount to around 300 billion to 500 billion yen ($2.7 billion to $4.5 billion), the Nikkei said, without citing its sources.  Walmart said it does not comment on market speculation.  A sale would be the latest exit by Walmart from a lower-growth market as it looks to shake up its overseas business and invest in places like China and India.  The world\u2019s biggest retailer said last month it had sold an 80 percent stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International, exiting an underperforming business in its third major international deal since April.  In addition to competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com AMZN.O, Japan's supermarkets are being squeezed by chains such as convenience stores and discount drugstores in a sluggish consumption environment.  In January Walmart said it was launching an online grocery service with Rakuten Inc 4755.T, in what Rakuten CEO Hiroshi Mikitani said he hoped may be a precursor to greater global cooperation.  Walmart has struggled to replicate the success of its low-price model with Seiyu despite the introduction of an \u201ceveryday low price\u201d pledge and frequent discounting.  Japanese supermarkets, with lots of workers preparing fresh food and high levels of customer service, are famous for their low margins and are proving a drag for many retailers.  Recent industry consolidation saw the creation of FamilyMart Uny Holdings Co Ltd 8028.T in 2016, a deal that focused on expanding the number of FamilyMart convenience stores. Such stores have increasingly become a priority for retailers as a growth driver.  Discounter Don Quijote Holdings Co Ltd 7532.T has taken a 40 percent stake in Uny as it looks for room to expand. Earlier this year Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd 3382.T announced a tie-up with regional general merchandise store chain Izumi Co Ltd 8273.T.

The new private brands, which are owned by the retailer, will be available in Walmart stores and online starting March 1, the company said on Tuesday.

A new survey of 1,699 shoppers by Coresight Research showed Amazon\u2019s apparel category has sharply gained in popularity, with footwear and casual clothing proving to be the online retailer\u2019s most popular categories and ease of browsing its biggest draw.  Walmart, which is still the largest clothing retailer in the United States, is upgrading the apparel section in its stores with improved displays, open floor plans and better fitting rooms, it said.

Its shares fell 9.4 percent as investors worried that Walmart would not be able to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, the world's biggest online retailer, as it struggles with managing its online business.  Even as comparable sales in the U.S. market rose for the 14th consecutive quarter, Walmart\u2019s online sales grew 23 percent in the fourth quarter that included the holidays. In the same period a year ago, sales grew 29 percent, while online sales were up 50 percent in the third quarter.  It was also slower than Amazon\u2019s North American sales growth of 40 percent during the holiday quarter.  Walmart\u2019s online performance was hurt during the quarter as growth fueled by the purchase of Jet.com began to lessen and the retailer struggled to balance its online inventory, Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a conference call with investors.  While Walmart added more holiday merchandise like electronics, toys and gifts, it did not stock enough everyday items, which hurt sales.  Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, said Walmart\u2019s trouble figuring out online inventory during the quarter raised questions about its preparedness to fight Amazon.  The company posted about $11.5 billion in U.S. e-commerce revenue for the year but lost money. McMillon expects e-commerce losses this year to be \u201cabout the same\u201d as last year.  Analysts said the company\u2019s price war with Amazon weighed on margins. In November, Walmart\u2019s prices were within striking distance of matching Amazon\u2019s for the first time.

Its shares slumped 10.2 percent, and suffered their biggest percentage fall since January 1988.  Markets have been choppy in recent weeks, falling more than 10 percent from their Jan. 26 high only to rebound last week with their best weekly gain in five years.

The initial market selloff in January was sparked after economic data raised worries the economy may overheat, causing a quick spike in bond yields and concern the Federal Reserve may become more aggressive in raising U.S. interest rates.

The world's largest retailer is in talks to merge its UK arm ASDA with J Sainsbury Plc SBRY.L in which it will hold a minority stake. Walmart is also looking to acquire a majority stake in India's leading online retailer Flipkart for $10 billion to $12 billion after years of underperformance there.  FILE PHOTO: A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California, U.S. on April 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The moves underscore Walmart's renewed focus on catching up with competitors, ranging from grocer Aldi Inc to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, in key international markets. The retailer\u2019s underperforming international business contributed less than a quarter to its total revenue of $500.3 billion in fiscal 2018.  \u201cWalmart has simply been too slow to react when it comes to their overseas business,\u201d said Burt Flickinger, managing director, Strategic Resource Group. \u201cThey have finally started taking corrective action and are now dedicating their resources to where they think they can grow,\u201d he said. It also marks a shift in Walmart\u2019s traditional approach of building a business on its own.  \u201cWalmart is clearly moving away from trying to crack tough foreign markets by itself to striking partnerships because it realizes that is the fastest way to bridge the gap with competitors,\u201d said Laura Kennedy, vice president, retail sales and shopper practice at Kantar Consulting.  A Walmart spokesman declined to comment on the negotiations in the UK and India.  Overall, sales from Walmart International, which runs about 6,300 stores globally, stood at $118.07 billion in the fiscal year ended 2018, down nearly 14 percent from $136.5 billion in 2014. This was in large part due to adverse currency movements, which hurt the money repatriated from its foreign arms, but also because of a series of missteps in major markets around the world. In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit and has indicated it will focus on its core North American markets and growth markets like China and India.  Walmart\u2019s international woes have been exacerbated by slow decision-making over the years and even initial talks with India\u2019s Flipkart began as far back as 2016.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Walmart initially entered the Indian market in 2007 through a joint venture with India\u2019s Bharti Enterprises, years before Amazon debuted there. That joint venture was called off in 2013 and its presence in India has remained largely static since then, at least in part due to restrictions around foreign investment in physical retail in India.  Meanwhile, Amazon jumped in with a less regulated online marketplace offering, retail consultants and investors said. Amazon now holds about 27 percent of India\u2019s burgeoning e-commerce market, according to Euromonitor, where Walmart remains a footnote and only operates 21 cash-and-carry wholesale stores in the country that sell to businesses.  Walmart\u2019s slow-footedness means if a deal is announced, Flipkart could be Walmart's largest acquisition to date, potentially at a steep premium to what SoftBank Group 9984.T paid for a stake in the company less than a year ago.  INTERNATIONAL BLUNDERS  Walmart\u2019s international moves over the years have involved a series of blunders.  For example, Walmart bet on an unprofitable, second-tier online retailer in China in 2011 and has since been behind Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N. In 2016, Walmart sold its online business in China to pick up a stake in China's no 2 retailer JD.com.  In Brazil, Walmart has struggled to gain traction after a decade, while in the United Kingdom it has been unable to stem market share declines to hard discounters like Aldi Inc and Lidl.  Now, Walmart is trying to offload a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International. And on Saturday, Sainsbury said it and Walmart\u2019s British unit Asda are in talks to create the country\u2019s biggest supermarket group.  Their combination, which some said shows Walmart\u2019s retrenching in the market, would surpass Tesco's TSCO.L grocery market share and be worth up to 15 billion pounds ($20.7 billion).  Whether Walmart\u2019s latest moves will turn Walmart International into the growth engine it once was remains to be seen, consultants said. For now at least, investors have largely supported the decisions to jumpstart global growth made by Chief Executive Doug McMillon as exemplified by the market reaction to the talks in India.  \u201cIn the short term, the Flipkart deal may look pricey, but the markets haven\u2019t punished Walmart because investors realize this is probably their best chance to have a fair fight with Amazon in India,\u201d Ken Murphy, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said. Walmart\u2019s shares fell 20 percent from an all-time high in January largely due to concerns around its online performance in the United States. They have, however, risen 27 percent in the past year, outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which rose 12 percent during the same period.","360":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of CVS Health is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017.

A deal is far from finalised, however, and talks between the two parties and investors in Flipkart are ongoing, said a third source.  The sources asked not to be named because the talks are private.  A stake in Flipkart would pit Walmart against Amazon.com in India and local media have reported here that Amazon is exploring a rival offer for India's largest home-grown e-commerce player.  Walmart is now seeking a bigger stake than previously expected. Reuters reported in February here that it was in talks to purchase a stake of over 40 percent in Flipkart, which is backed by the likes of SoftBank Group, Tiger Global, eBay, Accel Partners, Naspers, Tencent Holdings and Microsoft Corp.  Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment. SoftBank also declined to comment, while Tiger, its other lead investor, was not immediately reachable for comment.  Bengaluru-based Flipkart, started by two former Amazon employees, is fighting Amazon to grab a bigger piece of India\u2019s massive online retail market which, according to Morgan Stanley, could be worth $200 billion in a decade.  Walmart\u2019s investment would give Flipkart not just additional funds to fight Amazon, but also arm it with a formidable ally with extensive experience in retailing, logistics and supply chain management.  It is seen as a more likely investor than Amazon. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the probability of a Flipkart-Amazon deal was low, and that such a deal may spark competition fears as Flipkart and Amazon dominate India\u2019s e-commerce market.  GREATER HEFT  Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart could also aid Flipkart in developing its private label business, one of the sources said.  For Walmart a deal would open up a vast market and another front to take on its biggest rival.  Walmart is initially not expected to rock the boat and is likely to retain top management. It may, however, look to bring in some of its own people on the legal and finance teams at Flipkart, one of the sources said.  Walmart would also likely have a say in the appointment of a chief financial officer at Flipkart, if the deal is concluded, said another of the three sources.  Two of the three sources said Tiger Global Management, Accel Partners and Naspers, would likely sell their entire stakes in Flipkart to Walmart if a deal is reached.  Accel and Naspers declined to comment.  Japan\u2019s SoftBank, which has invested in Flipkart through its Vision Fund, may also consider selling a part of its roughly 20 percent stake if Walmart offers a good price, two sources said.

U.S. retail giant Walmart said this month that it would pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Flipkart, which CAIT\u2019s filing said would create unfair competition and result in predatory pricing.

(Reporting by Abhirup Roy Editing by David Goodman)","372":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc and logistics firm Deliv pulled the plug on a key same-day grocery delivery partnership, dealing a setback in the retailer\u2019s race against rival Amazon.com Inc to deliver groceries to customers\u2019 homes.  The world\u2019s largest retailer began bolstering its partnerships with third-party courier firms to reach consumers in 100 U.S. cities last year, after failing to use Uber and Lyft to deliver groceries, and struggling in its attempt to use its own employees to deliver goods.  Deliv, which was one of Walmart\u2019s earliest partners with pilot programs in Miami and San Jose, served the retailer with a 90-day termination notice, and the two companies stopped working with each other in late January, according to two people familiar with the situation.  Walmart confirmed the previously unreported decision, and said it still partners with seven delivery firms, including DoorDash and Postmates, four of which it signed up in January.  People familiar with the Walmart partnership with Deliv said the Deliv drivers had to frequently wait 40 minutes or more to collect grocery orders when they showed up at the store. One reason for that, they said, is because Walmart gives a priority to customers over delivery drivers during regular hours, which complicated the partnership.  The store operations at Walmart \u201cwere a huge problem,\u201d said one of the people with direct knowledge of the matter, adding the retailer could not \u201cprocess online grocery orders fast enough.\u201d  Deliv declined to comment. Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman told Reuters the retailer and Deliv mutually decided to end the partnership. \u201cAs with any pilot, the intent is to learn. And we ultimately came to the conclusion with Deliv that while their platform is a good delivery option, it was not the best fit for our program at this time.\u201d  Blakeman said same-day grocery delivery is currently available in 800 of its more than 5,000 U.S. stores and warehouse clubs, and the retailer plans to add 800 more this year.  Deliv offers scheduled same-day deliveries through gig drivers, a model which can work well with faster order processing and a better ability to predict demand and robust volumes. Walmart is now working mostly with restaurant delivery firms that deliver an order as and when it is generated, one of the sources said.  Both sources said order volumes were low in many markets, and one source said orders had to be delivered over large distances, resulting in both Deliv and Walmart losing money.  \u201cWhen the partnership with Deliv was struck, the hope was that demand will be stronger than it is now,\u201d one of the sources said.  Deliv operates in 1,400 U.S. cities, tapping into networks of local freelance drivers to deliver packages same-day for a fee for a range of retailers, from Home Depot Inc to Kohl\u2019s Corp.  In October, it raised $40 million in a new round of financing from investors, including Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and United Parcel Service. In December, it signed up 20 new U.S. retailers including Nike Inc and Nordstrom.  Deliv can process and deliver thousands of orders in an hour. Walmart in San Jose was sometimes generating only a hundred orders a week, and there were problems processing that volume through stores, one of the sources said. Walmart is working to fix the problems at its stores to process orders faster, the source added.  Blakeman said there were no problems with order volume in the market.  The sources also told Reuters that Walmart has ended a separate grocery delivery test from 2017, in which it partnered with smart security company August Home and Deliv for keyless entries to shoppers homes, to deliver groceries directly to their refrigerator.","373":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc WMT.N reported strong second-quarter results and raised its earnings expectations for the year, temporarily sidestepping concerns around consumer demand in the wake of tariffs on imports from China.  FILE PHOTO: Walmart signs are displayed inside a Walmart store in Mexico City, Mexico, March 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido\/File Photo  Walmart\u2019s performance was helped by shoppers who spent more at its stores and websites, indicating the U.S. consumer economy has not lost steam, sending its shares up 6.1% to close at $112.69.  The world\u2019s largest retailer posted a 20-quarter, or five-year, streak of U.S. growth, unmatched by any other retail chain.  On Wednesday, Macy's Inc M.N lowered its annual earnings outlook amid worries over tariff-related price hikes and the resultant impact on demand. On Thursday, JC Penney JCP.N posted a 9-percent drop in sales.  Analysts said the contrast in performance indicates there is no evidence to suggest a broad drop in demand in the economy and retailers posting lower growth need to improve their business strategies.  U.S. retail sales surged in July, which could help to assuage financial markets\u2019 fears that the economy was heading into recession.  Consumers are responding to the changes the company is making to its business and the company is gaining market share, Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a statement. Walmart gained share in grocery and general merchandise categories this quarter, the company said.  The retailer gets 56% of its revenue from food and grocery sales, which allows it to manage the pressure from tariffs better than many rivals, analysts said.  In an interview on Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said Walmart has raised prices on some items due to these tariffs, but it is not passing all the cost pressure it faces to consumers.  It is managing that by negotiating with suppliers and sourcing from alternate supply bases, he said.  \u201cWe still feel good about the consumer overall,\u201d Biggs said.  The company said it has expressed to the Trump administration that it wants negotiations with China to continue and communicated how this move impacts consumer and prices.  \u201cWe understand that free trade also has to be fair trade,\u201d Dan Bartlett, executive vice president of corporate affairs, told reporters on a conference call.  A Walmart shopping trip was 5.2% more expensive in June than a year earlier, according to Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, which compared prices on a basket of about 76 identical items over the past year.  U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% earlier this year, a move that has begun pushing up prices of thousands of products including clothing, furniture and electronics.  Earlier this week, Trump backed off his Sept. 1 deadline for imposing 10% tariffs on remaining Chinese imports, delaying duties on cellphones, laptops and other consumer goods, to shield U.S. holiday sales.  The move offered relief to the retail industry but will do little to mitigate the impact on consumers during the holiday season. Most retailers have purchased their holiday-season merchandise, and the inventory has for the most part already arrived at U.S. ports and warehouses.  NO CHANGE IN GUN SALES POLICY  Walmart has also come under growing pressure and criticism over its policy to continue selling firearms after two mass shootings, one at its store, killed 31 people in Texas and Ohio.  The retailer said its policy to sell guns has not changed.  It said it has about 2 percent of the market for firearms and is not among the top three sellers. It has a 20 percent share of the ammunition market.  \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged that broad support is emerging to strengthen background checks and to remove weapons from those who have been determined to pose an imminent danger,\u201d Chief Executive Doug McMillon said.  McMillon said \u201creauthorization of the assault weapons ban should be debated to determine its effectiveness in keeping weapons made for war out of the hands of mass murderers.\u201d  Walmart\u2019s Bartlett said it has also made clear that employees can express their concerns on gun sales and no employee\u2019s job was in jeopardy for doing so.  A junior Walmart employee in California began a petition protesting the sale of firearms that gathered over 50,000 signatures. His access to Walmart\u2019s emails and messaging systems was temporarily blocked.  Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.8%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended July 31. Analysts estimated growth of 2.07%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.27 per share, beating expectations of $1.22 per share.  The retailer raised its forecast for adjusted earnings-per-share to a \u201cslight decrease to slight increase,\u201d from a \u201cdecline by a low single-digit percentage range.\u201d That forecast includes the effect from the acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart.  Online sales surged 37%, in line with the previous quarter\u2019s increase and higher than the company\u2019s expectation of 35%.  Walmart\u2019s online expansion has come at a cost to profitability and losses at the U.S. e-commerce business could rise to about $1.7 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 2018, according to estimates from Morgan Stanley.  Walmart is looking to sell ModCloth, the women\u2019s apparel site it acquired two years ago, as it looks for ways to pare losses at its online business.  Total revenue rose 1.8% to $130.4 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates for $130.1 billion.","374":"A U.S. appeals court on Thursday rejected a Walmart Stores Inc unit\u2019s claim that it was exempt from having to provide hepatitis B vaccinations to warehouse workers in Florida who volunteered for an injury-response team.

Killen said the highway locations will primarily provide chargers for trips between U.S. cities but also cross-country journeys along Interstate 10 between Santa Monica, California and Jacksonville, Florida, plus Interstate 80 that runs from San Francisco and Teaneck, New Jersey.  Major automakers including General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N have announced plans to invest tens of billions of dollars on families of electric vehicles over the next few years, in a direct challenge to money-losing Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  But a lack of infrastructure for U.S. consumers to recharge their vehicles is seen is as a major barrier to the mass adoption of electric vehicles as consumers remain concerned over their limited range.  \u201cThese charging stations will go a long way toward convincing folks that there are a lot of chargers out there,\u201d Electrify America\u2019s Killen said.

In common with its traditional big four British rivals - market leader Tesco TSCO.L, Sainsbury's and Morrisons MRW.L - Asda has been losing market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are still opening lots of new stores.  That has put pressure on Asda, which said last week that budget-conscious British consumers were behind a fall in underlying sales in the key Christmas quarter.  \u201cWe are currently considering whether there is an opportunity for a third party to invest in Asda, alongside Walmart, in order to support and accelerate the delivery of Asda\u2019s strategy and position Asda for long term success,\u201d Walmart and Asda said in a joint statement.  The potential buyers share Walmart and Asda\u2019s commitment to growing the British business, they added.

Analysts said private equity firms are most likely to be interested in taking a stake in Asda, which Walmart bought for 6.7 billion pounds ($8.7 billion) in 1999.  Walmart said it was considering a separate stock market listing for Asda in April after Britain\u2019s competition regulator blocked Sainsbury\u2019s attempt to buy the firm for 7.3 billion pounds and become the country\u2019s biggest retailer,  Asda Chief Executive Roger Burnley told Reuters in July an initial public offering could happen in two years.

Several retailers, from Target, Apple to high-end apparel brands, have been looted and damaged as protesters turned violent in places including New York and Chicago, forcing them to reduce store hours or close shop.  This comes as U.S. retailers were already reeling under falling sales due to the pandemic-led stores closures.","391":"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N is in talks to buy a stake of more than 40 percent in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, a direct challenge to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in Asia's third-largest economy, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.  In what would be one of its biggest overseas deals, the U.S. retailer is looking at buying new and existing shares in Flipkart and due diligence is likely to begin as early as next week, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks were private.  Terms under discussion were not immediately available, but Flipkart would be valued at more than the $12 billion figure given when Japan's SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund took roughly a fifth of the firm last year for $2.5 billion, they added.  A spokesman for Flipkart said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. An India-based representative for Walmart declined to comment.  A deal with Walmart would give Flipkart much-needed muscle in its fight against Amazon, which has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands aggressively, including into online grocery deliveries, which analysts tip as the next big battleground for the country\u2019s e-commerce sector.  Besides its own e-commerce site, Flipkart owns fashion portals Myntra and Jabong, and controls nearly 40 percent of India\u2019s online retail, ahead of Amazon, according to estimates by research firm Forrester. It is also looking into expanding into grocery deliveries.  \u201cWalmart\u2019s expertise in selling groceries and low-cost apparel could help Flipkart remain ahead in India\u2019s e-commerce market,\u201d said Satish Meena, senior analyst at Forrester.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  For Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, a deal would open a new front in its efforts to take on Amazon, giving the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that Morgan Stanley has estimated will rapidly grow to be worth $200 billion in a decade.  It would be part of a huge e-commerce push that has seen Walmart acquire a slew of start-ups including paying roughly $3 billion for online retailer Jet.com. Last month it also said it was partnering with Japan's Rakuten Inc 4755.T in online grocery deliveries.  \u201cAs large as they are, Amazon has eaten away a significant chunk of their revenues and I think... they view India as the largest market possibly for this (taking on Amazon),\u201d one of the sources said.  Walmart has for years tried to enter India but has remained confined to a \u2018cash-and-carry\u2019 wholesale business amid tough restrictions on foreign investment. It currently operates 21 such stores in India.  Walmart's push into e-commerce comes as Amazon has embraced offline retail, with an affiliate of the Seattle-based company picking up a $27.6 million stake in Indian retailer Shopper's Stop Ltd SHOP.NS.  In the United States, Amazon also bought high-end grocer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year.  Former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru.  Like Amazon\u2019s founder Jeff Bezos, they began by selling books, but have diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones such as China\u2019s Xiaomi and Motorola through exclusive flash sales, and now compete with Amazon on almost all product categories.  Flipkart's success has attracted a bevy of deep pocketed and tech-savvy investors including U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management, China's Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK, online marketplace eBay Inc EBAY.O and software giant Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.","392":"* New focus on dry grocery products, general merchandise  * Move aims to avoid selling goods online at a loss  * Walmart still committed to \u201cEvery Day Low Prices\u201d (Updates with details in paragraphs 8-11)  Feb 8 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc is asking vendors to supply it with more merchandise priced at $10 and up, as part of a major push to finally turn a profit at its online business, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.  The new focus at the world\u2019s largest retailer is on dry grocery products such as sauces, soaps and general merchandise items such as toys and home furnishings, the sources said.  Walmart\u2019s goal is to see higher profit margins selling these more expensive items given the built-in cost of delivering goods purchased online, according to the people familiar with Walmart\u2019s new strategy.  Shipping Gillette Mach 3 Disposable Razors at $6.97, for example, costs the same as Gillette Fusion5 ProGlide Men\u2019s Razor Refills at $12.97.  In meetings last week with suppliers including Procter & Gamble Co, Unilever PLC, Kimberly-Clark Corp and Clorox Co, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce chief Marc Lore said Walmart.com wants to focus on merchandise priced at least $5 and preferably, more than $10, the people said.  \u201cWalmart has started to understand it cannot make money if they offer the lowest prices online on every item and then spend $4 or $5 trying to ship it over,\u201d said one supplier present at the meetings. \u201cIt is not sustainable and more importantly their shareholders won\u2019t allow it.\u201d  Walmart\u2019s directive to suppliers marks a shift in strategy. The retailer for years has squeezed suppliers for pennies to drive the lowest prices for shoppers, both online and at its brick-and-mortar stores. Walmart will continue to press for bargain-priced items to sell at its 4,700 stores. But in addition, it will now implore suppliers to provide it with more expensive goods for sale online.  Walmart does not disclose profit margins for individual products. But it tends to sell lower-priced merchandise at retail prices that are extremely close to its wholesale cost, and seeks to profit by selling large quantities of that merchandise across its brick-and-mortar stores.  Because Walmart.com offers free two-day shipping to draw in buyers, turning a profit on items that retail for $5 or $10 is difficult.  Consider a $3.50 tube of toothpaste. A supplier may incur $2.50 in costs to manufacture, transport and store it, selling the toothpaste to Walmart at $3 wholesale. The margin to Walmart on such an item is 50 cents if a shopper buys it at the store. But add $2 of shipping costs to get that toothpaste from Walmart\u2019s distribution center to the home of a Walmart.com shopper, and the transaction is a loss to Walmart.  The same tube of toothpaste in a different package, bigger in size, may sell for $6.50. It may cost the supplier $3, and Walmart may buy it wholesale at $3.75. When Walmart.com incurs the same $2 shipping cost to send it out to a shopper\u2019s home, the retailer makes a profit of 75 cents.  This new emphasis on more higher-priced goods at Walmart.com comes after the retailer acquired Jet.com in 2016 and is investing billions of dollars to make its online business more competitive.  Walmart declined to comment on the meetings, but affirmed its commitment to \u201cEvery Day Low Prices\u201d and offering the best prices online.  \u201cWe are constantly looking for opportunities to expand our assortment with new items, and want to ensure that the items we add to the assortment are a great value but also make economic sense for the channel,\u201d a Walmart spokeswoman said.  Two people present at the Walmart meetings in Bentonville, Ark. - who were not authorized to speak on the record - said Walmart wants to avoid selling products online at a loss like rival Amazon.com Inc, where there is much less of a focus on retail profit. Seattle-based Amazon profits on many but not all transactions, depending on price-matching, an order\u2019s size, shipping speed and other factors.  While Amazon has pressured suppliers for discounts usually given to bigger retailers, a person familiar with the matter said, it has been happy to sell popular items at cost or even at a loss if it means winning customers\u2019 loyalty over the long term.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2BGby73.  Amazon has a diverse array of profitable businesses to offset its retail losses, including commissions for third-party sales on its site, advertising sales and a business handling large enterprises\u2019 computing needs in the cloud.  Amazon accounted for 43.5 percent of U.S. e-commerce sales in the 12 months to October 2017, compared to Walmart\u2019s 3.6 percent, according to digital research firm eMarketer. Walmart.com has tripled the items it sells to 70 million in the past year. It is looking to grow that fast, as it plays catch up with Amazon\u2019s more than 300 million products for sale.  Walmart.com already had begun to raise prices on some items sold online last year. By now enlisting suppliers to provide it with higher priced goods, it is taking that strategy a step further.  The move to offer more $10-and-up merchandise for sale online carries significant risk if bargain hunters reject the push and seek lower-priced goods elsewhere. A majority of Walmart\u2019s low-income customers still tend to shop at its brick-and-mortar stores.  But the retailer, with $485 billion in annual sales, is trying to attract a slightly more affluent audience to Walmart.com.  For some suppliers, Walmart\u2019s directive will entail going back to the drawing board and coming up with new items to sell on Walmart.com. That, in turn, will require planning and investment in new product design, packaging, marketing and sales. One Walmart vendor said that more than 95 percent of its merchandise currently for sale on Walmart.com is priced between $3 and $8.  Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Unilever declined to comment. Clorox did not respond to requests for comment.  \u201cThey are no longer saying \u2018give us the lowest priced product for dot com,\u2019\u201d said one person present at the meetings, referring to Walmart.com. \u201cThey want items that retail for more than $10; those are the products that make money for them online.\u201d","393":"Nov 6 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc said on Friday it would sell its retail operations in Argentina to supermarket chain owners Grupo de Narv\u00e1ez.

(Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.)","394":"Aug 5 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc said on Monday there has been no change in its policy on gun sales after two mass shootings over the weekend, including one at a Walmart store, left 31 people dead in Texas and Ohio.  Years of public pressure led Walmart, the largest U.S arms retailer, to end assault rifle sales in 2015, and in 2018 to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21. Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether.  The weekend shooting in Texas unfolded at a popular Walmart store in the border city of El Paso, killing 22 people. In the other weekend mass shooting, in Dayton, Ohio, a gunman killed nine people.  While it was not clear where the shooters in both incidents purchased their guns, many people took to social media to post about the deadly shooting using the hashtags #walmartshooting,\u201d \u201c#boycottwalmart,\u201d and \u201c#guncontrolnow.\u201d  Guns Down America, an advocacy group that runs campaigns for gun control, began a petition to urge more change at Walmart late on Monday.  The petition calls on Walmart to stop selling firearms, pledge it will no longer make contributions to lawmakers who take money from gun rights lobby the National Rifle Association, and fund gun buybacks. It also pushes Walmart to use its political influence to advocate for legislative changes to raise the standards of gun ownership in America.  \u201cFederal legislative change will take time, but more and more Americans are dying every day,\u201d Igor Volsky, the founder and executive director of Guns Down America, told Reuters. \u201cThe El Paso shooting happened in their store, they have a responsibility to go further.\u201d  It is not the time that gun-control advocates have signed a petition calling on Walmart to take action. In early 2013, just one month after a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, shot dead 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, nearly 300,000 people signed a petition urging Walmart to stop selling assault weapons.  It was another two years before Walmart ended such sales.  \u201cA REASON TO BOYCOTT WALMART\u201d  Other gun control activists such as Texas Gun Sense President Ed Scruggs said Walmart, whose stores act as de facto community centers in rural America, could do more to educate children and teenagers on gun safety.  A group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America said it has been asking Walmart to stop letting shoppers walk into its stores with guns and to follow a similar policy adopted by other retailers like Target Corp and Starbucks .  On Twitter, one Florida-based user said Walmart needs more security. Another user, from Irvine, California, said Walmart\u2019s statement outlining that it would not change its gun policies in the wake of the two shootings over the weekend was \u201cshocking.\u201d  \u201cIf this isn\u2019t a reason to boycott Walmart, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d the user tweeted Monday afternoon.  Some celebrities also demanded more action from the retailer.  \u201cHey @Walmart! This would be a great opportunity for you to take a true leadership position and stop selling guns,\u201d actress Alyssa Milano said in response to a Walmart company tweet, which said it was \u201cin shock\u201d over the tragic events in Texas.  For now, Walmart\u2019s policies remain unchanged.  A Walmart spokesman on Monday told Reuters the retailer has not made any change in firearms sales policy after the mass shootings and that it has not issued a directive to any stores around the country to change such policy.  \u201cOur focus has always been on being a responsible seller of firearms,\u201d spokesman Randy Hargrove said. \u201cWe go beyond federal law, requiring all customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm.\u201d  The retailer\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, offered his support to the community of El Paso and reached out to employees via Instagram on Sunday. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m sending a note like this twice in one week,\u201d he said, referring to an earlier message he sent after two employees were shot by a co-worker in a store in Mississippi.  Walmart\u2019s gun safety policies are better than many retailers even as it trails some of its rivals.  Walmart rivals like Kroger-owned Fred Meyer stopped selling guns and ammunition in 2018 and the same year, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods ended the sale of assault weapons and raised the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases.  In March 2019, Dick\u2019s also said it would pull guns and ammunition off the shelves of 125 of its 720 store, a decision the company said it took because its gun sales were down due to competition from dedicated gun and hunting stores.  That same month, in a call to discuss earnings, the company\u2019s chief executive, Ed Stack, said lower sales during the quarter were partly driven by lower demand for \u201canything associated with hunting\u201d, including guns, ammunition, firearm accessories and hunting apparel.  Despite such measures from the larger chains, the sale of guns and assault-style weapons continues unabated.  Outdoor goods chains including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Outdoors and Academy Sports continue to sell assault-style rifles. A proliferation of online retailers like AIM Surplus, Armslist and Brownells also sell firearms that can be easily procured.","395":"The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2019.

The Bengaluru-based ecommerce company said it will start with deploying 160 vans by 2019-end. Some of these EVs are already plying in the country\u2019s capital of New Delhi.  Flipkart has amped up its focus on sustainability since its $16 billion acquisition by Walmart last year. The company has also expanded its operations at a fast pace as it competes with rival Amazon Inc in India\u2019s online sales market.  Flipkart\u2019s move towards electric vehicles, the first among big online firms in the country, comes as the Indian government is pushing for faster adoption of these to fight pollution.  \u201cThese efforts will help us meaningfully contribute towards electric mobility... while bringing cost efficiencies for the business. In this process, we also hope to create an ecosystem for adoption of electric mobility in India,\u201d Amitesh Jha, senior vice-president of Ekart and Marketplace at Flipkart, said in a statement.  Ecommerce companies in India are also in talks with the government around various policies related to their operations in the country. Earlier this week, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal met with ecommerce companies, including Flipkart, to talk about compliance with new foreign investment rules, Reuters reported citing sources.  In a statement dated June 27, Flipkart said it is working with local partners to co-design concepts for EVs best suited for the growing e-commerce industry.  \u201cWe believe these small but meaningful steps in this direction will go a long way in paving the way for larger adoption of EVs in the country,\u201d group Chief Executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy, said.

(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak)","397":"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)  SAN BRUNO\/SUNNYVALE, Calif., Feb 14 (Reuters) - One of Walmart Inc\u2019s best chances at taking on Amazon.com Inc in e-commerce lies with six giant server farms, each larger than ten football fields.  These facilities, which cost Walmart millions of dollars and took nearly five years to build, are starting to pay off. The retailer\u2019s online sales have been on a tear for the last three consecutive quarters, far outpacing wider industry growth levels.  Powering that rise are thousands of proprietary servers that enable the company to crunch almost limitless swathes of customer data in-house.  Most retailers rent the computing capacity they need to store and manage such information. But Walmart\u2019s decision to build its own internal cloud network shows its determination to grab a bigger slice of online shopping, in part by imitating Amazon\u2019s use of cloud-powered big data to drive digital sales.  The effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory. And it is allowing the company to target shoppers with more customized offers and improved services, two top executives told Reuters in interviews at Walmart\u2019s San Bruno and Sunnyvale campuses in California.  \u201cIt has made a big difference to how fast we can grow our e-commerce business,\u201d said Tim Kimmet, head of cloud operations for Walmart.  He said Walmart, for example, is using cloud data to stock items frequently ordered by customers via voice shopping devices such as Google Home.  The network is helping the retailer improve its in-store operations as well. Using data gleaned from millions of transactions, the company sped up the process by which customers can return online purchases to their local stores by 60 percent. And Walmart can adjust prices at its physical locations almost instantly across entire regions.  \u201cWe are now able to execute change faster,\u201d Jeremy King, Walmart\u2019s chief technology officer, told Reuters. He added that Walmart can now make over 170,000 monthly changes to software that supports its website, compared to less than 100 changes previously.  To be sure, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, holds just a 3.6 percent share of the U.S. e-commerce market compared to Amazon\u2019s 43.5 percent, according to digital research firm eMarketer.  Still, Walmart\u2019s cloud effort is significant at a time when U.S. retail is undergoing immense disruption, and data-based decision making has become more important than ever to understand how shoppers make purchases.  Walmart\u2019s online revenue climbed 50 percent year-over-year during the third quarter, helping it post its strongest-ever quarterly growth since 2009.  \u201cThe battle between Walmart and Amazon has been playing out on all fronts and the cloud is the latest frontier,\u201d said Kerry Liu, chief executive of Rubikloud Technologies, which offers artificial intelligence technology services to retailers.  EXCESS CAPACITY  The cloud initiative is but one of several steps Wal-Mart is taking to boost its e-commerce business. The company has expanded its online selection and acquired smaller e-commerce retailers. Walmart is offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, and it recently asked vendors to supply it with merchandise priced at $10 and up to help it turn a profit online.  Walmart has stored information in smaller internal data centers for years. And it uses public cloud storage for non-critical data. Most retailers rent server capacity offered by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google , Microsoft Corp and IBM.  (For a graphic on big players in the cloud market, see tmsnrt.rs\/2EYe9Ii)  But Walmart\u2019s decision to build a network that is not reliant on a single third-party cloud technology provider has transformed its ability to understand shoppers, who now move between store, desktop, mobile and app to make purchases. About 80 percent of Walmart\u2019s cloud network is now in-house.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said security was another big factor behind the effort, enabling the retailer to better protect customer data. That secrecy extends to the locations of its six \u201cmega clouds\u201d or giant server farms, and 75 \u201cmicro clouds\u201d whose locations the company declined to disclose publicly.  Walmart shareholders so far appear supportive of its cloud strategy. The company\u2019s shares have risen 49 percent in the last 12 months, defying the broader retail sector downturn and outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which has risen 14 percent over the same period.  Still, some investors have expressed concerns that Walmart\u2019s approach will make it harder for the retailer to downsize if market conditions change significantly. A few of them told Reuters they would like to see Walmart commercialize its excess capacity, much as its rival Amazon has done.  Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $18.34 billion in revenue in 2017 and has garnered 26 percent of the cloud market, according to estimates from Jefferies Group LLC.  \u201cWalmart is very good at following Amazon\u2019s innovations. Now they must find a way to monetize the cloud business they are building the way AWS did,\u201d said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said the retailer has no immediate plans to provide cloud services for other companies. But he did not rule it out as a future revenue driver.","398":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China faced mounting isolation in the face of increasing international travel curbs and flight suspensions on Saturday, as the death toll from a spreading coronavirus outbreak rose to 259.  The epidemic has led to mass evacuations of foreign citizens as world airlines halt flights, and risks exacerbating a slowdown in growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  China\u2019s National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China as of Friday, bringing the total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported more than 130 cases.  All of the reported deaths from the virus have been in China.  The Russian military was to start evacuating Russian citizens from China on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying the evacuations would be from regions that had been most affected by the outbreak.  Russia, which has already restricted direct flights with its biggest trading partner, also said it was suspending visa-free travel for Chinese visitors and halting work visas.  Most international cases have been in people who had recently traveled to or were visiting from Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak.  Hubei has been under a virtual quarantine for the last week, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. Elsewhere, Chinese authorities placed growing restrictions on travel and business.  In Beijing, counters were set up at the entrances of housing estates, where volunteers wearing red arm bands and masks noted details of residents coming back from their hometowns after the Lunar New Year holiday.  \u201cAs long as I am properly protected and don\u2019t go to crowded places, I don\u2019t feel scared at all about my hometown or Beijing,\u201d said a 58-year-old migrant worker surnamed Sun.  Others were more worried.  \u201cThere will be a huge number of people returning to the city. I think it will put Beijing at risk of more infections,\u201d said Zhang Chunlei, 45, another returning migrant worker.  In Hubei, the provincial government extended the holiday break to Feb. 13 in a bid to contain the outbreak, the Hubei Daily reported.  The World Health Organization, which this week declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, has said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed.  But Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering their territories. Australia followed suit on Saturday.  \u201cWe\u2019re in fact operating with an abundance of caution in these circumstances so Australians can go about their daily lives with confidence,\u201d Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Sydney.  The Chinese data would suggest the flu-like virus is less deadly than the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people of the some 8,000 it infected, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.  Slideshow ( 15 images )  EVACUATIONS  The list of international airlines suspending all or some flights to China is growing.  The latest were Qantas Airways Ltd and Air New Zealand, who said travel bans forced them to suspend their direct flights to China from Feb. 9. All three major U.S. airlines said on Friday they would cancel flights to mainland China.  The commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific banned travel to China for all service members and civilian personnel under his authority and ordered those now in China to leave immediately, officials said.  Slideshow ( 15 images )  U.S. health officials on Saturday confirmed an eighth case of the virus, a person in Massachusetts who recently returned from Hubei province.  Many nations have sent charter flights to repatriate citizens from China and then place them in isolation for around two weeks, believed to be the incubation period of the virus.  German Health Minister Jens Spahn called for calm and warned against hysteria as more than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt, none showing any symptoms of the virus.

DISRUPTIONS  Infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan, where the new virus is believed to have originated, raising concerns that new hot spots are emerging despite strict transport restrictions.  In Huanggang, authorities asked households to designate one individual who can leave the home, a local newspaper said. The mayor of the city of about 7.5 million people said there could be a significant rise in cases this weekend.  The northern city of Tianjin, home to some 15 million, suspended all schools and businesses until further notice.  Efforts to contain the virus risk slowing economic growth in China. The virus impact prompted Goldman Sachs to cut its estimate for first-quarter growth to 4% from 5.6%.  China\u2019s central bank said the impact was temporary and economic fundamentals remained sound, but that it would increase credit support, lowering lending costs for affected companies.  Apple Inc said on Saturday it would close all of its official stores and corporate offices in China until Feb. 9, the latest of dozens of major companies, including IKEA and Walmart Inc, to restrict travel and operations due to the outbreak.

Demand for fully cooked plant-based alternatives jumped 25% in the four weeks to Aug. 22, data from Nielsen showed, as consumers grow increasingly health conscious and concerned about the environmental impact of industrial animal farming.  The company said the wider distribution of its Beyond Burger patties - made from peas, mung bean and rice to mimic the taste of a beef burger - from 800 Walmart stores to over 2,400 comes after the successful launch of its value offerings this summer, at a time traditional ground beef prices were spiking due to COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions at beef plants.  It also comes at a time the company, which derives about half of its global sales from restaurants such as Dunkin DNKN.O and KFC, is trying to reroute its products to retailers to keep sales humming as restaurants continue to remain closed due to coronavirus-led restrictions.  Tuesday\u2019s deal with Walmart, which in 2015 was the first retailer to launch its frozen offerings, comes on the heels of Beyond Meat\u2019s announcement about expanding availability of its breakfast sausage patties at 5,000 more stores in the United States by the end of September.

FILE PHOTO: An employee picks out products to fulfil online orders at a Seiyu store in Tokyo, Japan February 11, 2020. REUTERS\/Ando Ritsuko  The barely year-old tie-up between the U.S. supermarket chain's Seiyu and local e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc 4755.T clocked 30% sales growth for late October through December versus the same period a year earlier when Seiyu was going it alone, said Rakuten Seiyu NetSuper Chief Executive Tamae Takeda.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing even better since the start of the new year,\u201d Takeda told Reuters. Concerns over the ongoing coronavirus epidemic may be encouraging people to try the service, she said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t really wanting to go out.\u201d  The change in fortune is a boost for Walmart as it steps up its rivalry with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in its home market where retailers are racing to deliver online orders faster.  It also demonstrates that greater confidence in online services and improved logistics can win over Japanese shoppers often considered too picky about freshness to buy produce through the internet, analysts said.  Helping drive overall growth, Takeda said, was demand for time-saving solutions, particularly as an increasing proportion of mothers work. Government data showed over 70% of Japanese women with children under 18 work, versus 50% just 20 years ago.  Helping the venture in particular is Seiyu\u2019s access to Rakuten\u2019s 99 million members, expanding its reach beyond its 333 stores. Rakuten, in turn, has benefited from Seiyu\u2019s ties with local suppliers, helping it fight back against Amazon.com.  Together, they are able to better ease the pressure of a shrinking labour market which has driven up delivery costs and prompted Seiyu's rivals such as Uny, owned by Pan Pacific International Holdings Corp 7532.T, to abandon e-commerce.  PROFIT IN SIGHT  Seiyu entered e-commerce in 2000, an early start which analysts said helped propel it to third place in the online grocery sector. It trails only bigger supermarkets Aeon Co Ltd 8267.T and Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd's 3382.T Ito-Yokado, and is ahead of Amazon, showed a Statista consumer poll.  Takeda declined to disclose user numbers or sales, but also placed the venture third. The former McKinsey & Co consultant said profitability was \u201cin sight\u201d although the venture would prioritise growth for another two to three years.  That contrasts with Walmart\u2019s overall story in the country.  The U.S. firm entered Japan in 2002 buying 6% of Seiyu, building up its stake before a full takeover in 2008. It slashed costs and closed unprofitable stores but has mostly recorded losses.  Many expected it to go the way of foreign peers including Britain's Tesco PLC TSCO.L and France's Carrefour SA CARR.PA which bowed out of Japan. Last year, Walmart moved to end on-and-off speculation of an imminent exit, saying it hoped to eventually list Seiyu while retaining a majority stake.  Meanwhile, growth online has prompted Seiyu\u2019s venture to plan a second logistics centre for this year to bolster scale and efficiency - considered crucial to offset delivery costs. Takeda said the company was discussing setting up more.  That is in expectation of online shopping accounting for 10% of households\u2019 60 trillion yen ($539 billion) grocery spending from around 2.5%, she said, without giving a time frame.  \u201cIt is true that Japanese people appreciate fresh food.

REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido  Walmex, as the unit of Walmart Inc WMT.N is known locally, said revenue rose 4.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019, it slowest since the 4.6% clocked in the year's first quarter.

Supermarket vouchers given out by the leftist government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador were previously designed to be spent at chains such as Bodega. But ahead of the fourth quarter, the government allowed the vouchers to be converted into cash, opening up possibilities for them to be spent at corner stores, street vendors and outdoor marketplaces.  \u201cAmong our formats, Bodega suffered the greatest impact from the change in disbursement of government support programs, especially in the center and metro regions,\u201d said Guilherme Loureiro, Walmex\u2019s chief executive, on a webcast following the release of the quarterly earnings.  He said the company was working to lower prices in response, without specifying how deeply sales were hit at Bodega.

The company also said online sales in the quarter grew 47%, with e-commerce representing 2% of total Mexico sales.  However, quarterly net profit dropped 4.5% to 11.2 billion pesos ($602.31 million), after an intellectual property royalty payment to parent company Walmart in November of 1.1 billion pesos.

(Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Wednesday told Walmart Inc shareholders and top executives that the world\u2019s largest retailer should boost the \u201cstarvation\u201d-level wages it pays its workers and stop fueling income inequality.  \u201cDespite the incredible wealth of Walmart\u2019s owners\u201d the company pays \u201cstarvation wages,\u201d Sanders said at Walmart\u2019s shareholder meeting.  He presented a shareholder proposal asking the company to give hourly employees a seat on its board and raise base wages to $15 an hour.  Walmart\u2019s \u201cwages are so low, many of these employees are forced to rely on government programs like food stamps, Medicaid and public housing in order to survive,\u201d Sanders said.  \u201cThe American people are so tired of subsidizing the greed of some of the largest corporations in the United States,\u201d he added.  Sanders\u2019 remarks at the meeting drew attention to his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination and the drive for higher hourly U.S. wages, one of his signature issues.  The proposal, filed by Walmart worker Carolyn Davis, was buried at the end of the annual proxy filing. It did not pass since a majority of shares are owned by the family of the founder, the late Sam Walton, and the retailer had asked shareholders to vote against it.

The ratio compared with that of the median employee was 1,076 to 1.  With his frequent attacks on Walmart, and other major employers, Sanders has been trying to distinguish himself from former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic nomination, who also is making a pitch to working-class Americans.  His presence on Wednesday could give Sanders a boost when the two dozen Democratic contenders begin to compete for endorsements from the nation\u2019s biggest labor unions.  Protesters gathered outside the meeting, many from the labor group \u201cUnited for Respect\u201d which has pushed for a worker presence on Walmart\u2019s board. They held signs supporting the Sanders 2020 Presidential campaign and calling for a $15 per hour U.S. minimum wage.  Walmart has raised its minimum wage twice since 2016 to $11 an hour, still lower than the $15 an hour that rival Amazon.com Inc pays employees. Retailers Target Corp and Costco Wholesale Corp also pay higher rates than Walmart.  Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said Walmart has raised wages in the United States by 50 percent in the past four years and continues to increase wages on a market-by-market basis to hire and retain talent. He also urged Congress to raise the federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 an hour.  \u201cWe are not perfect, but together we are learning, we are listening and changing,\u201d he said.  Walmart has said it pays an average of $17.50 an hour to its hourly employees, including benefits.  Walmart, which employs nearly 1.5 million Americans and is the largest U.S. private-sector employer, drew sharp criticism from labor groups and unions when it changed the format of its annual meeting last year, splitting it into two separate events.  The business meeting at which Sanders spoke is now held a few days before the big shareholder event, which draws thousands of employees.

FILE PICTURE - The logo of the web service Amazon is pictured in this June 8, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso\/Illustration\/File Photo  The news underscores how Amazon is focused on winning India\u2019s fledgling e-commerce market, and the offer could be a ploy to block Walmart from bringing its expertise in logistics and supply chain management to Flipkart, people familiar with the matter said.  Reuters reported last month that Walmart was close to buying a majority stake in Flipkart, Amazon\u2019s biggest rival in India, for $10 billion to $12 billion.  The talks with Walmart for what could be its largest acquisition to date are still ongoing, and a deal is expected to be clinched soon, two people told Reuters on Wednesday. However, Amazon was indeed interested in buying Flipkart, said two sources, asking not to be named. They declined to give further details.  A spokesman for Walmart declined to comment. Amazon said it does not offer comments on rumors and speculation, and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amazon\u2019s offer could kickstart a new battle between it and Walmart, already fierce retail rivals in the United States. The bid emphasizes the importance of gaining a greater foothold in online sales in India, a market expected to be worth $200 billion a year within a decade.  Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, touted in a letter to shareholders last month that Amazon was India\u2019s fastest growing online marketplace.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer has been pouring billions of dollars into India to ship goods to shoppers faster, contributing to growing losses internationally. A Walmart-Flipkart deal could lead to more intense price competition, retail consultants said.  On Wednesday, Indian broadcaster CNBC-TV18 reported bit.ly\/2jo03py that Amazon had offered Flipkart a breakup fee of $2 billion to convince it to discuss an offer, which analysts say would bring with it substantial antitrust challenges. Flipkart and Amazon dominate the online shopping space in Asia's third-largest economy.  Flipkart had vetoed an approach from Amazon for a 51 to 55 percent stake in the company two years ago, a source told Reuters, judging its offered price as far too low at the time.  \u201cNow with Walmart in the mix things are different,\u201d the source said. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge no decision has been made yet. There is no deadline per se.\u201d  CNBC-TV18, citing unnamed sources, said Amazon\u2019s new bid was likely to be on a par with Walmart\u2019s, but that Flipkart\u2019s investors and founders continue to favor the deal with Walmart, with founder Sachin Bansal overseeing final negotiations.  WORLDWIDE MOVES  Walmart and Amazon\u2019s interest in gaining share in India comes after both retailers have struggled to grow in China, ultimately losing ground to Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  A successful move by Amazon to grab Flipkart would likely send Walmart back to the drawing board when it comes to India, retail consultants and analysts said.  \u201cThe stakes are really high for Walmart,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, senior research analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cIt will be very hard for them to win India back if they miss this opportunity.\u201d  Investors expect faster returns from Walmart\u2019s investments compared to Amazon, said Yarbrough, a move that limits the brick-and-mortar retailer\u2019s ability to spend big on acquisitions in growth markets.  Sales from Walmart International, which runs about 6,300 stores globally, stood at $118 billion in the fiscal year ended 2018, down nearly 14 percent from 2014.  In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit and has indicated it will focus on its core North American markets and growth markets like China and India.  Its urgency to stem market share losses has seen it launch talks to merge its British arm Asda with Sainsbury\u2019s.  In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, McKenna downplayed analyst criticism that the company has been slow to move in India.  \u201cWe have been deliberate and thoughtful, we were not slow to respond,\u201d she said.

The world\u2019s largest retailer applied for six patents last year on drones that aim to prevent damage to crops, control pest attacks on farms and cross-pollinate plants, according to U.S. Patents and Trademark Office documents that were made public last week and seen by Reuters.  Groceries make up 56 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue and Walmart may see drone technology as one way to get food from farms to store shelves faster and more cheaply to compete with Amazon.com Inc, following its purchase of Whole Foods Market last year and the expansion of discount chains like Aldi and Lidl. In one application, Walmart seeks to patent a system that would use drones to identify crop-damaging pests and then dispense insecticides on the critters. Another suggests the use of drones carrying pollen dispensers to successfully pollinate crops.  Using technology to precisely apply pesticides rather than spraying entire fields can benefit the environment and save money for farmers. As part of a sustainability push in recent years, Walmart has also worked with suppliers to reduce the amount of fertilizer used to grow crops because it can pollute the environment.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company always looks for new ways to serve shoppers better but had no comment on the filings. The retailer applies for dozens of patents a year and many do not result in commercial products.  Walmart previously applied for a patent involving drones that could monitor crops\u2019 growing conditions and send data to stores about when and from where produce might arrive, said Zoe Leavitt, a senior analyst from data intelligence firm CB Insights, which analyzes corporate patent filings. The series of six applications indicates Walmart is looking into farming more seriously, she said.  Walmart has so far applied for 46 patents for using drone technology, mostly to facilitate its delivery and logistics operations, or for use within warehouses to do things such as track inventory, according to data from CB Insights.  In U.S. agriculture, drones are most often used to survey farms that can span hundreds of acres. The devices fly above fields and take photos that help growers estimate the size of upcoming harvests or identify problems, such as weed infestations and nutrient deficiencies.  Other industries have also turned to drones, with AT&T Inc using the devices to look at cellphone towers in Texas last year after Hurricane Harvey. Insurers such as Allstate Corp use them to assess property damage.  \u201cThe technology is very powerful and using that to control the supply chain as far out as possible will offer Walmart a distinct advantage over rivals,\u201d said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click.  The market for agricultural drones will top $1 billion by 2024, up from about $338 million in 2016, according to research firm Global Market Insights.  However, Walmart\u2019s patent applications stand out because they indicate the company sees greater potential to address problems on farms, rather than simply spot them, said David Dvorak, chief executive officer for Field of View, a U.S. company that sells drone camera systems.  \u201cIt sounds like Walmart is trying to develop a complete system that can actually do something about it,\u201d Dvorak said.  The patent push involving agricultural technology harks back to McDonald Corp\u2019s efforts in the 1960s to patent the processing of potatoes into French fries so it could reliably deliver consistent quality fries at the lowest cost in massive volumes.  \u201cCompanies like Walmart for a long time have created sustainability initiatives and this is really where the rubber is meeting the road,\u201d said Jayson Lusk, head of agricultural economics at Purdue University.  Such environmental-focused initiatives can be attractive to consumers, Lusk said. Eventually Walmart, which is courting more urban, higher income and health conscious shoppers for their online grocery business, could require suppliers to buy food from farmers who use agricultural technology to reduce chemicals to produce crops, he said.  \u201cA way how this might come down is the imposition of standards on their suppliers,\u201d Lusk said.","423":"April 16 (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard is withdrawing its nominations to eBay Inc\u2019s board after the e-commerce company appointed Walmart executive Jamie Iannone as its chief executive officer, the firms said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: People move past a hoarding of Amazon India outside a metro rail station in New Delhi, India, October 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Anushree Fadnavis\/File Photo  The government discussions coincide with a growing number of complaints from India\u2019s bricks-and-mortar retailers, which have for years accused Amazon and Walmart Inc-controlled Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass federal rules, allegations the U.S. companies deny.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers. It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.  Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart were last hit in Dec. 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  Now, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.  The changes could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect equity stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India.  Amazon said e-commerce created \u201chuge job opportunities\u201d and is a significant contributor to economic growth. \u201cAny major alterations\u201d to the policy will adversely impact small- and medium-sized busineses, it said in an emailed statement.  Walmart and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Yogesh Baweja, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which is working on the issue, confirmed to Reuters any changes will be announced through a so-called \u201cpress note,\u201d which contains foreign direct investment rules. He did not give details.  \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Baweja said, adding an internal meeting on the subject last took place about a month ago.  \u201cOf course Amazon\u2019s a big player so whatever advice, whatever suggestions, whatever recommendations they make, they are also given due consideration.\u201d  FRAYED TIES  The 2018 rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to rework their business structures and soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy change favoured local e-tailers over U.S. ones.  India\u2019s e-commerce retail market is seen growing to $200 billion a year by 2026, from $30 billion in 2019, the country\u2019s investment promotion agency Invest India estimates.  Domestic traders have been unhappy about the growth. They see foreign e-commerce businesses as a threat to their livelihoods and accuse them of unfair business practices that use steep discounts to target rapid growth. The companies deny they are acting unfairly.  \u201cThe way the government is thinking is that marketplaces are not doing what they are supposed to do. The government wants to tinker with the nuts and bolts of the policy,\u201d said one of the sources who is familiar with the talks on the policy changes.  LIMITING WHOLESALE TIES  India\u2019s trade minister Piyush Goyal has been critical of e-commerce companies in private meetings and told them to follow all laws in letter and spirit, Reuters has previously reported.  In the face of growing trader complaints and an antitrust investigation, Goyal last year said Amazon was not doing \u201ca great favour to India\u201d by making fresh investments.  Among other changes, the government is considering changes that would effectively prohibit online sales by a seller who purchases goods from the e-commerce entity or its group firm, and then sells them on the entity\u2019s websites, two of the sources said.  Under existing rules, a seller is free to buy up to 25% of its inventory from the e-commerce entity\u2019s wholesale or another unit and then sell them on the e-commerce website.  A boom in e-commerce in India accelerated last year when the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online. Flipkart, in which Walmart invested $16 billion in 2018, and Amazon are among the top two players.  \u201cE-commerce has already made its mark for itself in the country, particularly during COVID-19,\u201d Commerce Ministry\u2019s Baweja said. \u201cThey are bound to grow and a conducive environment should be there, which is good for the brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce.\u201d","426":"A Common myna sits next to the logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart installed on the company's office in Bengaluru, India April 12, 2018.

Krishnamurthy said Flipkart is competing by making its range of products more affordable for Indian buyers through financing options, trade-in programs and its own private label brands.  Smartphones will be Flipkart\u2019s biggest selling category this year, but the online marketplace\u2019s dependence on phones to bulk up sales has fallen as sales in other categories have risen, he said.

(Reuters) - One of Walmart Inc\u2019s best chances at taking on Amazon.com Inc in e-commerce lies with six giant server farms, each larger than ten football fields.  These facilities, which cost Walmart millions of dollars and took nearly five years to build, are starting to pay off. The retailer\u2019s online sales have been on a tear for the last three consecutive quarters, far outpacing wider industry growth levels.  Powering that rise are thousands of proprietary servers that enable the company to crunch almost limitless swathes of customer data in-house.  Most retailers rent the computing capacity they need to store and manage such information. But Walmart\u2019s decision to build its own internal cloud network shows its determination to grab a bigger slice of online shopping, in part by imitating Amazon\u2019s use of cloud-powered big data to drive digital sales.  The effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory. And it is allowing the company to target shoppers with more customized offers and improved services, two top executives told Reuters in interviews at Walmart\u2019s San Bruno and Sunnyvale campuses in California.  \u201cIt has made a big difference to how fast we can grow our e-commerce business,\u201d said Tim Kimmet, head of cloud operations for Walmart.  He said Walmart, for example, is using cloud data to stock items frequently ordered by customers via voice shopping devices such as Google Home.  The network is helping the retailer improve its in-store operations as well. Using data gleaned from millions of transactions, the company sped up the process by which customers can return online purchases to their local stores by 60 percent. And Walmart can adjust prices at its physical locations almost instantly across entire regions.  \u201cWe are now able to execute change faster,\u201d Jeremy King, Walmart\u2019s chief technology officer, told Reuters. He added that Walmart can now make over 170,000 monthly changes to software that supports its website, compared to less than 100 changes previously.

Still, Walmart\u2019s cloud effort is significant at a time when U.S. retail is undergoing immense disruption, and data-based decision making has become more important than ever to understand how shoppers make purchases.  Walmart\u2019s online revenue climbed 50 percent year-over-year during the third quarter, helping it post its strongest-ever quarterly growth since 2009.  \u201cThe battle between Walmart and Amazon has been playing out on all fronts and the cloud is the latest frontier,\u201d said Kerry Liu, chief executive of Rubikloud Technologies, which offers artificial intelligence technology services to retailers.  EXCESS CAPACITY  The cloud initiative is but one of several steps Wal-Mart is taking to boost its e-commerce business. The company has expanded its online selection and acquired smaller e-commerce retailers. Walmart is offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, and it recently asked vendors to supply it with merchandise priced at $10 and up to help it turn a profit online.  Walmart has stored information in smaller internal data centers for years. And it uses public cloud storage for non-critical data. Most retailers rent server capacity offered by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Microsoft Corp and IBM.  (For a graphic on big players in the cloud market, see tmsnrt.rs\/2EYe9Ii)  But Walmart\u2019s decision to build a network that is not reliant on a single third-party cloud technology provider has transformed its ability to understand shoppers, who now move between store, desktop, mobile and app to make purchases. About 80 percent of Walmart\u2019s cloud network is now in-house.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said security was another big factor behind the effort, enabling the retailer to better protect customer data. That secrecy extends to the locations of its six \u201cmega clouds\u201d or giant server farms, and 75 \u201cmicro clouds\u201d whose locations the company declined to disclose publicly.  Walmart shareholders so far appear supportive of its cloud strategy. The company\u2019s shares have risen 49 percent in the last 12 months, defying the broader retail sector downturn and outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which has risen 14 percent over the same period.  Still, some investors have expressed concerns that Walmart\u2019s approach will make it harder for the retailer to downsize if market conditions change significantly. A few of them told Reuters they would like to see Walmart commercialize its excess capacity, much as its rival Amazon has done.  Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $18.34 billion in revenue in 2017 and has garnered 26 percent of the cloud market, according to estimates from Jefferies Group LLC.  \u201cWalmart is very good at following Amazon\u2019s innovations. Now they must find a way to monetize the cloud business they are building the way AWS did,\u201d said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said the retailer has no immediate plans to provide cloud services for other companies.

The FAA said its long-awaited rules for the drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles, will address security concerns by requiring remote identification technology in most cases to enable their identification from the ground.  Previously, small drone operations over people were limited to operations over people who were directly participating in the operation, located under a covered structure, or inside a stationary vehicle - unless operators had obtained a waiver from the FAA.  The rules will take effect 60 days after publication in the federal register in January. Drone manufacturers will have 18 months to begin producing drones with Remote ID, and operators will have an additional year to provide Remote ID.  There are other, more complicated rules that allow for operations at night and over people for larger drones in some cases.  \u201cThe new rules make way for the further integration of drones into our airspace by addressing safety and security concerns,\u201d FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said. \u201cThey get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages.\u201d  Companies have been racing to create drone fleets to speed deliveries. The United States has over 1.7 million drone registrations and 203,000 FAA-certificated remote pilots.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  For at-night operations, the FAA said drones must be equipped with anti-collision lights. The final rules allow operations over moving vehicles in some circumstances.  Remote ID is required for all drones weighing 0.55 lb (0.25 kg) or more, but is required for smaller drones under certain circumstances like flights over open-air assemblies.  The new rules eliminate requirements that drones be connected to the internet to transmit location data but do that they broadcast remote ID messages via radio frequency broadcast. Without the change, drone use could have been barred from use in areas without internet access.  The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International said Remote ID will function as \u201ca digital license plate for drones ... that will enable more complex operations\u201d while operations at night and over people \u201care important steps towards enabling integration of drones into our national airspace.\u201d  One change, since the rules were first proposed in 2019, requires that small drones not have any exposed rotating parts that would lacerate human skin.  United Parcel Service Inc said in October 2019 that it won the government\u2019s first full approval to operate a drone airline.  Last year, Alphabet\u2019s Wing, a sister unit of search engine Google, was the first company to get U.S. air carrier certification for a single-pilot drone operation.  In August, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s drone service received federal approval allowing the retailer to begin testing commercial deliveries through its drone fleet.

JetBlue also said Walmart intended further infringements by using other \u201cJet+color\u201d names such as Jetgold and Jetsilver, and moving closer to JetBlue\u2019s core business by offering travel services, including dining and entertainment recommendations.  The complaint said JetBlue owns 43 federal trademark registrations for JetBlue marks dating as far back as 1999, the year before the Long Island City, New York-based carrier began flying passengers. JetBlue is now the sixth-largest U.S. airline.  Walmart launched Jetblack in New York City in May 2018, as part of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer\u2019s effort to compete with such e-commerce services as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Prime, especially in urban areas.  \u201cWe respect the intellectual property rights of others,\u201d Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said. \u201cWe take this issue seriously, and once we are served with the complaint will respond appropriately with the court.\u201d  The lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The report from the Organization United for Respect (OUR), formerly called OUR Walmart, said 69 percent of the part-time employees it surveyed would prefer the stability and greater income of a full-time job. Walmart\u2019s share of part-time workers is well above the industry average of around 30 percent, it said.  Over 7,000 Walmart hourly employees participated in the survey. The responses were collated online from 87 percent of them, or 6,176 current employees, the report said. OUR, which split from the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) in 2015, says it is a network of over 150,000 people working in low wage retail jobs and its largest support base is within Walmart.  The retailer\u2019s spokesman, Kory Lundberg, said the company has a majority full-time hourly workforce, without giving numbers. \u201cWe have more full-time jobs than any private business in America and we have seen that percentage go up over the last few years.\u201d  Lundberg said the company converts about 150,000 workers from part time to full time annually and employees can pick up extra hours by signing up for eligible unfilled shifts in their stores.  Part-time employees receive fewer benefits, earn less pay for the same work as full-time associates and often find it hard to climb the ranks within the company.  According to research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 9 percent of part-time workers prefer full-time jobs. Labor experts say that number takes into account a broad cross-section of the industry and not the specific subset of minimum wage workers that make up much of Walmart\u2019s ranks.  Walmart employs around 1.5 million people in the United States and is the largest private employer in the country. The company raised its minimum wage for hourly employees to $11 an hour in January, its third minimum wage increase since 2005, after benefiting from the corporate tax cut plan.  The company is gearing up for its annual shareholders meeting next week, a celebrity-studded affair that draws thousands of workers from around the world. OUR and other labor groups annually release reports before the shareholder meeting.  Four out of five part-time black, Latino and Asian hourly Walmart employees who participated in the survey described themselves as \u201cinvoluntary part-time\u201d employees - those who would prefer to work full-time - the survey showed.  About 60 percent of the part-time workers surveyed also said their hours declined after Walmart launched a new scheduling system in 2016.  Arianna Smith, a Walmart employee in Barstow, California, said her hours had been cut. \u201cI went from working more than 40 hours a week at $11 an hour to being scheduled for only 16-24 hours each week.\u201d  Guirlene Mazarin, who works at Walmart\u2019s store in Miami Gardens, Florida, said her part-time schedule is random.  \u201cEven though I am available to work additional hours, I\u2019m only scheduled for approximately 30 hours every week,\u201d she said. Mazar said her schedule prevents her from planning for the week, adding a second part-time job or being available to pick up her daughter from school.  Fifty-five percent of part-time employees also said they did not have enough food to meet their basic needs. Walmart employees are among the largest groups on food stamp subsidies, according to labor experts.","441":"FILE PHOTO: A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California April 13, 2016.

The virus has infected over 32,000 people in the United States leading to more than 415 deaths, a Reuters tally showed.  Last week, Walmart said it would pay special cash bonuses totaling $550 million to hourly staff and hire 150,000 temporary workers through the end of May in its stores and fulfillment centers.  Workers in distribution centers, which primarily help stock stores, start at $17 to $18 an hour. The starting wage for store workers in most locations remains $11 an hour, with the average wage among full-time hourly workers at $14.26.  Rivals such as Amazon.com Inc and Target Corp have also boosted pay and gone on a hiring spree to manage a surge in orders while many clothing and mall-based retailers have been forced to shut stores.  Amazon hiked entry wages to $17 from $15 and announced plans to hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States. On Saturday, it said it would raise overtime pay for associates working in its U.S. warehouses.  Target said last week it would raise its minimum wage by $2 an hour for store and distribution center workers through May 2.

Walmart officials said on Thursday they had reached out to industry groups representing hotels and restaurants, offering to hire staff who have recently lost their jobs due to the virus-induced slowdown in tourism and catering.  On Monday, the company said new employees can begin work at its facilities in as little as 24 hours after being hired. It is also offering new hires and current workers a $250 cash bonus for each new hire referral after 90 days from the new hire\u2019s start.  On Sunday, the retailer said it has set up federal drive-through coronavirus testing sites in the parking lots of two stores in Illinois.","453":"FILE PHOTO: A shopper is seen without a mask after leaving a Walmart store in Bradford, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 20, 2020.

Retailers count on customers opening up their wallets to score door-buster deals on gifts.  However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced retailers to drastically rethink how they do business as consumer spending habits prove unpredictable, and while Black Friday remains a major marketing event for retailers, its relevance had already been fading greatly in recent years due to early online promotions.  \u201cAmazon\u2019s Prime Day (in October) marks the earliest start of the full assortment holiday shopping season in 50 years, as COVID permanently reshapes the holiday calendar,\u201d said Hilding Anderson, head of retail strategy at consulting firm Publicis Sapient. \u201cBlack Friday may not exist as a recognizable form this year.\u201d  That has forced many retailers to match and discount much earlier in the season to remain competitive. A slew of retailers including Walmart, Target TGT.N, Best Buy, and Kohl's KSS.N, have announced plans to roll out their winter holiday promotions in October too.  Consumers getting a head start on holiday purchases could give retailers a better shot at increasing sales and improving revenue after \u201can incredibly challenging year,\u201d Anderson added.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, said on Wednesday it would offer Walmart shoppers reduced prices on everything from TVs to bath towels and blenders during three separate promotions across a handful of days in November, which will help reduce crowds. The promos will begin online at Walmart.com and continue in Walmart stores, the company said.  On Tuesday, Best Buy sent an email to shoppers advertising deeply discounted laptops, tablets, printers and other items for their two-day \"Black Friday Prices Guaranteed Sale\" coinciding with Amazon's AMZN.O Prime Day.  A Best Buy spokesperson said on Wednesday it would give shoppers more opportunities to bag deep discounts on electronics in the run-up to the holiday in November.

The British supermarket group said the deal will be followed by a full buy-out of the scheme in late 2020 or early 2021 after it had paid a one-off final contribution of about $1 billion.  Walmart CFO Richard Mayfield said the company was delighted to be able to secure the pensions of its members with a leading, well financed insurer such as Rothesay Life.  \u201cThis transaction is good news for members of the scheme, simplifies the Asda balance sheet and will transfer our pension liabilities at a competitive price,\u201d he said.  Rothesay Life said it was seeing an increasing number of very large schemes, with strong corporate sponsors, looking to insure pension liabilities, a trend that resulted in it writing a record level of pension business in 2019.  It said it now insured more than 800,000 people in pension schemes and managed 56 billion pounds of assets.  Asda said its defined contribution pension plan, that provided ongoing pension arrangements to the majority of its staff, was not included in the deal.  In April Sainsbury's SBRY.L 7.3 billion pounds agreed bid for Asda was blocked by Britain's competition regulator.

Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart called out the impact of tariffs on consumers after Macy\u2019s Inc delivered a similar warning on Wednesday. The department store chain\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said tariffs on Chinese imports are hitting its furniture business and warned investors that additional levies would leave its clothing and accessory categories vulnerable.  U.S. President Donald Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% last week. The move is widely expected to raise prices on thousands of products including clothing, furniture and electronics. China retaliated on Monday, though on a smaller scale.  Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said in an interview that higher tariffs will result in increased prices for consumers. He said the company will seek to ease the pain, in part by trying to obtain products from different countries and working with suppliers\u2019 \u201ccosts structures to manage higher tariffs.\u201d  Moody\u2019s analyst Charlie O\u2019Shea said the potential impact on Walmart and its shoppers from tariffs is limited by its food business. Its grocery operation, which includes fresh food, contributes roughly 56 percent to overall revenue.  \u201cWe believe Walmart has the wherewithal both financially and via its vendor relationships to minimize the impact on both itself and its shopping base,\u201d he said.  Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said on a conference call the company will maintain its \u201clow-price leadership\u201d and \u201cmanage costs on an item-by-item basis.\u201d But that position has been threatened, in part, by rising competition from discount chains like Aldi.  FILE PHOTO: Customers shop for a turkey at a Walmart store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski\/File Photo  Also, Walmart\u2019s vendors have started to raise prices, among them Del Monte Foods, which supplies fresh and packaged goods to Walmart, including mandarin oranges imported from China. Prices will go up again with tariffs rising.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just tariffs. Transportation costs are up, labor costs are up. It\u2019s an inflationary environment,\u201d Del Monte CEO Greg Longstreet told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference. \u201cA lot of that\u2019s going to have to be passed on. The consumer is going to have to pay more for a lot of critical goods.\u201d  Walmart shares, which have gained 7% so far this year, closed up 1.4% at $101.31.  NO SIGNS OF SPENDING SLOWDOWN  Walmart CFO Biggs said the retailer has not seen signs of a slowdown in consumer spending.  Investors and analysts expect U.S. spending to slow this year against a backdrop of rising debt, tariffs and economic uncertainty.  U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in April as households cut back on purchases of vehicles and a range of other goods, reflecting a slowdown in economic growth after a temporary boost from exports and inventories in the first quarter.  Earlier this week, Walmart stepped up its online battle with Amazon.com Inc by offering one-day delivery in some markets without a shipping fee, weeks after Amazon announced a similar plan.  Walmart said it will cost the company less than for two-day shipping since orders will come straight from warehouses closer to the customer and arrive in a single box rather than multiple packages.  Sales at Walmart\u2019s U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3.4%, excluding fuel, in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts estimated growth of 3.1%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Walmart has recorded over four straight years of sales growth, unmatched by any retailer.  Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.13 per share, beating expectations of $1.02 per share.  But profits remained under pressure as more revenue was generated by lower-margin online sales and as e-commerce investments rose.  Operating income fell 4.1% to $4.9 billion, in part because of Walmart\u2019s purchase of Indian e-commerce startup Flipkart last year.  In the United States, the largest piece of Walmart\u2019s business, operating income grew 5.5% as some transportation costs eased.  Online sales rose 37%, slowing from the previous quarter\u2019s 43% increase but stronger than online sales growth at most of its brick-and-mortar rivals. The company has forecast a 35% increase in online sales this year.  Total revenue was up 1% at $123.9 billion but lower than analysts\u2019 estimates of $125.03 billion, dragged down by the currency impact and lower international sales. Excluding currency, revenue was up 2.5% at $125.8 billion.  On Tuesday, Walmart said it was considering a stock market listing for its British supermarket arm Asda, whose attempt to combine with rival J Sainsbury Plc was blocked by UK regulators last month.","458":"July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. retailer Walmart Inc on Thursday said it has not decided to sell Japanese supermarket chain Seiyu and would continue to develop its business in Japan.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon held early exploratory talks to buy control of Indian rival Flipkart but a deal with Walmart is more likely, daily newspaper Mint said on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  One person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the probability of a deal with Amazon was low, and that any such deal could spark monopoly concerns as Flipkart and Amazon dominate India\u2019s e-commerce market. The person declined to be identified as discussions were private.  Amazon declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Flipkart and Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.  Walmart is in talks to buy over 40 percent of Flipkart in potentially one of its biggest overseas deals, Reuters reported in February. A deal would give the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that Morgan Stanley estimated to be worth $200 billion in a decade\u2019s time.  The deal would also represent a direct challenge to Amazon in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy. Amazon has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands into online grocery delivery.  Walmart will buy a majority stake in Flipkart through a mix of primary and secondary share purchases in a deal that could value the Indian firm at $21 billion, Mint reported.  Flipkart, founded by former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007, controls nearly 40 percent of India\u2019s online retail market, ahead of Amazon, showed estimates by researcher Forrester.  Like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the pair began by selling books and diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones through exclusive flash sales. Flipkart now competes with Amazon on almost all product categories.  Flipkart\u2019s success has attracted a bevy of deep-pocketed and tech-savvy investors including U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management LLC, online marketplace eBay Inc and software maker Microsoft Corp, as well as Chinese technology firm Tencent Holdings Ltd.  It was valued at around $12 billion when Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp\u2019s Vision Fund bought roughly a fifth of the firm last year for $2.5 billion.","463":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T said on Wednesday it is selling its roughly 20 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart [IPO-FLPK.N] to Walmart Inc WMT.N, the first public divestment by its Vision Fund.  Walmart said this month it will pay $16 billion for a stake of around 77 percent in Flipkart and there had been some uncertainty over whether the Japanese tech and investment giant would remain a shareholder.  SoftBank did not disclose terms of the sale but this month CEO Masayoshi Son said its investment in the Indian firm was worth around $4 billion. The Vision Fund invested invested $2.5 billion in Flipkart in August last year.  It also did not comment on its reasons for cashing out. The Flipkart exit comes far more quickly than SoftBank\u2019s average investment duration of 13.5 years.  The Vision Fund has invested $30 billion in startups in the last year. Son, who, as of last May, has attracted $93 billion to his technology investment vehicle, said last week he is looking to start a new fund - potentially further upending the world of dealmaking.

FILE PHOTO: The main entrance to a Walmart store is pictured in Sao Paulo, Brazil February 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker  Wholesale has become increasingly popular in Brazil as the country slowly exits from a harsh recession.  \u201cThe company is working in a new omnichannel strategy which will be later announced\u201d, Walmart Brasil said in a statement on Friday, without giving details. News of the decision was first reported by newspaper Valor Economico.  The move is likely to open room to local and international retailers currently focused on exploring still incipient e-commerce in Brazil.  Walmart\u2019s decision caps years of efforts that never really took off. It precedes the long-awaited launch of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment center, which will enable it to sell directly to consumers in Brazil.  Part of Walmart\u2019s struggles, had to do with tough competition from local players in the e-commerce segment, including B2W, Via Varejo and Magazine Luiza SA.  Walmart launched an e-commerce division in Brazil in 2011, selling directly to consumers. But by 2017, the retailer discontinued direct sales, focusing only on running as a marketplace for third-party sellers, which it had launched in 2015.  Walmart never disclosed how much online sales contributed to its top line in Brazil.  In mid-2018, buyout firm Advent International acquired an 80% stake in the Brazilian operation, unfolding a broad revamp.  By then, the e-commerce division was already in decline.  As part of the decision to exit e-commerce, the company laid off 70 of its 90 employees working for the marketplace platform, with the remaining 20 fully dedicated to manage ongoing orders.  Walmart\u2019s decision could be a boom for its competitors.  \u201cWalmart\u2019s (e-commerce) operation has been shrinking for a while now, but we are prepared to direct their consumer traffic to Carrefour\u201d, Chief Executive Officer of Carrefour eBusiness Brasil, Paula Cardoso, told journalists on Friday in a call to discuss quarterly results.  In a separate statement, Walmart Brasil said it plans to convert 10 underperforming hypermarkets into wholesale stores Maxxi Atacado by the end of 2020. The first one was opened on May 9 in the city of Diadema, near Sao Paulo.  Another 10 hypermarkets will be converted into Sam\u2019s Club stores, the company said.","468":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N said it would start offering holiday deals for customers as early as Thursday, as it prepares to compete with Amazon Inc AMZ.N, Target Corp TGT.N and other rivals for shoppers on one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer will also have deals available on Walmart.com beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thursday, Nov. 8, the company said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Overall, roughly 20.5 million people lost their jobs in April, the U.S. Labor Department said on Friday, a wipeout of jobs at a rate not seen since the 1930s. The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7%, although some economists estimate the true level is closer to 20% due to misclassifications of workers.  Almost across the board, sector after sector reported precipitous drops in overall employment in April, even though some major players within industries - from online sales to grocery shopping and pharmacies - have seen surges in demand in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders.  Warehouse clubs, superstores and supercenters, which usually sell both groceries and other general merchandise including clothing and appliances, saw such an uptick in demand that an additional 93,400 workers were hired last month. That was a record for that sector and nearly double the next highest increase in November 2007 as the economy was about to enter the 2007-2009 Great Recession.  The biggest names in that category are Walmart and Costco, the two largest retailers in the world. Both operate membership-only warehouse clubs, which allow customers to buy in bulk at discounted prices, and have benefited as panicked shoppers stockpiled essentials amid the shutdown of large parts of the U.S. economy in mid-March.  Walmart said last month it had hired an additional 150,000 new staff across its stores and fulfillment and distribution centers since March, 85% of whom were in temporary or part-time roles. The company said it plans to hire 50,000 more.  It has had more than 1 million applicants for the roles, the company said.  Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O had reported a nearly 12% rise in net sales for March, including a 48% jump in online sales, although it reported this week that U.S. same-store sales declined 3.3% in April as an even higher increase in online orders failed to offset fewer people at its stores.  COURIERS, POSTAL SERVICE  An additional 1,800 couriers and messengers were also hired in April, Friday\u2019s data showed, and the U.S. postal service added 500 jobs.  Delivery services have been in demand to cope with a surge in online shopping, a combination of consumers trying to limit outings that could expose them to the coronavirus and all but essential stores having been closed until recently in many states.  Both FedEx Corp FDX.N and UPS UPS.N have ramped up hiring. Instacart, which provides home delivery of groceries, said two weeks ago it had hired 300,000 people as personal shoppers and plans to hire 250,000 more.  Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O said it had hired 175,000 people in the past two months in its fulfillment and delivery network and estimated a 28% rise in revenue to $81 billion this quarter. It uses the U.S. postal service for some of its deliveries.","472":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese discount retailer Don Quijote Holdings Co Ltd 7532.T said it would be interested in buying Seiyu if Walmart Inc WMT.N puts the Japanese supermarket chain up for sale, as it expands its presence in the domestic market.

Walmart has struggled to replicate the success of its low-price model with Seiyu, which has more than 300 stores, and a sale would mark its latest exit from a low-growth market to shake up its overseas business and invest in places like China and India.  A Walmart spokesperson, however, said the retailer has not decided to sell Seiyu, is not in talks with prospective buyers and is continuing to develop the business, reiterating what the company had said after the Nikkei report.  Last week, Don Quijote reported its 29th straight year of sales and profit growth.

Online sales jumped 43 percent in the quarter helped in particular by the expansion of Walmart\u2019s online grocery pickup program to more than 2,100 stores by year end.  Shares of the world\u2019s largest retailer rose 2.2 percent on Tuesday in a broadly flat market, putting them up 9.7 percent so far this year.  Walmart and rival Target Corp\u2019s unexpectedly strong growth in holiday sales reflected the health of the U.S. consumer as spending remained robust due to a strong labor market and cheaper gasoline prices.  \u201cWe still feel pretty good about the consumer. We haven\u2019t seen much of a change,\u201d Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters. \u201cThe data we are seeing still looks pretty healthy. Gas prices are down year over year, which helps.\u201d  Investors and Wall Street analysts have been expecting U.S. spending to slow this year, against a backdrop of rising debt, trade tariffs and economic uncertainty. Walmart\u2019s results settled nerves, but some doubts remain.  \u201cThere are definitely some storm clouds on the horizon,\u201d said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, which owns Walmart shares. \u201cA big example would be delinquent loans in the auto sector which are rising ... the consumer may be on hard times and in 2008 that was the prelude to the global economic slowdown.\u201d  U.S. retail sales recorded their steepest drop in more than nine years in December, the government reported last week, as receipts fell across the board, suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2018.  However, overall sales for the 2018 U.S. holiday shopping season hit a six-year high as shoppers were encouraged by early discounts, according to a Mastercard report in late December.

The gain exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations of 2.96 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Sales were boosted by federal officials distributing food stamp aid early during the partial government shutdown. The demise of retailer Toys R Us also helped Walmart gain toy market share, the company said.  Adjusted earnings per share increased to $1.41 per share, beating expectations of $1.33 per share, according to Refinitiv. But the retailer\u2019s gross margins declined for the seventh consecutive quarter due to higher transportation costs and e-commerce investments.  ONLINE SALES JUMP  Walmart\u2019s 43 percent rise in online sales matched the previous quarter\u2019s increase, and the company credited a broader assortment on its website and improved delivery, as well as store pickup of online grocery orders.  Higher online grocery sales helped it expand market share in the category, Walmart said. It will have the store pickup service at 3,100 stores by next January.  Walmart will offer grocery deliveries to about 800 more stores by the end of the year, bringing the total to 1,600 stores.  But the company reiterated that it expected e-commerce losses to increase this year due to ongoing investments. Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a conference call the company was focused on getting return customer visits and strengthening product assortment.  Grocery sales currently make up 56 percent of total revenue for the retailer. Amazon.com Inc is trying to crack the food category, especially since it bought organic supermarket chain Whole Foods.  Walmart is partnering with third-party couriers and working with so-called gig, or freelance, drivers, who are cheaper than full-time employees, to push down costs, Reuters recently reported.  Google-backed Deliv, a Walmart delivery partner in Miami and San Jose, ended its relationship with the retailer, Reuters reported last week.  The U.S. retailer, which overtook Apple Inc to become the third largest e-commerce retailer last year, is likely to capture a 4.6 percent share of the U.S. e-commerce market, behind eBay Inc and Amazon, according to research firm eMarketer.  Walmart repeated its forecast that fiscal year 2020 earnings per share would decline in the low single digits in percentage terms, compared with last year. Excluding the acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, it sees an increase in the low- to mid-single-digits.  McMillon said the company was disappointed in India\u2019s revised e-commerce regulations, which ban companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and also bar them from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms.  He said the Indian government didn\u2019t consult with Walmart and other U.S. companies before it changed the rules. \u201cWe hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward, which results in a level playing field,\u201d he said.  Walmart expects fiscal year 2020 comparable sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent, excluding fuel and online sales growth of 35 percent.  Total revenue increased 1.9 percent to $138.8 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $138.65 billion.

The surge in demand for essentials seen at the peak of the coronavirus lockdowns has carried into the second half of the year, with consumers relying on its same-day delivery and store pick-up services to buy everything from groceries to sporting goods.  This helped its U.S. e-commerce sales grow 79% with strong results across all channels and helped boost same-store sales and profit margins.  \"I'm a believer that with more investment in online ...

The company did not disclose any metrics about the new service that costs $98 per year and offers services such as unlimited free delivery, fuel discounts and no checkout lines.  The COVID-19 pandemic has also forced retailers to drastically rethink how they do business during the key holiday season, with many big retailers including Walmart, Kohl's KSS.N, Target TGT.N, and Best Buy BBY.N moving their promotions to as early as October.  \u201cThis holiday season will obviously be unique ...

(Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N is starting a new same-day delivery service where customers can place orders using a text message, another step in its effort to scale up its e-commerce offerings and compete with rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  The service, called Jetblack, allows shoppers to order items from Walmart.com and even websites of rival retailers. It is a part of Walmart\u2019s internal start-up incubator, Store No. 8.  Jetblack has been launched in parts of New York City, with plans to roll it out to the rest of the United States over time.  \u201cThe goal is to think about game-changing technologies that will change the way people shop,\u201d said Jenny Fleiss, co-founder and chief executive of Jetblack, who also co-founded popular online fashion website Rent The Runway.  Fleiss said one of the technologies that will usher retail into the future will be the ability to have a personalized shopping experience through text messaging and online chat.  The U.S. retail giant is pouring billions of dollars into beefing up its e-commerce business and has recently announced partnerships with logistics companies to deliver groceries ordered online. Two such partnerships Walmart had struck with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft have ended, however, Reuters reported earlier this month.  Jetblack, which is available with a monthly membership fee of $50, will offer same-day and next-day delivery at no additional cost. The challenge for the service will be competing with other established membership services like Amazon Prime and Prime Now, which already enjoy wide adoption and are popular with urban consumers.  Fleiss said consumers who took part in a pilot were on average buying ten items per week from Jetblack. The service differentiates itself by sourcing everyday essentials from Walmart and Jet.com, while also allowing customers to order items from rival retailers like cosmetics retailer Sephora or local brands, she said.  Jetblack will also remind shoppers using text messaging if they are about to run out of a product they ordered. The service uses artificial intelligence to curate product suggestions, Fleiss said.","486":"FILE PHOTO: A Walmart store is seen in Encinitas, California April 13, 2016.

FILE PHOTO: AR-15 rifles are displayed for sale at the Guntoberfest gun show in Oaks, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts  The decision by the nation\u2019s second largest pension fund came after California State Treasurer John Chiang urged CalSTRS to use \u201cthe power of its purse strings\u201d and \u201cdeny weapons of mass carnage to another killer stalking our innocent loved ones.\u201d  The pension fund has already divested from firearms manufacturers, but the board said that with retailers, it preferred to take a high-profile engagement strategy.  The plan calls for the fund to hire two new positions devoted to actively engaging retailers. It allows the board to reconsider divestment if it \u201cfails to achieve an acceptable outcome,\u201d but did not specify what would be considered unsuccessful engagement.  The plan would prioritize \u201ca public communication plan to highlight areas of firearm concern and applaud responsive companies.\u201d  \u201cUnlike other CalSTRS engagements, where our staff practices quiet diplomacy, this plan advances a more public approach, to leverage the public pressure that has been mounting in this country in response to recent tragic gun violence,\u201d said Harry Keiley, CalSTRS\u2019 Investment Committee Chair. \u201cWe encourage other institutional investors to consider conducting similar activities.\u201d  CalSTRS\u2019 decision follows a vote by the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System board in March to not divest in assault rifle retailers and wholesalers, saying the move would do little to reduce gun violence.  Both proposals were pushed by Chiang, who is running for governor of California.  CalSTRS', in documents discussed on Wednesday, noted exposure to retailers and wholesalers of assault-style rifles exceeds $420 million, the majority of it passively held in an investment in Walmart Inc WMT.N.  However, two weeks after February\u2019s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, Walmart amended its firearms sales policy by raising the minimum age for purchasing firearms and ammunition to 21 years. Walmart ended sales of modern sporting rifles, including the AR-15, in 2015, the company said in a February statement. It doesn\u2019t sell handguns, except in Alaska.  The CalSTRS board on Wednesday listened to statements from about a dozen members of the public, including teachers, parents, and family members of victims of mass shootings, who called on the board \u201cto be an agent of change\u201d by supporting divestment.  In 2013, CalSTRS divested from publicly traded companies that manufactured firearms after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.  Following the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, weapon manufacturers, too, have been under increasing scrutiny to acknowledge a growing public discourse over weapon sales to the public.

The memos were issued in July and viewed by Reuters on Tuesday after they were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.  Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart is the world\u2019s largest retailer and the largest private employer in the U.S. with a workforce of 1.5 million.  Walmart told the EEOC it was willing to engage in a \u201cconciliatory process,\u201d though in most cases the agency\u2019s reasonable cause findings were \u201cvague and non-specific,\u201d said Randy Hargrove, a Walmart spokesman.  The cases involved allegations that were more than 15 years old, he said, and were \u201cnot representative of the positive experiences millions of women have had working at Walmart.\u201d  Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for the women, said there were at least 1,600 similar complaints pending at the EEOC, accusing Walmart of discriminating against women in pay and promotions between 1999 and 2011. About 150 lawsuits against Walmart, covering the same time period, were pending in federal courts across the country, he said.  In 2011, Walmart convinced the U.S. Supreme Court not to let about 1.5 million female workers complaining about pay and promotions sue in a class action, with a majority of justices concluding the women had too little in common to sue as a group.  Sellers, who represented Walmart workers in that case, said the memos issued in July involve women who worked at Walmart stores in over 30 states. That suggests a broad pattern of pay discrimination rather than isolated instances that could be attributed to local managers, Sellers said.  The EEOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  If Walmart cannot reach a settlement with the women, the EEOC could file a lawsuit against the company or authorize the women to bring their own.  Sellers declined to comment on the status of settlement negotiations.","491":"Feb 28 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc:  * WALMART ISSUES STATEMENT ON FIREARMS POLICY  * WALMART SAYS GOING FORWARD, RAISING AGE RESTRICTION FOR PURCHASE OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION TO 21 YEARS OF AGE  * WALMART SAYS ALSO REMOVING ITEMS FROM WEBSITE RESEMBLING ASSAULT-STYLE RIFLES, INCLUDING NONLETHAL AIRSOFT GUNS AND TOYS Source text: (bit.ly\/2ox2M2Y) Further company coverage:","492":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is seeking new ways to widen use of the euro and counter the dollar\u2019s global dominance, top EU officials said on Thursday, as the bloc tries to salvage Iran\u2019s nuclear deal by helping companies bypass U.S. sanctions.  FILE PHOTO - U.S. dollar and Euro notes are seen in this November 7, 2016 picture illustration. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File photo  Fears they will be hit with sanctions have pushed European corporations to suspend their dealings with Iran after Washington pulled out of the nuclear accord last year. The EU has tried to defend the pact signed with world powers in 2015 by offering firms alternative ways to trade with oil-rich Iran.  Because the dollar is the world\u2019s dominant currency, European officials and businessmen are aware that financial threats by the United States cannot be overlooked, even when they rest on controversial legal grounds.  \u201cYou simply don\u2019t want to take the risk,\u201d said a manager at a top European company.  Companies that trade with Iran risk being shut out from the U.S. market and could lose access to credit. Banks, insurers and other financial operators that provide support to firms breaching sanctions also face fines. The effectiveness of U.S. sanctions is increased by the dollar\u2019s global dominance.  Beyond immediate but limited moves to challenge Washington\u2019s boycott of the Iran deal, such as plans to set up a barter-based trade channel, INSTEX, EU officials are taking a long view and pondering how help the euro challenge the dollar\u2019s position.  \u201cA stronger international role for the euro is a key priority,\u201d France\u2019s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told a conference in Brussels, saying U.S. policy towards Iran had triggered renewed efforts in that direction.  \u201cI don\u2019t want our companies to suffer from American decisions that we do not share,\u201d Le Maire told the conference of European financial experts.  The dollar is dominant in most sectors of the global monetary system, accounting for about a 60% of foreign reserves, sovereign debt issuance and international loans to corporations. The euro takes roughly a 20% share of those markets.  Reforming the euro zone\u2019s governance, with joint debt issuance and stronger common guarantees to rescue ailing banks and their savers, is considered the crucial route to strengthen the euro. But divisions between the 19-country bloc\u2019s governments have for years prevented progress.  FROM INSTANT PAYMENTS TO RUSSIAN GAS  EU officials are therefore considering complementary measures to boost the euro\u2019s global relevance.  \u201cThe time has come to strengthen the international role of the euro, because the euro is also one of the best tools we have to support our European values abroad,\u201d the EU commissioner for the common currency Valdis Dombrovskis told the conference.  He said the Commission, the EU\u2019s executive, supported the development of a bloc-wide instant-payment system that could increase the euro\u2019s 35% share of the market for global transactions, and challenge U.S. dominance in card payments.  The European Central Bank has set up an infrastructure to settle euro payments in a few seconds, but banks have so far been reluctant to join the system, favouring national schemes.  The EU is also discussing with foreign countries, like Ukraine and India, how to facilitate the issuance of part of their public debt in euros, one EU official said.  Europe is also looking at ways of better leveraging its weight on energy markets, Dombrovskis said.  Despite being the world\u2019s primary importer of oil and gas, less than 10 percent of the 40 trillion euros worth (\u00a334.93 trillion) of transactions each year in Europe\u2019s energy markets are executed with the bloc\u2019s currency.  Brussels is pushing European states and companies to use euros in their energy contracts, especially for gas, imported mostly from Russia.  It may find in Moscow an unexpected ally, as Russian suppliers have for years been showing interest in replacing the dollar in their contracts, said Marco Piredda, Vice-President of government affairs at the Italian oil and gas group ENI.","493":"LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, the UK arm of Walmart, confirmed on Monday they are to merge to create Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket group by market share, surpassing current leader Tesco.

Activists from Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a wing of Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), scuffle with police during a protest against U.S. retailer REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi  Walmart said on Wednesday it would pay some $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in the Indian e-commerce firm, stepping up competition with rival Amazon.com AMZN.O in a major growth market.  While Thursday\u2019s protest was small and unlikely to affect the deal, such sentiments pose a challenge for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it prepares to fight an election next year.  For Modi, appeasing small traders and farmers, who are part of the BJP\u2019s core constituency, is as important as upholding India\u2019s image as a place that welcomes foreign investment.  Officials have been advised not to comment on the Walmart-Flipkart deal, a senior government official said. The ruling party has previously opposed foreign direct investment in the multi-brand retail sector.  \u201cPolitically, the government may find it difficult to digest the deal,\u201d the official said.  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) also taunted the Modi government, noting the BJP had decried such investments when it was in the opposition and accusing it of betraying promises.  Officials in the Prime Minister\u2019s office did not respond to calls by Reuters for comment.  According to the deal, Walmart\u2019s investment is in Flipkart\u2019s online marketplace platform, where foreign investment is allowed. The U.S. company cannot open physical stores in India, according to rules governing the multi-brand retail sector.

I think as a company not just in India, but around the world, the concept of franchising isn\u2019t out of bounds,\u201d said McMillon, adding Walmart was not yet ready to make any such announcements.  That could fan fears of some trader and farmer groups, who contend the U.S. company is using the deal as a back-door entry into India\u2019s bricks and mortar retail market, and that it could squeeze out small corner shops that dominate Indian retail.  FRINGE PROTESTS  Some 80 people gathered outside a Delhi hotel holding placards reading \u201cWalmart Go Back!\u201d and shouting slogans asking people to ditch imported products for Indian-made goods. Inside the hotel, McMillon was talking to a dozen journalists about the deal.  \u201cWhoever is protesting also has a story to tell. If you look at our history as a country, there was a history of colonialism. And there is always a fear that you start with trade and then it becomes control,\u201d said Devangshu Dutta, head of retail consultancy firm Third Eyesight.  The protesters were from the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), a nationalist group linked to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of Modi\u2019s party. The group has said the deal is against \u201cnational interests\u201d and will hurt Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d drive.  It has also written to Modi asking the government to intervene.

The deal, one of Walmart\u2019s various global investments and tie-ups geared at helping the retailer compete with Amazon.com Inc, is slated to close by year\u2019s end.  In the United States, Walmart is the largest seller of groceries but grapples with the challenge of swiftly delivering fresh food to the homes of online customers. The company has promised to make such deliveries in 100 U.S. cities by the end of 2018 and so far covers nearly 50 markets.  In a race to meet its goal, the company is working with several small delivery companies including Doordash and Postmates after ditching partnerships with ride-share companies Uber and Lyft.  Cornershop Chief Technology Officer Daniel Undurraga said in an interview on Tuesday that Cornershop plans to launch in Toronto in the first quarter next year. If it does well, Vancouver and Montreal would follow.  If Canada is successful overall, Undurraga said, the United States could be the next target.  \u201cCanada is a good test market for launching a service in the U.S. It is very similar, but smaller,\u201d he said.  Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Judith McKenna, chief executive of Walmart International, said in September that Cornershop was expected to provide a learning experience for Walmart\u2019s markets beyond Mexico and Chile.  An English-language version of the app will roll out within a month as part of preparation for the Canada launch, Undurraga said.  Cornershop still needs to partner with a local payments company and recruit workers in Canada. About 11,000 people currently work for Cornershop across 11 cities in Mexico and Chile.  Apart from Walmart the platform also offers deliveries from various retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Mexican chains Chedraui and La Comer. Undurraga said Cornershop is building firewalls so that Walmart cannot access customer data from other stores.  The company will also consider raising delivery fees to account for higher labor costs in Canada and the United States. Cornershop generates other revenue through advertising, commissions from retailers and price mark-ups.  The technology, however, is already in place.  \u201cWe have our own tools for being able to do this without a lot of effort,\u201d Undurraga said.","502":"March 20 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc:  * WALMART SAYS RECEIVED GRAND JURY SUBPOENAS ISSUED BY THE U.S. ATTORNEY\u2019S OFFICE FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA  * WALMART - SUBPOENAS ARE SEEKING DOCUMENTS REGARDING CONSUMER FRAUD PROGRAM & ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING COMPLIANCE RELATED TO CO\u2019S MONEY TRANSFER SERVICES  * WALMART - THE MOST RECENT SUBPOENA WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY 2020  * WALMART - HAS BEEN RESPONDING TO THE SUBPOENAS  * WALMART - HAS ALSO BEEN RESPONDING TO CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMANDS FROM THE U.S. FTC RELATED TO MONEY TRANSFERS AND THE COMPANY\u2019S ANTI-FRAUD PROGRAM Source text for Eikon: (bit.ly\/3a9kHCy) Further company coverage:","503":"April 20 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc:  * WALMART - CEO DOUGLAS MCMILLON\u2019S TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2018 WAS $22.8 MILLION VERSUS $22.4 MILLION IN 2017 - SEC FILING  * WALMART - CFO M.

Roughly an hour later, the 62-year-old delivers vegetables, flavored water and cleaning supplies to a shopper\u2019s front door. It is one of nearly 100 such Walmart deliveries for Leonard since July, when he first signed up to courier for the world\u2019s largest retailer.  But he does not wear a uniform or collect a traditional paycheck. He is not on Walmart\u2019s staff.  Leonard is one of hundreds of local independent drivers for DoorDash, the San Francisco-based online delivery service that Walmart uses to handle same-day delivery of groceries to shoppers\u2019 homes outside of Atlanta.  Leonard and his cohort of some 16.5 million American \u201cgig\u201d workers - people who currently work in contingent jobs or as on call workers - come at a lower cost for Walmart than full-time employees, according to interviews with drivers, delivery companies and Walmart documents reviewed by Reuters. But they lack loyalty when there are better paying deliveries out there, adding risk to Walmart\u2019s latest attempt to win more online grocery customers.  \u201cThis affords me the ability to make my own hours,\u201d said Leonard, who pays for his own fuel, car insurance and gets no health insurance, retirement plan or other employee benefits. He and other gig drivers in the area collect $7 to $10 per Walmart delivery. Walmart has deemed $11 an hour as minimum wage for its own employees.  The world\u2019s largest retailer began bolstering its partnerships with third-party courier firms to reach consumers in 100 U.S. cities last year to better compete with Amazon.com Inc. The move came as it ended initiatives to use Uber and Lyft drivers, and struggled with using Walmart\u2019s own employees, to deliver packages.  Walmart told Reuters it benefits from the speed as well as the driver contacts of its seven partner firms, such as DoorDash. The move allows same-day grocery delivery to 40 percent of households across the United States, without the burden of hiring employees.  The retailer is able to keep costs down by negotiating pre-determined delivery rates with the firms, namely by breaking down delivery costs by zones in cities, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the situation, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.  The amount that drivers are paid is determined largely by the distance from a store to the shopper\u2019s home or location. For example, for all deliveries within 5 miles of the pick-up point, the retailer agrees to pay a certain amount. It works similarly for distances of 10 or 15 miles from the store as the pick-up point.  \u201cThat (payment) gets defined ahead of time and that is fixed,\u201d said a source, referring to the company\u2019s agreement with Walmart. The retailer, the source said, then charges the customer a delivery fee.  The strategy helps Walmart avoid paying surge pricing - higher fares when demand for delivery drivers spikes due to rush hour, bad weather or popular meal times - that can dramatically drive up delivery costs.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said speed is a big factor in Walmart\u2019s reliance on the delivery companies, who have existing contracts with drivers and technology to dispatch them on demand. \u201cTo develop that on our own in each market would take us much longer to roll out,\u201d she said.  Walmart\u2019s partnership approach to grocery delivery is in contrast to Amazon Flex, which taps freelance drivers directly as needed, and pays them $18 or more per hour. Amazon is also launching its own branded delivery service for Amazon packages, providing couriers with access to leased Mercedes delivery vans and discounted insurance. Amazon did not respond to request for comment.  By working with partners who hire out drivers \u201con demand\u201d as contractors who can then also earn money from other outlets, Walmart is also able to lower liability risk from labor-related driver lawsuits, which are growing in number around the United States.  Walmart\u2019s Blakeman said the drivers are paid by the delivery, not by the hour, and the all-in average delivery time is 35 minutes. The delivery companies then make decisions about payments to drivers and how they are distributed, she said.  In Georgia and Ohio where these drivers deliver for Walmart as well as local restaurants, Reuters found nearly two dozen drivers take in compensation of less than $11 an hour when they made deliveries for Walmart. And some took in less than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. All but one of the 22 deliveries, Reuters tracked, took over an hour to finish.  In a statement, DoorDash Chief Operating Officer Christopher Payne said a majority of drivers earn over $11 an hour while completing Walmart deliveries and a significant portion of the drivers earn over $15 an hour. Reuters was not independently able to verify the higher end of the hourly pay scale.  Walmart partner Deliv paid drivers by the hour, sources said. Reuters reported earlier this week that Deliv, one of Walmart\u2019s partners in Miami and San Jose, ended the relationship altogether.  LACKING LOYALTY  The risk to Walmart\u2019s new strategy is driver loyalty. None of the drivers in Georgia and Ohio Reuters interviewed said they would commit to handling Walmart deliveries over more lucrative gigs from local restaurants, especially during busy hours.  Garrick Clark, a 44-year-old driver making deliveries for Walmart in Alpharetta, said he would prefer dropping packages for Amazon over delivering groceries for Walmart because Amazon pays $18 to $24 an hour for similar deliveries.  A source with direct knowledge of why the relationship between Walmart and Deliv ended, said delivering large orders over long distances was a hurdle to the tie-up. Walmart charges $7.99 to $9.99 delivery fee on a minimum order size of $30 for online grocery orders, and customers willing to pay for same-day delivery often do not live close to a Walmart store, the person said.  Further, many Walmart\u2019s stores are in low-income neighborhoods which generated fewer online grocery orders for Deliv\u2019s same-day delivery, two sources said.  \u201cTo get drivers to agree to $7 or so to drive 15 miles to deliver 40 items was a big problem. Most drivers were like, \u2018We don\u2019t want to do Walmart anymore,\u2019\u201d one of the sources said.  According to Spend Management Experts, Walmart would have to spend at least $141.76 per employee, per day if it hired them to make deliveries for 8 hours at $11 an hour in Atlanta. The cost analysis, which the firm performed on behalf of Reuters in December, includes what Walmart would pay for fuel, car insurance and car maintenance. But it excludes the cost of employee benefits.  Leonard, the driver here in Alpharetta, said getting a guaranteed minimum wage from delivery companies for the hours he logs would be a big help.  \u201cBut they don\u2019t, and that\u2019s the nature of the beast,\u201d Leonard said.","505":"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc:  * SAYS INTRODUCING WALMART INSURANCE SERVICES  * WALMART INSURANCE SERVICES WILL BEGIN SELLING MEDICARE INSURANCE PLANS DURING THIS YEAR\u2019S ANNUAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD, OCT. 15 THROUGH DEC. 7 Source text: bit.ly\/34u6eiP Further company coverage:","506":"Aug 18 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc posted its biggest-ever growth in online sales on Tuesday as shoppers placed orders for everything from electronics and toys to groceries from the safety of their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

FILE PHOTO: A man holding a phone walks past a sign of Chinese company ByteDance's app TikTok, known locally as Douyin, at the International Artificial Products Expo in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China October 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Stringer  A top ByteDance lawyer conveyed that the Chinese company would agree to terms put forth by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel chaired by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that scrutinizes deals for potential national security risks. U.S. officials are concerned that the personal data of as many as 100 million American TikTok users could be passed on to China\u2019s Communist Party government.  What appeared as a coup clinched by Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N investment banker, did not hold. ByteDance would subsequently announce a deal under which TikTok would remain its subsidiary, contradicting Oracle and Walmart, which said the majority owners would be Americans.  ByteDance\u2019s version of the deal would also defy President Donald Trump\u2019s order last month calling for the Beijing-based company to relinquish ownership of the app in the United States.  Four sources familiar with the frenzied negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained how a preliminary deal for TikTok announced by Trump on Saturday remains in dispute.  With ByteDance and TikTok\u2019s suitors angling for an agreement that both the United States and China can approve, key elements of what would be the social media industry\u2019s biggest-ever deal, potentially worth more than $50 billion, were not spelled out in a comprehensive contract that is typically seen in high-stakes mergers.  Instead, the companies were asked to agree in principle at breakneck speed to a CFIUS 20-page revision, awash in red font with mark-ups, to a proposal that ByteDance had submitted only four days before. If ByteDance did not have a deal by Sunday, the Commerce Department would block downloads and updates to the TikTok app.  Oracle and the Treasury declined to comment. ByteDance and Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  After Trump got assurances from Oracle and Walmart on Friday that they would create 25,000 new jobs at TikTok and a launch an educational initiative for children, he decided to announce the deal himself, without a contract drawn up or a plan for how it could be presented to bring China onboard.  He delayed the announcement until Saturday, following the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  With Trump providing scarce detail, Walmart and Oracle scrambled to issue a statement outlining the key terms of the deal as they understood them. When ByteDance then issued a statement about the deal on Monday, it conflicted with Oracle and Walmart\u2019s statement.  All the sides agree that Oracle would take a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global, a newly-created U.S. company that will house TikTok's Global business and store U.S. user data on its cloud, with Walmart Inc WMT.N taking a 7.5% stake. But the fate of the remaining 80% stake in TikTok Global is in dispute.  ByteDance said it would hold an 80% stake in TikTok Global itself, until it launches an initial public offering in the next twelve months, and that it would then gradually reduce its stake.  Oracle said on Monday that ByteDance would not have a stake in TikTok Global, and that it would be ByteDance\u2019s investors who would be awarded the remaining 80% stake. This is also how some Trump administration officials, and even a top ByteDance investor, have privately described the deal.  This discrepancy could be enough to scuttle the deal. If the Beijing-based company gets to keep a majority stake, it would represent a major reversal for the White House. If ByteDance got no stake in TikTok Global, it would be a blow to China, where officials have been opposed to stripping ByteDance of one of its most prized assets.  \u201cThe divergent messages from ByteDance and Oracle reflect the difficulty of trying to thread the needle of pleasing Washington and Beijing, if that is a needle that even exists,\u201d said John Kabealo, a regulatory lawyer not involved in the discussions.  SUNDAY DEADLINE  It remains unclear whether the conflicting descriptions of the deal, which still requires further CFIUS review, are the result of ambiguity in the terms or a push by ByteDance to alleviate Chinese concerns about caving in to U.S. pressure.  One way Oracle and ByteDance had tried to minimize differences over TikTok Global\u2019s ownership is by stressing that the new company will be majority American-owned. About 41% of ByteDance\u2019s current investors are from the United States. By counting indirect U.S. ownership alongside Oracle and Walmart\u2019s direct ownership, ByteDance could claim that TikTok Global would be majority American, even if the Chinese firm owns an 80% stake.  The clock is ticking for the companies to come to terms. The Commerce Department has extended until Sunday its deadline for the companies to finalize a deal before TikTok is banned from app stores in the United States. A deal is unlikely by then, and the companies may ask for a new extension, two of the sources said.  Ownership of TikTok Global is not the only issue that has to be ironed out. While CFIUS has approved a broad plan on how Oracle will store U.S. user data and inspect TikTok\u2019s source code, details such as precise protocols for security fixes have yet to be hammered out.

REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Walmart is late to the hot new trend of subscription-based shopping, but that isn\u2019t such a bad thing. In September, the U.S. retailer launched a membership model akin to Amazon.com\u2019s Prime. Like Walt Disney\u2019s streaming service, which is quickly catching up to Netflix, Walmart may have the advantage of being able to ride on a more innovative rival\u2019s coattails.  The $432 billion company said on Tuesday that U.S. e-commerce sales for the three-month period ending Oct. 31 rose 79% year-over-year, as customers piled up on groceries and electronics. Americans also spent 24% more per transaction, on average. During the quarter, the company led by Doug McMillon launched Walmart Plus for $98 a year, cheaper than Amazon\u2019s annual fee of $119. Customers receive unlimited free delivery when they spend $35 or more. They also get fuel discounts and fast-lane checkouts in the store.  Cowen analysts reckon that Walmart Plus has attracted some 10 million households in the two months or so since the rollout, representing more than $140 million in equity value. That makes it a minnow compared with Amazon, which boasts around 82 million Prime-using households, according to Morgan Stanley forecasts.  Walmart can turn this to its advantage. For one thing, Amazon has accustomed consumers to shelling out monthly fees for fringe benefits, and piling their shopping carts high enough to qualify for free delivery. Amazon has also opened the eyes of investors who appreciate the value in the service, too. In the last three months Walmart\u2019s stock has increased 12% while the S&P 500 Index is up 7%.  Walmart is in a prime spot. While the pandemic has boosted e-commerce sales, its gigantic physical footprint allows it to offer curbside pickup. Amazon\u2019s third-quarter shipping costs rose 57% year-over-year but Walmart\u2019s equivalent costs ought to grow more slowly if it doesn\u2019t need to ship everything to the customer\u2019s door.  Disney is an example of why second needn\u2019t mean second-best. The Magic Kingdom introduced Disney+ last November, 12 years after Netflix started streaming movies and TV series. Disney has amassed an impressive 73 million customers, more than a third of Netflix\u2019s total. So long as customers are prepared to pay for more than one service, following the leader can be a smart strategy.","515":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge said Walmart Inc, Target Corp and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc must face a lawsuit claiming they sold linens that were falsely labeled \u201c100% Egyptian Cotton\u201d or \u201c100% Long-Staple Egyptian cotton\u201d despite being suspicious of their origin.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Monday\u2019s decision by U.S. District Judge Vincent Briccetti in White Plains, New York, addressed claims that consumers nationwide overpaid for mislabeled cotton produced by an Indian textile company, Welspun India Ltd.

In a 39-page decision, Briccetti said consumers may pursue breach of warranty and negligent misrepresentation claims against the retailers and a U.S. unit of Welspun, and fraud claims against the Welspun unit.  He dismissed fraud claims against the retailers because there was no \u201cstrong inference of fraudulent intent.\u201d New York and California consumers were allowed to sue the retailers under their respective states\u2019 consumer protection laws.  A lawyer for Welspun and Bed Bath & Beyond declined to comment. Walmart, Target and their respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The consumers\u2019 lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.  According to the complaint, the retailers sold Welspun\u2019s \u201cEgyptian\u201d cotton well into 2016 even though Target and Bed Bath & Beyond had known for several months, and Walmart had known as early as 2008, that the cotton was mislabeled.  The cotton was sold under the Fieldcrest, Royal Velvet, Better Homes and Gardens, Canopy, Crowning Touch and Perfect Touch brands, court papers show.  Target severed its ties to Welspun in August 2016, and Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond stopped selling the linens in question later that year.  The litigation combined several lawsuits.

The company said it had ended its partnership with Bossa Nova Robotics Inc, who it had worked with for five years to improve customer experience by using robots to assist shop staff and make their jobs easier.  \u201cThis was one idea we tried in roughly 500 stores just as we are trying other ideas in additional stores,\u201d Walmart said in a statement.  Walmart added it would continue to test new technologies and invest in its own processes and apps to track inventory and help move products to shelves as quickly as possible.  The supermarket chain began rolling out shelf-scanning robots in 2017 to replenish inventory faster and save employees\u2019 time when products run out, as a part of its broader effort to digitize its stores to make shopping faster as it competes with Amazon.com Inc.  Walmart, which posted record online sales in its recent quarter, now has more workers walking the aisles to package online orders, extracting new data on inventory problems, people familiar with the situation told the Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report this news.

The U.S.-only promotion, effective from Nov. 5, waives the $25 minimum that customers outside Amazon\u2019s Prime loyalty club must hit for free shipping. The deal lasts until Amazon can no longer promise items in time for Christmas with free delivery, which typically takes five to eight business days.  The company\u2019s shares fell more than 3 percent following the announcement. One analyst, Colin Sebastian of Baird Equity Research, said the offer could shave 5 percent to 6 percent off Amazon\u2019s operating profit this quarter.  Still, the news could help Amazon win more sales. That is important for the world\u2019s largest online retailer since a revenue slowdown it forecast last month spooked some investors and sent its stock tumbling. The current quarter typically is Amazon\u2019s biggest.  Amazon cut its order minimum for free shipping to $25 from $35 indefinitely in May 2017.  Monday's news will add to pressure on Walmart and Target Corp TGT.N, which in recent years have chipped away at Amazon's lead with their own offers of free two-day shipping. While Walmart has maintained its $35 order threshold this holiday, Target has scrapped its minimum until Dec. 22.  Shares of Walmart and Target rose about 1 percent each on Monday.  \u201cThey\u2019re forcing Amazon to react,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. \u201cThat\u2019s what today\u2019s price action tells you.\u201d  Just over half of all U.S. households have a Prime subscription, analysts estimate. Prime remains the cornerstone of Amazon\u2019s business because shoppers buy more from the retailer once they pay $119 for the year-long membership. Perks include same-day shipping and video streaming.  Amazon is now courting those outside the club, hoping its brand and wider selection will set it apart. Free shipping can apply to hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, versus hundreds of thousands on Target. Target, however, promises to deliver the items more quickly.  Amazon last month touted improvements in efficiency, which could help it offset costs from more free deliveries. According to the Seattle company\u2019s latest annual filing, shipping costs nearly doubled from 2015 to 2017, reaching $21.7 billion.","524":"MIAMI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co, Walmart Inc and delivery service Postmates Inc will collaborate to design a service for delivering groceries and other goods to Walmart customers that could someday use autonomous vehicles, the companies said on Wednesday.  The project is the latest to grow out of Ford\u2019s broader effort to develop businesses that could use automated delivery vehicles. Ford was working with San Francisco-based Postmates already to develop delivery services that could employ automated vehicles.  The Walmart pilot initially will use human-driven vehicles operated to simulate how a self-driving vehicle would behave, Ford said. Ford has said it expects to launch commercial production of automated vehicles by 2021.  Ford and its partners are using Miami as a testing ground for automated delivery service ideas and automated vehicle technology.  The new pilot project will offer customers delivery by Postmates of goods ordered at Walmart stores. Brian Wolf, an executive of Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicle unit, wrote in a blog post that the companies will work over the next \u201ccouple of months\u201d to figure out what goods can be delivered successfully, especially perishable groceries.  That could require new designs or equipment for vehicles, Wolf wrote. Among the challenges Ford has said it is working on is designing on-board storage systems that are easy for customers to open to retrieve a pizza or a package.  Postmates, according to its website, operates in 385 U.S. cities, as well as Mexico. It offers delivery from brick-and-mortar restaurants and stores.  Walmart is competing with online retailer Amazon.com and other rivals to cut the cost of delivering goods over what industry executives call \u201cthe last mile\u201d to customers who order online.  Replacing human delivery van drivers with robotic systems could reduce last-mile delivery costs. But the technology is still expensive, and the industry is still waiting for regulations that could help protect automated vehicle owners or manufacturers from liability claims.  Ford has emphasized commercial uses of autonomous vehicle technology, such as goods delivery, in contrast to rival General Motors Co, which is working to build a robot taxi service at its GM Cruise unit.  Ford is in discussions with German automaker Volkswagen AG about a possible investment in its self-driving vehicle unit, people familiar with the situation said. No deal has been announced.  In July, Ford said it would create a new business unit, Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, to house its self-driving vehicle operations. The automaker said it would invest a total of $4 billion in the unit through 2023.

In the wake of nationwide protests in the U.S. against police brutality and racial inequality following the death of African American George Floyd last month, several companies have issued statements in support of the black community and set up funds to fight systemic racism.  The change in policy at both companies comes after a Walmart customer complained the practice of locking up items that cater to people of color was discriminatory.  \u201cWe have a firm-nondiscrimination policy that applies to all aspects of our business and our product protection measures have never been based on the race or ethnicity of our customers,\u201d CVS said in an emailed statement on Friday.  The drugstore chain said it had expanded its selection of products in its textured hair and color cosmetics categories by 35% over the past year to add new brands that appeal to communities of color.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Walmart is shown on one of its stores in Encinitas, California April 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Years of public pressure led Walmart, the largest U.S arms retailer, to end assault rifle sales in 2015 and in 2018 to raise the minimum age for gun purchases to 21. Some gun control activists and Walmart customers now want the retailer to drop sales of guns and ammunition altogether.  The weekend shooting in Texas unfolded at a popular Walmart store in the border city of El Paso, killing 22 people. In the other weekend mass shooting, in Dayton, Ohio, a gunman killed nine people.  Many people took to social media to post about the deadly shooting using the hashtags #walmartshooting,\u201d \u201c#boycottwalmart,\u201d and \u201c#guncontrolnow.\u201d  Guns Down America, an advocacy group that runs campaigns for gun control, began a petition to urge more change at Walmart late on Monday.  The petition calls on Walmart to stop selling firearms, pledge it will no longer make contributions to lawmakers who take money from gun rights lobby the National Rifle Association, and fund gun buybacks. It also pushes Walmart to use its political influence to advocate for legislative changes to raise the standards for gun ownership in America.  \u201cFederal legislative change will take time, but more and more Americans are dying every day,\u201d Igor Volsky, founder and executive director of Guns Down America, told Reuters. \u201cThe El Paso shooting happened in their store, they have a responsibility to go further.\u201d  It is not the first time that gun-control advocates have signed a petition calling on Walmart to take action. In early 2013, just one month after a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut, shot dead 20 first-graders and six adults at an elementary school, nearly 300,000 people signed a petition urging Walmart to stop selling assault weapons.  It was another two years before Walmart ended such sales.  \u201cA REASON TO BOYCOTT WALMART\u201d  Other gun control activists such as Texas Gun Sense President Ed Scruggs said Walmart, whose stores act as de facto community centers in rural America, could do more to educate children and teenagers on gun safety.  A group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America said it has been asking Walmart to stop letting shoppers walk into its stores with guns - even where doing so is permitted by law. Target and Starbucks have policies asking shoppers not to carry firearms in their stores.  On Twitter, one Florida-based user said Walmart needs more security. Another user, from Irvine, California, said Walmart\u2019s statement outlining that it would not change its gun policies in the wake of the two shootings over the weekend was \u201cshocking.\u201d  \u201cIf this isn\u2019t a reason to boycott Walmart, I don\u2019t know what is!\u201d the user tweeted.  Some celebrities also demanded more action from the retailer.  \u201cHey @Walmart! This would be a great opportunity for you to take a true leadership position and stop selling guns,\u201d actress Alyssa Milano said in response to a Walmart company tweet saying it was \u201cin shock\u201d over the tragic events in Texas.  For now, Walmart\u2019s policies remain unchanged.  A Walmart spokesman on Monday told Reuters the retailer has not made any change in its firearms sales policy after the mass shootings and that it has not issued a directive to any stores around the country to change policy.  \u201cOur focus has always been on being a responsible seller of firearms,\u201d spokesman Randy Hargrove said. \u201cWe go beyond federal law, requiring all customers to pass a background check before purchasing any firearm.\u201d  The retailer\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, offered his support to the community of El Paso and reached out to employees via Instagram on Sunday. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m sending a note like this twice in one week,\u201d he said, referring to an earlier message he sent after two employees were shot by a co-worker in a store in Mississippi.  Walmart\u2019s gun safety policies are more restrictive than many retailers\u2019 even as it trails some of its rivals.  Walmart rivals like Kroger-owned Fred Meyer stopped selling guns and ammunition in 2018 and the same year, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods ended the sale of assault weapons and raised the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases.  In March 2019, Dick\u2019s also said it would pull guns and ammunition off the shelves of 125 of its 720 store, a decision the company said it took because its gun sales were down due to competition from dedicated gun and hunting stores.  That same month, in a call to discuss earnings, the company\u2019s chief executive, Ed Stack, said lower sales during the quarter were partly driven by lower demand for \u201canything associated with hunting,\u201d including guns, ammunition, firearm accessories and hunting apparel.  Despite such measures from the larger chains, the sale of guns and assault-style weapons continues unabated.  Outdoor goods chains including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Outdoors and Academy Sports continue to sell assault-style rifles. A proliferation of online retailers like AIM Surplus, Armslist and Brownells also sell firearms that can be easily procured.  Armslist called the shootings \u201chorrific\u201d and said in a statement it is a service that does not directly sell guns, but carries ads and listing for private sales. The other companies did not respond to a request for comment.","528":"Walmart Stores Inc has asked a federal judge to toss out the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\u2019s bid to hold the company in contempt for refusing to comply with what the retailer says is an overly broad discovery request in a lawsuit accusing it of pregnancy discrimination.

The National Association of Trade and Home Offices, which holds 121 collective contracts across 10 states with Wal Mart de Mexico, or Walmex, said it was seeking a 20 percent salary hike over 2018 wage levels for the 8,000 workers it represents.  Mexico raised the daily minimum wage last month by 16 percent under new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to improve wages as well as fight poverty and deep-seated inequality in the country.  The union also aims to establish a first-ever sales commission for clerks, to be set at 4 percent.  It also alleged that employees were not properly compensated for working overtime and that some staff suffered abuses including sexual harassment from superiors.  Walmex, Mexico\u2019s biggest retailer, said it saw the dialogue as positive when asked by Reuters for comment on the demands.  A spokeswoman for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations of abuse.  Mexico\u2019s conciliation and arbitration board is overseeing the talks, which have a March 5 deadline, said Eduardo Miranda, a spokesman for the union\u2019s umbrella organization, CROC.  Walmex has not yet presented a salary proposal during its three meetings with the union over the past month, he added, increasing the possibility of a strike.  The retailer has some 237,055 employees in Mexico and Central America, about 200,000 of whom are in Mexico, Miranda said.  Those represented by the National Association of Trade and Home Offices include janitors, cashiers, pharmacy clerks and warehouse workers.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, on Tuesday said it had dropped Alibaba-linked Alipay in all its stores in the western region of the country, after agreeing a tie-up with Tencent to use its popular WeChat payment system.  The move underscores how China\u2019s retail market is dividing into two camps around Alibaba and Tencent, tech behemoths worth a combined $1 trillion who are shaking up the online and offline retail market.  The two firms, who have spent billions of dollars on retail deals since the start of last year, dominate the country\u2019s third-party mobile payment market. Alibaba-linked Alipay leads the field, with Tencent\u2019s WeChat Pay catching up fast.  Chinese consumers - and retailers - often have both Alipay and WeChat, which can be used to pay for shopping online or in physical stores by scanning QR codes with a smartphone.  Alibaba is China\u2019s top e-commerce player, while Tencent is strong in social media and gaming and has - along with Walmart - a major stake in number two online retailer JD.com Inc.  A Walmart spokeswoman said the firm had entered into a \u201cpartnership\u201d with WeChat Pay in western China, which was a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d to improve customer experience.  The Western China region is a large area including provinces like Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu. It is, however, more sparsely populated than the wealthier eastern part of the country.  \u201cIn the future, Walmart will cooperate with more partners to provide payment solutions with more convenience and benefits,\u201d she said in emailed comments, adding the firm accepted payment methods including cash, cards and mobile payments.  Tencent said it welcomed Walmart\u2019s decision and would push forward with plans to help support vendors with digital tools in the \u201csmart retail\u201d arena.  Alibaba and Alipay declined to comment.  The Walmart move comes after Tencent and Alibaba have between them splashed over $10 billion on retail-focused deals, boosting their reach offline and meaning few brick-and-mortar sellers are left without an allegiance to one or the other.","531":"BENGALURU, July 14 (Reuters) - U.S. retail giant Walmart will lead a $1.2 billion investment in its Indian e-commerce unit Flipkart, giving it a valuation of $24.9 billion, Flipkart said on Tuesday.

Walmart acquired Jet for $3.3 billion in August 2016, a deal that was widely considered a watershed moment for its then-struggling e-commerce operation as it got access to both technology and talent through Jet founder Lore and his team.  Walmart\u2019s e-commerce success has been erratic. Online sales increased 23 percent in the most recent quarter, less than half the rate of growth in each of the previous three quarters. Walmart\u2019s stock got walloped after the news.  Belsham's hiring comes amid fierce competition in the grocery sector. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O purchased Whole Foods Market for $13.4 billion last year, and rivals like Target Corp TGT.N, Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O and Kroger Co KR.N are joining the costly battle for customers who want groceries without leaving their couches.  Walmart is aggressively ramping up its online grocery business. It has said it will expand home delivery service to more than 100 U.S. cities and offer curbside grocery pickup at 2,200 stores by the end of the year.  Jet\u2019s focus on groceries is likely to help Walmart win with urban millennial customers - Jet\u2019s key demographic.  \u201cWith Jet grocery being an integral part of the strategy, Simon brings incredible experience in scaling grocery delivery and his unique background in converging technology and retail,\u201d Lore said in the email.  Belsham spent seven years at Tesco TSCO.L, building up its online grocery operation for Britain and 10 markets across central Europe and Asia. He also developed a general merchandise platform for Ocado, a UK-based web retailer that sells groceries.  Most recently, Belsham worked as chief executive officer of venture-backed Notonthehighstreet.com, according to the email.  He will succeed Liza Landsman, who left the company in March, a little more than a year after she was promoted to the job. Belsham will start on March 26, report to Lore and be based at Jet\u2019s New Jersey headquarters, according to the email.  Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on a Feb. 20 earnings conference call the online retailer will not grow as quickly as it did in the early days but will be well-positioned in select markets.  Belsham will also need to ensure that Jet is differentiated from the parent brand and offer shoppers specialty goods that cannot be bought elsewhere - a strategy on which Lore has focused in the past year.  Belsham said in a statement he has long admired the founders of both Walmart and Jet.  \u201cIn my view, there is no business better positioned to take advantage of the opportunity ahead than the combination of Walmart and Jet,\u201d Belsham said.","536":"FILE PHOTO: The Wal-Mart company logo is seen outside a Wal-Mart Stores Inc company distribution center in Bentonville, Arkansas June 6, 2013.

The company expects demand for its layaway program to be similar to that of previous years, said Anne Marie Kehoe, vice president of toys, while at an event in New York to reveal the retailer\u2019s top toys for the holidays. Layaway plans can have a sizeable impact on sales and past analyst estimates suggest the program accounted for as much as 15 percent of holiday revenue at Walmart stores in poorer areas of the United States.  Walmart added 30 percent more new toys to its stores and expanded its online selection by 40 percent, including some toys that are exclusive to the retailer, such as the DC Comics Justice League Batmobile.

Walmart\u2019s fiscal year ends in January.  The initiative is Walmart\u2019s latest attempt to tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the \u201clast mile\u201d of delivering goods to online customers.  In March, Walmart said it would offer home delivery of groceries in 100 U.S. cities covering 40 percent of U.S. households by the end of 2018. It has since tied up with several small delivery companies like DoorDash and Postmates, which offer gig-style jobs to workers.  Walmart's aggressive expansion into home delivery follows Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, which spurred several traditional retailers to push such services fearing increased competition.","540":"Aug 27 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc is partnering with Microsoft Corp in the software maker\u2019s bid to buy Bytedance-owned TikTok, CNBC reported on Thursday.

Shares in the world's top brick-and-mortar retailer rose as much as 3.4% on Tuesday and are up about 7% so far this year, outpacing Wall Street's blue chip index .DJI, which is down nearly 14% for the year.  Walmart, like many other essential businesses, has seen a surge in demand late in March and early in April, with consumers limiting their trips to the grocers under \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders but stockpiling staples.  The retailer said that though demand for toilet paper, surface cleaners and groceries tapered off after initial hoarding, government relief payments helped boost sales in the second half of April.  \u201cToward the end of the quarter, another phase emerged, call it relief spending,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon told analysts. He said sales have risen for categories for products needed for DIY projects, such as bandanas and sewing machines, while bicycles were also in greater demand.  Walmart executives said the stimulus checks have helped deliver a good start to the second quarter, but they did not expect spending to continue at the same pace.  The company offered little insight beyond that and pulled its forecast for the full year, citing uncertainty caused by the pandemic.  Walmart\u2019s online business grew 74% in the first quarter ended April 30, as its investments in store pick-up and delivery paid off at the time when demand for such services soared. That drove their sales volumes to records, with the number of new customers rising four times since mid-March.  Walmart said uncertainty brought by the coronavirus called for prudence in its investments and cost savings. As part of that the group would discontinue Jet.com, the online start-up it bought in 2016 for $3.3 billion.  The business was undergoing an overhaul last year by integrating its retail, technology, marketing, analytics and product teams with Walmart\u2019s own online business.  Walmart said the strength of its own online operation made it decide to part with business.  Overall, sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 10%, excluding fuel, in the quarter. Analysts had expected a gain of 8.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Total revenue rose 8.6% to $134.6 billion, also beating analysts\u2019 estimates.  Responding to a surge in demand, the group has been ramping up hiring, adding about 235,000 hourly workers so far to its 1.5-million strong U.S. workforce, temporarily increasing wages and spending more on the maintenance of its stores and fulfillment centers. It said additional costs related to the pandemic reached nearly $900 million.  That pushed operating margins down 62 basis points to 20.5% in the quarter, but operating income still rose 5.6% to $5.22 billion in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share at $1.18, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.12.

REUTERS\/Jose Cabezas\/File Photo  The EEOC, which enforces federal laws banning discrimination in the workplace, said Walmart\u2019s distribution center in Menomonie, Wisconsin, has discriminated against pregnant employees since 2014. Federal law requires employers to accommodate workers\u2019 pregnancies in the same way as physical disabilities.  Arkansas-based Walmart is the largest retailer and private employer in the United States.  Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove in a statement on Friday said the company does not tolerate discrimination.  \u201cOur accommodations policy has been updated a number of times over the last several years and our policies have always fully met or exceeded both state and federal law,\u201d he said.  Walmart is also facing class action lawsuits in Illinois and New York accusing it of denying accommodations to thousands of pregnant workers at its retail stores. In March, a federal judge in Illinois denied Walmart\u2019s bid to dismiss the claims. The New York case is pending.  Walmart denied the claims in both lawsuits and said its anti-discrimination policy has long listed pregnancy as a protected status.  Friday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Wisconsin, stems from a complaint filed by Alyssa Gilliam, an employee at the Walmart warehouse in Menomonie.  The EEOC in the lawsuit said Gilliam became pregnant in 2015, and Walmart denied her requests for restrictions on heavy lifting, additional breaks, and a chair to use while working.  The commission said Walmart refused similar requests by other pregnant workers at the warehouse, but granted them for workers with disabilities or injuries.  The federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act prohibits workplace discrimination against pregnant women. In a 2015 decision involving United Parcel Service Inc, the U.S. Supreme Court said the law requires employers to provide the same accommodations to pregnant women as it does disabled workers.  Since the Supreme Court ruling, workers have filed pregnancy discrimination lawsuits against several large companies, including Merck & Co Inc, Amazon.com Inc unit Whole Foods, Novartis AG, and AT&T Inc\u2019s mobile phone subsidiary.","546":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BEIJING\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Dada-JD Daojia, a Chinese online grocery and delivery firm, said on Thursday it has raised $500 million from Walmart Inc and JD.com Inc in its latest round of financing.

Dada operates a network of 5 million delivery men, while JD Daojia partners with retail stores and provides one-hour delivery services of groceries and other items.  Walmart said it invested about $320 million in the latest fundraising. The Arkansas-based company\u2019s partnership with Dada-JD Daojia dates back to 2016 when it invested $50 million, the company said, adding that at present, 200 Walmart stores in 30 major Chinese cities have a presence in JD Daojia.  \u201cWe are confident that this deeper collaboration with Dada-JD Daojia will enhance our omni-channel footprint and deliver a better O2O (online to offline) customer experience,\u201d said Wern-Yuen Tan, president and CEO for Walmart China.

The stores are competing with Alibaba\u2019s Hema to provide fast delivery of grocery to customers.  Alibaba is China\u2019s top e-commerce player, while Tencent is strong in social media and gaming and has, along with Walmart, a considerable stake in number two online retailer JD.com.

Nuala O\u2019Connor, senior vice president and chief counsel of digital citizenship at Walmart, said privacy legislation focused on a particular industry - referring to the U.S. tech sector - must be carefully crafted to avoid unintended effects on retail.  Walmart said it collects myriad different forms of customer data including personal information provided directly by consumers, personal information provided by third parties, purchase history, healthcare data, browsing information, device information and location data.

Earlier this week, a draft consumer privacy bill from Republican U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the Commerce Committee, proposed nationwide rules for handling of personal information online and elsewhere that would override state laws.  That followed a privacy bill introduced by the top Democrat on the committee, Maria Cantwell.  A U.S. online privacy bill is not likely to come before Congress this year, Reuters reported in September, as lawmakers disagree over several issues.

Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer by sales, bought about 77% of home-grown Flipkart for roughly $16 billion in 2018, the biggest deal in India\u2019s e-commerce sector where it competes with U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc\u2019s local business.  \u201cAs we invested we did mention that our plan is to IPO and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon told Indian newspaper Hindustan Times\u2019 Leadership Summit.  Flipkart, based in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru, is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) overseas as early as 2021, which could value the firm at up to $50 billion, Reuters has reported previously.  McMillon declined to give details but said both Flipkart and PhonePe could diversify in a number of ways, including IPOs.  \u201cFlipkart and PhonePe both need funding, they\u2019re both growing so quickly. There\u2019s lots of room to invest and we\u2019re excited about being a majority investor, but there is room for other people,\u201d McMillon said.  Flipkart\u2019s other investors include China\u2019s tech giant Tencent, U.S. investment firm Tiger Global and U.S. venture capital firm Accel.  PhonePe last week said it would sell a stake to existing investors for $700 million in a bid to help it fuel growth in a crowded fintech market where it competes with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Alibaba-backed Paytm.  On Thursday, Walmart, which is based in Bentonville, Arkansas, also said it would triple its exports of Indian-made goods to $10 billion annually by 2027.  It said the company\u2019s commitment to more sourcing from India will include helping develop hundreds of new suppliers in sectors such as food, pharmaceuticals, consumables and apparel.  India is already among Walmart\u2019s top sourcing markets for products such as jewellery and homeware, with annual exports of about $3 billion.

McMillon comments come as retailers are preparing for an increase in prices after the Trump tariffs on imports from China.  Walmart will change sourcing bases on products when possible, he said.  \u201cWhere we can change sourcing, whether it\u2019s Mexico, it\u2019s China, we will but where we can\u2019t we just have to deal with it and find places where we can cut costs in the near term,\u201d he said.  McMillon did not give details on how much Walmart procures from China or Mexico.  On Thursday, Walmart U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran told Reuters the impact from tariffs on imports from Mexico will be \u201csignificant\u201d for Walmart. He declined to share additional details.  HOPING FOR RESOLUTION WITH CHINA  Walmart also said it hopes the United States and China find a way to work together. It is in the best U.S. interest to do so because China offers a \u201ctremendous business opportunity,\u201d McMillon said.  Last month the retailer said prices would rise for shoppers due to tariffs on Chinese imports.  \u201cTrade overall has been good for Americans, good for consumers ... and I realize it gets criticized at times,\u201d said McMillon, urging a focus on how trade helps a broad number of people in the country and \u201cnot just those it harms.\u201d  Walmart has spent time talking to both governments and is trying to encourage things to work out \u201cin ways we can but we don\u2019t control that,\u201d he added.

Shares of Walmart fell 3 percent. The company warned it expects the deal to reduce fiscal 2019 earnings by 25-30 cents per share if it closes in the second quarter. It also expects Indian investments to shave 60 cents per share from earnings in fiscal 2020.  Walmart\u2019s acquisition opens a new front in its battle with Amazon, which had expressed interest in making a competing offer. Amazon holds about 27 percent of India\u2019s burgeoning e-commerce market, according to Euromonitor, where Walmart only operates 21 cash-and-carry wholesale stores in the country that sell to businesses.  The deal probably will not do much to change market share between Flipkart and Amazon in India, said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group. In the fiscal year ended March 31, Flipkart reported sales of $4.6 billion.  Flipkart sells consumer goods ranging from soaps to smartphones and clothes, and gives Walmart access to an e-commerce market that could be worth $200 billion a year within a decade, according to Morgan Stanley.  Walmart expects the deal to help set it up \u201cfor growth and profits in the future,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a call with investors. McMillon has led Walmart\u2019s efforts to boost international business.  Walmart said Flipkart\u2019s logistics, payments and apparel businesses offer new areas of growth.  \u201cIt is not so much about succeeding in India for Walmart because that may or may not happen,\u201d said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. \u201cIt is really about grabbing an opportunity after waiting on the sidelines in a growth market for over a decade,\u201d he said.  Walmart entered the Indian market in 2007 through a joint venture with a local company, years before Amazon debuted there. That joint venture was called off in 2013 and its presence in India has remained largely static, at least partly due to restrictions around foreign investment in physical retail.  FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS  Walmart has renewed its focus on catching up with rivals in key international markets.  The company retreated from Britain, selling a controlling stake in its British arm ASDA to J Sainsbury Plc SBRY.L. Walmart is also trying to offload a majority stake in its Brazilian operations to private equity firm Advent International.  International business contributed less than a quarter to the retailer\u2019s total revenue of $500 billion in fiscal 2018.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen on the company's office in Bengaluru, India April 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  Walmart said it plans to fund the India deal through a combination of newly-issued debt and cash on hand. The investment will include $2 billion of new equity funding.  Walmart said it remains in talks with other potential investors to join the funding round. This could lower its stake although Walmart plans to retain majority control. Reuters has reported Google-parent Alphabet GOOGL.O may buy a roughly 15 percent stake in Flipkart for $3 billion.  The remainder will be held by existing shareholders, including Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal, China's Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK, Tiger Global Management and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, the company said.  The Walmart statement made no reference to the exit of Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal or SoftBank Group 9984.T, which was one of the largest investors in Flipkart through its Vision Fund. Reuters had reported that Bansal and SoftBank would sell their entire stakes.  Other investors like Naspers and eBay said they sold their holdings in Flipkart.  S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook for Walmart to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable,\u201d citing risk as the retailer spends heavily to expand its online and global reach. Walmart\u2019s long-term corporate credit rating was affirmed at \u201cAA,\u201d S&P said.  \u201cWalmart has a very poor track record operating outside North America,\u201d said Steven Roorda, portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors, which invests in retailers. \u201cWe will not know for five to 10 years whether this transaction is successful strategically or financially.\u201d","563":"LONDON (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of Walmart WMT.N reported a 2.6 percent rise in quarterly underlying sales, showing its recovery was gaining speed ahead of an expected takeover by bigger rival Sainsbury's SBRY.L.

Removing the impact of Easter which this year benefited the first quarter, they grew 2.6 percent.  That compared to sales growth adjusted for Easter of 1.0 percent in the first quarter.  Asda said that its second quarter performance was boosted by new shoppers, stronger online sales and the launch of new products such as vegan falafal burgers and a gin range with flavors such as rhubarb and ginger.  The strong performance chimed with data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel which showed the recent turnaround of Asda\u2019s fortunes.  It emerged as the best performer in terms of sales growth of the big four supermarkets over the 12 weeks to July 15, the first time it has done so since December 2014.  \u201cWe remain focussed on delivering our strategic priorities and investing in the areas that matter most to our customers - innovation in our own brand, lowering prices and in continuously improving our shopping experience both in store and online,\u201d Asda president and chief executive Roger Burnley said.

Apollo did not respond to a request for comment, while the Issa brothers could not be reached for comment.  The drop in Asda\u2019s valuation from the proposed Sainsbury\u2019s deal is likely to be because of the integration benefits that a merged Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda would have delivered.

FILE PHOTO: The logos of Walmart and Seiyu are pictured at the headquarters office in Tokyo, Japan July 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  The deal, which values Seiyu at 172.5 billion yen ($1.65 billion), comes after on-off speculation about the U.S. retail giant looking to exit Japan. It is well below the 300-500 billion yen it reportedly sought a few years ago.  KKR will buy 65% of Seiyu while Rakuten, which already has an online venture with the chain, will acquire a 20% stake. Walmart will retain 15%, the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.  The world\u2019s biggest retailer first entered the Japanese market in 2002 by buying a 6% stake in Seiyu, and gradually built up its stake before a full takeover in 2008.  But it has struggled in Japan, like other foreign entrants such as Tesco PLC TSCO.L and Carrefour SA CARR.PA who were lured by the high spending power of Japanese consumers but were frustrated by tough competition.  Some analysts said Walmart, while failing to make much money in Japan, had done better than other foreign retailers considering it saved money-losing Seiyu from bankruptcy by cutting costs and improving private brand sales.  \u201cWalmart was always going to struggle, because they had to turn around the business and also they needed to grow volume to really have a viable share in the Japanese market and the only way to do that was through more acquisitions, which it wasn\u2019t willing to spend money on,\u201d said Roy Larke who specialises in Japan\u2019s retail industry at JapaneseConsuming.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Walmart said it expects a non-cash loss of about $2 billion after tax in its fourth fiscal quarter due to the sale.  LATEST DIVESTITURE  The Seiyu deal is the latest divestiture of underperforming assets by Walmart, following its exits in Britain and Argentina, as it struggled to compete with nimble local rivals. In Asia, it pulled out of South Korea in 2006 and shifted focus in China to expanding members-only warehouse chain Sam's Club as competition from online marketplaces such as Alibaba BABA.N intensified. Walmart is expanding in India, though, with its $16 billion purchase of ecommerce provider Flipkart.  Japanese media reported two years ago that Walmart was seeking to sell Seiyu, which operates around 330 supermarkets, for around 300 billion to 500 billion yen. Sources said at the time that potential buyers balked at the price.  Addressing reports that it was looking to leave Japan, Walmart announced last year that it aimed to list Seiyu and retain a majority stake in the business.  But Monday\u2019s announcement also comes as Seiyu is starting to show signs of improvement, with its relatively early start in e-commerce finally yielding results, helped by a 2018 partnership with Rakuten.  Walmart Japan, mainly the Seiyu business, booked a net profit of 47 million yen in 2019 after reporting losses in most previous years. Seiyu told Reuters earlier this year that the coronavirus pandemic had bolstered interest in online grocery shopping in Japan.  Large Japanese supermarkets such as Aeon Co Ltd 8267.T and Seven & I Holdings Co Ltd's 3382.T Ito-Yokado have been stepping up their investments in e-commerce as Japanese consumers, long wary of buying fresh fish and produce online, are starting to use online grocery services.  For Rakuten, the deal with Seiyu helps it fight back against rival Amazon AMZN.O, which recently stepped up its online grocery business by tying up with supermarket chain Life Corp 8194.T.  \u201cWe look forward to accelerating digital transformation of Seiyu brick and mortar retail, and further merging the best of offline and online retail,\u201d Kazunori Takeda, Rakuten\u2019s group executive vice president, said in a statement.","568":"(Reuters) - Walmart Inc on Tuesday sued Tesla Inc, accusing it of \u201cwidespread negligence\u201d that led to repeated fires of its solar systems and asking a court to force Tesla to remove solar panels from more than 240 of its U.S. stores.  FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., November 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski  Solar energy systems installed and maintained by the electric car maker were responsible for fires at seven locations, with dozens showing hazardous problems such as loose wiring and \u201chot spots\u201d on panels, according to court papers filed in New York State Supreme Court.  Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  The lawsuit accuses Tesla of having untrained workers putting up shoddy installations and showing \u201cutter incompetence or callousness, or both,\u201d court papers said.  The lawsuit is the latest blow to Tesla\u2019s struggling solar business, which it acquired through its $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity in 2016. Quarterly installations have plummeted more than 85 percent since the deal, as Tesla has cut its solar panel sales force and ended a distribution deal with Home Depot Inc .  The fires destroyed significant amounts of store merchandise and required substantial repairs, totaling millions of dollars in losses, Walmart said in the lawsuit.  In addition, inspections of the retailer\u2019s other Tesla-owned solar installations \u201cdisplayed troubling problems that were indicative of widespread negligence,\u201d the lawsuit said.  As of November 2018, at least seven Walmart stores, including in Denton, Maryland and Beavercreek, Ohio, had experienced fires due to Tesla\u2019s solar systems, according to the lawsuit. One of the fires happened months after the system was de-energized, Walmart said.  The suit argues that inadequate inspections by Tesla have created a safety hazard for Walmart customers and employees.  \u2018MONEY PRINTER ON YOUR ROOF\u2019  Walmart became a SolarCity customer in 2010 and over the next six years fitted 244 of its store rooftops with panels in a bid to improve its image as an environmentally aware company and to lower its energy costs. In the lawsuit, it asks for the court to require Tesla to remove all of its systems from Walmart stores, which are now all de-energized.  Walmart has a goal of sourcing 35 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2020. The retailer was a major customer for SolarCity, which added both residential and commercial installations at a rapid clip while taking on significant debt.  In the lawsuit, Walmart accused SolarCity of having \u201can ill-considered business model that required it to install solar panel systems haphazardly and as quickly as possible in order to turn a profit, and the contractors and subcontractors who performed the original installation work had not been properly hired, trained, and supervised.\u201d  Under the terms of its solar energy contracts, SolarCity, and then Tesla, was required to install, maintain and operate the panel systems, according to the lawsuit.  In July, Walmart gave Tesla 30 days to provide analyses of the root causes of the fires, compensate the retailer for damages to its stores and demonstrate an overhaul of its operations, among other measures. As of Aug. 15, Tesla \u201cstill had not taken any reasonable steps toward curing its breaches,\u201d the lawsuit said.  Three days later, on Aug. 18, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced the re-launch of the company\u2019s solar business that allows customers to install solar panels without a long-term contract.  \u201cIt\u2019s like having a money printer on your roof,\u201d Musk wrote on Twitter.

Last month, the company announced a sweeping overhaul at Jet.com, an online startup it acquired in 2016 for $3.3 billion, after it failed to live up to the retailer\u2019s e-commerce ambitions.  Jet was expected to boost Walmart's reach particularly among city dwellers and millennial shoppers, but sources told here Reuters in June that it had failed to drive online grocery sales and grow market share in urban areas.  Walmart had previously said it expected losses from its online business, including Jet, to increase in 2019.  Shares in the company were down nearly a percent at $110.71 before the opening bell.","574":"FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. November 27, 2019.

The world\u2019s largest retailer, known for its hypermarkets, is expanding in China as shopping with mobile devices gains popularity in the country, and as retailers and technology companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings Ltd cut deals to integrate online and offline shopping.  Walmart is also targeting more online shoppers, who spend twice as much in the United States when buying on its website.  Walmart had run smaller Walmart Express stores in the United States, with 12,000 to 15,000 square feet, compared with about 105,000 square feet for its typical supermarket. But the concept did not take off and the retailer was forced to shut them down in 2016.  Walmart did not specify the size of the China store, in the southern city of Shenzhen. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The outlet will stock more than 8,000 items ranging from stir-fried clams to fresh fruit, 90 percent of which will be available online, it said in a statement. Items can be delivered within a 2 kilometer (1.2 mile) radius as quickly as 29 minutes, said Walmart, which owns a stake in JD.com.  Customers can opt to pay with their smartphone using a program on Tencent Holding Ltd\u2019s WeChat messaging.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Flipkart is seen on the company's office in Bengaluru, India, May 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa  Bengaluru-based Flipkart, which vies with players such as Amazon.com's AMZN.O local unit in India and India's Reliance Industries RELI.NS, will be aiming for a valuation in the $45-$50 billion range, according to one source with knowledge of the matter.  If achieved, that would mean Walmart would have more than doubled its investment.  Flipkart is likely to choose between Singapore, or the United States for the initial public offering (IPO), said two other sources, who asked not to be named as discussions are private.  \u201cFlipkart is incorporated in Singapore, but listing in the United States, where parent Walmart is headquartered, could give it access to a deeper pool of funds,\u201d one of the sources said.  Flipkart and Walmart did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.  The sources said the preparations and discussions have been largely internal for now, but the company is preparing to tap external advisers on the process soon.  The discussions come as India drafts new regulations that could pave the way for domestic companies to directly list overseas.  Two other sources familiar with the plans said that work has begun to ensure compliance, legal and finance functions will meet regulatory standards ahead of a potential listing.  \u201cRight now, the IPO target is more or less considered to be late 2021, or early 2022, but the current crisis has made things a little blurry,\u201d said one of these two sources.  The second person added that being \u201cIPO ready\u201d has become a constant refrain in top level meetings internally.  BUMPER VALUATION EYED  Walmart acquired a roughly 77% stake in Flipkart for about $16 billion back in 2018. That deal remains the single largest foreign direct investment in India.  It turned Flipkart\u2019s founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal into billionaires, and confirmed Flipkart\u2019s status as the country\u2019s most successful start-up at the time.  Later that year, Bentonville, Arkansas-headquartered Walmart in a regulatory filing said it could take Flipkart public in four years.  In July this year, Flipkart raised $1.2 billion in fresh funding with Walmart as its lead investor. That round valued Flipkart, which counts China's Tencent 0700.HK, U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global, and Microsoft MSFT.O among its investors, at $24.9 billion.  Flipkart said it would use the funds, to be received in two tranches this fiscal year, to support the development of its e-commerce marketplace as India emerges from the COVID-19 crisis.  Like its rival Amazon, Flipkart began by selling books, but diversified rapidly into sell selling smartphones, clothing and other items. It now competes with Amazon in most categories.  India\u2019s e-commerce sector is expected to be worth $99 billion by 2024, according to Goldman Sachs, as more Indians switch to online shopping.  That expanding market has attracted not only global giants such as Walmart and Amazon, but also India\u2019s oil-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance, which has jumped into the fray.  Mumbai-based Reliance this year launched an online grocery service, JioMart, with its billionaire boss Mukesh Ambani telling shareholders in July that deliveries will expand into electronics and fashion products.","580":"(Reuters) -  A federal judge in California has ordered Walmart Stores Inc to pay just over $100 million in damages and penalties for miscalculating the overtime pay of tens of thousands of workers in the state and issuing faulty wage statements.

REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Concise insights on global finance in the Covid-19 era.  -------------------------------------------------  SCALING THE WAL. Walmart raked it in during 2020. Now comes the giving back. The $416 billion retailer said on Thursday it plans $14 billion of investment in technology, supply chain and other enhancements this year, a 26% increase year-over-year. Where operating profit growth outpaced sales in 2020, that will reverse in 2021. Investors were displeased enough to wipe around 6%, or $25 billion, off the company\u2019s market value on Thursday.  That looks mean. Walmart\u2019s main reasons for diverting profit into investment should be good for its long term value. The U.S. e-commerce business had 79% more sales in the year ended Jan. 31 than it did in the previous period. Raising average associate wages to $15 an hour seems less obviously good for shareholders. But it might cool the jets of politicians who think paying below $15 is positively inhumane.  The plan fits in with what Chief Executive Doug McMillon calls a \u201cmulti-stakeholder view.\u201d And it\u2019s not like investors are being forgotten: Walmart has authorized $20 billion of share buybacks over three years, the same as it greenlit in October 2017. But with shares in Amazon.com and the more digitally savvy Target performing almost three times as well as Walmart\u2019s last year, not to invest would be the really expensive option. (By Amanda Gomez)","583":"(Reuters) - Can a prospective Justice Department target use a preemptive declaratory judgment suit to shape the parameters of the government\u2019s case? Or must defendants wait to be sued in an enforcement action to contest DOJ\u2019s interpretation of the law?  That\u2019s one of the key questions in a fierce and highly consequential fight between Walmart and the U.S. government. The Justice Department, as you probably recall, filed an enforcement action against Walmart in federal court in Delaware last December, alleging that the company violated the Controlled Substances Act by failing to police opioids prescriptions.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  The government\u2019s complaint, which cites more than 230,000 overdose deaths that have occurred in the 10-year opioid epidemic, is seeking maximum penalties for thousands of prescriptions that DOJ contends Walmart should not have filled. Walmart has called the suit \u201cmisguided and misleading,\u201d contending that its pharmacists have refused to fill thousands prescriptions from \u201cquestionable doctors\u201d but are prohibited from interfering in doctor-patient relationships.  But before DOJ sued Walmart, Walmart sued the government. The company filed a declaratory judgment complaint in Sherman, Texas, last October, requesting a ruling that DOJ\u2019s interpretation of the CSA is wrong. Walmart\u2019s strategy in the declaratory judgment suit was fascinating. Its lawyers at Jones Day described a pressure campaign by DOJ in which Texas prosecutors allegedly used the threat of a criminal indictment in an attempt to extract \u201ca massive civil penalty\u201d from the company. Even after DOJ higher-ups formally declined to bring criminal charges, Walmart said, the government appeared to be moving forward with plans to bring a civil case. Walmart said it wanted the court to issue an interpretation of the CSA in light of DOJ\u2019s looming suit. And it wanted that interpretation fast: The company moved for summary judgment even before the government filed an appearance in the case.  Obviously, if Walmart\u2019s intention was to obtain a quick ruling to ward off the DOJ\u2019s case, the plan failed. Walmart filed in October. The Justice Department brought its suit in December. As I\u2019ve previously reported, DOJ outmaneuvered Walmart by moving to dismiss the company\u2019s suit and persuading U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan to stay briefing on Walmart\u2019s summary judgment motion until he decided whether to toss the case. Walmart, in other words, won\u2019t be able to wield a Texas declaratory judgment that its pharmacists acted within the scope of the CSA in the early stages of litigation in DOJ\u2019s suit.  But can the company continue to seek such a judgment at all \u2013 or must the Texas case be dismissed, as DOJ has requested? Walmart filed its opposition brief yesterday. Its argument: The company wasn\u2019t attempting to interfere with prosecutorial discretion when it originally filed the suit and still needs a ruling from the court in Texas to inform its future conduct, which isn\u2019t at issue in DOJ\u2019s enforcement action in Delaware.  And if Judge Jordan\u2019s ruling on the scope of the CSA just happens to impact the DOJ suit, Walmart said, that doesn\u2019t mean its Texas case is \u201ca forbidden attack on prosecutorial discretion.\u201d  The government certainly portrayed the Walmart suit as an attempt to interfere with its enforcement power in its dismissal motion. Keep in mind: The government moved for dismissal of the Texas case before it actually sued Walmart in Delaware. So DOJ described Walmart\u2019s bid for a declaratory judgment as a \u201cdramatic expansion of judicial review of prosecutorial activity.\u201d  And if Judge Jordan allowed Walmart to move ahead with its preemptive attack on the government\u2019s investigation, DOJ said, he would open the door to any prospective target \u201cfaced with a government investigation that it dislikes.\u201d The proper course, DOJ said in its Dec. 4 motion, would be for Walmart to wait until any enforcement action was filed and then to mount a defense in that case. The government argued that the Texas case must be dismissed because Walmart hadn\u2019t presented a live case or controversy and because the government\u2019s interpretation of the CSA isn\u2019t an agency rule or regulation that can be challenged in a declaratory judgment action. (Technically, the question is whether the U.S. has waived sovereign immunity for such a challenge; such immunity is waived for Administrative Procedure Act suits challenging final rules and regulations by executive branch agencies but DOJ argued Walmart\u2019s case isn\u2019t an APA suit.)  Walmart\u2019s new brief countered that there\u2019s clearly a live controversy over the scope of the CSA, now that DOJ has sued the company. And its request for a declaratory judgment, Walmart said, is exactly why Congress passed the Declaratory Judgment Act: to allow a prospective defendant to dispel the cloud of uncertainty.  \u201cWalmart does not ask the court to enjoin an enforcement action, to interfere with prosecutorial discretion, or to declare Walmart \u2018innocent\u2019 of any fact-bound allegations,\u201d the company\u2019s motion said. \u201cRather, this case is simply an ordinary attempt by a regulated entity subject to plausible threats of enforcement \u2026 to obtain certainty about the scope of its statutory and regulatory duties, and thereby guide its conduct going forward.\u201d  Judge Jordan can determine the proper interpretation of the Controlled Substances Act quickly, Walmart said, since it\u2019s sheerly a question of law. The Delaware enforcement case, it argued, won\u2019t proceed nearly as quickly \u2013 and the company, it said, needs answers fast for pharmacists who are still filling prescriptions amid uncertainty about their duties to state and federal regulators.  DOJ\u2019s response is due later this month.","584":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of a Walmart Superstore is seen during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Rosemead, California, U.S., June 11, 2020.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer, which sells firearms in approximately half of its more than 5,000 U.S. stores, will still sell the items upon request, it said.  Retailers have been on edge after raiders earlier this year smashed windows, stole merchandise and, at times, set stores ablaze in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Portland and other U.S. cities. In an another trend that has fed concern, gun sales in the United States this year have reached record highs, and more first-time buyers have purchased firearms recent months.  In June, Walmart pulled firearms and ammunition from some U.S. sales stores amid nationwide protests over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in late May.  Last year, the retailer stopped selling ammunition for handguns and some assault-style rifles in all its U.S. stores. It has also in the past called for a strengthening of background checks for gun buyers and action to take guns out of the hands of those who pose a risk of violence.

Amazon recently debuted free two-hour Prime Now grocery delivery from Whole Foods in four cities, free for its annual $99 Prime subscribers.  Kroger Co KR.N, the nation's largest supermarket operator, has home delivery from more than 872 stores across the United States, and this week expanded its partnership with delivery company Instacart.  Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market, mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts.  Walmart is No. 2 with 9 percent, followed by Ahold USA's AD.AS Peapod with 7 percent, FreshDirect with 6 percent and Instacart at 5 percent.  Online revenue growth slowed at Walmart in the most recent quarter, causing some analysts to question its strategy to compete with Amazon. Company officials said Walmart was still on track to increase its e-commerce sales by 40 percent this year.","594":"LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury\u2019s and Walmart\u2019s Asda are in talks to create Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket group, a combination which would surpass Tesco\u2019s grocery market share and be worth up to 15 billion pounds ($20.7 billion).  Sainsbury\u2019s confirmed on Saturday that it and Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, were in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda businesses, the UK\u2019s No. 2 and 3 UK grocers. It said they will make a further announcement at 0600 GMT on Monday.  Britain\u2019s big grocers, including No. 4 player Morrisons, have been losing share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl and must also deal with growing demand for internet grocery shopping and the march of Amazon.  Sainsbury\u2019s gave no details of the deal\u2019s structure but a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters the holding company of the combined group would retain the Sainsbury\u2019s name. Sainsbury\u2019s Chief Executive Mike Coupe, who used to work for Asda, would lead it, the source said.  The source described the planned deal -- which would consolidate a brutally competitive UK food market while helping Walmart address its underperforming UK arm through greater buying power -- as a \u201cmerger\u201d.  Three sources with knowledge of the situation said Walmart would take a minority stake in the combined business. Two said Walmart would be the biggest shareholder, with a stake of around 40 percent.  The Qatar Investment Authority, which has tried to buy Sainsbury\u2019s in the past, is currently the supermarket group\u2019s biggest shareholder with a 22 percent stake. The deal would probably dilute that holding.  Sainsbury\u2019s invited media and analysts to presentations scheduled for Monday, indicating a done deal.  Walmart declined to comment. Asda did not respond to requests for comment.  Sky News, which first reported the news, said the deal could be worth over 10 billion pounds.  One of the sources who spoke to Reuters said the combined company would have an enterprise value, including debt, of around 15 billion pounds and would remain listed in London.  Sainsbury\u2019s shares closed on Friday at 269 pence, giving the company an equity value of 6 billion pounds.  The deal would be the largest in the UK supermarket sector since Morrisons acquired the Safeway business in 2004.

REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls  PROFIT DECLINE  Sainsbury\u2019s has reported three straight years of profit decline, and is forecast to report a fourth on Wednesday. Asda has seen two years of falls.  Asda, which Walmart bought in 1999 for 6.7 billion pounds, is one of the retail giant\u2019s largest and worst-performing international businesses. Analysts reckon Asda was hurt the most by the rise of the discounters, which eroded its traditional price advantage.  \u201cAsda doesn\u2019t have discount and it doesn\u2019t have convenience. This (deal) provides a potential solution for Walmart to deliver a more profitable Asda in the long run,\u201d said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.  In recent years Walmart has shifted its traditional approach from building overseas businesses itself to partnering with local players, for example in China.  In January, Walmart appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit with a remit that included fixing its UK operations. McKenna is a Briton and a veteran of Asda, where she served as both COO and finance chief.  Roger Burnley, who took over as Asda CEO in January, is a former Sainsbury\u2019s executive, working under Coupe. One of the sources said he would stay at the combined group.  Tesco last month moved to strengthen its grip on the UK food sector, completing the 4 billion-pound purchase of wholesaler Booker. In 2016 Sainsbury\u2019s purchased general merchandise retailer Argos for 1.1 billion pounds.  Sainsbury\u2019s and the similarly-sized Asda would overtake Tesco with a combined market share of 31.4 percent versus Tesco\u2019s 27.6 percent, according to the latest data from market researcher Kantar Worldpanel.  Asda stores would continue to trade under their own brand, separate from the more upmarket Sainsbury\u2019s, the sources said.  REGULATORY HURDLES  A major uncertainty surrounding any combination would be whether the move secures approval from Britain\u2019s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), given that the deal would effectively create a duopoly.  However, the CMA\u2019s surprise unconditional waving through of Tesco\u2019s Booker deal may have changed the regulatory landscape.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really big test of the CMA\u2019s understanding of the market and whether it believes that this deal is in the consumer\u2019s interest,\u201d said Shore Capital\u2019s Black.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe it would not require considerable store disposals and there aren\u2019t many buyers out there.\u201d","595":"Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened higher on Thursday as a surge in July retail sales and Walmart\u2019s robust results eased fears of a recession in the world\u2019s largest economy, while differing reports on the U.S.-China trade dispute kept investors on edge.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 34.83 points, or 0.14%, at the open to 25,514.25.  The S&P 500 opened higher by 5.60 points, or 0.20%, at 2,846.20. The Nasdaq Composite gained 16.26 points, or 0.21%, to 7,790.20 at the opening bell. (Reporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)","596":"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N, Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N and hundreds of smaller retailers are bolstering their online gift features, hoping to challenge Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O dominance as a seller of holiday gifts to homebound shoppers.  An Amazon.com Inc worker prepares an order in which the buyer asked for an item to be gift wrapped at a fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota, U.S., November 12, 2020. Amazon.com Inc\/Handout via REUTERS  The new services seek to take some of the drudgery out of gift-giving. The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift\u2019s price.  Amazon\u2019s rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving.  Consumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share.  \u201cThis is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,\u201d said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon\u2019s ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient.  Walmart.com on Oct. 28 added a \u201cgift eligible\u201d label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging.  With gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.  BestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered.  Estee Lauder Companies Inc EL.N this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Americans will spend $160 billion on gifts during the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago as people put savings from skipped outings into celebrating Christmas and other year-end holidays, according to industry analyst Coresight Research.  Adobe Inc's ADBE.O e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship gifts to 18% more recipients than a year ago as travel gets curbed.  But Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019.  Amazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon\u2019s product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1\/2 times the rate over the same period last year.  It pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon\u2019s largest ever.  The company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts and messages for some items, with links to let recipients initiate a return and send a thank you note.  MYSTERIOUS SENDER  But some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card.  \u201cThe gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,\u201d said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked.  Amazon said its gift features remain popular.  Jeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper.  Though Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he \u201clearned his lesson.\u201d"}}
