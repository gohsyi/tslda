DELHI (Reuters) - Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has kicked up a social media storm in India after a picture of him holding a poster saying \u201csmash Brahminical patriarchy\u201d, referring to the highest Hindu caste, went viral.  FILE PHOTO: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey addresses students during a town hall at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India, November 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Anushree Fadnavis  Twitter has apologized and expressed regret over the incident, which some Indians have called \u201chate-mongering\u201d.  The picture, posted on Twitter on Sunday by a journalist who was part of group of women journalists, activists and writers whom Dorsey met during a visit to India last week, had him clutching a poster of a woman holding up a banner with the line that has offended many Indians.  \u201cThe sentiments expressed on the poster do not reflect the views of Twitter as a company or Jack as the CEO, and we regret that this picture has detracted from an otherwise insightful trip to India,\u201d a Twitter spokeswoman told Reuters via email on Tuesday.  She said Twitter had hosted a closed-door discussion and one of the participants had shared her experience as a low-caste Dalit woman. At the conclusion of the session she gifted the poster to the Twitter CEO.  Several prominent Indians, including T.V. Mohandas Pai, a former finance chief of software exporter Infosys INFY.NS, accused Dorsey of \"hate-mongering\" against Brahmins.  \u201cTomorrow if @jack is given a poster with anti Semitic messages in a meeting, will his team allow him to hold it up?,\u201d Pai tweeted. \u201cWhy is that any different? Inciting hate against any community is wrong.\u201d  Twitter India TWTR.N said on Monday the poster had been handed to Dorsey by a Dalit activist when it hosted the discussion with a group of women to know more about their experience using Twitter.  It added the poster was a \u201ctangible reflection of our company\u2019s efforts to see, hear, and understand all sides of important public conversations that happen on our service around the world\u201d.  Late on Monday, Vijaya Gadde, legal, policy and trust and safety lead at Twitter, who accompanied Dorsey to India, apologized.  \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for this. It\u2019s not reflective of our views. We took a private photo with a gift just given to us - we should have been more thoughtful,\u201d she said in a tweet.  \u201cTwitter strives to be an impartial platform for all. We failed to do that here & we must do better to serve our customers in India.\u201d  Twitter, whose monthly active users globally averaged 326 million in the July-September quarter, does not disclose the number of its users in India but its executives say the country is one of its fastest-growing areas.  Its use is expected to increase further in coming months as political parties in the country of 1.3 billion try to expand their reach to voters ahead of a general election due by May.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with 44.4 million followers, is a Twitter enthusiast.  \u201cI enjoy being on this medium, where I\u2019ve made great friends and see everyday the creativity of people,\u201d Modi tweeted last week after meeting Dorsey in New Delhi.","1":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Friday it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the U.S. election process or implementation of election results, including through violence, as the company also announced more restrictions to slow the spread of misinformation.  FILE PHOTO: The Twitter App loads on an iPhone in this illustration photograph taken in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Twitter said in a blog post that, from next week, users will get a prompt pointing them to credible information before they can retweet content that has been labeled as misleading.  It said it would add more warnings and restrictions on tweets with misleading information labels from U.S. political figures like candidates and campaigns, as well as U.S.-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers or that get \u201csignificant engagement.\u201d  Twitter, which recently told Reuters it was testing how to make its labeling more obvious and direct, said people will have to tap through warnings to see these tweets. Users can also only \u2018quote tweet\u2019 this content, as likes, retweets and replies will be turned off.  Twitter says it has labeled thousands of misleading posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump. Twitter also said it would label tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate.  The company announced several temporary steps to slow amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the U.S. election week, global users pressing \u201cretweet\u201d will be directed first to the \u201cquote tweet\u201d button to encourage people to add their own commentary.  It will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context, and will stop people seeing \u201cliked by\u201d recommendations from people they do not know in their timeline.  Twitter\u2019s decision to hit the brakes on automated recommendations contrasts with the approach at Facebook Inc , which is amping up promotion of its groups product despite concerns about extremism in those spaces.  Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the Nov. 3 vote.  Reuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud.  On Wednesday, Facebook said it would ban calls for poll watching using \u201cmilitarized language.\u201d","2":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc executives will defend their companies before U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday, with Facebook insisting it takes election interference seriously and Twitter denying its operations are influenced by politics.  Facebook and Twitter logos are seen on a shop window in Malaga, Spain, June 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Jon Nazca\/File Photo  But no executive from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google is expected to testify, after the company declined the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s request to send one of its most senior executives, frustrating lawmakers.  Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, appearing alongside Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, will say that her company\u2019s efforts to combat foreign influence efforts have improved since the 2016 U.S. election, according to written testimony released on Tuesday.  \u201cThe actions we\u2019ve taken in response ... show our determination to do everything we can to stop this kind of interference from happening,\u201d Sandberg said.  The company is getting better at finding and removing \u201cinauthentic\u201d content and now has more than 20,000 people working on safety and security, she said.  Technology executives have repeatedly testified in Congress over the past year, on the defensive over political influence activity on their sites as well as concerns over user privacy.  The Senate Intelligence Committee has been looking into efforts to influence U.S. public opinion for more than a year, after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Kremlin-backed entities sought to boost Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House in 2016.  Moscow has denied involvement.  Google offered to send its chief legal officer, Kent Walker, to Wednesday\u2019s hearing, but he was rejected by the committee, which said it wanted to hear from corporate decision-makers.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u2018DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM\u2019  Senator Richard Burr, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, said he expected the hearing would focus on solutions to the problem of foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections and sow political discord, with a jab at Google.  \u201cYou don\u2019t understand the problem if you don\u2019t see this as a large effort from whole of government and the private sector,\u201d Burr told reporters at the Senate.  Google said Walker would be in Washington on Wednesday and be available to meet with lawmakers. On Tuesday it released written \u201ctestimony\u201d describing the company\u2019s efforts to combat influence operations.  Twitter\u2019s Dorsey also will testify at a House of Representatives hearing on Wednesday that the company \u201cdoes not use political ideology to make any decisions,\u201d according to written testimony also made public on Tuesday.  Dorsey will appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, addressing Republican concerns about how the social media platform polices content.  \u201cFrom a simple business perspective and to serve the public conversation, Twitter is incentivized to keep all voices on the platform,\u201d Dorsey said.  Conservative Republicans in Congress have criticized social media companies for what they say are politically motivated practices in removing some content, a charge the companies have repeatedly rejected.  Trump faulted Twitter on July 26, without citing any evidence, for limiting the visibility of prominent Republicans through a practice known as shadow banning.  Democratic Representative David Cicilline blasted Wednesday\u2019s hearing and his Republican colleagues, calling claims of political bias baseless.  \u201cThere is no evidence that the algorithms of social networks or search results are biased against conservatives. It is a made-up narrative pushed by the conservative propaganda machine to convince voters of a conspiracy that does not exist,\u201d Cicilline said.","3":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Facebook Inc FB.O said on Monday they had dismantled a state-backed social media campaign originating in mainland China that sought to undermine protests in Hong Kong.  Twitter said it suspended 936 accounts and the operations appeared to be a coordinated state-backed effort originating in China. It said these accounts were just the most active portions of this campaign and that a \u201clarger, spammy network\u201d of approximately 200,000 accounts had been proactively suspended before they were substantially active.  Facebook said it had removed accounts and pages from a small network after a tip from Twitter. It said that its investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government.  The Hong Kong protests, which have presented one of the biggest challenges for Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012, began in June as opposition to a now-suspended bill that would allow suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts. They have since swelled into wider calls for democracy.  Social media companies globally are under pressure to stem illicit political influence campaigns online, especially ahead of the U.S. election in November 2020. A 22-month U.S. investigation concluded Russia interfered in a \u201csweeping and systematic fashion\u201d in the 2016 U.S. election to help Donald Trump win the presidency.  The Chinese embassy in Washington and the U.S. State Department did not respond to requests for comment.  Twitter in a blog post said the accounts undermined the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement in Hong Kong. (bit.ly\/30kl9Jk)  Examples of posts provided by Twitter included a tweet from a user with photos of protesters storming Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council building, which asked: \u201cAre these people who smashed the Legco crazy or taking benefits from the bad guys? It\u2019s a complete violent behavior, we don\u2019t want you radical people in Hong Kong. Just get out of here!\u201d  In examples provided by Facebook, posts described the protesters as cockroaches who \u201crefused to show their faces.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed logo for Twitter is seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher told reporters that the bulk of the Facebook accounts were created in 2018.  Both Twitter and Facebook are blocked in mainland China by the government but available in Hong Kong.  TWITTER CHANGES AD POLICY  Twitter and Facebook have come under fire from users over showing ads from state-controlled media that criticized the Hong Kong protesters.  In response, Twitter said Monday it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media. Twitter told Reuters the advertising change was not related to the suspended accounts. (bit.ly\/2Za5Pxn)  In the past week, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency and state broadcaster China Global Television Network (CGTN) paid to promote videos that portrayed the protests as violent and said Hong Kong citizens wanted the demonstrations to end, according to Twitter\u2019s Ads Transparency Center.  Twitter said it did not have data on how much revenue it generates from state-controlled media advertising.  Many countries including the United States do not have clear standards on state media\u2019s purchase of online advertising.  Total digital ad spending in Hong Kong will grow 11% to reach $786.1 million in 2019, according to projections by U.S. digital market data analyst eMarketer.  Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O YouTube video service told Reuters in June that state-owned media companies maintained the same privileges as any other user, including the ability to run ads in accordance with its rules. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday on whether it had detected inauthentic content related to protests in Hong Kong.

In an unprecedented spree, the unidentified attackers on Wednesday hijacked the accounts of politicians, celebrities and billionaires, using them to solicit bitcoin transfers to a string of digital wallets.  A digital wallet used to consolidate the bitcoin has previously been linked with crypto firms including merchant service providers, U.S. blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis told Reuters - a clue that could aid investigators.  \u201cThey have interacted with service providers that have know-your-customer processes, and law enforcement can work with those service providers to find out who can be behind those accounts,\u201d spokeswoman Maddie Kennedy said, declining to give further details.  Twitter declined to comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which sources told Reuters is leading a federal inquiry into the Twitter hacking, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bitcoin allows users to send and receive funds without revealing their personal identity. Yet its movements are recorded on the blockchain, a publicly viewable digital ledger that underpins the crypto currency.  By tracing illicit bitcoin to exchanges and crypto payment firms where identification is required, investigators can potentially pinpoint criminal suspects.  \u201cIn bitcoin it\u2019s very difficult to transact without leaving some clues on the blockchain,\u201d said Tom Robinson of Elliptic, a London-based blockchain analysis firm. One of the wallets used in the hack has transacted with exchanges in the past, he said.  Since 2016, blockchain analysis firms including Elliptic, Chainalysis and California-based Cipher Trace have won contracts with U.S. government agencies including the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, according to a database of U.S. government contracts here.

A 19-year-old British man and a 22-year-old man in Orlando, Florida were also charged under U.S. federal law with aiding the attack, the Justice Department said.  A Florida prosecutor identified the 17-year-old as Graham Clark of Tampa and charged him as an adult with 30 felony counts of fraud. Clark netted at least $100,000 from the scheme by using the celebrity accounts to solicit investments from unsuspecting Twitter users, state officials said.  \u201cHe\u2019s a 17-year-old kid who just graduated from high school,\u201d said Florida State Attorney Andrew Warren in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, \u201cBut make no mistake: This was not an ordinary 17-year-old.\u201d  Mason Sheppard, a 19-year-old from Bogner Regis, Britain who used the alias Chaewon, was charged with wire fraud and money laundering while Orlando-based Nima Fazeli, 22, nicknamed Rolex, was accused of aiding and abetting the crimes, according to a Justice Department statement.  Twitter said it appreciated the \u201cswift actions of law enforcement.\u201d  Clark and one of the other participants were in custody, officials said.  In the hack, fraudulent tweets soliciting investments in the digital currency bitcoin were posted in mid-July by 45 verified Twitter accounts, including those belonging to Biden, former President Barack Obama and billionaire Bill Gates. Twitter said the hackers also likely read some direct messages including to a Dutch elected official.  More than $100,000 was obtained, bitcoin\u2019s public ledger showed.  Twitter has previously said its employees were duped into sharing account credentials.  Authorities provided new details Friday in an affidavit alleging that Clark \u201cused social engineering to convince a Twitter employee that he was a co-worker in the IT department and had the employee provide credentials to access the customer service portal.\u201d  Sheppard and Fazeli did not return emails seeking comment. An attorney for Clark could not be immediately identified. Phone calls and an email to Clark\u2019s mother were not immediately returned.

Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement he has written letters to the companies for information on data sharing agreements, noting that since 2012 \u201cthe relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE has been an area of national security concern.\u201d  Alphabet has said previously it has strategic partnerships with Chinese mobile device manufacturers, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, and Xiaomi, as well as with Chinese technology platform Tencent.  It wasn\u2019t clear if Twitter has a partnership with any Chinese vendors.  Alphabet and Twitter did not immediately respond to questions for comment.  Facebook acknowledged on Tuesday it has data sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese companies including Huawei, the world\u2019s third-largest smartphone maker, which has come under scrutiny from U.S. intelligence agencies on security concerns.  That brought a firestorm of criticism from members of Congress, including some who said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg should have disclosed the arrangements in testimony to Congress in April.  The social media company said computer maker Lenovo Group and smartphone makers OPPO and TCL Corp were among about 60 companies worldwide that received access to some user data after they signed contracts to re-create Facebook-like experiences for their users.  Warner asked Alphabet Chief Executive Larry Page if it had \u201cthird party partnerships\u201d with ZTE Corp, Lenovo or TCL and if it conducted audits to ensure that the companies were properly treating consumer data. He asked Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey if it had relationships with Huawei as well as those companies.  Members of Congress raised concerns after The New York Times reported on the data-sharing practice on Sunday, saying the data of users\u2019 friends could have been accessed without their explicit consent.  Facebook denied that and said the data access was to allow its users to access account features on mobile devices.

Greg Nash\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  In early 2020, Dorsey faced calls from Elliott Management Corp to step down, after the hedge fund argued he was paying too little attention to Twitter while also running payments processing company Square Inc. He fended off this pressure by giving Elliott and its ally, buyout firm Silver Lake Partners, seats on Twitter\u2019s board.  Since then, Twitter shares had risen more than 70% as of Friday - the day Twitter suspended Trump - as users flocked to the app for news in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet its stock has dropped 9% this week amid investor concerns that banning Trump would alienate some of his 88 million followers from the popular social media platform and trigger a new push by lawmakers to regulate it.  An agreement that prevents Elliott and Silver Lake from seeking to influence Twitter\u2019s content moderation and user policy expires this spring. The two investment firms declined to comment on whether they would seek to intervene once the agreement expires. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment or make Dorsey available for an interview.  Elliott\u2019s founder, Paul Singer, is a major financial backer of Trump\u2019s Republican Party. The hedge fund took a 4% stake in Twitter when the stock was hovering around $30, and is still in the black with the shares now trading at around $47. Silver Lake invested $1 billion in Twitter\u2019s convertible bonds that give it the equivalent of a 3% stake.  Analysts and investors said the impact of the ban on Dorsey\u2019s standing with investors will hinge on whether the move weighs on the company\u2019s longer-term growth prospects, and that the chances of a regulatory crackdown on the app were difficult to assess. Many said, however, that they expected most Twitter users to remain on the platform and top shareholders to stick with the company.  \u201cWe think other Tweeters can replace Trump, and note that since Nov. 17, Trump\u2019s follower count is down by about 180,000, and President-elect Biden\u2019s is up by over 4 million,\u201d Bank of America analysts wrote in a note.  Representatives for top Twitter investors, including BlackRock Inc, Vanguard and Fidelity, declined to comment.  The reaction of advertisers, from whom Twitter derives the bulk of its revenue, will be key. Many are drawn to the platform because of its high user \u201cengagement,\u201d a measure of how active and involved people are when they use the app, and are fearful of being mired in controversy, said Mark Douglas, chief executive of SteelHouse, which provides advertising software to help marketers reach audiences across TV, Web and mobile media.  Advertisers often pull their ads in times of political or cultural turmoil, such as the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death in May. Twitter has acknowledged this risk, warning investors in October that the U.S. election could affect its ad sales.  \u201cWe just worry that last week\u2019s news flow will remind advertisers how dark of a sewer that Twitter\u2019s environment truly is,\u201d said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.  Some investors said Dorsey could argue he was left with no choice but to suspend Trump after his rally of supporters in Washington, D.C. seeking to overturn the outcome of the U.S. election led to the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which resulted in the deaths of five people. Other internet giants, such as Facebook Inc and Google owner Alphabet Inc, also cracked down on content produced by Trump and his supporters.  \u201cWe think Twitter is undergoing a turnaround and will show very nice growth numbers. Replacing a CEO in the middle of that effort would interrupt all of those good things,\u201d said Sahm Adrangi, founder and portfolio manager of Kerrisdale Capital Management, Twitter\u2019s 40th-largest shareholder.","12":"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Tuesday suspended several recently created right-leaning news accounts posting information about voting in the hotly contested U.S. election for violating its policies.

Ali Alzabarah and Ahmad Abouammo, who used to work for Twitter, and Ahmed Almutairi, who then worked for the Saudi royal family, face charges of working for Saudi Arabia without registering as foreign agents, according to the complaint filed against them on Wednesday.  The indictment points an unusually public finger at Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally that maintains warm ties with President Donald Trump despite its bad human rights record.  Saudi Arabia has not yet publicly remarked on the complaint.  King Salman met with the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Gina Haspel, in the capital Riyadh, the state news agency said on Thursday. It gave no details on the topics discussed at the meeting, which was also attended by the Saudi foreign and interior ministers and the U.S. ambassador.  Many Republican and Democratic lawmakers are already deeply critical of Riyadh\u2019s conduct of the war in Yemen and the 2018 murder at a Saudi consulate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who had U.S. residency and wrote for the Washington Post.  Despite the pressure, Trump has stood by the kingdom and its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who appears in the complaint as Royal Family Member-1, according to the Washington Post, which initially reported the charges.  The charges also put Silicon Valley companies in the spotlight once again over how they protect the intimate details they collect about their users, including from employees with no legitimate reason for accessing the information.  According to the complaint, Abouammo repeatedly accessed the Twitter account of a prominent critic of the Saudi royal family in early 2015. At one instance, he was able to view the email address and telephone number associated with the account.  He also accessed the account of a second Saudi critic to get personally identifiable information.  Twitter uncovered Alzabarah\u2019s unauthorized access of private data and placed him on administrative leave in late 2015, but not before he had tapped data from over 6,000 accounts, including 33 for which Saudi authorities had submitted law enforcement requests to Twitter, the complaint said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  \u201cThis information could have been used to identify and locate the Twitter users who published these posts,\u201d the U.S. Justice Department said in a news release.  Almutairi, for his part, is accused of acting as a go-between for the Saudi government and the Twitter employees.  Abouammo, who is a U.S. citizen, was arrested in Seattle, Washington while the other two are presumed to be in Saudi Arabia, the department said. Abouammo was ordered to remain behind bars pending a detention hearing Friday.  PAYMENT FOR INFORMATION  The two former Twitter employees were given cash and other rewards, such as an expensive watch, in exchange for the information they shared, the complaint said.  Abouammo later claimed the watch was worth $35,000 in communications with prospective buyers on Craigslist.org.  They appeared to have been cultivated by a senior Saudi official, identified by the Washington Post as Bader al-Asaker, Prince Mohammad\u2019s close adviser who now heads the crown prince\u2019s private office and charity MiSK.  Most contacts occurred in 2014 and 2015, when the crown prince was rising to power, according to the U.S. complaint.  One man posted a photo of himself with the crown prince during his visit to Washington in May 2015, while another flew to Washington from San Francisco during the same time, the Justice Department complaint says.  The Saudi embassy and government media office did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not reach al-Asaker and he did not reply to an emailed request for comment.  Twitter said it was grateful to the FBI and U.S. Justice Department. \u201cWe recognize the lengths bad actors will go to try and undermine our service,\u201d it said.  \u201cOur company limits access to sensitive account information to a limited group of trained and vetted employees. We understand the incredible risks faced by many who use Twitter to share their perspectives with the world and to hold those in power accountable.\u201d  Twitter would not comment on how it became aware of the two men\u2019s activities or whether it alerted law enforcement.","14":"April 25 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc reported its second profitable quarter on Wednesday and topped Wall Street estimates for revenue and monthly active users, as advertisers in Asia and other markets outside the United States embraced Twitter\u2019s video ads.  San Francisco-based Twitter has tried to grow its user base and ad business internationally, expanding beyond its home country. U.S. President Donald Trump has kept the service in the headlines domestically but growth has been faster abroad, including a boost in Asia in the most recent quarter.  International sales accounted for 48 percent of revenue, growing 53 percent year-over-year, compared with 2 percent in the United States. Total revenue rose 21 percent.  Still, the social media sector is under intense pressure from lawmakers around the globe for inflaming political debates, allowing abusive language and failing to safeguard personal data.  While there have been few signs that users have abandoned social media, the companies face rising costs in the face of new regulation and to avoid abuse and misuse of their sites.  Twitter said it expected to grow headcount 10 percent to 15 percent in 2018, hiring people to improve the \u201chealth\u201d of discussions on Twitter and meet other priorities.  Revenue growth for the remainder of 2018 will be similar to the slower rates of 2016, the company said, adding that second-half growth would face difficult comparisons to a strong performance in late 2017.  Up to Tuesday\u2019s close, Twitter shares had risen 26.9 percent this year, compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the S&P 500 Index.  The fourth quarter of last year was Twitter\u2019s first profitable one, and the company reiterated that it expects to be profitable for the full year in 2018.  First-quarter expenses not including stock-based compensation rose 10 percent. Twitter has been cutting stock-based compensation, and total expenses were flat as a result.  The company said it saw a $21 million tax benefit from a U.S. tax overhaul carried out last year by Trump and U.S. Republican lawmakers.  The number of people using Twitter monthly rose to 336 million, up 3 percent from a year earlier and topping an estimate of 334 million from financial data and analytics firm FactSet.  Investors closely watch the number of people using the service as a sign of future ad sales potential.  Most recent user growth is international. Twitter said it added 5 million people outside the United States and 1 million people inside its home market, compared with the fourth quarter.  Total revenue rose to $664.9 million, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $607.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Ad revenue was $575 million, beating expectations of $523.1 million.  \u201cWe saw growth across all regions with particular strength in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Twitter said, adding that Japan continued to be its second-largest market for sales.  Videos accounted for more than half of ad revenue and was Twitter\u2019s fastest-growing ad format in the first quarter, the company said.  Known for short messages, Twitter has paid to develop live shows and broadcast live events, using the videos to get people to spend more time on the service and to sell video ads to marketers.  Revenue from ads rose at about the same rate, 21 percent, as other revenue, which includes Twitter\u2019s data business and rose 20 percent from a year earlier.  Twitter swung to a net profit of $61 million, or 8 cents per share, in the first quarter, from a loss of $61.6 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 16 cents per share.  Analysts on average had expected 12 cents per share.

TWITTER  After the Capitol unrest, Twitter announced steps to limit amplification of tweets violating its election misinformation rules, blocking likes, replies and retweets of those messages.  Users can still quote the tweets, but must add their own comments before sharing, it said.  The company also updated its \u201ccivic integrity\u201d policy to establish a strike-based enforcement system for misleading election claims and purged more than 70,000 accounts for sharing QAnon content.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  A Twitter spokeswoman declined to say whether the company was restricting automated content recommendations, such as suggestions for users to follow, or to disclose specific terms being blocked from appearing in \u201ctrending\u201d topics.  On Inauguration Day, Twitter will transfer control of official White House accounts like @WhiteHouse and @POTUS to the Biden administration.  The company permanently suspended Trump\u2019s personal account @realDonaldTrump, citing the risk of further incitement. That account had been his primary megaphone throughout his presidency.  YOUTUBE  YouTube, Alphabet Inc\u2019s video streaming platform, said it has put in place \u201cadditional protective measures\u201d for Inauguration Day, without elaborating.  The company bars live videos that show someone using a firearm, but declined to say whether it was imposing any further restrictions on livestreams or making temporary changes to its systems for recommending content.  On Tuesday, YouTube extended a one-week ban on Trump\u2019s account for at least an additional seven days, citing \u201cconcerns about the ongoing potential for violence.\u201d  PARLER  Parler, which styles itself as a \u201cfree-speech\u201d space, remains largely offline after being dropped by Amazon\u2019s hosting arm and major app stores after the Capitol attack, with partners citing its poor record of policing calls for violence.  A static version of its website returned on Jan. 15 with the help of a Russian-owned technology company and has featured a handful of posts by executives and others, including Fox News host Mark Levin.  Jeffrey Wernick, Parler\u2019s chief operating officer, told Reuters the company was posting those comments on behalf of \u201cfriends who reached out\u201d and had not yet put in place any new content guidelines.  DLIVE  Niche video streaming platform DLive, in the spotlight after far-right personalities used it to broadcast live during the Capitol siege, said it would block all live streams from Washington, D.C. on Jan. 20.  The company, popular with video game streamers, also started proactively reviewing content in the non-gaming \u201cX-tag\u201d section of its site and halted the ability of streamers there to earn money off their videos, it said.  TWITCH  Amazon\u2019s livestreaming platform declined to disclose whether it had put in place any specific measures related to the inauguration.  The company said it removes content that incites or glorifies violence and was monitoring for policy violations. It has carried graphic livestreams of extremist violence before, including shootings in Germany in 2019.  Twitch disabled Trump\u2019s account indefinitely after the Capitol attack and said it would reassess the ban after he leaves office.  SNAPCHAT  Snap Inc maintains it faces fewer problems with extremism and incitement to violence than other platforms because of Snapchat\u2019s design: no open news feed, pre-approval for promoted content and limits on the size of group chats.  A spokeswoman said an internal team is conducting regular proactive sweeps for rules violations around the inauguration, but the platform is not making any other changes.  Snap permanently terminated Trump\u2019s account after the Capitol unrest, \u201cbased on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence.\u201d  REDDIT  Reddit did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for inauguration week.  The company had long hosted r\/The_Donald, a popular online home base for Trump fans, but shut down the forum last year for violating hate speech rules.  It banned another forum, r\/DonaldTrump, after the Capitol siege, citing policy violations related to the violence there.","21":"FILE PHOTO: Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-MS) attends the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee hearing 'Does Section 230's Sweeping Immunity Enable Big Tech Bad Behavior?', on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., October 28, 2020.

Apple, Google and Amazon also suspended Parler - a pro-Trump app where users have threatened more violence - from their respective app stores and Web-hosting services, a set of moves that stand to severely handicap the service.

Convertible bonds behave like an option in that they grant holders of the security the right to exchange them for equity above a pre-established price, giving the company scope to reduce coupon payments on the debt.  There have been 22 convertible offering by technology companies this year, raising in total almost $9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters IFR.  \u201cThe stock price has certainly turned around from where it was last year ... The momentum in the stock may give investors a reason to at least look at this deal,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.  Twitter is taking advantage of strong investor demand for convertible bonds, which allow investors a downside-protected way to participate in the stock. Twitter\u2019s stock would need to rise to $77.64 before investors would be eligible to convert into the underlying stock. The shares were trading around $40 at midday Wednesday.  \u201cWe assume the main purpose of the new convert will be to pay off the old one,\u201d wrote Dave King, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.  While the conversion price, interest rate and other details have yet to be set, concerns about the prospect of more shares coming onto the market sent its stock down about 2 percent in premarket trade before a recovery that saw it extend Tuesday\u2019s rally about 0.4 percent at mid morning.  Twitter will market the convertible at a coupon of 0.125 percent to 0.625 percent and a 40 percent to 45 percent conversion premium to the current share price, leads on the deal told IFR. That would put it at the higher end of recent conversion premiums. Only 3 of the 22 technology companies that issued convertible bonds this year were in that high range, according to IFR.  This is a popular strategy that other tech companies have used to offset dilution to very high share prices. For instance the financial payments processor Square last month raised $862.5 million on the sale of a five-year convertible with a conversion premium of 42.5 percent.  The company is using net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to purchase call spread options to offset future dilution and to repurchase part of a convertible that matures in 2019, Twitter said.  That was part of a two-part convertible issue that Twitter sold in September 2014, comprised of five-year and seven-year tranches, according to IFR data.  \u201cThe timing of a convertible bond deal with the company\u2019s entrance into the S&P 500 makes sense,\u201d said King. \u201cThere will likely be a strong bid for the stock from index funds.\u201d  King said this could offset selling pressure from convertible arbitrageurs trying to establish short positions in Twitter in anticipation of going long the new convertible bond.  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are expected to price the deal later on Wednesday, according to IFR.

The Twitter App loads on an iPhone in this illustration photograph taken in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  India has ordered Twitter to remove more than 1,100 accounts and posts that it alleges are spreading misinformation about the widespread protests by Indian farmers against new agricultural laws.  Twitter Inc riled Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government earlier on Wednesday, after it said in a public blog post that it had not fully complied with the government\u2019s order because it believed some of the take-down orders were not consistent with Indian law.  \u201cIn keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression, we have not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians,\u201d it said.  India\u2019s IT Ministry, via a post on rival platform Koo, said late on Wednesday that its top official had on a call with some of Twitter\u2019s top executives expressed \u201cstrong displeasure\u201d with Twitter\u2019s actions.  \u201cTwitter is free to formulate its own rules and guidelines,\u201d the government said. \u201cBut Indian laws which are enacted by the Parliament of India must be followed irrespective of Twitter\u2019s own rules and guidelines.\u201d  The IT secretary expressed his deep disappointment over the manner in which the company had \u201cunwillingly, grudgingly and with great delay\u201d complied with only parts of the government\u2019s orders, the government statement added.  Twitter did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the meeting with the IT ministry.  Twitter\u2019s moves to defy India\u2019s orders have put the company and its executives at the centre of a political firestorm. New Delhi has previously threatened legal action which could result in fines or imprisonment for Twitter executives responsible for implementing government directives.  It also comes after Twitter\u2019s top lobbyist in India, Mahima Kaul, resigned while the company scrambles to contain a growing public relations crisis.  Public opinion in one of Twitter\u2019s key markets is split. Some lawyers say Twitter must comply or challenge the order in court while activists blame the government for using legal provisions to curb free speech.  I\u2019M ON KOO!  Earlier on Wednesday, Twitter said following government orders it permanently suspended over 500 accounts for engaging in platform manipulation and spam. For many others, it only restricted access within India and their tweets can still be read abroad.  For Twitter, the stakes are high in India, where it had 17.5 million users as of last month, according to German database firm Statista. It is also ardently used by Modi, his Cabinet ministers and other leaders to communicate with the public.  As the row takes a toll on Twitter, many Indian politicians and users are joining the home-grown Twitter-like social media platform Koo, which was launched last year.  #kooapp was the top Twitter trend in India on Wednesday with nearly 21,000 posts, followed by #BanTwitter.  Twitter declined to comment about some users migrating to Koo.  Several people on Twitter, including Trade Minister Piyush Goyal, have posted tweets this week saying \u201cI am now on Koo\u201d. Goyal, who has 9.6 million Twitter followers, has a pinned tweet asking people to connect with him on the rival Indian platform.

Five people died in the violence including one Capitol Police officer.  After the attack, Twitter removed Trump\u2019s account, which had 88 million followers, due to the risk of further violence.

The call to action by the Solar Energy Industry Association came a day after it released a study claiming the levies would cost some 62,000 jobs and $19 billion in clean energy investments. The study is part of a strategy to persuade President Donald Trump to reduce or end the four-year tariff regime implemented early last year.  The study prompted a withering rebuttal from Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro, who called the estimate here \"fake news\" and the association \"a loose confederation of Chinese solar companies seeking to destroy American solar manufacturing jobs.\"  In an email to the trade group\u2019s public relations committee on Wednesday, Dan Whitten, its vice president of public affairs, asked that members post photos of U.S. solar workers online with the phrase: \u201cMr. Peter Navarro, I am an American solar worker. @StopSolarTariffs @WhiteHouse & @USTradeRep\u201d.  \u201cWe need your help to punch back,\u201d the email, seen by Reuters, said. \u201cWe need to engage our workers in a Twitter campaign to hit back.\u201d  Trump\u2019s tariff program on imported panels was his opening salvo in a trade war aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers rebound from years of decline due to foreign competition. Solar installers opposed the tariffs because they rely on cheap imported panels to compete with fossil fuels.  The levy started at 30% and was designed to drop by five percentage points each year.  The report, whose gloomy forecasts were based on that rate regime, came out two days before a scheduled mid-term review of the tariff program by the International Trade Commission that could influence whether Trump maintains, changes or cancels it.  Most panels installed in the United States are made in Asia. Despite the tariffs, global panel prices have continued to fall due to an oversupply in top producer China, which cut incentives for installations there and unleashed a flood of solar products into the market.

Overall revenue rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, handily beating analyst estimates that called for a fourth straight quarter of declines.  Twitter\u2019s previous inability to turn a profit or log consistent revenue growth had confounded investors given its ubiquitous media presence and popularity among celebrities, athletes and politicians such as U.S. President Donald Trump.  Revenue from outside the United States rose 17 percent, making up for an 8 percent decline in U.S. sales. Revenue from Japan rose 34 percent to $106 million, and Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said Chinese exporters were strong advertisers abroad.  Shares closed 12.1 percent higher at $30.18 after hitting a high of $35.00. Twitter was founded in 2006 and went public in 2013 at $26 a share.  Twitter, which has doubled the number of characters allowed per tweet and made other changes to attract users, said the number of daily active users rose 12 percent.  \u201cAdvertisers want eyeballs, so anything Twitter can do to maximize the number of people accessing the platform daily for a good chunk of time allows for better ROI,\u201d or return on investment, analyst Erna Alfred Liousas of Forrester Research said.  Monthly active users grew more slowly, up 4 percent from a year earlier to 330 million. That was flat from the third quarter, which the company blamed in part on seasonal weakness and its purge of fake and spam accounts.  Twitter said revenue was helped by using data to make the targeting of ads more individualized, a process known as machine learning. That raised clickthrough rates, or the ratio of users who click on a specific ad to the number that view it.  The Twitter logo and stock prices are shown above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The company also cited higher video ad sales and redesigned ad formats as helping to grow revenue.  \u201cThey are showing the right tweets to the right people at the right time, and as you do that, not only do you drive consumers to use Twitter more, but you attract more and more advertisers to want to be on the platform,\u201d analyst Richard Greenfield of BTIG Research said.  Overall revenue was $731.6 million, beating Wall Street\u2019s target of $686.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company reported $87 million in data licensing and other non-advertising revenue, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Ad revenue rose 1 percent to $644 million.  Twitter reported a net profit of $91.1 million, or 12 cents per share, compared to a loss of $167.1 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier.  Adjusted profit was 19 cents per share, topping analyst expectations of 14 cents per share.  The company said it expects to be \u201cGAAP profitable for the full year 2018,\u201d referring to generally accepted accounting principles.  But analysts were split on what lies ahead for the company.  Twitter needs to attract more new users and is trading at a \u201clofty premium\u201d given expected earnings, James Cakmak of Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co said in a client note.  Greenfield said he expected growth for years to come. \u201cThis is all about really looking at the potential of revenue growth as they scale and leverage their cost structure,\u201d he said.  Chief Executive Jack Dorsey focused for the past year on tweaking the product he co-founded to attract users, including by trying to limit user harassment. Twitter has also struck deals with media companies for live news and entertainment shows.  Facebook Inc has 2.1 billion monthly users, while Snapchat owner Snap Inc, which does not report a monthly figure, has 187 million daily users.  Dorsey told analysts on a conference call that he was not planning a search to replace Anthony Noto, who is leaving as chief operating officer to become CEO of online lender Social Finance Inc and whose duties have been absorbed by others.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have to do any backfilling,\u201d Dorsey said.  Shares in Twitter had already surged 47 percent over the past 12 months as of Wednesday\u2019s close, outpacing a 17 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index.  That came even as social media companies are grappling with a regulatory backlash in Europe and the United States over privacy, possible user addiction, hate speech and alleged abuse of by Russia to sway foreign elections.  Twitter\u2019s quarterly profit and rising revenue reignited speculation on Thursday among some analysts that a larger company could try to buy it. The Walt Disney Co expressed interest in 2016, though at the time Twitter shares were trading around $18.","36":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Social media giant Twitter Inc has apologised to an Indian parliamentary panel for showing a northern Himalayan region as part of China, promising to make corrections by month-end, the panel\u2019s chief said on Wednesday.

Twitter has assured the panel that the matter will be resolved by Nov. 30, she added.  Twitter executives last month appeared before the panel to explain the error, with Lekhi accusing the company of disrespecting India\u2019s sovereignty.  The mistake came to light after some Twitter users tagged their posts as being in Ladakh but the geo-tag showed their location in China.  Twitter at the time said the mistake had been quickly fixed.  Nuclear-armed India and China fought a brief but bloody border war in 1962, and are currently locked in a months-long military standoff along their contested Himalayan border that includes the region of Ladakh.  The territory is claimed in full by arch rivals India and Pakistan, while China claims a portion in the east known as the Aksai Chin.  Indian lawmakers and Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government have been at odds with U.S. tech giants.  Lekhi last month criticized Amazon, threatening coercive action against the e-commerce giant after it failed to appear before her panel, while Facebook has been questioned by another parliament panel over its content regulation practices.","37":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The account of Twitter Inc TWTR.N Chief Executive Jack Dorsey was hacked on Friday afternoon, sending public tweets and retweets including racial slurs and curse words to 4 million followers before Twitter secured the account.  The social media company, co-founded by Dorsey, said the phone number associated with his account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider.  \u201cThis allowed an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number. That issue is now resolved,\u201d the company said, adding separately that there was no indication that Twitter\u2019s systems had been compromised.  One of the tweets from the hacked account said Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was innocent, while others contained derogatory comments about black people and Jews. There was also a tweet suggesting there was a bomb at Twitter\u2019s headquarters.  The account posted a hashtag that was used during the apparent hacks of several YouTube stars last week.  The hack underscored potential vulnerabilities in the social media platform, which is widely used by world leaders and politicians, including U.S. President Donald Trump. It comes at a time when social media companies are facing scrutiny over management of their networks, privacy issues and security of user data.  The offensive tweets and retweets were deleted less than an hour after the incident. Some Twitter accounts named in the compromised tweets and retweets appeared suspended on Friday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Screenshots of the tweets appeared to show they were sent through Cloudhopper, a mobile text messaging service that Twitter acquired in 2010. Twitter did not immediately respond when asked to confirm if the hack took place via Cloudhopper.  Security researcher Brian Krebs said it appeared that Dorsey was the victim of a SIM swapping attack in which a mobile provider is tricked or otherwise convinced to transfer a victim\u2019s phone number to a SIM card controlled by someone else.  The Friday incident was not the first time that Dorsey\u2019s Twitter account has been hacked. His account was compromised in 2016 by a group that also hacked the Twitter accounts of Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.  Twitter shares were down less than 1% in after-hours trade following the hack.","38":"FILE PHOTO: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is seen as he testifies remotely from his home during a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation hearing to discuss \"reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act,\" which protects internet companies, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 28, 2020. U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation\/Handout via REUTERS  (Reuters) - Twitter Inc Chief Executive Jack Dorsey appeared to stop following President Donald Trump on the social media platform this weekend, according to a Twitter account that follows the activity of tech leaders.  Dorsey also unfollowed Democratic President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, said @BigTechAlert, as well as the @realDonaldTrump account and the account of his daughter, Ivanka Trump.  Trump, a prolific user of Twitter, has lost 368,743 followers since Nov. 17, according to Factba.se, a website that tracks Trump\u2019s public statements and tweets.  His follower count still stands at 88.5 million, but the decrease represents a shift for an account that has rapidly grown during his time in office. Biden has gained about 2.5 million followers since Nov. 17, bringing his follower count to 21.6 million.  A Twitter spokesman declined to comment.  Trump\u2019s Twitter account has sometimes fired off more than 100 tweets a day and has been used to communicate with his supporters, insult opponents and fire staff. He also has announced numerous policy decisions on the platform.  Twitter this year started adding warnings and labels to the president\u2019s rule-breaking tweets, including on misinformation tweeted about the Nov. 3 election. Trump and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly accused Twitter and other major social media platforms of anti-conservative bias in their content moderation, which the companies deny.  In recent weeks, Twitter has said that when Biden takes office on Jan. 20, Trump will be subject to the same rules as any other user. He will also begin to be subject to Facebook Inc\u2019s third-party fact-checking program, from which politicians are exempt.","39":"Aug 13 (Reuters) - Twitter said late on Wednesday it plans to expand its rules against misinformation regarding mail-in ballots and early voting in the U.S. elections this year.

The finer details of the step are still being finalized.  U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that voting by mail, which is expected to increase dramatically this fall due to coronavirus outbreak, is susceptible to large-scale fraud.  Voting by mail is not new in the United States \u2014 nearly one in four voters cast 2016 presidential ballots that way.  Routine methods and the decentralized nature of U.S. elections make it very hard to interfere with mailed ballots, experts say.

The app is popular with retail investors who \u201cmight be talking about a stock I own, and it could move. There could be a trading opportunity there as well,\u201d said Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading.  Retail investors have long discussed stocks on Reddit and other social media forums, but in recent months Wall Street has had to pay attention to what they are saying. Long dismissed as \u201cdumb money,\u201d retail traders in recent months have put enough money into the market to make stocks move in ways that defy fundamental analysis.  The most stunning recent example is a nearly 700% rise over the past week in shares of GameStop Corp, without any fundamental change in business for the video game retailer that Wall Street had long given up for dead in the age of Amazon and online downloads. The sharp upswing in GameStop shares has mowed down sophisticated traders who had taken short positions on the stock, betting against it. The surge was fueled in large part by a series of posts talking up the stock on popular forums on Reddit.  Wall Street is paying attention.  \u201cIt adds a new element to the profession,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s ignorant of professional traders to not at minimum be aware of the added dynamic to what we all do on a daily basis.\u201d  Authors on Reddit, which hosts more than 100,000 discussion groups, or \"subreddits,\" are mostly anonymous. Founded in 2005, Reddit has recently drawn the interest of amateur traders who post about their strategies and opinions on stocks. The wallstreetbets subreddit here, which has 2.9 million members, has seen huge spikes of late in volumes of chats around individual stocks.  The largest shareholders in privately held Reddit are media tycoons the Newhouse family\u2019s Advance group, which also owns Cond\u00e9 Nast. Reddit\u2019s co-founder Steve Huffman serves as chief executive, while another co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, stepped down from the board last year. Reddit did not respond to a request for comment.  Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk gave Reddit even more prominence as a trading forum on Tuesday as he tweeted \u201cGamestonk!!\u201d, along with a link to the wallstreetbets subreddit. \u201cStonks\u201d is a tongue-in-cheek term for stocks widely used on social media.  Homebound Americans, some flush with cash from stimulus checks and forced savings, have been chasing higher on the stock market at a time of zero interest rates. Their trades are becoming a force to reckon with.  Before, much discussion on forums such as Reddit used to involve penny stocks and micro-caps that institutions would shun, professional traders said. Now they are noticing discussions moving into mainstream companies with large institutional holdings \u2013 and moving markets.  Wedbush\u2019s James said he started paying closer attention to Reddit over the past month and now looks at trading-related subreddits daily. Over the past week, he has looked at it a few times a day.  Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, said the volume of retail trades was significant and it was important to be aware.  \u201cI\u2019m not taking advice from \u2018WallStreet1,\u2019\u201d Saluzzi said, referring to anonymous posters on Reddit. \u201cBut if something is going on - they\u2019re active in the morning, and that creates momentum.

The FBI\u2019s San Francisco division is leading an inquiry into the Twitter hacking, it said in a statement, as more Washington lawmakers called for an accounting of how it happened.  The law enforcement agency said hackers committed cryptocurrency fraud after they seized control of the Twitter accounts of celebrities and political figures including Joe Biden, Kim Kardashian, Barack Obama and Elon Musk.  A day after the breach, it was not clear if the hackers were able to see private messages sent by account holders, although Twitter said it had no evidence that attackers had been able to access passwords.  The company said in a statement that it was continuing to lock accounts that had changed passwords in the past month, but said \u201cwe believe only a small subset of these locked accounts were compromised.\u201d Twitter declined to comment on the job search.  In a sign of how much the attack unnerved U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans showed rare bipartisan agreement that Twitter must better explain how the security lapse happened and what it was doing to prevent future attacks.  \u201cThis hack bodes ill for November balloting,\u201d U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement scolding Twitter for \u201cits repeated security lapses and failure to safeguard accounts.\u201d  Echoing a similar sentiment, Representative Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, asked what would happen if Twitter allowed a similar incident to occur on Nov. 2, a day before the U.S. presidential election.  Jordan said he remained locked out of his Twitter account as of Thursday afternoon.  President Donald Trump, a prolific Twitter user, was planning to continue tweeting and his account was not jeopardized during the attack, spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said.  The White House had been in \u201cconstant contact with Twitter over the last 18 hours\u201d to keep Trump\u2019s Twitter feed secure, she said.  Twitter said hackers had targeted employees with access to its internal systems and \u201cused this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts.\u201d  Other high-profile accounts that were hacked included rapper Kanye West, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O founder Jeff Bezos, investor Warren Buffett, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O co-founder Bill Gates, and the corporate accounts for Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N and Apple Inc AAPL.O.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The company, which has been without a security chief since December, said the hackers conducted a \u201ccoordinated social engineering attack\u201d against its employees.  Several security experts researching the case said that they believed the hackers were primarily interested in prestige Twitter accounts with one- or two-digit handles, such as @6.  Such accounts were among the first ones hacked Wednesday, even before the bitcoin requests, and control of handles was advertised in one forum for enthusiasts of accounts active since Twitter\u2019s early days.  Access to the employee tool could have spread beyond that group.  In an extraordinary step, Twitter temporarily prevented many verified accounts from publishing messages as it investigated the breach.  The second and third rounds of hijacked accounts tweeted out messages telling users to send bitcoin to a given address in order to get more back. Publicly available blockchain records show the apparent scammers received more than $100,000 worth of cryptocurrency.  As of Thursday, Twitter was continuing to block tweets containing the bitcoin addresses the scammers had used. Facebook Inc FB.O appeared to have enabled a similar security feature on its Messenger service temporarily on Wednesday, but did not respond to queries on whether it had also been targeted in the attack.  Twitter\u2019s shares fell a little more than 1% on Thursday.  CEO Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday that it was a \u201ctough day\u201d for everyone at Twitter and pledged to share \u201ceverything we can when we have a more complete understanding of exactly what happened\u201d.  Dorsey\u2019s assurances did not assuage Washington\u2019s concerns about social media companies, whose policies have come under scrutiny by critics on both the left and the right.  Frank Pallone, a Democrat who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee that oversees a sizeable portion of U.S. tech policy, said the company needed to explain how the hack took place.

Twitter\u2019s Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said the growth in monetizable daily active usage (mDAU) was driven by product improvements, including making the site easier to navigate and more proactively identifying abusive content for removal.  Twitter\u2019s revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $824 million, missing Wall Street expectations of $874 million, based on IBES data from Refinitiv. Total advertising revenue was $702 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year.  Third-quarter net income was $37 million, or $0.05 per share. In the same period last year, the firm reported net income of $789 million, or $106 million when adjusted to exclude certain items.  Analysts had expected net income of $161.5 million.  Twitter had forecast that third quarter revenue growth would lag the first two quarters, partly due to ending some older ad formats. But it also encountered unexpected problems, such as bugs which impacted its ability to target ads and share data with ad partners, and fewer big events compared with the previous summer.  For the fourth quarter, Twitter expects total revenue to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.  Twitter has stopped disclosing its monthly active users count, instead reporting mDAU, a metric it created to measure users exposed on a daily basis to advertising through the site or Twitter applications that are able to show ads.  The company\u2019s average mDAU hit 145 million, beating analyst expectations of 141 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This alternative metric was up 17% year-over-year.  In July, Twitter launched a more personalized desktop Twitter.com as part of its efforts to make the platform better for conversations. It has also experimented with the ability to follow topics, and has recently expanded testing for a feature to hide replies.  Recently, the company made 6-second video bidding available for global advertisers and it has continued to expand its live and on-demand video partnerships, including deals with NBC Olympics and Eurosport for coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Games.  Twitter and other social media platforms have also recently come under scrutiny over their ad policies.  Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google were this month criticized by U.S. democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden, for allowing politicians to run ads containing false or misleading claims.  In August, Twitter announced it would no longer accept advertising from state-controlled news media outlets, shortly after it came under fire for showing ads from Chinese state-controlled media that criticized the Hong Kong protesters.  Twitter also faced heat over its handling of user data when it said in October that email addresses and phone numbers uploaded by users to meet its security requirements may have been \u2018inadvertently\u2019 used for advertising purposes.  Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 17% year-over-year to $780 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees.  The company expects fourth-quarter operating income to be between $130 million and $170 million.","50":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N will add labels and warning messages on some tweets with disputed or misleading information about COVID-19, the company said on Monday, as part of a new approach to misinformation that will eventually extend to other topics.  Twitter\u2019s new labels will provide links to more information in cases where the risk of harm from the tweet is not severe enough to be removed but people could be confused or misled, Twitter said in a blog post.  The company said that depending on the propensity for harm and type of misleading information in the tweet, warnings may also be added to say the tweet conflicts with guidance from public health experts before a user views it.  Twitter said these labels, which will look similar to ones launched to flag synthetic and manipulated media, will also apply to tweets that have been sent before Twitter\u2019s announcement and will be used regardless of who sent the tweet.  Social media sites, including Facebook Inc FB.O and YouTube, the video service of Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, are under pressure to combat misinformation that has spread on their platforms about the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus.  Such false claims have ranged from bogus cures to misinformation linking the virus with conspiracy theories about high-profile figures such as Microsoft co-founder turned philanthropist Bill Gates or about 5G mobile phone technology.  Social media giant Facebook\u2019s third-party fact-checking partners, which include Reuters, rate and debunk viral content on the site with labels and last month, YouTube said it would also start showing information panels with third-party, fact-checked articles for U.S. video search results.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Twitter\u2019s labels will link to a Twitter-curated page or external trusted source containing additional information.  \u201cOne of the differences in our approach here is that we\u2019re not waiting for a third party to have made a cast-iron decision one way or another,\u201d said Twitter\u2019s public policy director Nick Pickles.  \u201cWe\u2019re reflecting the debate, rather than stating the outcome of a deliberation,\u201d he added.  Twitter said it would not take action on tweets with information unconfirmed at the time of sharing, but it could place warnings or labels on disputed claims, as well as those confirmed as false.  In March, Twitter banned here tweets that go against COVID-19 guidance from public health authorities. On Monday, Twitter's head of site integrity Yoel Roth said in a call with reporters that it would continue to prioritize the removal of tweets with a call to action that could potentially cause harm, such as telling people to stop social distancing.  Roth said an example of tweets the company would now consider labeling would be those disputing the origin or nature of the virus.  \u201cWe will continue to introduce new labels to provide context around different types of unverified claims and rumors as needed,\u201d Twitter said.  It said it would use internal systems to proactively monitor tweets related to COVID-19 and rely on \u201ctrusted partners,\u201d such as non-governmental organizations and think tanks, to identify content that could cause harm.","51":"WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - The chief executives of Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc and Twitter will testify before a U.S. House panel on March 25 on \u201cmisinformation and disinformation plaguing online platforms.\u201d  A pair of House Energy and Commerce subcommittees will hold a fully remote joint hearing including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.  \u201cWhether it be falsehoods about the COVID-19 vaccine or debunked claims of election fraud, these online platforms have allowed misinformation to spread, intensifying national crises with real-life, grim consequences for public health and safety,\u201d said Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone and the chairs of the two subcommittees in a joint statement. (Reporting by David Shepardson)","52":"WASHINGTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Friday that it has permanently suspended U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s account due to the risk of further incitement of violence following the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.  The suspension of Trump\u2019s account, which had more than 88 million followers, silences his primary megaphone days before the end of his term and follows years of debate about how social media companies should moderate the accounts of powerful global leaders.  \u201cAfter close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\u201d the company said in a tweet.  It was the first time Twitter has banned a head of state, the company confirmed.  Social media companies have moved swiftly to crack down on Trump and some of his prominent right-wing allies and supporters in the wake of the turmoil in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, which led to five deaths.  Trump has repeatedly used Twitter and other platforms to claim his defeat in the Nov. 3 election was due to widespread voter fraud and to share other conspiracy theories, and had urged supporters to come to Washington on Wednesday and march on the Capitol to protest the election result.  Facebook Inc said earlier this week it was suspending his account through until at least the end of his presidential term.  The Republican president is due to hand over to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20.  In a blog post on Friday, Twitter said that two of the president\u2019s tweets posted that day were in violation of its policy against the glorification of violence.  Twitter had temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s account on Wednesday following the siege of Capitol Hill, and warned that additional violations by the president\u2019s accounts would result in a permanent suspension.  Trump was required to delete three rule-breaking tweets before his account was unblocked. He returned to Twitter on Thursday with a video acknowledging that Biden would be the next U.S. president.  Twitter said that Trump\u2019s tweet that he would not be attending Biden\u2019s inauguration was being received by a number of his supporters as confirmation that the November election was not legitimate.  It said another tweet praising \u201cAmerican Patriots\u201d and saying his supporters \u201cwill not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\u201d could be seen as \u201cfurther indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an orderly transition.\u201d  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Critics of major social media platforms, including top Democratic politicians, praised Twitter\u2019s move and said it was long overdue, while Trump supporters expressed outrage.  The president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., in a tweet on Friday decried the ban, saying dictators who had threatened genocide continued to have Twitter accounts. He did not provide names.  The White House had no immediate direct comment. The Trump campaign\u2019s Twitter account criticized the company for \u201csilencing\u201d the president of the United States.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Using the @POTUS account, Trump said he would look at building his own platform.  \u2018LOOTING AND SHOOTING\u2019  Trump\u2019s prolific use of social media helped propel him to the White House in 2016. He has used his personal @realDonaldTrump account, which has sometimes tweeted more than 100 times a day, to reach supporters, spread misinformation and even fire staff.  In a 2017 interview on Fox Business, Trump said \u201cI doubt I would be here if it weren\u2019t for social media, to be honest with you,\u201d according to a transcript released by the network.  Both Twitter and Facebook have long afforded Trump special privileges as a world leader, saying that tweets that may violate the company\u2019s policies would not be removed because they were in the public interest. They said he would lose access to those privileges upon leaving office, however.  Twitter last year started labeling and putting warnings on Trump\u2019s tweets that broke its rules against glorifying violence, manipulated media or sharing potentially misleading information about voting processes. [nL1N2D82QQ]  In May, Twitter affixed a warning label to a Trump tweet about widespread anti-racism protests over the police killing of George Floyd that included the phrase \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Facebook, which has come under fire from employees and lawmakers for not doing more about Trump\u2019s inflammatory posts, declined to act on the same message.  Trump still has access to the official @WhiteHouse and @POTUS accounts but will lose this when his presidential term ends. Asked if Trump could create another account, a Twitter spokeswoman said if the company had reason to believe he was using accounts to evade Friday\u2019s suspension, those accounts too could be suspended.","53":"FILE PHOTO: An advertisement for the Square Inc payment processor is seen outside a vendors site along the High Line in New York March 9, 2016.

The company\u2019s policy chief Vijaya Gadde said Thursday night that Twitter had decided to make changes to its hacked materials policy following feedback, but a spokesman told Reuters that the New York Post story would still be blocked for \u201cviolating the rules on private personal information.\u201d  \u201cWe will no longer remove hacked content unless it is directly shared by hackers or those acting in concert with them,\u201d Gadde said in a series of tweets. \u201cWe will label Tweets to provide context instead of blocking links from being shared on Twitter.\u201d  Twitter had initially said the Post story violated its \u201chacked materials\u201d policy, which bars the distribution of content obtained through hacking, but has provided no details on what materials it viewed as hacked.  Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a tweet Friday morning that \u201cstraight blocking of URLs was wrong\u201d and suggested that Twitter instead should have applied tools like labels.  \u201cOur goal is to attempt to add context, and now we have capabilities to do that,\u201d he tweeted.  Tweets of the story successfully published on Friday did not have any labels attached. Twitter declined to answer Reuters questions on whether that was due to an error or a policy decision.  The company had briefly restricted the Twitter account of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign after it posted a video that referred to the New York Post story on Thursday.  U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley said on Thursday the committee would vote on Tuesday on sending a subpoena to Dorsey.

In an unprecedented spree, the unidentified attackers on Wednesday hijacked the accounts of politicians, celebrities and billionaires, using them to solicit bitcoin transfers to a string of digital wallets.  A digital wallet used to consolidate the bitcoin has previously been linked with crypto firms including merchant service providers, U.S. blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis told Reuters - a clue that could aid investigators.  \u201cThey have interacted with service providers that have know-your-customer processes, and law enforcement can work with those service providers to find out who can be behind those accounts,\u201d spokeswoman Maddie Kennedy said, declining to give further details.  Twitter declined to comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which sources told Reuters is leading a federal inquiry into the Twitter hacking, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bitcoin allows users to send and receive funds without revealing their personal identity. Yet its movements are recorded on the blockchain, a publicly viewable digital ledger that underpins the crypto currency.  By tracing illicit bitcoin to exchanges and crypto payment firms where identification is required, investigators can potentially pinpoint criminal suspects.  \u201cIn bitcoin it\u2019s very difficult to transact without leaving some clues on the blockchain,\u201d said Tom Robinson of Elliptic, a London-based blockchain analysis firm.

His administration has faced criticism for its lax approach to mask-wearing and social distancing in the White House. At least 11 close Trump aides have tested positive for the coronavirus.  Opinion polls show Biden with a substantial lead nationally, although with a narrower advantage in some of the states that may decide the Nov. 3 election outcome.  \u201cNow you have a president who doesn\u2019t have to hide in the basement, like his opponent,\u201d Trump said in a shot at Biden, who he has mocked for wearing a mask and keeping a light, socially distanced campaign schedule.  Trump addressed supporters from a White House balcony on Saturday afternoon, urging a crowd of hundreds of largely Black and Latino supporters to help get out the vote.  Standing alone at the event, Trump was not wearing a mask as he spoke. In the crowd, most were wearing masks but not following social distancing guidelines.

Biden was off the campaign trail on Sunday, attending church in his home state of Delaware and addressing a virtual fundraiser where he told donors the country was being \u201cripped apart\u201d by Trump\u2019s divisive policies.  Trump repeated on Sunday his past calls for states to reopen their economies even as the pandemic shows little sign of abating. New cases of COVID-19 in the United States hit a two-month high on Friday.  Nationally, the United States is reporting on average 48,000 new cases a day and coronavirus hospitalizations in the Midwest hit a record for a sixth day in a row on Saturday, according to a Reuters analysis.","67":"FILE PHOTO: The Twitter App loads on an iPhone in this illustration photograph taken in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N said on Wednesday it had removed 130 accounts, as they were attempting to disrupt the public conversation during the first U.S. presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.  Twitter removed the accounts, which appeared to originate in Iran, \"based on intel\" provided by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it said in a tweet here.  The accounts had very low engagement and did not make an impact on the public conversation, the social media giant said, adding, that the accounts and their content will be published in full once the investigation is complete.  One of the tweet was worded \u201care You watching For Fun too?\u201d, showing graphical representation on why voters would plan to watch the debate, according to a sample tweet shared by Twitter.  Last week, Twitter said it worked with Facebook Inc FB.O to identify and remove 350 accounts which could be used by Russia's intelligence services to leak hacked documents as part of efforts to disrupt the upcoming U.S. election.  Both companies said one of the networks had been identified following a tip from the FBI, which warned that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to spread disinformation about the results of the Nov. 3 election.  Over the last two years, since the 2018 U.S. midterm election, senior U.S. intelligence officials have openly predicted that hackers associated with Russia, China, Iran and North Korea would attempt to target the 2020 U.S. presidential election.  Social media companies have long been under pressure to combat misinformation after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia used their platforms to meddle in the 2016 vote, allegations that Moscow has denied.","68":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N on Thursday placed a warning label on a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump, saying his post included potentially misleading information about the mail-in voting process.  \u201cBecause of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to \u201cvoters\u201d, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want. Another election disaster yesterday. Stop Ballot Madness!,\u201d Trump tweeted.  The president has in recent months assailed the voting process without evidence, saying it could result in widespread fraud, although millions of Americans, including much of the military, have cast absentee ballots by mail for years without such problems.  The process is seen as a way to limit exposure to the coronavirus, though the system to do so will vary from state to state.  Twitter\u2019s warning label redirected users to a curated page, \u201cVoting by mail is legal and safe, experts and data confirm\u201d, which contained more information on mail-in voting.  The social network has previously attached labels to tweets posted and shared by the president, including adding fact-checking notices on his tweets.

Earlier this month Twitter reported that sales in Japan jumped 34 percent in the last three months of 2017, compared with a year earlier, to $106 million.  In Japan, Twitter\u2019s success in converting users into revenue - a problem that has vexed the social network since its founding - has raised hopes it might lead to broader growth across the company. Investors and analysts, however, point to Japan-specific factors that may not be replicable elsewhere.  The company seems to be innovating at a local level instead of simply localizing U.S. services, as is common at other tech firms, said Ryo Sakai, a senior planner for the interactive media division at Asatsu-DK Inc 9747.T, Japan's third-largest advertising agency.  \u201cI get the impression that Twitter has, in the past year or two, been responding flexibly to advertisers\u2019 requests,\u201d he said.  At the same time, the company has attracted more eyes in Japan: user numbers rose to about 45 million in October from about 40 million just over a year earlier.  The reasons for that are complex, but ad industry executives say Twitter\u2019s policy of allowing aliases and the idea of tweeting - sometimes translated as \u201cmuttering\u201d in Japanese - allows Japanese users to express their opinions in a culture that tends to be outwardly reserved.  FILE PHOTO: The Twitter application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  \u201cThere is an ease to anonymity,\u201d says Motohiko Tokuriki, chief marketing officer at Agile Media Network, which advises companies on the use of social media.  Twitter has moved beyond text and pictures, offering rich video advertising options and providing an alternative to rivals such as Facebook Inc FB.O, says Shinya Kobori, manager for the Twitter group at Dentsu Digital Inc, part of Japan's largest advertising agency, Dentsu Inc 4324.T.  The popularity of video on Twitter has been evident during the Winter Olympics. National broadcaster NHK\u2019s video of figure skater Yuzuru Hanyu\u2019s gold-medal-winning short program was watched more than 4 million times and shared 125,000 times.  Facebook, which lagged home-grown rival Mixi Inc 2121.T in the early days of social networks, has failed to dominate Japan as it has in the United States and Europe.  Twitter now makes $2.36 per Japanese user, compared with $5.97 per user in the United States, according to data from the fourth quarter of 2017. That is nearly twice the $1.24 in revenue per non-U.S. user overall.  Twitter has continued to grow its Japanese mobile user base over the last 18 months even as Facebook struggles to expand its app users numbers, data from Nielsen shows.  And for advertisers targeting a population that has tuned out television, Twitter offers an attractive option: around three quarters of Japanese students over the age of 18 use it, compared with around a quarter on Facebook, according to Nielsen.  With smartphones \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d used for social activities like watching video, demand for video advertising has been \u201cexplosive\u201d says Masahiro Ajisawa, Japan-based senior director at Twitter Client Solutions.  Japanese consumers were late to embrace smartphones but have accelerated their purchases, with domestic sales hitting a record high of 32 million units last year, data from the Tokyo-based MM Research Institute shows.  Under the Twitter model, advertisers pay to push their tweets into the feeds of users who may watch the video, retweet to their followers or click through to the advertiser\u2019s website.  Many of the websites of traditional media lack the latest ad options, and video-savvy net media have not taken root to the same extent in Japan as in countries like the U.S., said Yoshiya Nakamura, executive analyst at Nielsen Digital.Digital spending is on the rise, with the ad market for internet media growing 15 percent to 1.5 trillion yen in 2017 - its fourth straight year of double-digit expansion - compared with a 2.3 percent fall to 2.8 trillion yen for traditional media, according to Dentsu.  The importance of Japan to Twitter is reflected by its choice to be one of three countries, along with the U.S. and the U.K., chosen for Twitter\u2019s new \u201cpromote mode,\u201d a subscription service that allows smaller business to pay to boost their tweets.  Although Twitter expects its Japan growth to continue, it is less clear whether the success will be replicable elsewhere.  One possibility could be the Middle East, where revenue per user remains low despite a large number of users, said Ross Gerber, chief executive of U.S. investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.","75":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who closely follows tech issues, pressed Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey on Friday on whether a company employee had been paid to assist with a hack of high-profile accounts this week aimed at scamming readers.

The company said the work it was doing to clean up Twitter by purging automated and spam accounts had some impact on user metrics in the second quarter, and that it was deciding to prioritize tackling suspicious accounts and reducing hate speech and other abusive content over projects that could attract more users.  Allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election by spreading misleading or divisive content over social media have made the issue of improving control over accounts and content critical for Twitter.  Twitter, like bigger rival Facebook has been under pressure from regulators in several countries to weed out hate speech, abusive content and misinformation, better protect user data and boost transparency on political ad spending.  The user outlook came as Twitter reported higher-than-expected revenue thanks to the FIFA World Cup, video ads and booming international ad revenue. Twitter also earns revenue from licensing its data.  The quarter marked the first time overseas revenue contributed the majority of Twitter\u2019s ad sales.  The World Cup brought in $30 million of revenue in the quarter. But Chief Financial Office Ned Segal told analysts that the event, which carried into the third quarter, raked in less revenue in its second two weeks.  Twitter raised its 2018 capital spending forecast and said adjusted EBITDA margins in the third quarter would be below the second quarter\u2019s.  Twitter shares tumbled 19 percent to $34.75 in afternoon trading, marking their biggest one-day drop since Oct. 6, 2016.  The drop echoed that of Facebook on Thursday, when its shares ended down nearly 19 percent after the company said spending to improve privacy and slower user growth in big markets would hit margins for years.  The reaction in Twitter shares to the user outlook may be overblown, some analysts said.  FILE PHOTO: People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken September 27, 2013. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel\/Illustration\/File Photo  Twitter executives answered questions on the earnings call by saying the steps to improve daily user and advertiser experience would be a long-term boost for the company, and that there had been no revenue hit.  Revenue of $711 million rose 24 percent from last year and exceeded the average estimate of $696 million.  Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement that daily users grew 11 percent compared to a year ago, showing that addressing \u201cproblem behaviors\u201d was turning the service into a daily utility. The company does not disclose daily users.  Segal said the efforts to improve accounts along with other factors had a negative hit to monthly active users of 3 million in the quarter, which compares with the 1 million net decline, but added that efforts to improve quality of the accounts would take an even bigger bite out of third-quarter monthly users.  Twitter said in a blog post in early July that weeding out accounts would not hurt metrics because the accounts would mostly be inactive.  FEWER MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS  Monthly active users fell by 1 million in the second quarter from the first to 335 million. Analysts expected a gain of 1 million users, and the results could harden concerns Twitter lacks a clear strategy to fix platform problems and grow usage and revenue together.  \u201cWe are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility,\u201d the company said in a shareholder letter. Twitter refers to platform \u201chealth\u201d when describing the spam and other issues.  Twitter said the decline in the third quarter would be in the mid-single-digit millions, suggesting a sequential decline to around 330 million users. Analysts had expected 340 million monthly active users in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Twitter\u2019s relations with advertisers have been strained by concerns about phony accounts bought by users to boost their following.  Profit was $100 million, with a $42 million boost due to a tax benefit. Non-GAAP earnings of 17 cents per share were in-line with estimates.  \u201cInvestors are overreacting to (monthly active user) trends,\u201d BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said about the share fall. \u201cThis is an identical overreaction that we saw in Q2 last year. Last year\u2019s Q2 created an incredible buying opportunity in the stock.\u201d  Twitter said it lost some users due to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe in May but did not note any revenue impact.  Twitter also saw usage fall after saying it would not subsidize messaging fees for users who accessed its app through text messages.  The new capital expenditures forecast is for between $450 million and $500 million, up from $375 million to $450 million, as Twitter expands and upgrades the computer infrastructure underlying its service. The company again flagged its push to increase headcount this year.  Costs related to licensing video and automated analysis of user data increased overall expenses 10 percent compared with a year ago.  Twitter has said increased video programming, including news shows and live sports, and investing in technology that automatically surfaces interesting content with limited user intervention should make the service appealing to first-timers.","80":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Square Inc SQ.N, the payments company led by Twitter Inc TWTR.N chief executive Jack Dorsey, is refiling its application with U.S. state and federal regulators for a bank license, the company said on Wednesday.

The meeting, which was organized by the White House last week, came hours after Trump again attacked the social media company over his allegations it is biased against conservatives.  \u201cGreat meeting this afternoon at the @WhiteHouse with @Jack from @Twitter. Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform, and the world of social media in general. Look forward to keeping an open dialogue!\u201d Trump tweeted, posting a photo of Dorsey and others with him in the Oval Office.  Dorsey, who had not previously met with Trump, replied in a tweet: \u201cThank you for the time. Twitter is here to serve the entire public conversation, and we intend to make it healthier and more civil. Thanks for the discussion about that.\u201d  The source, who was briefed on the meeting that included Twitter\u2019s general counsel and public policy chief, said Dorsey explained in response to Trump\u2019s concerns about losing followers that the company was working to remove fraudulent and spam accounts and that many famous people, including Dorsey himself, had lost followers as a result.  Earlier on Tuesday, Trump suggested Twitter was biased against him, without providing evidence. He wrote on Twitter that the company does not \u201ctreat me well as a Republican. Very discriminatory.\u201d  Trump has been upset about losing followers. Trump lost 204,000, or 0.4 percent, of his 53.4 million followers in July, according to social media data firm Keyhole, when Twitter started its purge of suspicious accounts after it and other social media services were used in misinformation campaigns attempting to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and other elections.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In October, Trump wrote that \u201cTwitter has removed many people from my account and, more importantly, they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship, now it is a Blimp! Total Bias?\u201d  Shares in Twitter jumped 13 percent on Tuesday after it reported quarterly revenue above analyst estimates, which executives said was the result of weeding out spam and abusive posts and targeting ads better.  Trump has one of the most-followed accounts on Twitter. But the president and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly criticized the company and its social media competitors for what they have called bias against conservatives, something Twitter denies.  Democratic U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono said earlier this month: \u201cWe cannot allow the Republican party to harass tech companies into weakening content moderation policies that already fail to remove hateful, dangerous and misleading content.\u201d  Carlos Monje, Twitter\u2019s public policy director, said at a Senate hearing earlier this month the site \u201cdoes not use political viewpoints, perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions, whether related to automatically ranking content on our service or how we develop or enforce our rules.\u201d","82":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Tuesday released plans for its new policy on how people are \u201cverified\u201d on the site, an area the company has long promised to revamp to address confusion and criticisms over the blue check-mark badges it uses to authenticate the identity of prominent accounts.  FILE PHOTO: People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken September 27, 2013. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel\/Illustration  The social media company said in a blog post here that it plans to relaunch its verification program, including a new public application process, in early 2021. It said a public feedback period for the new policy would open on Tuesday and run until Dec. 8.  Twitter said it paused public submissions for verification in 2017 after hearing feedback that the program \u201cfelt arbitrary and confusing to many people.\u201d It said at the time the check mark was being confused with \u201can endorsement or an indicator of importance.\u201d  A year later, Twitter said it was putting fixes to the verification program on the back burner to focus on issues like election integrity, though it has continued to verify some accounts, such as medical experts tweeting about COVID-19 this year.  \u201cSince then, we haven\u2019t been clear about who can become verified and when, why an account might be unverified, or what it means to be verified,\u201d Twitter said in the Tuesday blog post.  The company laid out more detailed criteria here for the \"core types\" of notable, active accounts it will verify, such as government officials, companies, nonprofits, news organizations, entertainers, sports teams, athletes and activists.  Twitter said it also may verify accounts that meet other standards such as being one of the top-followed accounts in the user\u2019s country and having \u201coff-Twitter notability,\u201d which could be assessed through Google search trends, Wikipedia references or coverage in news outlets.  The company said it may cut the blue badge from accounts that severely or repeatedly violate rules, such as its policies on hateful conduct, civic integrity or glorification of violence. But it said these removals would not be automatic and would be assessed case by case.  Twitter also released proposed grounds for denying verification, for example, accounts that have been locked out for violating rules in the last six months or accounts of individuals associated with hateful content or who have been found to have committed \u201cgross human rights violations.\u201d  Twitter aims to introduce the final policy on Dec. 17. It also indicated plans for more ways for users to identify themselves with new account types and labels.","83":"May 29 (Reuters) - Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was informed in advance by the company\u2019s staff of a decision to tag a tweet by President Donald Trump as \u201cglorifying violence\u201d, a spokeswoman for the company said.  \u201cThe decision was made jointly by teams within Twitter, and our CEO Jack Dorsey was informed of the plan before the Tweet was labelled,\u201d the spokeswoman said in an email.

Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) also said on Friday it had sent a preliminary decision to Facebook-owned WhatsApp for their submissions and made further progress in three other investigations related to Facebook.  Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology firms, making the DPC the EU\u2019s lead regulator under the bloc\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\u2019s (GDPR) \u201cOne Stop Shop\u201d regime introduced in 2018.  The new rules give regulators the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.  Under GDPR, the DPC must share its preliminary decision with all concerned EU supervisory authorities and consider their views in its final verdict. Each of the bloc\u2019s regulators may be called on for a majority decision if agreement cannot be reached.  The DPC is not commenting on the substance of the preliminary Twitter decision at this point, Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle told Reuters.  The Twitter ruling relates to a 2019 probe into a bug in its Android app, where some users\u2019 protected tweets were made public. Twitter is the subject of two of the 20 other inquiries the DPC had open into big tech firms at the end of 2019.  Facebook has come under most scrutiny, with eight individual probes, plus two into WhatsApp and one into Facebook-owned Instagram.  The DPC said it had moved to the decision-making phase of a complaint-based inquiry which focuses on Facebook Ireland\u2019s obligations to establish a lawful basis for personal data processing.  It said it had also sent draft inquiry reports to the complainants and companies concerned in two further inquiries concerning Instagram and WhatsApp. (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Mark Potter)","86":"(Corrects paragraph 7 to show adjusted EBITDA margin forecast is for the third quarter not the full year)  * Social media firms under pressure to control content  * Monthly users fell 1 million quarter-on-quarter  * Twitter says gained daily users over a year ago  * Shares down 17 pct in morning trading  By Meredith Mazzilli  NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Friday reported fewer monthly active users than analysts expected and warned the closely-watched figure could keep falling as it deletes phony accounts, sending shares tumbling.  The company said the work it was doing to clean up Twitter by purging automated and spam accounts had some impact on user metrics in the second quarter, and that it was deciding to prioritize improving suspicious accounts and reducing hate speech and other abusive content over projects that could attract more users.  Twitter, like bigger rival Facebook Inc, has been under pressure from regulators in several countries to weed out hate speech, abusive content and misinformation, better protect user data and boost transparency on political ad spending.  The user outlook came as Twitter reported higher-than-expected revenue thanks to the FIFA World Cup, video ads and booming international ad revenue. Twitter also earns revenue from licensing its data.  The quarter marked the first time overseas revenue contributed the majority of Twitter\u2019s ad sales.  The World Cup brought in $30 million of revenue in the quarter. But Chief Financial Office Ned Segal told analysts that the event, which carried into the third quarter, raked in less revenue in its second two weeks.  Twitter raised its 2018 capital spending forecast and estimated third-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 33 percent to 34 percent, suggesting worsening margins.  Twitter shares tumbled 17 percent to $36.24 in morning trading.  The drop echoed that of Facebook on Thursday, when its shares ended down nearly 19 percent after the company said spending to improve privacy and slower user growth in big markets would hit margins for years.  The reaction in Twitter shares to the user outlook may be overblown, some analysts said.  Twitter executives answered questions on the earnings call by saying the steps to improve user and advertiser experience would be a long-term boost for the company, and that there had been no revenue hit.  FEWER MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS  Monthly active users fell by 1 million in the second quarter from the first to 335 million. Analysts expected a gain of 1 million users, and the results could harden concerns Twitter lacks a clear strategy to fix platform problems and grow usage and revenue together.  \u201cWe are making active decisions to prioritize health initiatives over near-term product improvements that may drive more usage of Twitter as a daily utility,\u201d the company said in a shareholder letter. Twitter refers to platform \u201chealth\u201d when describing the spam and other issues.  Twitter said the decline in the third quarter would be in the mid-single-digit millions, suggesting a sequential decline to around 330 million users. Analysts had expected 340 million monthly active users in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement that daily users grew 11 percent compared to a year ago, showing that addressing \u201cproblem behaviors\u201d was turning the service into a daily utility.  The company does not disclose daily users.  Twitter\u2019s relations with advertisers have been strained by concerns about phony accounts bought by users to boost their following.  Revenue of $711 million rose 24 percent from last year and exceeded the average estimate of $696 million.  Profit was $100 million, with a $42 million boost due to a tax benefit.  The non-GAAP earnings were 17 cents per share, in-line with estimates.  \u201cInvestors are overreacting to (monthly active user) trends,\u201d BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said about the share fall. \u201cThis is an identical overreaction that we saw in Q2 last year. Last year\u2019s Q2 created an incredible buying opportunity in the stock.\u201d  Twitter said it lost some users due to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe in May but did not note any revenue impact.  Twitter also saw usage fall after saying it would not subsidize messaging fees for users who accessed its app through text messages.  The new capital expenditures forecast is for between $450 million and $500 million, up from $375 million to $450 million, as Twitter expands and upgrades the computer infrastructure underlying its service. The company again flagged its push to increase headcount this year.  Costs related to licensing video and automated analysis of user data increased overall expenses 10 percent compared with a year ago.  Twitter has said increased video programming, including news shows and live sports, and investing in technology that automatically surfaces interesting content with limited user intervention should make the service appealing to first-timers.","87":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N is preparing a $1 billion convertible note offering, the social media hub said on Wednesday, one day after news that it would be included in the S&P 500 index sent its shares up 5 percent to a more than three-year high.  FILE PHOTO: The Twitter application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  Convertible bonds grant holders the right to exchange them for equity above a pre-established price, giving the company scope to reduce coupon payments on the debt.  The company said on Thursday the private placement of senior unsecured notes due 2024 was priced at a 0.25 percent coupon.  The offering is expected to result in about $989 million in net proceeds and settle on June 11, the company said.  There have been 22 convertible offerings by technology companies this year, raising in total almost $9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters IFR.  \u201cThe stock price has certainly turned around from where it was last year. ... The momentum in the stock may give investors a reason to at least look at this deal,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.  Twitter is taking advantage of strong investor demand for convertible bonds, which allow investors a downside-protected way to participate in the stock. Twitter\u2019s stock would need to rise to $77.64 before investors would be eligible to convert into the underlying stock.  The shares closed at $40.10 on Wednesday.  \u201cWe assume the main purpose of the new convert will be to pay off the old one,\u201d wrote Dave King, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.  Concerns about the prospect of more shares coming onto the market sent Twitter\u2019s stock down about 2 percent in premarket trade before a recovery that saw it extend Tuesday\u2019s rally.  Twitter\u2019s 0.25 percent coupon and 42.5 percent conversion premium compare with the 0.125 percent to 0.625 percent and 40 percent to 45 percent respective marketing ranges, sources told IFR on Wednesday.  That would put it at the higher end of recent conversion premiums. Only three of the 22 technology companies that issued convertible bonds this year were in that high range, according to IFR.  This is a popular strategy that other tech companies have used to offset dilution to very high share prices. For instance, financial payments processor Square SQ.N last month raised $862.5 million on the sale of a five-year convertible with a conversion premium of 42.5 percent.  Twitter said it will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to purchase call spread options to offset future dilution and to repurchase part of a convertible that matures in 2019.  That was part of a two-part convertible issue that Twitter sold in September 2014, comprised of five-year and seven-year tranches, according to IFR data.  \u201cThe timing of a convertible bond deal with the company\u2019s entrance into the S&P 500 makes sense,\u201d said King. \u201cThere will likely be a strong bid for the stock from index funds.\u201d  King said this could offset selling pressure from convertible arbitrageurs trying to establish short positions in Twitter in anticipation of going long on the new convertible bond.  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are expected to price the deal later on Wednesday, according to IFR.","88":"FILE PHOTO: The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016.

Twitter has been rolling out new features aimed at making the platform more user-friendly in the past several months, but the company\u2019s growth has lagged behind rivals for years, leaving investors grumbling that it has failed to innovate or expand beyond its core platform.  Its shares fell last year when it disclosed that its platform experienced glitches that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners.  Activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp is now pushing for changes at the company, including the removal of its chief executive Jack Dorsey.","89":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on Wednesday that banning President Donald Trump from its social media platform after last week\u2019s violence at the U.S. Capitol was the \u201cright decision,\u201d but said it sets a dangerous precedent.  A photo illustration shows the suspended Twitter account of U.S. President Donald Trump on a smartphone and a lit window in the White House residence in Washington, U.S., January 8, 2021. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts\/Illustration  San Francisco-based Twitter last week removed Trump\u2019s account, which had 88 million followers, citing the risk of further violence following the storming of the Capitol by supporters of the president.  \"Having to take these actions fragment the public conversation,\" Dorsey said on Twitter here. \"They divide us. They limit the potential for clarification, redemption, and learning. And sets a precedent I feel is dangerous: the power an individual or corporation has over a part of the global public conversation.\"  The ban drew criticism from some Republicans who said it quelled the president\u2019s right to free speech. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also warned through a spokesman that legislators, not private companies, should decide on potential curbs to free expression.  In his Twitter thread, Dorsey said that while he took no pride in the ban, \u201cOffline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all.\u201d  Even so, he added, \u201cWhile there are clear and obvious exceptions, I feel a ban is a failure of ours ultimately to promote healthy conversation.\u201d  Twitter has introduced a series of measures over the last year like labels, warnings and distribution restrictions to reduce the need for decisions about removing content entirely from the service.  Dorsey has said he believes those measures can promote more fruitful, or \u201chealthy,\u201d conversations online and lessen the impact of bad behavior.  The Twitter CEO added that bans by social media companies on Trump after last week\u2019s violence were emboldened by each other\u2019s actions even though they were not coordinated. But in the long term, the precedent set \u201cwill be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet,\u201d he said.  Supporters of Trump who has repeatedly made baseless claims challenging Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the November election, stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, trying to halt the certification by Congress of Biden\u2019s Electoral College win.  On Wednesday, Trump became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice.","90":"(Reuters) -Wall Street rose on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq closing at a record high as investors awaited a potential fiscal economic stimulus package and after the Federal Reserve repeated a pledge to keep its benchmark interest rate near zero.

Twitter\u2019s revenue and number of users have been in focus since the social media platform started deleting millions of spam or fake accounts promoting hate speech or spreading political misinformation, contributing to declines in monthly users through 2018.  Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said the platform saw an 18% drop in reports of spammy or suspicious behavior across all Tweet detail pages, which show the replies to any given Tweet on the service.  The company reported a rise in monthly active users in the first quarter, fueling speculation that Twitter was returning to growth, but has since stopped disclosing its MAU count.  Instead, this quarter it reported monetizable daily active usage (mDAU), a metric it created to measure only users exposed on a daily basis to advertising on the site and exclude those who access Twitter via aggregating sites like TweetDeck.  Its monetizable daily active usage (mDAU) hit 139 million, beating analyst expectations of 135 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe strong growth in monetizable daily active users shows that Twitter users are sticking with the platform, and that should resonate with advertisers,\u201d eMarketer senior analyst Jasmine Enberg said.

It also expanded its multimedia features, launching a Snapchat-style camera feature in the Twitter app and releasing its own long-awaited tool for clipping and publishing video.  Twitter also recently updated its policies on hateful conduct directed at religious groups and last month introduced a new policy to de-emphasize and label rule-breaking tweets from important sources like politicians, though this has not yet been used.  WEAK FORECAST, HIGHER EXPENSES  However, Twitter forecast third-quarter revenue between $815 million and $875 million, the midpoint of which was below analysts estimates of $869.3 million, partly due to ending some older ad formats.  Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 21% to $766 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees and reiterated that operating expenses would grow about 20% in 2019.  Twitter's results come against the backdrop of regulatory scrutiny against big tech and social media firms like Facebook Inc FB.O, Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Twitter has also constantly been in the spotlight due to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s prominent use, as well as criticism, of the platform.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a campaign rally at the Giant Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania, U.S., December 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Tom Brenner  A count of tweets from Trump about U.S. monetary policy suggest a detente may have taken hold between an elected leader who has lambasted Fed officials with insults like \u201cclueless\u201d and \u201cboneheads\u201d and a central bank whose rate cuts have helped buffer the economy from the administration\u2019s own unpredictable trade and tariff policies.  On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at the end of a two-day policy meeting, and signaled it was likely to keep them at the current level until at least 2021 - after the Nov. 3 presidential election in which Trump hopes to win a second term.  Though the Republican president has suggested rates need to continue falling, so far there has been no reaction from @realDonaldTrump to the latest Fed decision, and indeed the pace and tenor of his Twitter war with the central bank has eased since the Fed made what appears to be its final rate cut for now, in October.  That contrasts with what happened in the summer and early fall, when the Fed was still debating whether to cut rates at all, and at what pace.  According to tweets compiled by Trumptwitterarchive.com, a privately maintained site that is a commonly used reference for the president\u2019s twitter history, Trump used the social media platform to blast the Fed 25 times in August alone, the month when his pressure on the central bank appears to have peaked.  The Fed cut rates at its policy meetings in July, September and October. Trump tweeted about monetary policy at least 50 times during those months.  He tweeted about the Fed only twice in November and has done so three times this month. The latest were related to complaints about metal imports from Brazil and Argentina and his long-running grousing about the strength of the U.S. dollar.  \u201cThe Fed should lower rates (there is almost no inflation) and loosen making us competitive with other nations and manufacturing will SOAR! Dollar is very strong relative to others,\u201d he tweeted on Dec. 2.  Trump\u2019s language has also been more tempered of late, including a reference to his \u201cvery good & cordial meeting\u201d with Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Nov. 18, a session that came after the central bank had begun signaling it was unlikely to lower rates any further.  (Graphic: Trump's Fed tweets decline link: )  ELECTION YEAR  What changed?  After a rocky summer, and as the Fed pivoted towards easier monetary policy, stock markets rebounded to new highs, and what Trump referred to as the \u201ccrazy inverted yield curve\u201d reverted to normal as bond markets gained confidence that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy easing would avert a serious economic slowdown.  \u201cHe is more likely to lash out when stock prices are going down,\u201d said Vincent Reinhart, a former senior Fed staffer who is now chief economist at Mellon. Even if Trump\u2019s sometimes erratic trade decisions have been a chief source of economic risk this year, Reinhart said Powell and his colleagues had to react.  \u201cIf goals align, then maybe they reach a meeting of minds because of shared interest,\u201d in keeping the economic expansion underway, he said.  The test may come later next year, as Trump seeks re-election. The policy statement and projections released this week by the Fed were notable for the strong consensus reflected about the path of interest rates: 13 of 17 officials think rates will be the same at the end of 2020 as they are now, in a range of between 1.5% and 1.75%.  But the Fed\u2019s year-ahead projections more often than not miss the mark, noted Steven Blitz, chief U.S economist at TS Lombard.  \u201cWhen the Fed is this certain about policy they are usually wrong,\u201d Blitz wrote in a note after the Fed meeting this week. \u201cThe question ... for 2020 is not whether there will be a policy move, but in which direction.\u201d  Investors expect one more rate reduction next year, though likely at one of the two Fed policy meetings that would take place after the U.S. presidential election.  But if, for example, wages and prices unexpectedly accelerate in an economy with historically low unemployment, the Fed may face a new Trump backlash on Twitter if it considers hiking rates during the election year.  The Fed has never been shy about raising or lowering rates during a campaign. And in other instances where it cut rates as a way to buy \u201cinsurance\u201d and extend an ongoing expansion, it eventually reversed course as the expansion continued.  \u201cThe market is betting on a rate cut,\u201d Blitz wrote. \u201cModest growth next year and firm labor markets look more likely to flip market thinking to a tightening by the time late 2020 comes round.\u201d","106":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s recently appointed vaccine tsar, Taro Kono, is having a breakout moment.  FILE PHOTO: Japan's vaccination programme chief Taro Kono adjusts his protective face mask during a news conference on the country's preparations to begin vaccinating health workers, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Tokyo, Japan February 16, 2021. REUTERS\/Issei Kato  Twitter-savvy and educated at Georgetown University in Washington, Kono has seen his popularity surge even as the government of his boss, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, has been battered by criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Two recent opinion polls have favoured Kono, who is also the minister for administrative reform, to be the next prime minister. As Japan launches its much awaited COVID-19 vaccination campaign, his role as the logistics head of the programme has thrust him even more firmly into the spotlight.  Part of Kono\u2019s attraction, in a nation known for wooden, script-following leaders, is his ability to engage directly with voters through social media, a sharp contrast to Suga, who has been criticised for seeming stiff and aloof from voters.  In recent weeks, Kono, 58, has used Twitter to publish videos on vaccine safety, repost memes and address media reports. He frequently responds directly to followers - 2.2 million on his Japanese account and 50,000 for his English one.  Last week he posted about conferences with governors over the coronavirus, and a black mask embroidered with a dinosaur skull he had worn the previous day.  But for all his appeal to voters and a resume that includes foreign and defence minister, some in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which he would lead as premier, are wary.  \u201cHe speaks English, he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s got a media presence, and he uses social media, so that\u2019s kind of appealing,\u201d said Scott Seaman, Asia director at the Eurasia Group in Washington. \u201cBut he would still have to run the LDP. And that\u2019s a skill.\u201d  Given the LDP\u2019s majority in parliament, its leader is virtually guaranteed the premiership. Only two LDP presidents have failed to be premier during brief spells when the party was out of power - including Kono\u2019s father, Yohei.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Some say his father\u2019s being denied the top job may have helped feed the son\u2019s ambition for the post.  Kono declined a direct answer on Tuesday about whether he could work with the party if he became premier, with his current job a possible step towards that end.  \u201cMy job is the health of the Japanese people, let\u2019s not politicise this job,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s too important to politicise.\u201d  Some in the LDP feel he is too young, given the average age since 2000 for premiers to take office is roughly 62. But their concerns also include his lone-wolf character in a land that runs on consensus, as well as an outspoken streak and occasional divergence from the standard line.  Last month Kono told Reuters that \u201canything is possible\u201d regarding the Tokyo Olympics, breaking with government vows that the Games, already postponed once, will open as planned in July.  Last year, as defence minister, he suddenly cancelled deployment of the U.S.-made Aegis Ashore missile defence system without consulting others beforehand, a move that an LDP official said may have angered key ally the United States.  \u201cI wonder if he can build a good relationship with the U.S. as a result,\u201d said the official, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.  The faction-ridden LDP could prove difficult to run. Its tolerance of mavericks such as the wildly popular Junichiro Koizumi, premier from 2001 to 2006, has diminished in recent years, said political commentator Atsuo Ito.  \u201cHis bluntness will likely go over well with voters, but I\u2019m not sure how well it\u2019d work running a big organisation,\u201d added Ito.  Kono\u2019s popularity, though, may prove hard for the LDP to resist and was likely part of Suga\u2019s calculus in putting him in charge of the vaccine rollout, to gain some support himself, political analysts said, although they wondered if Suga was also trying to neutralise a political rival.  With a general election looming by October and the LDP chief\u2019s term expiring in September, putting Kono in the top job could bring big benefits for LDP candidates. But pitfalls remain, including Japan\u2019s rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.  \u201cThis is a gamble,\u201d the LDP official said. \u201cIf the vaccine doesn\u2019t go as planned, it\u2019s the end for both Suga and Kono.\u201d","107":"WASHINGTON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will unveil later on Wednesday a proposal that seeks to limit legal protections for internet platforms on managing content, a person briefed on the matter confirmed.

SEC Commissioner Robert Jackson, a Democrat, told reporters at a conference in Washington that the SEC was reasonable in suggesting greater oversight of Musk\u2019s communications, including the threat of new fines if he backslides.  \u201cThe idea (is) that we would have future oversight to prevent future problems from recurring,\u201d Jackson said.  The SEC had asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet in which the agency said he had improperly posted material information about Tesla\u2019s vehicle production outlook without seeking approval from its lawyers.  In a Friday order, the judge gave both sides until April 18 to reach a resolution. If they do not, the judge said she would decide whether to hold Musk in contempt. If he is held in contempt, the judge would allow discussions on possible sanctions. \u201cI understand those who are skeptical and who feel that it\u2019s innovative relief \u2013 to me it was important relief and I thought enforcement took very reasonable steps, both to the nature of the relief and our oversight of that relief,\u201d added Jackson of the judge\u2019s order.  The SEC, which had sued Tesla, asked the company in September to consider removing Musk. The CEO agreed to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman in an agreement that also required preapproval of Musk\u2019s written communications that could be material to the company, such as volumes of cars produced or other information likely to change the value of its securities. In a statement by Tesla on Thursday, Musk said \u201cthe tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement.\u201d  The SEC said the first of the Feb. 19 tweets conflicted with Tesla\u2019s Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.  At the time the SEC also said Musk had violated their agreement by sending a tweet that had not been vetted by Tesla\u2019s lawyers and he should be held in contempt. It did not say what penalties it wanted imposed, raising the question of whether it would again seek his removal or propose less drastic measures.","109":"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Tuesday it is launching tweets that disappear after 24 hours for all users, similar to the stories feature popular on Snapchat and Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app Instagram.

Twitter temporarily blocked the @TeamTrump account from sending tweets after it posted a video about Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s son that it said violated its rules.  The video referred to a New York Post story from Wednesday that contained alleged details of Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with a Ukrainian energy company and said the former vice president had met with an adviser of the company.  Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement that Republican-led Senate committees have previously concluded that Joe Biden engaged in no wrongdoing related to Ukraine. He also denied such a meeting had taken place.  A Twitter spokesman said earlier on Thursday that the @TeamTrump account, and the accounts of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and the New York Post, had been blocked from tweeting because of the company\u2019s policies on hacked materials and posting private information. He said the accounts may need to delete the rule-breaking posts to continue tweeting.  Twitter policy chief Vijaya Gadde said late on Thursday the company has decided to make changes to its hacked materials policy following feedback on its enforcement earlier.  \"We will no longer remove hacked content unless it is directly shared by hackers or those acting in concert with them,\" Gadde said in a tweet here. \"We will label Tweets to provide context instead of blocking links from being shared on Twitter.\"  Twitter also said that despite the new policy the New York Post story would still be blocked. A company spokesman said the stories would still be blocked for \u201cviolating the rules on private personal information.\u201d  The Trump campaign, with 2.2 million followers, was sending tweets again on Thursday afternoon. It said in a new tweet it was \u201cre-posting the video Twitter doesn\u2019t want you to watch.\u201d A Twitter spokesman told Reuters that the site would not take action as alterations to the video meant it no longer violated its policies.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to all end up in a big lawsuit and there are things that can happen that are very severe that I\u2019d rather not see happen, but it\u2019s probably going to have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about the move by Twitter.  McEnany likewise began tweeting again on Thursday, saying she regained access after deleting her post on the report.  Both Facebook Inc and Twitter took proactive steps on Wednesday to restrict dissemination of the Post story in the hours after it was published.  Facebook reduced how often the story shows up in users\u2019 news feeds and elsewhere on the platform, an action spokesman Andy Stone said the company takes temporarily pending fact checker review \u201cif we have signals that a piece of content is false.\u201d  Facebook did not respond to Reuters questions on whether its fact-checking partners were working on rating the Post\u2019s story.

Pai said on Thursday the agency will move forward to set new rules to clarify the meaning of the provision.  The calls to reform Section 230 and penalize tech companies have been intensifying but it is unlikely there will be action on the law by Congress this year.","112":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Friday that it has banned ads from Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, saying the cyber-security company\u2019s business model conflicts with advertising rules and citing U.S. government claims that Kaspersky has ties to Russian intelligence agencies.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Twitter confirmed the ban in an email to Reuters after Kaspersky Lab co-founder Eugene Kaspersky disclosed the development in a blog post on Friday, saying that the company learned of the ban in early January.  The ban follows charges by Washington that Kaspersky Lab has close ties to intelligence agencies in Moscow and its software could be used to enable Russian spying, which prompted the Trump administration to ban its products from U.S. government networks.  Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied those allegations, saying it will open up its code for inspection so that experts can hunt for vulnerabilities in its products that could be exploited by intelligence agencies, and it has asked a U.S. federal court to overturn the American ban.  Eugene Kaspersky said in his blog post that he was surprised by Twitter\u2019s ban and asked the company to reconsider.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t violated any written \u2013 or unwritten \u2013 rules, and our business model is quite simply the same template business model that\u2019s used throughout the whole cybersecurity industry: We provide users with products and services, and they pay us for them,\u201d he said.  Department of Homeland Security cyber-security official Jeanette Manfra said her agency has not instructed U.S. companies to punish Kaspersky.  \u201cWe laid out a very transparent process and how we came to our decision,\u201d to ban Kaspersky products from government networks, she said at a panel at the RSA security conference in San Francisco. \u201cI would defer to the companies for how they made their decisions.\u201d  Kaspersky said in an email that Twitter was the only social media company to ban its ads.  But other social media companies have taken action regarding Kaspersky Lab.  Facebook Inc in January said it had removed Kaspersky Lab from a list of anti-virus offerings to users.  When asked to explain its ban, Twitter said in an email, \u201cThis decision is based on our determination that Kaspersky Lab operates using a business model that inherently conflicts with acceptable Twitter Ads business practices.\u201d  Twitter also said it was responding to a Department of Homeland Security warning of a threat to national security posed by Russian government access to Kaspersky products.  It is rare for Twitter to ban specific advertisers. In October it banned Russian media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, accusing them of interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Last month, Twitter banned cryptocurrency ads.","113":"A digital rights attorney who has represented the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Buzzfeed Inc and the Freedom of the Press Foundation has joined Twitter as its director, product counsel.

FILE PHOTO: The Twitter logo and binary cyber codes are seen in this illustration taken November 26, 2019. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Twitter Inc and the FBI are investigating the breach that allowed hackers to repeatedly tweet from verified accounts of the likes of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg.  Twitter said on Saturday that the perpetrators \"manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials\" to log into tools and turn over access to 45 accounts. here On Wednesday, it said that the hackers could have read direct messages to and from 36 accounts but did not identify the affected users.  The former employees familiar with Twitter security practices said that too many people could have done the same thing, more than 1,000 as of earlier in 2020, including some at contractors like Cognizant.  Twitter declined to comment on that figure and would not say whether the number declined before the hack or since. The company was looking for a new security head, working to better secure its systems and training employees on resisting tricks from outsiders, Twitter said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.  \u201cThat sounds like there are too many people with access,\u201d said Edward Amoroso, former chief security officer at AT&T. Responsibilities among the staff should have been split up, with access rights limited to those responsibilities and more than one person required to agree to make the most sensitive account changes. \u201cIn order to do cyber security right, you can\u2019t forget the boring stuff.\u201d  Threats from insiders, especially lower-paid outside support staff, are a constant worry for companies serving large numbers of users, cyber security experts said. They said that the greater the number of people who can change key settings, the stronger oversight must be.  STUMBLES  The former employees said that Twitter had gotten better about logging the activity of its people in the wake of previous stumbles, including searches of records by an employee accused last November of spying for the government of Saudi Arabia.  But while logging helps with investigations, only alarms or constant reviews can turn logs into something that can prevent breaches.  Former Cisco Systems Chief Security Officer John Stewart said companies with broad access need to adopt a long series of mitigations and \u201cultimately ensuring that the most powerful authorized people are only doing what they are supposed to be doing.\u201d  Who exactly pulled off the hacking spree isn\u2019t clear, but outside researchers such as Allison Nixon of Unit 221B say the incident appears linked to a cluster of cybercriminals who regularly traded in novelty handles \u2013 especially rare one-or-two character account names \u2013 that are treated a bit like the vanity license plates of the online world.  Although the public evidence tying the hacking to those was circumstantial, ultra-short Twitter handles were among the first to be hijacked.  In addition, the forums where those hackers were active have long been replete with boasts about having access to Twitter insiders, according to Nixon and Nick Bax, an analyst with StopSIMCrime, a group that lobbies for greater protection against \u201cSIM swapping\u201d \u2013 a phone number hijacking technique often used by these kinds of hackers.  Bax said he had seen reference on forums to \u201cTwitter plugs\u201d or \u201cTwitter reps\u201d \u2013 the terms used to describe cooperative Twitter employees \u2013 since as far back as 2017.  The potential involvement of low-level cybercriminals has particularly alarmed professionals because of the implication that a hostile government might be able to cause even greater havoc.  Access to accounts for national leaders was limited to a much smaller number of people after a rogue employee briefly deleted President Donald Trump\u2019s account two years ago. That could explain why Biden\u2019s account was hijacked but not Trump\u2019s.  Twitter should expand the number of protected accounts, said former Twitter security engineer John Adams. Among other things, accounts with more than 10,000 followers should at least need two people to change key settings.  Security experts said they were worried that Twitter has too much work to do and too little time before the campaign for the Nov. 3 U.S. election intensifies, with potential inference domestically and from other countries.  Said Ron Gula, a cybersecurity investor who co-founded network security company Tenable, \u201cThe question really is: Does Twitter do enough to prevent account takeovers for our presidential candidates and news outlets when faced with sophisticated threats that leverage whole-of-nation approaches?\u201d  On a call to discuss company earnings on Thursday, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey acknowledged past missteps.  \u201cWe fell behind, both in our protections against social engineering of our employees and restrictions on our internal tools,\u201d Dorsey told investors.","120":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc FB.O is considering halting political advertising after U.S. Election Day to curb post-election misinformation, a source who has had discussions with the company said Friday.

The New York Times reported here on Friday, citing unnamed sources, that Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and some company executives met daily about how to minimize ways the platform could be used to dispute the election and have discussed the option of a political ads \"kill switch\" after the Nov. 3 election.  \u201cIt is previously reported news that we are considering a range of political advertising options during the closing period of the election,\u201d Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said in a statement, declining to provide details.

The popular social media site, which first announced its political ads ban last month, had not previously provided details on the new policy. On Friday, it said it will define political content as anything that references \u201ca candidate, political party, elected or appointed government official, election, referendum, ballot measure, legislation, regulation, directive, or judicial outcome.\u201d  Twitter said it will use a combination of automated technology and human teams to enforce the new ad policies.  The move comes as campaigns for the November 2020 presidential election heat up amid growing pressure on social media companies to stop accepting ads that spread false information and could sway elections.  \u201cWe believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,\u201d Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in announcing the ban.  Rival Facebook Inc, saying it did not want to stifle political speech, has refused calls from some politicians and others to follow Twitter\u2019s lead, and said it would not vet political ads for misleading claims on its site.  The ban is expected to take effect on Nov. 22.  Brad Parscale, campaign manager for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election bid, in a statement called the move, \u201cyet another attempt to silence conservatives, since Twitter knows President Trump has the most sophisticated online program ever known.\u201d  Bill Russo, deputy communications director for former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, said in a statement that he appreciates Twitter will not allow \u201cdisproven smears\u201d to appear in ads, but said social media companies had more work to do to ensure their sites are not rife with disinformation.  \u201cWe look forward to seeing how the policy works in practice and intend to hold Twitter to its word,\u201d he said.  Twitter will allow companies and advocacy groups to run ads that promote awareness and discussion about social causes, such as environmental protection. But they will not be allowed to push for a political or legislative change, especially if they are advocating for something that benefits their business, Del Harvey, vice president of trust and safety, said in a conference call on Friday.  Under the new policy for example, Sierra Club could still promote their causes, but they would not be able to single out politicians they support or target those they would like to see defeated in elections, or lobby for political outcomes.  Similarly, a group could run a gun violence awareness ad but could not call for a ban on assault weapons used in mass shootings as a ban implies legislation, Twitter said.  Ads intended to promote awareness about a cause would be allowed to target users at the state level or higher, but not by zip-code. And those advertisers will not be able to target people based on their political leanings, Twitter said.  Roy Temple, a partner at digital media consultancy GPS Impact who has worked with political campaigns, called the move \u201ca gigantic cop-out\u201d by Twitter\u2019s CEO that does not involve the loss of much revenue, and he questioned the difficulty of implementing the complicated policy.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be the Twitter employee who has to make these calls and defend them,\u201d Temple said. \u201cUniversal healthcare is a cause, but is there a bill related to that? Are you talking about the bill or the cause? How is that determined?\u201d  Harvey said on Friday the new policies were not expected to change Twitter\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Political ad spend for the 2018 U.S. midterm elections on Twitter was less than $3 million, the company reported.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook, Google and Twitter logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS\/File Photo  Critics have said the ban would punish lesser-known candidates taking on well-funded incumbents in local elections.  If Facebook and Google - much larger players in digital advertising - were to adopt similar policies it would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to down-ballot candidates who lack name recognition, said Eric Wilson, a political strategist based in Washington D.C.  \u201cIf Facebook considers eliminating things like microtargeting, that\u2019s when we would panic,\u201d Wilson said. He said the platform has been the best vehicle for raising grassroots support, and a similar ban could hurt candidates that do not accept large donations from corporations and political action committees (PACs).  Twitter said it sought to make its new rules as clear as possible. But other major tech companies, including Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, have had widely publicized struggles to moderate the vast amount of content uploaded to their sites.  News publishers that meet certain criteria will continue to be able to run ads on Twitter that reference political content, but they cannot advocate for or against a political topic.","122":"U.S. President Donald Trump arrives aboard Air Force One from Singapore at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, U.S. June 13, 2018.

Democratic members of the House of Representatives will introduce formal articles of impeachment on Monday, Representative Ted Lieu said on Twitter. The California Democrat, who helped draft the charges, said the articles had drawn 180 co-sponsors as of Saturday afternoon. A spokeswoman for Lieu said no Republicans have yet signed on.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top congressional Democrat, has threatened to impeach Trump for a historic second time unless he resigned \u201cimmediately,\u201d a move the pugnacious president is unlikely to consider.  Pelosi has also asked members to draft legislation aimed at invoking the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 25th Amendment, which allows the removal of a president unable to fulfill the duties of the office.  Trump \u201chas done something so serious -- that there should be prosecution against him,\u201d Pelosi told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d according to an early excerpt of the interview.  The intensifying effort to oust Trump from the White House has drawn scattered support from Republicans, whose party has been splintered by the president\u2019s actions. Democrats have pressed Vice President Mike Pence to consider the 25th Amendment, but a Pence adviser has said he opposes the idea.  The odds that Trump will actually be removed before Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in, remain long. Any impeachment in the House would trigger a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which is scheduled to be in recess until Jan. 19 and has already acquitted Trump once before.  Trump has said he will not be at Biden\u2019s inauguration, but Pence will attend, a senior administration official said on Saturday.  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sent a memo to his fellow Republican senators suggesting a trial would not begin until Trump was out of office, a source familiar with the document said. A conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds vote.  Democrats will take control of the Senate later this month, after Georgia certifies two runoff elections won by Democratic challengers.  Twitter permanently cut off Trump\u2019s personal account and access to his nearly 90 million followers late on Friday, citing the risk of further incitement of violence, three days after Trump exhorted thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Biden\u2019s Nov. 3 election victory.

In his first public comments, Pope Francis said he was \u201castonished\u201d and that anyone engaged in attacks on democracy must be condemned.  A Florida man who was photographed smiling and waving as he carried Pelosi\u2019s lectern from the House chambers amid the chaos was arrested by federal law enforcement late Friday.  Authorities also arrested a man seen in widely shared photographs wearing a horned fur hat and carrying a spear inside the Capitol. Dozens of others face federal and state charges.  \u2018I WANT HIM OUT\u2019  Twitter\u2019s decision stifled one of Trump\u2019s most potent tools. His frequent posts helped propel his 2016 presidential campaign, since which he has used the site to fire up his base and attack his political opponents from both parties.  Trump later used the official @POTUS government account to lash out at Twitter, saying the 75 million \u201cgreat patriots\u201d who voted for him would not be silenced, and that he was considering building his own social media platform.  Twitter quickly deleted those posts and soon after suspended the Trump campaign account as well.  A Reuters\/Ipsos poll conducted Thursday and Friday found 57%of Americans want Trump to be removed immediately from office following the violence.  A small but growing number of Republicans have joined calls for Trump to step down, and several high-ranking administration officials resigned in protest.  Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Friday that Trump should resign immediately and suggested she would consider leaving the party altogether if Republicans cannot separate themselves from him.  \u201cI want him out. He has caused enough damage,\u201d she told the Anchorage Daily News.  Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told Fox News on Saturday that Trump had \u201ccommitted impeachable offenses\u201d but declined to commit to voting in favor of Trump\u2019s removal.  Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, told CBS News he would \u201cdefinitely consider\u201d impeachment because the president \u201cdisregarded his oath of office.\u201d  Trump allies, including Senator Lindsey Graham and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, however, urged Democrats to shelve any impeachment effort in the name of unity.  \u201cImpeaching President Donald Trump with 12 days remaining in his presidency would only serve to further divide the country,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere.  Democratic lawmakers have also called for some of their Republican colleagues to resign or be expelled over their roles supporting Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of a rigged election.  Sherrod Brown, Democratic senator from Ohio, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, who called for Electoral College votes of states that voted for Biden to be rejected, had \u201cbetrayed their oaths of office and abetted a violent insurrection on our democracy.\u201d  \u201cIf they do not resign, the Senate must expel them,\u201d said Brown, the first senator to call for the pair to be expelled.  Representative Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, also called on McCarthy to resign for backing efforts to block Biden\u2019s election.  A copy of draft articles of impeachment circulating among members of Congress charged Trump with \u201cinciting violence against the government of the United States\u201d in a bid to overturn his loss to Biden.  The House impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, but the Senate acquitted him in February 2020. Only two other presidents have been impeached, and none has been impeached twice.  Trump spent months falsely claiming the election was stolen from him due to widespread fraud. Dozens of courts across the country have thrown out lawsuits challenging the results, and election officials from both parties have said there is no evidence to support his allegations.","127":"(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc TSLA.O fell 7 percent on Friday, as David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital slammed the electric carmaker the day after Tesla CEO Elon Musk mocked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter.  The sell-off started in morning trading the day after Musk stirred nerves about a settlement of his securities fraud lawsuit by calling the SEC the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d on Twitter. His tweet came hours after a federal judge ordered him and the regulator to justify their settlement.  \u201cJust want to (sic) that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work,\u201d Musk, a frequent critic of investors betting against the electric car company said in the tweet. \u201cAnd the name change is so on point!\u201d  In its quarterly letter, Greenlight said on Friday its short position on Tesla was its second-biggest winner in the third quarter. The hedge fund said Musk has been deceptive and the carmaker\u2019s woes resemble those of Lehman Brothers before its collapse.  Tesla shares plunged last week after the SEC accused Musk, 47, of fraud over \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d tweets on Aug. 7 that promised to take Tesla private and said funding had been secured.  The lawsuit threatened Tesla and Musk with a long fight that could have undermined the company\u2019s operations and ability to raise capital.  In the settlement announced over the weekend, Tesla and Musk agreed to pay $20 million each to the regulator while Musk, also a large Tesla shareholder, would step down as chairman but continue as CEO.  FILE PHOTO: A Tesla showroom is seen in Santa Monica, California, U.S., January 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The settlement provided for appointment of a new chairman and directors, as well as moves to oversee Musk\u2019s output on social media.  Peter Haveles, a partner in the Trial and Dispute Resolution Practice Group, said Musk\u2019s tweets showed his lack of self discipline and puts intense pressure on Tesla board.  Several Twitter users also criticized Musk, who has over 20 million followers on the social media platform, for his tweets targeting regulators and short sellers.  \u201cI have lost 30 years of my life savings all in $tsla thanks to your tweets please stop,\u201d TrendTrader007 wrote.  \u201cIf you continue this self destructive path you will lose all your ardent supporters and the goodwill from diehard $tsla longs like me,\u201d the user tweeted.  Teresa Goody, a former SEC attorney and CEO of The Goody Group, said Musk\u2019s \u201ccontempt for the SEC is sending a message that he has no regard for the securities laws that are intended to protect investors and ensure a fair and efficient marketplace.\u201d  In a separate tweet, Musk took another shot at shortsellers and accused BlackRock Inc BLK.N of enabling them by saying, \"The big funds can & will (sic), as they're suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket (sic) make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for 'passive' index tracking.\"  Widely seen as the driving force behind the company, Musk's talent for promotion has helped Tesla vault much bigger manufacturing operations like General Motors GM.N and Ford F.N to become America's most valuable car company.  As news on the settlement emerged at the weekend, he told employees in an email that Palo Alto, California-based Tesla was \u201cvery close to achieving profitability.\u201d  Production numbers on Tuesday showed the company finally meeting its promises on output of the Model 3 sedan seen as crucial for the its long-term prospects, while also fighting hard to overcome logistical issues with deliveries.

FILE PHOTO: Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivers a televised speech, in Tehran, Iran January 8, 2021. Official Khamenei Website\/Handout via REUTERS\/File Photo  The image first appeared on a Persian-language Twitter feed that carried a link to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s website. Twitter took down that feed on Friday, saying it was fake.  Underneath the website picture were remarks by Khamenei in December ahead of the first anniversary this month of the killing of military commander General Qassem Soleimani in Iraq, which was ordered by Trump.  \u201cBoth the murderers and those who ordered it should know that revenge may come at any time,\u201d said the comments on top of the image, which showed the shadow of a drone looming over the lone golfer. Trump, who regularly plays golf, was not named.  U.S.-Iran tensions grew rapidly after 2018, when Trump exited a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers and reimposed crippling sanctions.  Tehran retaliated for Soleimani\u2019s killing with missile strikes against U.S. targets in Iraq but the two sides backed away from further confrontation.  High tension and risk of war appeared to subside with the end of Trump\u2019s term. His successor President Joe Biden, sworn in on Wednesday, has said Washington seeks to lengthen and strengthen the nuclear constraints on Iran through diplomacy.  Emily Horne, a spokeswoman for the Biden White House National Security Council, said \u201cthese kinds of threats from Iran are unacceptable.\u201d  \u201cWe strongly condemn this provocative action. We will continue to work with our friends and partners to counter Iran\u2019s malign influence,\u201d she said in response to a request for comment.  The top Republican on the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, earlier urged the Biden administration \u201cto respond quickly and forcefully to this provocative threat against a former president\u201d and called on Twitter to immediately and permanently suspend Khamenei\u2019s account.  An official close to Khamenei\u2019s inner circle said: \u201cThe aim (of the tweet) was to remind the gambler (Trump) that leaving office does not mean he will be safe and the assassination of our martyr Soleimani will be forgotten.\u201d  \u201cAnd now, American troops cannot protect him,\u201d the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters without elaborating.  POWERFUL GENERAL  Soleimani, the commander of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force, was responsible for clandestine overseas operations and was widely seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran after Khamenei.  Iran\u2019s military and clerical rulers have said Tehran would choose the time and place of Soleimani\u2019s revenge.  A Tehran-based analyst said the threat could be an end in itself: \u201cThe intention of the tweet seems to be keeping alive the spectre of revenge, which perhaps by itself is a kind of revenge.\u201d  A Twitter spokeswoman said the @khamenei_site account was suspended for violating the company\u2019s platform manipulation and spam policy, specifically against the creation of fake accounts. Asked if the @khamenei_site account was fake, she said it was.  Iranian officials were not immediately available to comment.  The golfer image tweet was retweeted by Khamenei\u2019s main Persian-language account @Khamenei-fa, although it appeared to have been deleted later. The text and graphic of the tweet later carried by Khamenei\u2019s official website (farsi.khamenei.ir) was also widely quoted by Iranian media.  Khamenei\u2019s @Khamenei_fa account and his main Twitter account in English, which did not carry the golfer image tweet, were still operational.  Earlier this month, Twitter removed a tweet by Khamenei in which he said U.S.- and British-made vaccines were unreliable and may be intended to \u201ccontaminate other nations\u201d for violating its rules against misinformation.  Exiled rights activists renewed calls for Twitter to ban Khamenei. \u201cI hope the world can see how they (Iranian officials) can use social media to promote violence,\u201d U.S.-based activist Massih Alinejad told Reuters.  Twitter permanently suspended Trump\u2019s account following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by some of his supporters, citing the risk of further incitement of violence.","131":"Korean League of Legends team Griffin has disbanded, the organization announced Tuesday on social media.  \u201cTeam Griffin LoL\u2019s journey, in which many have walked with us, has come to an end as of 2020,\u201d Griffin posted to Twitter.

The company\u2019s quarterly monthly active user (MAU) count rose 9 million to reach 330 million from previous quarter, while analysts on average had expected 318.8 million, a loss of 2.2 million users, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Twitter, which has been focusing on improving the quality of its platform by removing thousands of spam and suspicious accounts, would no longer disclose MAUs from next quarter.  Instead, it plans to only provide the number of \u201cmonetizable\u201d daily active users, a metric the company created to measure only users exposed to advertising on a daily basis.  Monetizable daily active users or mDAU rose to 134 million in the first quarter, up 12 percent from a year ago, Twitter said.  For the first quarter of 2019, Twitter\u2019s revenue rose 18 percent from a year ago to $787 million, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $776.1 million.  Revenue was boosted by ad sales that also jumped 18 percent to $679 million. In the United States, ad revenue rose by 26 percent year-on-year, thanks to its video ad formats that continued to show strength in 2019.  However, it forecast current quarter revenue largely below Wall Street targets. Twitter expects revenue to reach between $770 million and $830 million, compared with $819.5 million estimated by analysts polled by Refinitiv.  Twitter also sees more operating costs as it cleans up its platform to minimize abusive user behavior.  \u201cWe are now removing 2.5x more Tweets that share personal information and 38 percent of abusive Tweets that are taken down every week are being proactively detected by machine learning models,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said in a statement.  Total operating expense including cost of revenue, rose by 18 percent to $693 million from the first quarter a year ago.  Twitter reported quarterly profit of $191 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $61 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier.

FILE PHOTO: A sign displays the Twitter logo on the front of the New York Stock Exchange ahead of the company's IPO in New York, November 7, 2013. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The social media company said in April that it had sped up work on long-sought tools to attract advertisers, particularly mobile games and other app makers that are continuing to target consumers stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Months later, Twitter remains reliant on advertising targeted around big events, which have all but vanished during the pandemic, and it lacks the \u201cdirect response\u201d ad products preferred by app developers at the level offered by peers.  Wall Street is bracing for Twitter to take a harder hit in the second quarter than other ad-dependent social media competitors like Facebook FB.O, which is expected to turn a profit despite coronavirus pressures.  Analysts estimate on average that Twitter\u2019s ad sales will decline 19.8% in the second quarter year-over-year, according to Refinitiv data. They expect a loss of nearly $126 million, blowing past the $8 million loss posted in the first quarter.  \u201cTwitter\u2019s ad business was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic in March, and it\u2019s likely that losses continued into at least part of Q2,\u201d said eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg.  The company had aimed to stem losses this year by slashing costs, although the hack may spoil that plan if it forces costly security investments. Last week, Moody\u2019s warned the incident raised concerns about Twitter\u2019s internal security and possible reputational risks for users.  That could bode ill for Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, who fought off an attempt by activist investor Elliott Management to oust him from his job earlier this year by agreeing to growth targets. The deal bought time for Dorsey, who is also CEO of financial tech company Square SQ.N, to show Elliott he could run two public companies.  Earlier this month, Twitter signaled that new revenue-generating products were on the way. It revealed via a job listing that it had convened a team, code-named Gryphon, to work on building a subscription platform.  It also announced plans to launch a new Application Programming Interface (API), a potential boon to the company\u2019s data licensing business, which contributes about 15% of its revenue and is growing at a faster clip than ad sales. But Twitter postponed the API\u2019s launch after the hack, saying the timing \u201cno longer made sense or felt right.\u201d","136":"Oct 5 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc fell as much as 4 percent on Friday, after Chief Executive Elon Musk stirred nerves about the settlement of his securities fraud lawsuit by mocking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Twitter.

FILE PHOTO: A magnifying glass is held in front of a computer screen in this picture illustration taken in Berlin May 21, 2013. REUTERS\/Pawel Kopczynski  Twitter said late Wednesday hackers obtained control of employee credentials to hijack accounts including those of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, former president Barack Obama, reality television star Kim Kardashian, and tech billionaire and Tesla founder Elon Musk.  In a series of tweets, the company said: \u201cWe detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.\u201d  The hackers then \u201cused this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf.\u201d  The company statements confirmed the fears of security experts that the service itself - rather than users - had been compromised.  Twitter\u2019s role as a critical communications platform for political candidates and public officials, including President Donald Trump, has led to fears that hackers could wreak havoc with the Nov. 3 presidential election or otherwise compromise national security.  Adam Conner, vice president for technology policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think-tank, said on Twitter: \u201cThis is bad on July 15 but would be infinitely worse on November 3rd.\u201d  BITCOIN BOUNTY  Posing as celebrities and the wealthy, the hackers asked followers to send the digital currency bitcoin to a series of addresses. By evening, 400 bitcoin transfers were made worth a combined $120,000. Half of the victims had funds in U.S. bitcoin exchanges, a quarter in Europe and a quarter in Asia, according to forensics company Elliptic.  Those transfers left history that could help investigators identify the perpetrators of the hack. The financial damage may be limited because multiple exchanges blocked other payments after their own Twitter accounts were targeted.  The damage to Twitter\u2019s reputation may be more serious. Most troubling to some was how long the company took to stop the bad tweets.  \u201cTwitter\u2019s response to this hack was astonishing. It\u2019s the middle of the day in San Francisco, and it takes them five hours to get a handle on the incident,\u201d said Dan Guido, CEO of security company Trail of Bits.  An even worse scenario was that the bitcoin fraud was a distraction for more serious hacking, such as harvesting the direct messages of the account holders.  Twitter said it was not yet certain what the hackers may have done beyond sending the bitcoin messages.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking into what other malicious activity they may have conducted or information they may have accessed and will share more here as we have it,\u201d the company said.  Mass compromises of Twitter accounts via theft of employee credentials or problems with third-party applications that many users employ have occured before.

Twitter, like bigger rival Facebook Inc, has been under pressure from regulators in several countries to weed out hate speech, abusive content and misinformation, better protect user data and boost transparency on political ad spending.  The social media firm increased removals and suspensions of accounts in recent months, saying this was one reason the number of monthly users fell by 1 million to 335 million in the second quarter from the previous three months.  The United States accounted for most of the decline.  Financial analysts had expected a gain of 1 million users, and the results could harden concerns that Twitter lacks a clear strategy to grow usage and revenue together.  Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said in a statement that daily users grew 11 percent compared to a year ago, saying this showed that addressing \u201cproblem behaviors\u201d was turning the service into a daily utility.  The company did not reveal the number of daily users.  Sales of $711 million, mostly from advertising and up 24 percent from last year, exceeded the average estimate of $696 million among analyst research aggregated by Thomson Reuters.  Twitter said it benefited from two weeks of the World Cup in the second quarter, with ads tied to the soccer tournament generating $30 million in revenue.  Profit was $100 million, with a $42 million boost due to a tax accounting move. It marked Twitter\u2019s third quarter in a row and the third three-month period without a loss.  Adjusted earnings per share were in line with the average estimate in Thomson Reuters data at 17 cents per share, although it was not immediately known if the figures were comparable.  Twitter shares have rallied this year on expectations that moves to make the service a friendlier place to interact with other users would also make it more attractive to advertisers.  Shares closed Thursday trading at more than 10 times expected revenue over the next 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc, which have both begun experiencing more gradual revenue growth, trade at eight and six times expected revenue, respectively.  Facebook is still well ahead of Twitter in turning usage into money, generating $5.89 in revenue on average per user in the second quarter compared to $1.79 for Twitter.  Some analysts say Twitter is now better at retaining users but question whether it is doing enough to lure new ones.  Twitter has said increased video programming, including news shows and live sports, and investing in technology that automatically surfaces interesting content with limited user intervention should make the service appealing to first-timers.  Macquarie Research analysts said in a report this month they had not seen proof that product improvements were \u201cdriving significant new user growth.\u201d  The latest results bear that out. Twitter said it lost some users due to the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe in May but it did not note any revenue impact. Facebook has said it expects to take a moderate hit in coming quarters due to the new rules.  Twitter also saw usage fall after saying it would not subsidize users who accessed its application through text messages without paying messaging fees to wireless carriers.  The company increased capital expenditures guidance for the year to between $450 million and $500 million from $375 million to $450 million as it expands and upgrades the computer infrastructure underlying its service.

Twitter had looked set to become the first big technology company to face a fine by Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (DPC) under tougher EU data protection rules after it submitted the decision to other member states in May.  Under the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\u2019s (GDPR) \u201cOne Stop Shop\u201d regime introduced in 2018, regulators can impose fines for violations of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.  Ireland hosts the European headquarters of a number of U.S. technology companies, making its the EU\u2019s lead regulator for firms including Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Google.  But it must share its preliminary decision with all concerned EU supervisory authorities (CSAs) and consider their views in its final verdict.  \u201cA number of objections were raised by CSAs and the DPC engaged in a consultation process with them,\u201d Graham Doyle, Deputy Commissioner at the Irish DPC, said in a statement.

The EDPB now has one month to reach a two-thirds majority among member states and if that fails, a further month to seek an absolute majority. If it still can\u2019t find agreement, the chair of the board will cast the deciding vote.  The Twitter ruling relates to a bug in its Android app where some users\u2019 protected tweets were made public, and whether it notified the regulator in a timely manner.

But the company also posted fourth-quarter net income lower than expectations, at $119 million, or 15 cents per share, down from $255 million year-over-year. Twitter also forecast first-quarter revenue between $825 million and $885 million, behind many Wall Street estimates and said costs would grow about 20% in 2020 as it increases headcount and builds out a new data center.  Twitter saw most revenue growth in the United States, a major market where the company will this year face scrutiny over its efforts to tackle misinformation around the presidential election in November.  Twitter said improvements to its machine-learning models to provide more relevant content and notifications contributed to its growth in average monetizable daily active users (mDAU).  This number of daily users who log in through twitter.com or Twitter applications that show ads hit 152 million, beating analyst expectations of 147.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This metric was up from 126 million year-over-year.  Twitter has continued its efforts to drive up user numbers by making the platform more user-friendly, for example, allowing people to follow topics, and by trying to clean up abusive content. Late last year, it launched a feature for users to hide certain replies on their tweets.  The company\u2019s quarterly revenue rose 11% from a year earlier to $1.01 billion, beating Wall Street expectations of $996.7 million, based on IBES data from Refinitiv. Total advertising revenue was $885 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year.  Still, its revenue outlook for the first quarter was between $825 million and $885 million, compared to analyst expectations of $872.6 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Twitter\u2019s total U.S. revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $591 million, compared with a 3% uptick in international revenue.  The company attributed the slower overseas figures to factors including a decrease in a mobile ad product\u2019s revenue in Asia Pacific.  Twitter also said it was prioritizing efforts to protect the integrity of election-related conversations.  In November, Twitter banned political ads amid growing pressure on social media companies to stop accepting ads containing misleading or false information.  But this week\u2019s Iowa caucuses still saw the platform used organically to spread false allegations of voter fraud and conspiracy theories over the delayed results of the first key contest of the election.  On Tuesday, Twitter announced it would apply \u201cfalse\u201d warning labels to tweets containing synthetic or deceptively edited forms of media and remove such media if it is likely to cause harm.  On a call with reporters earlier this week, Twitter executives declined to answer questions on the resources it would put toward spotting manipulated media, saying it would consider user reports and build relationships with \u201cthird-party experts.\u201d  Quarterly total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 22% year-over-year to $854 million, partly due to a planned increase in headcount.  The company expects first-quarter operating income to be between $0 million and $30 million.  It said it expects an approximately 20% increase in operating expenses in 2020, as it grows headcount by 20% or more in 2020 and it also builds out a new data center. It said capital expenditures would be weighted towards the second half of the year.","146":"FILE PHOTO: A man reads tweets on his phone in front of a displayed Twitter logo in Bordeaux, southwestern France, March 10, 2016.

Social networks such as Twitter and Facebook have come under pressure to do more to combat fake news and the spread of extremism and propaganda online. The European Union is concerned about Russia\u2019s role. Russia has repeatedly denied any such actions.  Twitter said its political campaigning ads policy, introduced during the U.S. midterm elections, will also be launched in India and Australia, both of which are also heading to the polls.

The company has been investing heavily to improve what Dorsey has described as the \u201ccollective health\u201d of Twitter.  Dorsey said on Tuesday he does not like how Twitter tends to incentivize outrage, short-term thinking, echo chambers, and fragmented conversations, and that the lack of diversity in the company has not helped in combating such problems.  He said Twitter\u2019s work against \u201cautomations and coordinated campaigns,\u201d along with its collaboration with various government agencies, has left it in a better position to combat the threat of misinformation for the 2020 U.S. presidential elections.  U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used social media during the 2016 U.S. elections to sway voters. Moscow denies that charge.","149":"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Many women cannot express themselves freely on Twitter without fear of violence or abuse, Amnesty International said on Wednesday, even though the #MeToo campaign has helped women to speak out.  Abuses ranged from \u2018doxing\u2019 - releasing personal documents such as a person\u2019s address or children\u2019s names - to posting nude pictures, the rights group said, as it launched a campaign to get Twitter to step up its response to violations.  \u201cMany women are logging onto Twitter to find death threats, rape threats and racist or homophobic slurs littering their feeds,\u201d Azmina Dhrodia, a researcher with Amnesty and author of its #ToxicTwitter report, said in a statement.  \u201cIf Twitter is allowing violence and abuse against women to flourish on the platform, the danger is that someone experiencing that will censor or silence themselves as a result,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Twitter was not immediately available to comment. In October, however, the company pledged to toughen its rules on online sexual harassment and impose stronger penalties for misconduct.  The report follows an international study this month that found women politicians on Twitter were judged more harshly than their male peers on appearance and marital status, and were three times more likely to receive sexist comments.  Amnesty said it asked Twitter in January for information on how many reports of abuse it gets, the number of reports that were in violation of Twitter\u2019s rules, and its response times.  It published a reply from Twitter which said the data could be \u201cmisleading\u201d as some users report content that they disagreed with for political reasons in a bid to get others blocked.  Twitter also noted it had made dozens of changes over 16 months to improve safety, and, according to Amnesty, said it \u201ccannot delete hatred and prejudice from society\u201d.  \u201cWe are not asking them to solve the world\u2019s problems. We are asking them to make concrete changes that truly demonstrate that abuse against women is not welcome on Twitter,\u201d Dhrodia said.  In a poll last year, Amnesty found a third of women who experienced online abuse stopped giving opinion. It found 43 percent of women in Britain and 22 percent in the United States felt Twitter\u2019s response to abuse or harassment was inadequate.  Twitter does have a number of tools to help users, including options to block followers, to change settings to avoid seeing certain words, and to report abuse.  In a written response to Amnesty, Vijaya Gadde, who is Twitter\u2019s general counsel, said limiting accounts that violated the service\u2019s rules on abuse had improved behavior.  Gadde did say Twitter continued to see repeat offenders who create new accounts when suspended.

The San Francisco-based social media company announced greater first-quarter revenue and a smaller loss than financial analysts had expected. Daily users who can view ads grew 24% to 166 million, about 2 million above estimates, as people looked to Twitter for information related to the virus.  Twitter provided neither its usual guidance on sales for the current quarter nor any comment on whether U.S. ad sales had bounced back as well. It did warn of smaller increases in non-advertising revenue. Making development of ad tools its No. 1 priority also could complicate efforts to maintain user growth late into the year.  But the first-quarter results and signs of recovery mirrored those seen over the last week from Twitter\u2019s main competitors for advertisers, including Facebook Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc and Snapchat maker Snap Inc.  Shares of those companies, including Twitter, have surged in the last week, erasing most or all their declines for the year. Twitter shares rose about 6% to $32.94 in extended trading on Wednesday.  The novel coronavirus halted travel, retail and entertainment in much of the world by March, leading to sudden budgets cuts at many advertisers and generating concerns about the prospects of ad sellers.  About 84% of Twitter\u2019s revenue comes from ads on its service and partner apps, and those sales were 27% lower in the last three weeks of March than the same period in 2019, the company said on Thursday. But sales bounced back in Asia during late March as lockdowns lifted there, Twitter said, without providing specific figures.  In addition, Twitter said it hoped to release tools earlier than planned this year to attract business from mobile games and other app makers. Those companies are trying to gain market share among consumers stuck at home and are continuing to buy what the ad industry calls \u201cdirect response\u201d ads.  Google on Wednesday also said it expected revenue from direct response ads sold by its YouTube unit to return to normal faster than from other ad types.  SLASHING COSTS, PRIORITIZING SALES  Twitter\u2019s first-quarter revenue was $808 million, or 3% growth compared with a year earlier, above the average estimate of $776 million among analysts tracked by Refinitiv.  Twitter had rescinded on March 23 its first-quarter revenue outlook of between $825 million and $885 million because of virus-related uncertainty.  The company said that sales growth from licensing users\u2019 posts to researchers and marketers, which was 17% in the first quarter, is expected to \u201cmoderate\u201d the rest of the year.  Twitter lost $8 million in the first quarter, or a penny per share, better than the average estimate of two cents per share.  The opening of a new data center to host tweets and user information could be pushed back because the virus made it difficult to acquire materials and required spending on improving some existing infrastructure, Twitter said.  Twitter is aiming to stem losses by slashing its own budgets, including by limiting hiring to product development, research and user support. Expense growth in 2020 is likely to be in \u201cthe low teens,\u201d versus earlier plans to spend 20% more than last year, Twitter said.  Focusing its product teams on advertiser tools could pose challenges for Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. He pledged in February to launch new features for users this year at a faster pace to stoke growth, while committing to activist investor Elliott Management on March 9 that he would increase daily users by at least 20% this year.  The growth goal was part of an agreement allowing Dorsey to remain CEO as a revamped board of directors evaluates Twitter\u2019s leadership structure and CEO succession plan. Elliott had expressed concern about Dorsey, who is also CEO of financial tech company Square Inc, taking on too much.","151":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc will transfer control of the @POTUS account to the Joe Biden administration on Jan. 20, the social media companies said on Saturday.

The study is part of a strategy to persuade President Donald Trump to reduce or end the four-year tariff regime implemented early last year.  The study prompted a withering rebuttal from Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro, who called the estimate \u201cfake news\u201d and the association \u201ca loose confederation of Chinese solar companies seeking to destroy American solar manufacturing jobs.\u201d  In an email to the solar group\u2019s public relations committee on Wednesday, Dan Whitten, its vice president of public affairs, asked that members post photos of U.S. solar workers online with the phrase: \u201cMr. Peter Navarro, I am an American solar worker. #StopSolarTariffs @WhiteHouse & @USTradeRep\u201d.  \u201cWe need your help to punch back,\u201d said the email, which was seen by Reuters. \u201cWe need to engage our workers in a Twitter campaign to hit back.\u201d  SEIA\u2019s president, Abigail Hopper, issued a statement in response to Navarro\u2019s comments saying: \u201cWe\u2019d be thrilled if Mr. Navarro would come to one of our conferences to meet some of the 240,000 Americans who work in this great industry, including the tens of thousands of people who manufacture solar products.\u201d  Trump\u2019s tariff program on imported panels was his opening salvo in a trade war aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers rebound from years of decline due to foreign competition. Solar installers opposed the tariffs because they rely on cheap imported panels to compete with fossil fuels.  The levies started at 30% and were designed to drop by five percentage points each year.  The report, whose gloomy forecasts were based on that rate regime, came out two days before a scheduled mid-term review of the tariff program by the International Trade Commission that could influence whether Trump maintains, changes or cancels it.  Most panels installed in the United States are made in Asia. Despite the tariffs, panel prices have continued to fall due to an oversupply in top producer China, which cut incentives on installations, unleashing a flood of solar products onto the global market.","155":"April 13 (Reuters) -  * INDIA TO ISSUE SOVEREIGN GOLD BONDS, APPLICATIONS TO BE ACCEPTED FROM APRIL 16-20 - FINMIN ON TWITTER  * INDIA\u2019S SOVEREIGN GOLD BONDS TO BE TRADABLE ON STOCK EXCHANGES WITHIN FORTNIGHT OF ISSUANCE ON DATE AS WILL BE NOTIFIED BY CENBANK - FINMIN ON TWITTER  * INDIA\u2019S SOVEREIGN GOLD BONDS ACQUIRED BY BANKS TO BE COUNTED AS PART OF THEIR STATUTORY LIQUIDITY RATIO - FINMIN ON TWITTER","156":"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania, U.S., October 26, 2020.

U.S. President Donald Trump talks with attendees as he departs an event held to tout his administration's environmental policies in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., July 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the First Amendment forbids Trump from using Twitter\u2019s \u201cblocking\u201d function to limit access to his account, which has 61.8 million followers.  \u201cThe First Amendment does not permit a public official who utilizes a social media account for all manner of official purposes to exclude persons from an otherwise-open online dialogue because they expressed views with which the official disagrees,\u201d wrote Circuit Judge Barrington Parker, citing several Supreme Court decisions.  Kelly Laco, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which argued the appeal, said: \u201cWe are disappointed with the court\u2019s decision and are exploring possible next steps.\u201d  The White House declined to comment. White House social media director Dan Scavino was also a defendant. Twitter TWTR.N declined to comment.  Trump has made his @RealDonaldTrump account, which he opened in 2009, a central and controversial part of his presidency, using it to promote his agenda and to attack critics.  His blocking of critics was challenged by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, as well as seven Twitter users he had blocked.  \u201cThe decision will help ensure the integrity and vitality of digital spaces that are increasingly important to our democracy,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, Knight\u2019s executive director.  Tuesday\u2019s decision upheld a May 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan, which prompted Trump to unblock some accounts.  The Justice Department had called her ruling \u201cfundamentally misconceived,\u201d saying Trump used Twitter to express his views, not to offer a public forum for discussion.  Parker, however, said Trump\u2019s account bears \u201call the trappings of an official, state-run account\u201d and is \u201cone of the White House\u2019s main vehicles for conducting official business.\u201d  He said Trump and his aides have characterized the president\u2019s tweets as official statements, and that even the National Archives considers them official records.  Parker also found it ironic that Trump censored speech at a time the conduct of the U.S. government and its officials is subject to intense, passionate and wide-open debate.  \u201cThis debate, as uncomfortable and as unpleasant as it frequently may be, is nonetheless a good thing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe remind the litigants and the public that if the First Amendment means anything, it means that the best response to disfavored speech on matters of public concern is more speech, not less.\u201d  The case is Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University et al v Trump et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-1691.","160":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N said on Tuesday it was globally launching tweets that disappear after 24 hours, similar to the stories feature that is popular on Snapchat SNAP.N and Facebook's FB.O photo-sharing app Instagram.  FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Twitter has previously announced its plan for these ephemeral tweets, dubbed \u201cfleets\u201d, and tested the feature in Brazil, Italy, India, and South Korea.  \u201cSome of you tell us that Tweeting is uncomfortable because it feels so public, so permanent, and like there\u2019s so much pressure to rack up Retweets and Likes,\u201d design director Joshua Harris and product manager Sam Haveson said in a blog post.  \u201cBecause they disappear from view after a day, Fleets helped people feel more comfortable sharing personal and casual thoughts, opinions, and feelings,\u201d they added.  However, some Twitter users experimenting with the tool said it had created worrying opportunities for online harassment, like allowing unwanted direct messages. It also allows fleet authors to tag people who have blocked them.  Twitter said it was listening to feedback and working on fixes for safety concerns like the blocking issue.  Fleets, which include text, photos and videos, will be available at the top of users\u2019 home timelines on Twitter and on the sender\u2019s profile.  Twitter and other major social media companies are under pressure to better police abuses and viral misinformation on their sites. Twitter spokeswoman Liz Kelley said fleets are subject to the same rules as tweets.  Kelley said warnings or labels, which Twitter has started applying to content such as manipulated media and misinformation about civic processes or COVID-19, could be applied to fleets.  Twitter also confirmed it was working on a live audio feature, dubbed \u2018Spaces,\u2019 that it aims to test later this year. The feature will allow users to talk in public, group conversations. It has similarities with Clubhouse, a social platform in which users are invited to talk in voice chat rooms.  \u201cGiven all of the potential for abuse within audio spaces, we are going to be making it available first to women and historically marginalized communities,\u201d said Kelley.  The company earlier this year launched a feature for users to tweet recorded voice notes.","161":"KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Twitter has launched a new prompt to fight gender-based violence in response to a surge in sexual assaults and domestic attacks during lockdown, a company official said on Wednesday.  The social network said the feature, currently available in 11 countries, directs users to local helpline services if they search for terms such as \u201cdomestic violence\u201d or \u201csexual assault\u201d.  \u201cThis is the first time that this notification prompt has been made available in multiple locations in multiple languages,\u201d said Kathleen Reen, a senior director of Twitter in Asia-Pacific.  The prompt was introduced across Asia last week, then expanded to the United States on Wednesday, with notifications in English and Spanish. Next step: Europe and Latin America.  \u201cTwitter is a very popular service during crisis. People come to find out what\u2019s happening, what\u2019s breaking and to get key information on real-time basis,\u201d Reen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The initiative came after the United Nations warned there had been a \u201chorrifying global surge\u201d in domestic violence, with calls to helplines doubling or tripling in some countries, as lockdowns trapped many women indoors with their abusers.  The feature is an expansion of Twitter\u2019s #ThereIsHelp initiative, which provides similar notifications on issues such as suicide prevention and vaccinations.  U.N. chief Antonio Guterres has called on governments to take urgent measures to tackle the spike in domestic violence and make it a part of national response plans for COVID-19.  More than 240 million women and girls aged 15 to 49 worldwide have faced sexual or physical violence by an intimate partner over the past 12 months, U.N. figures show.  It says the figure is likely to increase due to health and money worries ratcheting up tensions at home.  \u201cViolence against women and girls across Asia-Pacific is pervasive but at the same time widely under-reported,\u201d said Melissa Alvarado, a manager at the U.N. Women Asia-Pacific, which partners with Twitter on the latest feature.  \u201cConnecting women who are feeling fearful or in danger is critical for their safety,\u201d she added in a statement.","162":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - The board of Twitter Inc TWTR.N expressed support for Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey on Monday and said it had confidence in the social media company's \"current structure\".  \u201cThe committee expressed its confidence in management and recommended that the current structure remain in place,\u201d the board said in a regulatory filing.  The board cited Twitter\u2019s \u201csignificantly improving product\u201d and financial performance in the third quarter when revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $936 million.  Earlier this year, Dorsey fought off an attempt by activist investor Elliott Management to oust him from his job by agreeing to growth targets.  The deal bought time for Dorsey, who is also CEO of financial tech company Square SQ.N, to show Elliott he could run two public companies.  The social media platform had 187 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU) during the third quarter, missing consensus analyst expectations of 195.2 million users, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The renewed heat from Indian legislators comes a day after an Indian parliamentary panel said Twitter submitted a written apology for geo-tagging a northern Himalayan region as part of China. The company vowed to make corrections by month-end.  Meenakashi Lekhi, the head of the panel and a lawmaker from India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ordered Twitter to explain on Thursday why it had not taken down \u201cobscene\u201d tweets by a stand-up comedian against the country\u2019s top court and its judges.  Twitter declined to comment.  The fresh scrutiny comes at a time when India has taken a tough stance around policing digital content. To tackle \u201cfake news\u201d and disinformation, India has proposed a strict set of rules that would force social media giants to deploy automated tools to check for unlawful content and appoint an officer for \u201c24x7\u201d coordination with law enforcement.  Lekhi\u2019s comments come after comedian Kunal Kamra in a series of tweets this month lampooned India\u2019s Supreme Court and some of its judges, after they intervened to grant bail to the head of a nationalist TV news channel, accused of abetment in a suicide case.  Among other tweets deriding the judges, Kamra also posted an image of the court painted in saffron - a colour associated with Hindu nationalism - with the ruling party\u2019s flag raised over the court.  \u201cKamra is playing with Indian institutions ... degrading our institutions is not acceptable,\u201d Lekhi told Reuters.  Lekhi said Twitter\u2019s explanation that it did not moderate content unless it violated the platform\u2019s policy, was inadequate. Twitter has been given seven days to explain its stand on the matter, she added.  Kamra did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment.

The companies have sought to distance themselves from the violent storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, following weeks of toxic rhetoric and organizing online.  Here\u2019s what each company says it is doing:  FACEBOOK  The world\u2019s biggest social media company says it has blocked the creation of any new events near strategic places like the White House, the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings through Inauguration Day.  Facebook also re-introduced a measure used after the presidential election that gives added weight in its news feed algorithm to publishers considered authoritative, based on an internal \u201cnews ecosystem quality\u201d scoring system.  Other temporary changes include blocks on the ability of people who have repeatedly violated policies to create events, groups, pages and live videos, as well as stepped-up requirements for users running groups to pre-approve posts.  On Saturday, Facebook said it would prohibit ads for weapon accessories like gun holsters and vests until at least two days after the inauguration, although researchers have spotted such ads even after the ban.  The company suspended Trump at least through Inauguration Day, saying he used Facebook to \u201cincite violent insurrection,\u201d and has no plans to lift the ban even after that.  TWITTER  After the Capitol unrest, Twitter announced steps to limit amplification of tweets violating its election misinformation rules, blocking likes, replies and retweets of those messages.  Users can still quote the tweets, but must add their own comments before sharing, it said.  The company also updated its \u201ccivic integrity\u201d policy to establish a strike-based enforcement system for misleading election claims and purged more than 70,000 accounts for sharing QAnon content.  A Twitter spokeswoman declined to say whether the company was restricting automated content recommendations, such as suggestions for users to follow, or to disclose specific terms being blocked from appearing in \u201ctrending\u201d topics.  On Inauguration Day, Twitter will transfer control of official White House accounts like @WhiteHouse and @POTUS to the Biden administration.  The company permanently suspended Trump\u2019s personal account @realDonaldTrump, citing the risk of further incitement. That account had been his primary megaphone throughout his presidency.  YOUTUBE  YouTube, Alphabet Inc\u2019s video streaming platform, said it has put in place \u201cadditional protective measures\u201d for Inauguration Day, without elaborating.  The company bars live videos that show someone using a firearm, but declined to say whether it was imposing any further restrictions on livestreams or making temporary changes to its systems for recommending content.  On Tuesday, YouTube extended a one-week ban on Trump\u2019s account for at least an additional seven days, citing \u201cconcerns about the ongoing potential for violence.\u201d  PARLER  Parler, which styles itself as a \u201cfree-speech\u201d space, remains largely offline after being dropped by Amazon\u2019s hosting arm and major app stores after the Capitol attack, with partners citing its poor record of policing calls for violence.  A static version of its website returned on Jan. 15 with the help of a Russian-owned technology company and has featured a handful of posts by executives and others, including Fox News host Mark Levin.  Jeffrey Wernick, Parler\u2019s chief operating officer, told Reuters the company was posting those comments on behalf of \u201cfriends who reached out\u201d and had not yet put in place any new content guidelines.  DLIVE  Niche video streaming platform DLive, in the spotlight after far-right personalities used it to broadcast live during the Capitol siege, said it would block all live streams from Washington, D.C. on Jan. 20.  The company, popular with video game streamers, also started proactively reviewing content in the non-gaming \u201cX-tag\u201d section of its site and halted the ability of streamers there to earn money off their videos, it said.  TWITCH  Amazon\u2019s livestreaming platform declined to disclose whether it had put in place any specific measures related to the inauguration.  The company said it removes content that incites or glorifies violence and was monitoring for policy violations. It has carried graphic livestreams of extremist violence before, including shootings in Germany in 2019.  Twitch disabled Trump\u2019s account indefinitely after the Capitol attack and said it would reassess the ban after he leaves office.  SNAPCHAT  Snap Inc maintains it faces fewer problems with extremism and incitement to violence than other platforms because of Snapchat\u2019s design: no open news feed, pre-approval for promoted content and limits on the size of group chats.  A spokeswoman said an internal team is conducting regular proactive sweeps for rules violations around the inauguration, but the platform is not making any other changes.  Snap permanently terminated Trump\u2019s account after the Capitol unrest, \u201cbased on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence.\u201d  REDDIT  Reddit did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for inauguration week.  The company had long hosted r\/The_Donald, a popular online home base for Trump fans, but shut down the forum last year for violating hate speech rules.

Elliott\u2019s head of U.S. activism, Jesse Cohn, and private equity firm Silver Lake\u2019s co-chief executive officer Egon Durban, will join the social media site\u2019s board immediately and the company plans to appoint a third new director soon.  Silver Lake also will invest $1 billion in Twitter.  The agreement brings together hedge fund Elliott, which owns a $1 billion stake in Twitter, and Silver Lake in an unusual arrangement that lets Dorsey continue to lead the company, for now, and sidestep a potentially nasty proxy contest.  \u201cWhile our CEO structure is unique, so is Jack and so is this company,\u201d Twitter\u2019s lead independent director Patrick Pichette said in a statement.  Twitter shares were up about 0.4% on a day of heavy selling on Wall Street.  In reaching the agreement with Twitter, Elliott keeps a close eye on Dorsey while also giving the company more time to formulate long-term plans and repair missteps, people familiar with Elliott\u2019s thinking said.  They added that the deal avoids a mad scramble to find an immediate replacement for Dorsey.  Twitter\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal, who was privy to the discussions, said he believed the arrangement reflected more than short-term support for Dorsey.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThis is by no means thought about as temporary. This is just getting back to work with the team and the strategy, ambitions and timeframe that we were working against before,\u201d he told Reuters in a phone interview.  \u201cEgon joining should be a big indication of Silver Lake\u2019s support for the founder, the team and our strategy and ambitions,\u201d he said.  Twitter said in its statement that it would use the Silver Lake investment to help fund a $2 billion share repurchase program.  Twitter also pledged to grow daily users by 20% or more in 2020 and beyond, roughly in line with user growth in its most recent quarter and its projections that costs and expenses would increase 20% this year.  The board will also create a temporary committee to evaluate Twitter\u2019s leadership structure and CEO succession plan that will share the results publicly before the end of the year.  Late last month Elliott nominated four directors to Twitter's board and was pushing to remove Dorsey, one of Silicon Valley's most prominent entrepreneurs, criticizing him for being the CEO of two publicly traded companies: Twitter and Square SQ.N, a mobile payments company he co-founded.  Each company, Elliott and other investors argued, deserves a full time CEO.  Investors had also expressed concern about Dorsey\u2019s plan to spend three to six months living in Africa this year, something he walked back last week citing \u201ceverything happening in the world, particularly with coronavirus.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWe invested in Twitter because we see a significant opportunity for value creation at the company,\u201d Elliott\u2019s Cohn said. \u201cI am looking forward to working with Jack and the board to help contribute to realizing Twitter\u2019s full potential.\u201d  Cohn will now sit on three boards including online shopping company eBay, which reached an agreement with Elliott in early 2019. Devin Wenig, eBay\u2019s CEO at the time, left nine months after Elliott got a seat, citing differences with the board.  2020 promises to be a big year for Twitter with people looking to the company for news about the coronavirus, the U.S. election and the planned Olympics in Tokyo.  The company has taken more aggressive steps in recent months to curtail abusive behavior and give people control over the content they see on the platform. It is also rebuilding its ads system following technical issues that hurt profits last year.  Dorsey told analysts in January that rolling out features at a faster pace was one of Twitter\u2019s top priorities this year, acknowledging that the company had been slow in turning ideas into products.  Silver Lake sent its first tweet ever to announce the news, saying: \u201cSilver Lake is excited to partner with @Twitter by investing and joining the board and we look forward to working alongside @Jack and the whole team.\u201d  Twitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott.","173":"Jan 14 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc:  * SPUTNIK V SAYS TWITTER RESTORED ACCESS TO @SPUTNIKVACCINE ACCOUNT - TWEET  * SPUTNIK V SAYS TWITTER EXPLAINED THAT THEY RESTRICTED THE ACCOUNT DUE TO A POSSIBLE SECURITY BREACH FROM VIRGINIA, USA- TWEET Source text: bit.ly\/2XDq4VN Further company coverage:","174":"NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc reported a better-than-expected 24 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue on Thursday, helped by growth in its video advertising business.

Overall revenue rose to $909 million in the quarter, beating Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of $868.2 million.  Total advertising revenue rose 23 percent to $791 million. More than half that revenue came from video ads placed by corporate clients.  Revenue from data licensing and other non-advertising businesses rose 35 percent from a year earlier to $117 million.  Twitter reported quarterly profit, excluding some items, of 31 cents per share. Analysts had expected 25 cents, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The number of average daily active users exposed to Twitter ads, a new figure disclosed by the company, rose to 126 million in the fourth quarter from 115 million a year ago and 124 million in the previous quarter.  Monthly active users totaled 321 million. That was in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts, but down from 330 million a year earlier and 326 million in the third quarter. Twitter said that after the current quarter it would stop disclosing monthly active users, a statistic that has become standard among internet companies over the last decade.  For the current quarter, Twitter said it expected total revenue to be between $715 million and $775 million. Analysts are expecting about $765 million, on average.  Twitter said it expects operating expenses to rise about 20 percent year-on-year in 2019 due to efforts to improve its service, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of 12 percent.

In a statement posted to the company\u2019s Public Policy Twitter feed on Saturday, Twitter said \u201ca number of accounts\u201d had been suspended as part of efforts to target accounts engaging in \u201cplatform manipulation\u201d.  \u201cSome of these were involved in commentary about China. These accounts were not mass reported by the Chinese authorities - this was a routine action on our part,\u201d the company said.

Twitter\u2019s statement follows a sharp reaction from its users over the suspensions, including U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who in a tweet accused Twitter of becoming \u201ca Chinese (government) censor\u201d.  The approach of the 30th anniversary of the bloody June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square has been accompanied in China by a tightening of censorship. Tools to detect and block content related to the 1989 crackdown have reached unprecedented levels of accuracy.

The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\u2019s (GDPR) \u201cOne Stop Shop\u201d regime makes Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission lead regulator of Twitter, Facebook, Apple and Google in the bloc, due to the location of their EU headquarters.  GDPR has been in force since 2018, but the Twitter case is the first using a new dispute resolution system under which one lead national regulator makes a decision before consulting with the other EU national regulators.  Some European Union regulators objected to Ireland\u2019s preliminary Twitter ruling when it was issued in May, triggering a referral to the dispute resolution body, the European Data Protection Board to secure a two-thirds majority among member states.  The Twitter fine relates to a 2019 probe into a bug in its Android app, where some users\u2019 protected tweets were made public.  In particular it was levied due to Twitter\u2019s \u201cfailure to notify the breach on time to the DPC and a failure to adequately document the breach,\u201d the Data Protection Commission said in a statement.  The Irish regulator, which has more than 20 major inquiries into U.S technology firms open, has the power to impose fines for violations of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global revenue or 20 million euros ($22 million), whichever is higher.

The Reuters review found tens of thousands of tweets that an expert said appeared to be from accounts amplifying royalist messaging in a push to counter a months-long protest movement that has swelled from opposing the government to breaking a longstanding taboo by challenging the monarchy.  Internal army training documents reviewed by Reuters showed evidence of a coordinated information campaign designed to spread favourable information and discredit opponents.  The pro-monarchy @jitarsa_school account was suspended after Reuters sought comment on Wednesday from Twitter on the recent royalist campaign on the social media platform, where protesters have long had a strong presence.  Protesters and royalists have cited the importance of social media in propelling the protest movement, which has become the biggest challenge in decades to the monarchy as well as the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha.  Created in September, the @jitarsa_school account had more than 48,000 followers before its suspension.  \u201cThe account in question was suspended for violating our rules on spam and platform manipulation,\u201d a Twitter representative said on Sunday. She said the suspension was in line with the company\u2019s policies and not a result of the Reuters request for comment.  The account\u2019s profile had said that it trained people for the Royal Volunteers programme, which is run by the Royal Office. A Facebook page for the Royal Volunteers School, which posts pro-monarchy videos and news of the programme, also identifies the Twitter account as its own.  Neither the school nor the Royal Volunteers headquarters responded to requests for comment on the suspension. The \u201cVolunteer Spirit 904\u201d programme was established during the current king\u2019s reign, which began in 2016, to build loyalty to the monarchy.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The palace did not respond to a request for comment. It has a policy of not speaking to media and has not commented since the start of protests in July that initially targeted the government before breaking taboos by calling for curbs to the king\u2019s powers.  ROYALIST FIGHTBACK  In recent weeks, royalist hashtags have begun trending on Twitter, an important platform for opponents of the government even before protests began in July.  The Reuters analysis found that more than 80% of the accounts following @jitarsa_school had also been created since the start of September. A sample of 4,600 of the recently created accounts showed that all they did was promote the royalist hashtags - an indication of the kind of activity that would not be associated with regular Twitter users.  (Graphic: Thai royalist Twitter account's new followers )  A sample of 559 retweets of the account\u2019s tweets were virtually all from accounts with bot-like characteristics, according to research by social media consultancy Drone Emprit for Reuters.  \u201cGovernment forces have been trying to counter the protesters,\u201d said Saijai Liangpunsakul of the independent Social Media Monitoring for Peace group. \u201cTwitter has taken down some accounts, but there are many more.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Hashtags promoted by the suspended account, usually alongside pictures of the king and other royals, included those that translate as: #StopViolatingTheMonarchy, #ProtectTheMonarchy, #WeLoveTheMotherOfTheLand, #WeLoveTheMonarchy and #MinionsLoveTheMonarchy.  Royalist group leader Warong Dechgitvigrom declined to comment on the account\u2019s suspension, saying he was unaware of it.  He told Reuters there were more pro-monarchy messages on Twitter because royalists increasingly recognised the need to counter protesters\u2019 messages and had encouraged each another to join the platform.  \u201cPro-monarchy hashtags are authentic, born out of true feelings,\u201d he said.  PROTESTERS ACCUSED BY ROYALISTS  Royalists have accused protesters of inauthentic activity on Twitter, with coordinated campaigns around hashtags.  But Parit \u201cPenguin\u201d Chiwarak, one of the protest leaders, said protesters using the platform were genuine and he welcomed the suspension of the pro-royalist account.  \u201cThey\u2019re not recruited to trend hashtags like the army and they don\u2019t use taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.  Although not directly linked to the @jitarsa_school account, a 28-page army document reviewed by Reuters showed an organised information operation to target \u201copponents\u201d and spread pro-monarchy messages on Twitter.  The document says 17,562 Twitter accounts run by 9,743 army officers are split into a \u201cWhite Team\u201d and a \u201cGrey\/Black Team\u201d that were instructed to tweet with coordinated hashtags, as well as to like, retweet and follow one another.  The document suggests measures to appear more like authentic accounts.  The army on Saturday acknowledged the document is genuine, saying in a Facebook post it was used in a training session to strengthen the army\u2019s public relations efforts.  In early October, Twitter announced it had taken down 926 accounts linked to the Thai army for violating its platform-manipulation policies by amplifying pro-government content and targeting political opposition figures.  The army at the time denied that the accounts belonged to army officials.","179":"FILE PHOTO: People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken in Warsaw September 27, 2013.

Beykpour also acknowledged the privacy and security concerns that some early adopters had raised about fleets, or tweets that disappear automatically after 24 hours, but said those issues would mostly be addressed in subsequent updates.  Twitter initially started to launch fleets on Tuesday, after having tested it in a handful of countries, but later slowed the rollout in order to fix performance and stability issues.  Critics said the tool created worrying opportunities for online harassment, like allowing unwanted direct messages, which would be more difficult to address with an ephemeral product. It also allows fleet authors to tag people who have blocked them.  Beykpour said Twitter would remove links from those tags within the next day to address the blocking concerns, but that it would take longer to find \u201cbetter solutions\u201d for the other issues.  \u201cCan\u2019t promise that\u2019s going to be an overnight quick fix, but we\u2019re absolutely thinking about it,\u201d he said.","180":"LONDON (Reuters) - Square, the payments company co-founded by Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, has launched an initiative to enable refugee entrepreneurs to accept card and mobile payments, to help get their businesses off the ground.

Speaking at a London Tech Week event, Dorsey told Reuters that nothing the company does \u201cis more important than serving folks like refugees, who are just getting started, in an entirely new culture, entirely new community and an entirely new language in many cases, and just need a little bit of help.\u201d  Muzaffar Sadykov, one of three refugee entrepreneurs to join Dorsey on stage to launch the collaboration, said Square was helping him serve more customers, more quickly, at his street-food business \u2018Oshpaz\u2019.  \u201cNowadays people want to pay contactless,\u201d Sadykov, who came to Britain from Kyrgyzstan, said.  The fact that payments via Square arrived in his account within a day had persuaded him to get involved, he said, given that he was relying on his savings to fund the business.  Dorsey said communities needed to help people of all backgrounds participate in the economy, particularly those who had suffered hardship. \u201cI think that\u2019s critical to a healthy society.\u201d  Asked about the often polarized discussions about refugees on social media, he said it was \u201cnecessary to have these conversations, and to address the issues and to acknowledge it and work to fix it.\u201d  Square, which was co-founded by Dorsey in 2009, arrived in Britain just over two years ago with the objective of helping small businesses accept card payments.  Dorsey said he wanted all of Square\u2019s customers to have full control of their data.  \u201cThat starts with the customers of our sellers, then it continues to our sellers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is their data and they need to use it in a way that is insightful so they can grow their business - but their customers should also be able to turn it off.\u201d  However, the company has made some missteps, including sending some digital receipts to the wrong customers, according to a Wall Street Journal report.  \u201cAs we develop products we are going to find new ways of doing things, things that don\u2019t work, and we are going to correct them,\u201d Dorsey said.  Dorsey said Square could seek similar partnerships elsewhere.  \u201cRight now we are experimenting and we love what we are seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat unifies (the entrepreneurs) is the sense of ambition, the sense of hustle and doing whatever it takes to make it work.\u201d","181":"A photo illustration shows the suspended Twitter account of U.S. President Donald Trump on a smartphone at the White House briefing room in Washington, U.S., January 8, 2021.

Trump tweeted \u201cWe will not be SILENCED!\u201d from the @POTUS government account, with 33.4 million followers. Twitter had permanently suspended the president\u2019s go-to megaphone, his @realDonaldTrump personal account, hours earlier.

FILE PHOTO: Electronic cables are silhouetted next to the logo of Twitter in this September 23, 2014 illustration photo in Sarajevo. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Twitter said the accounts had been suspended for violating its policy against \u201ccoordination\u201d by posting identical content while appearing independent or engaging in other covertly automated behavior.  One of those suspended, SVNewsAlerts, had more than 78,000 Twitter followers, after adding more than 10,000 in the past week.  The account frequently warned of election-related unrest and highlighted issues with voting safety and reliability. It pointed to fraud claims about Democrats and called attention to Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s rallies and speeches.  In fact, few if any major disruptions were reported at polling sites on Tuesday as civil liberties groups and law enforcement were on high alert for any interference with voters.  Other accounts suspended by Twitter included FJNewsReporter, Crisis_Intel and Faytuks. Some of the accounts in the past suggested that readers follow the others.  Facebook also suspended several accounts behind U.S.-based pages called SV News and FJ News, citing inauthentic behavior. The SV page had more than 20,000 followers.  Some of the suspended accounts were closely read by the media in Russia, which has been accused of meddling in the 2016 election. Both SVNewsAlerts and Faytuks, which had only 11,000 followers, have had their tweets highlighted dozens of times in state-controlled Sputnik and RT, as observed by researcher Chris Scott and confirmed by Reuters.  Even as social media companies took action, false or exaggerated reports about voting fraud and delays at the polls circulated throughout the day, in some cases helped along by official Republican accounts and online publications.  The FBI and the New York attorney general also said they were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home, which were reported in multiple battleground states.  Twitter appended fact-checking labels to multiple tweets from the @PhillyGOP account, which was among those using the hashtag #StopTheSteal. The Philadelphia Republican Party did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Twitter labels.  Far-right sites Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit both published articles claiming \u201cthe steal is on\u201d in Pennsylvania that racked up thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter.  #StopTheSteal spiked from a few dozen mentions to more than 2,000 mentions over a 15-minute period in the morning, according to media intelligence firm Zignal Labs.  Zignal said unfounded claims about closed polling stations and excessively long lines in Republican-leaning areas in Pennsylvania, one of the most closely contested states, received more than 33,000 mentions on Twitter.  Alex Stamos, former chief technology officer of Facebook and now director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, told reporters there were coordinated efforts to deliberately blow some problems out of proportion.  \u201cSpecifically in Pennsylvania - to say this example is a demonstration of something nefarious going on, and not just the kind of random mistake that happens all the time,\u201d he said on a call organized by the Election Integrity Partnership.  In one video shared widely among conservative audiences, including by both of Trump\u2019s sons, a Trump poll-watcher was seen being turned away from a site. The video was viewed 2.5 million times on Twitter.  Philadelphia officials investigated and concluded the man had mistakenly been barred under an expired law, which required authorization to enter a specific polling spot. He was then admitted.  Followers of the conspiracy movement QAnon also spread the Pennsylvania reports, according to researchers at misinformation tracking firm Alethea Group.","183":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may be best remembered for his use of Twitter as a bully pulpit to stoke controversy or browbeat opponents, but the noise his tweets generated often distracted from the big policy changes he made over his four-year term.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump holds an Executive Order during a signing ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque  During his rollercoaster presidency, the focus was often on what Trump was saying and not on what he was doing as he careened from one self-induced crisis to another. But a review of his policies shows that he had a real effect on people\u2019s lives in the areas of energy and environment, immigration, the judiciary, business and the economy, trade, and foreign policy, among others.  CHINA  The Trump administration put China\u2019s rise in the spotlight and helped forge a bipartisan and increasingly adversarial U.S. view of the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  From a raft of tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports to sanctions against top officials and a muscular use of penalties against top Chinese companies like Huawei, ZTE, SMIC and TikTok, Trump hit Beijing on a variety of fronts.  Some allies, however, have raised questions about the effectiveness of these measures and hope that President-elect Joe Biden, who has promised to be just as tough on China, will coordinate better with them to rein in Beijing.  Tensions have risen especially over the past year with Trump repeatedly blaming China for the coronavirus, which originated in the city of Wuhan.  The two global powers are increasingly at odds over a range of other issues, including Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea.  Biden has been vague about his plans for some of Trump\u2019s signature measures, it will be hard for him to dramatically unwind many of them, given the overwhelmingly bipartisan anti-China sentiment in the U.S. Congress.  ECONOMY  The U.S. economy under Trump had two distinct phases: pre-and post-COVID-19.  Before the coronavirus pandemic hit in March of 2020, unemployment had hit 50-year lows, wages were rising for lower-income jobs, and the gap between Black and white unemployment was narrowing.  The landmark tax bill Trump signed in late 2017 pushed economic growth over 3%, a Trump campaign promise, for a brief period.  Things could have been better, but an 18-month tariff war with China, which cost U.S. companies billions, was a drag on growth and jobs. It ended in early 2020 with a bigger trade deficit with China than when it began.  Three Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2019 helped blunt the impact. Taxpayers shelled out about $50 billion in subsidies to U.S. farmers in 2020 alone to make up for the loss in sales to China.  The pandemic, and the administration\u2019s failure to control it, risks leaving the economy scarred long after Trump leaves office. About 21 million jobs disappeared immediately, and 9 million of those still haven\u2019t come back. Millions more have had hours or pay reduced, or dropped out of the labor force altogether.  Meanwhile, the U.S. national debt jumped by nearly $7.8 trillion, to $27 trillion, as corporate tax revenue dropped and spending increased to counter the trade war and pandemic impacts.  CLIMATE CHANGE  Trump routinely dismissed scientific consensus that industry was causing global warming and gutted federal science agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior and interfered with their scientific advisory panels. He also boasted about removing the United States from the global Paris Agreement on climate change.  He styled himself as a friend of fossil fuels, courting coal workers and oil executives alike and made good on promises to ease costs for energy companies by rolling back more than 100 climate- and environment-related regulations.  While oil and gas companies praised corporate tax cuts, they grumbled about Trump\u2019s trade war with China disrupting supply chains and jeopardizing demand for U.S. natural gas exports.  Many of Trump\u2019s deregulation efforts were successfully challenged in court due to bureaucratic errors in rulemaking procedures.  Trump opened up a record number of acres on public lands to drilling and mining, including a last-minute auction for oil development permits in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge that attracted few bidders.  In his first weeks in office, Biden is expected to begin reversing some of Trump\u2019s most prominent regulatory rollbacks, rejoin the Paris agreement and order every federal cabinet agency to identify who is in charge of combating climate change.  FOREIGN POLICY  Had Trump won the Nov. 3 election, America\u2019s friends and foes were girding for a second four years, to borrow one of his favorite phrases, the likes of which the world had never seen. His election defeat deprived him of the chance to double down on his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, but the fallout is expected to linger.  Trump has upended some tenets of America\u2019s post-World War Two foreign policy by questioning the NATO alliance, alienating European partners and indulging autocrats.  His disdain for multilateralism prompted withdrawals from accords and bodies, including the Iran nuclear deal and the World Health Organization. His treatment of U.S. allies has left Biden with shell-shocked friends and the challenge of restoring the United States as a champion of democracy.  Trump partially delivered on a campaign promise to bring troops home from \u201cendless wars,\u201d but scaled-down forces remain in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Despite Trump\u2019s historic engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, he has made no progress in persuading Kim to give up his nuclear weapons.  Trump\u2019s hard line on Iran has crippled its economy but not forced it back to the negotiating table, and Biden\u2019s aides see the last-minute piling-on of sanctions by the Republican administration as an effort to box him in.  While Trump failed to achieve promised Israeli-Palestinian peace, he brokered deals to normalize relations between Israel and four Arab neighbors.  IMMIGRATION  Trump ended his presidency as he began it - with a laser-like focus on immigration.  \u201cWe got it done,\u201d Trump said, standing in front of a section of the 450 miles (724 km) of new and replacement border fence in Texas on one of the last days of his presidency.  The 18-30 foot-high steel fence is the most visible example of Trump\u2019s reshaping of the U.S. immigration system. He set up a multitude of new bureaucratic hurdles for immigrants seeking to enter or stay in the United States. Many of the measures were challenged in court and some were stopped by national injunctions.  Trump imposed a travel ban on a handful of Muslim-majority nations which was later expanded, slashed the U.S. refugee program and forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings.  Trump\u2019s 2018 \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy to prosecute illegal border crossings led to several thousand children being separated from parents and legal guardians at the U.S.-Mexico border. He later reversed the policy but the parents of some 600 children have still not been located by advocates.  Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the administration imposed new restrictions that allow border officials to expel almost all migrants caught crossing the border and block the entry of many temporary foreign workers and applicants for green cards.  Biden plans to send a bill to Congress on Wednesday that lays out \u201ca clear roadmap to citizenship\u201d for some 11 million people living in the United States unlawfully. He has also said he will rescind the travel ban, end the program requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico and seek to reunite children separated from their parents.  JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS  Trump wasn\u2019t happy when judges he appointed ruled against his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, but his reshaping of the judiciary in a conservative direction is still one of his biggest legacies.  During his four years in office, he appointed three Supreme Court justices, the first time that has been done since President Richard Nixon appointed four in his first term. The court now has a rock-solid 6-3 conservative majority.  Trump can thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who made judicial nominations a priority, for his ability to appoint not just Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett but also dozens of lower court judges.  Trump appointed 54 judges to the influential appeals courts, just one fewer than his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama managed in eight years and almost a third of the total number.  (For a graphic showing Trump\u2019s impact on federal appeals courts, click tmsnrt.rs\/2PPsGtM)  Trump also named 174 district court judges, the lowest rung on the federal judicial ladder, making up about a quarter of the total number of judges now serving on those courts.  Biden will be able to make inroads on judicial appointments but opportunities are limited because there are few vacancies. He might get the chance to replace liberal Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court if the 82-year-old chooses to retire.  RACE RELATIONS  Trump saved some of his nastiest words for Black athletes kneeling to protest racial injustice, Black and Muslim women politicians who disagreed with him, and non-white immigrants and asylum seekers.  White nationalism, which has festered in the United States since its very start, bloomed under Trump. Propaganda and recruiting for anti-minority organizations jumped and hate crimes climbed. The Capitol riot on Jan. 6 may be just the beginning of more violent threats from white nationalists, terror experts say.  Trump policy took aim at Muslims specifically. The early \"Muslim Ban\" limited travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, while a domestic program tracking extremism was refocused here to only monitor Islamist threats, ignoring white nationalism.  Guidelines calling on colleges and universities to consider race to promote diversity, and encouraging public schools to use zoning and admissions into competitive schools and programs to tackle inequalities, were rolled back in 2018.  A September 2020 Executive Order forbidding federal agencies and government contractors from diversity training that included \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d resulted in some stopping any training on gender or race altogether.  A notable exception, 2018\u2019s First Step Act, was the first major criminal justice reform in a decade. It reduced mandatory minimum sentences, and allowed some federal prisoners to finish their sentences early with good behavior.  The toxic relationship between some city police departments and their communities was highlighted by the 2020 death of George Floyd; a divided Congress couldn\u2019t pass a bill in response.  REGULATIONS  Trump came into office pledging to slash corporate red tape which he said stymied economic growth and hurt jobs.  At his administration\u2019s urging, the Republican-led Congress swiftly reversed 16 regulations on fair lending, corporate disclosures, and consumer privacy, among others, and eased banking industry rules introduced following the 2009 financial crisis, in a landmark legislative victory. Most of the action, however, came from Trump\u2019s regulators, which across the government took hundreds of deregulatory measures.  While advocacy groups and progressives slammed Trump\u2019s deregulatory measures for hurting consumers or increasing systemic risks, the changes were rarely as radical as many had initially feared and in some cases even drew backing from Democrats sympathetic to the notion that small businesses would benefit from a lighter touch. Wall Street giants, for their part, won far fewer victories than they would have liked and in some cases found themselves at odds with Trump\u2019s regulators.  Despite the overarching pro-business flavor of Trump\u2019s time in office, his Justice Department led the charge against Big Tech, setting in motion antitrust investigations against Apple, Amazon.com and Facebook, and suing Google for using its online heft to cripple rivals.  Trump\u2019s team also loosened regulations on labor, allowed Corporate America to create more pollution, and was generally more welcoming of mergers and acquisitions. To a certain extent, the regulatory changes can be overturned, some very quickly, by the Biden administration. With Democrats in charge of the Senate and House, some Trump actions will be reversed under the Congressional Review Act, while new staff at regulators can rewrite some, and choose not to enforce others. But big corporate tie-ups, like T-Mobile\u2019s purchase of Sprint, are unlikely to be undone.","184":"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand\u2019s army on Friday denied using nearly a thousand Twitter accounts blocked by the social media company, which said they were linked to the army and had targeted the political opposition.  In its first such move against Thailand-based accounts, Twitter said it had \u201cpermanently suspended\u201d 926 accounts linked to the Royal Thai Army (RTA) for violating its manipulation policies.  \u201cThese accounts were engaging in amplifying pro-RTA and pro-government content, as well as engaging in behaviour targeting prominent political opposition figures,\u201d it said in a statement.  In response, Deputy Army Spokeswoman Sirichan Ngathong said the accounts were anonymous and did not belong to the army - which had only its official account.  \u201cThe issue of information operations is a misunderstanding. We don\u2019t do this. It\u2019s not one of our objectives for using Twitter,\u201d she told reporters.  Thailand\u2019s army ruled from a 2014 coup until elections last year, when junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha stayed on as prime minister - rejecting the complaints of critics that the ballot was a facade to keep the military\u2019s hands on power.  The army had previously dismissed opposition accusations it was carrying out information operations through social media - which has been a powerful rallying force for anti-government protesters over the past three months.  The blocked accounts appeared to have had limited influence.  Data from Twitter showed that more than two thirds of them had no followers.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan approved the deal worked out on Friday that settled the dispute in which the SEC had sought to find Musk in contempt of a securities fraud settlement last year.  Earlier this month, Nathan had ordered the parties to work out an arrangement between themselves.  The new deal lays out in more detail what types of statements by Musk must be reviewed by Tesla\u2019s legal counsel before publication, such as financial statements, previously unreported production or delivery numbers, and other topics.  Regulators had claimed that a February tweet by Musk about Tesla\u2019s production numbers violated the earlier settlement, as it had not been vetted by the company\u2019s attorneys. Musk countered that the tweet was not material.  The SEC sued Musk last year for making fraudulent statements after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share.  The parties eventually settled, and the deal called for Tesla\u2019s lawyers to pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.","186":"May 15 (Reuters) - Greenlight Capital Inc:  * GREENLIGHT CAPITAL DISSOLVES SHARE STAKE IN UNDER ARMOUR INC  * GREENLIGHT CAPITAL CUTS SHARE STAKE IN TWITTER INC BY 10.1 PERCENT TO 2.5 MILLION SHARES  * GREENLIGHT CAPITAL TAKES SHARE STAKE OF 2.1 MILLION SHARES IN OFFICE DEPOT INC  * GREENLIGHT CAPITAL CUTS SHARE STAKE IN PERRIGO CO PLC BY 20.7 PERCENT TO 2.3 MILLION SHARES  * GREENLIGHT CAPITAL - CHANGE IN HOLDINGS ARE AS OF MARCH 31, 2018 AND COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS QUARTER ENDED AS OF DEC 31, 2017 Source For the quarter ended Mar 31, 2018: bit.ly\/2rInDBI Source For the quarter ended Dec 31, 2017: bit.ly\/2nZmLXw","187":"Twitter Inc and its top executives have asked a federal judge to dismiss a proposed class action by investors who allege that a software change made to protect users\u2019 privacy caused the company\u2019s advertising revenue to drop.

New ad formats, partnerships with content providers like the U.S. National Basketball Association and efforts to patrol abusive content are helping Twitter better compete for advertising dollars, executives said.  Social media companies have been under pressure over privacy concerns and political influence activity. Twitter has removed thousands of spam and suspicious accounts, which it blamed for sequential declines in monthly users in recent quarters.  Twitter executives said they saw opportunities for selling ads that earn revenue when users visit websites or download apps, citing success with major brands like Walt Disney Co. The company is looking to grow its sales team in 2019 to better serve big advertisers.  \u201cSomething where you see a blending of performance and brand is the Star Trek ad that Disney is running right now, where I click through to make sure that I\u2019d be notified when more information was available about the next Star Wars,\u201d Twitter Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal told analysts.  Twitter said pre-roll ads, or promotional messages that play before videos, are also growing.  The company said its monthly active users (MAU) rose 9 million to 330 million from the previous quarter, much better than Wall Street\u2019s average estimate that it would lose 2.2 million users, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Still, MAUs were down 6 million from a year earlier.  It was Twitter\u2019s last quarter of disclosing MAUs.  From now on it will only provide \u201cmonetizable\u201d daily active users (mDAUs), created to measure people exposed to advertising and exclude those who access Twitter via text messages or aggregating sites like TweetDeck.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed logo for Twitter is seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  For the first quarter, Twitter said mDAUs rose to 134 million, up 12 percent from a year ago.  Analysts were encouraged by signs the company had found ways to sustainably grow users and revenue, but said the new way of measuring users could make comparisons with rivals like Facebook Inc more difficult.  \u201cPeople are not impressed with a made up metric and their reluctance to give us actual users,\u201d said analyst Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities. \u201cI don\u2019t think the stock can get out of its own way until they come clean and report the same metrics everyone else does.\u201d  FORECAST LARGELY BELOW WALL STREET  For the first quarter, Twitter\u2019s revenue rose 18 percent to $787 million from the year-ago quarter, topping analyst estimates of $776.1 million.  But Twitter also forecast revenue for the second quarter largely below analyst estimates, and said that it would continue to spend heavily on cleaning up Twitter as well as new ad products.  Ad sales jumped 18 percent to $679 million. In the United States, ad revenue rose by 26 percent.  Total operating expense including cost of revenue rose by 18 percent from the first quarter a year ago. The company reiterated that operating expenses would grow about 20 percent in 2019.  Twitter reported quarterly profit of $191 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $61 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a $124.4 million tax benefit, the company earned 9 cents per share.  The results appeared to catch the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who called for the creation of \u201cmore, and fairer\u201d social media companies, repeating his claim that Twitter is biased against Republicans, without presenting evidence.  \u201cWe enforce the Twitter Rules dispassionately and equally for all users, regardless of their background or political affiliation,\u201d a Twitter representative said. \u201cWe are constantly working to improve our systems and will continue to be transparent in our efforts.\u201d","189":"Feb 9 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Tuesday posted 27% user growth, missing Wall Street estimates, and warned this rate would slow in the upcoming quarters as a boost from the pandemic fizzles.  The social media company, which beat quarterly sales and profit estimates, said expenses would rise 25% or more in 2021 but projected that total revenue would grow faster than costs.  In the fourth quarter, Twitter said it had 192 million average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) - its term for the number of daily users who can view ads. Analysts were expecting 196.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Twitter said user growth was driven by product improvements and more global conversation from events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. election. Some temporary changes to reduce misinformation around the U.S. election had a small negative impact on global user growth, it said.  The social media company has been in the spotlight amid global debates over what is allowed on the site - from its ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump to its recent refusal to comply with an Indian government directive to block accounts linked to the farmers\u2019 protest.  In a letter to shareholders, Twitter said the significant pandemic-related surge in users last year created challenges for future gains.  Twitter\u2019s advertising business benefitted from new ad formats and improved targeting, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said in the earnings release.  Total revenue came in at a record $1.29 billion, an increase of 28% year over year. Ad revenue was $1.15 billion, up 31% from the same period a year ago.  Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $1.19 billion, with ad sales totalling $1.05 billion.  Twitter acquired newsletter startup Revue last month. It also recently launched disappearing tweets called \u201cfleets\u201d as a low-pressure way for users to post on the site and said it had in late Q4 released a beta test of \u201cSpaces,\u201d its audio-chat room feature which has similarities with voice-based app Clubhouse.  Net income rose to $222.1 million, or 27 cents per shares, from $118.8 million, or 15 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding items, Twitter earned 38 cents per share, beating estimates of 31 cents.  Twitter\u2019s costs and expenses were $1.04 billion for the quarter, an increase of 21% year over year. It said it expected costs and expenses to rise partly due to plans to grow headcount by more than 20% particularly in engineering, product, design and research.  Twitter said it expected total revenue in the current quarter to be between $940 million and $1.04 billion, compared to estimates of $965.14 million.","190":"(Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies flooded social media on Wednesday with false claims of victory and unsupported allegations of voter fraud, social media companies warned users the presidential election had yet to be decided.  U.S. President Donald Trump holds a note with the early results from the 2020 U.S. presidential election in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., November 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlos Barria  The posts on Twitter TWTR.N, Facebook FB.O and other sites are imposing a real-time test of Silicon Valley's much-touted rules on handling election misinformation and premature claims of victory.  But it is not clear whether the disclaimers and fact-checks, which often occur well after posts have been shared tens of thousands of times, are curbing the circulation of baseless claims. And in the case of Facebook, staff rewrote some of their rules on the fly.  Critics say that, in environments explicitly built to promote instant sharing and viral posts, bland disclaimers do not cut it.  \u201cWe\u2019re on the brink here,\u201d said Jessica Gonzalez, co-CEO of the advocacy group Free Press. She said Facebook should take down disinformation rather than just flag it.  \u201cWe\u2019re testing our democracy experiment, and Facebook hasn\u2019t gotten it right up to now,\u201d Gonzalez said.  The false and unfounded claims evolved over the course of the day. Initially, Trump said he had won (he hasn\u2019t.) Then he said that unanticipated mail-in votes were appearing out of nowhere (in fact they were long-expected.) Later, Trump\u2019s campaign claimed it had won Pennsylvania (where votes are still being counted.)  Unsubstantiated allegations that ballots for Trump were not counted because voters used Sharpie pens, dubbed \u201cSharpiegate\u201d on social media, were labeled as false on Facebook but shared hundreds of thousands of times.  The rumors prompted more than 100 Trump supporters, urged on by right-wing Twitter figures, to gather in Phoenix on Wednesday and demand to be let into an election building where votes were being counted.  RULES CHANGE  Facebook\u2019s rules evolved too, with eligibility for premature victory labels expanded to non-politicians based on \u201cpotential for virality\u201d and shifting guidance on whether false claims of state victories would get labels.  The claims came as Trump\u2019s lead in battleground states has evaporated as more ballots are counted in Michigan and Wisconsin, a process that has taken longer than usual as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and extraordinarily high turnout. Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger Joe Biden is projected to win Wisconsin and Michigan.  The extended count is no surprise, and neither was the late swing to Biden, which was widely predicted in the run-up to the vote - including by Reuters. That did not stop Trump and his supporters from flooding the internet with unfounded allegations of fraud.  Twitter marked a series of Trump\u2019s tweets, including one making a false claim about \u201csurprise ballot dumps,\u201d as potentially \u201cmisleading about an election\u201d and restricted sharing of the posts.  It also tagged statements by Trump\u2019s son Eric and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany that falsely claimed victory in Pennsylvania.  Facebook put labels underneath several of the president\u2019s false posts to note that \u201cfinal results may be different from the initial vote counts,\u201d but did not restrict interactions with the posts. Each was shared tens of thousands of times.  YouTube, the video service of Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, likewise placed \"results may not be final\" labels below videos containing unsubstantiated claims without identifying the content as false or restricting comments.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  NOT STOPPING THE SPREAD  Even if the disclaimers are curbing the spread of misinformation on their platforms, they have not stopped other media from amplifying Trump\u2019s comments or his claims from hopping from one platform to another.  On Fox News, Trump\u2019s tweets were read out verbatim on Wednesday, sometimes without caveats about their veracity. And on the video-sharing site TikTok, a group called the Republican Hype House shared a video featuring a false claim that Michigan found 138,000 ballots in a lake.  TikTok said the video was later removed for violating its policy against misleading information. Fox did not respond to an email seeking comment.  Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, told reporters one critical issue was the tender treatment accorded prominent figures who lie repeatedly on social platforms.  \u201cA lot of it is the elite,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see it over and over again.\u201d  Social media companies have been under scrutiny over how they police rapidly spreading false information and election-related abuses of their platforms. In the weeks before Tuesday\u2019s vote, both vowed action on posts by candidates trying to declare early victory.  The attempts at policing those declarations began early on Wednesday, when Twitter hid a Trump tweet that claimed \u201cwe are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election\u201d behind a label that said it was potentially misleading.  Facebook added a label to the same post, which had about 25,000 shares.

India\u2019s security agencies said some of the accounts were being operated from outside the country and were sharing and amplifying misinformation and provocative content on the farmers\u2019 protests, one of the tech ministry sources told Reuters, declining to be named as the order was not public.  Twitter did not comment on whether it had complied with the government\u2019s order.  \u201cWe continue to be engaged with the government of India from a position of respect and have reached out to the Honourable Minister for a formal dialogue,\u201d a spokeswoman for Twitter in India said, adding that the safety of its local staff was a top company priority.  Tens of thousands of farmers have camped on the outskirts of India\u2019s capital New Delhi for months demanding the withdrawal of new agriculture laws they say benefit private buyers at the expense of growers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government says the reforms open up new opportunities for farmers.  Last week, India sent Twitter a notice of non-compliance, threatening its executives with jail terms and fines after the company did not obey another government order to block content that alleged Modi\u2019s administration was trying to wipe out the protesting farmers.  The incident drew criticism of the company from members of Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, in one of Twitter\u2019s top markets by users.  On Monday, Twitter for the first time said it had formally acknowledged receipt of the government\u2019s non-compliance notice.  Twitter reviews all government reports promptly and takes action, while ensuring it upholds free speech, the California-headquartered company said.  \u201cWe strongly believe that the open and free exchange of information has a positive global impact, and that the Tweets must continue to flow,\u201d the Twitter spokeswoman said.  India\u2019s IT ministry did not respond to a request for comment outside business hours.","201":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Twitter has locked the account of China\u2019s U.S. embassy for a tweet that defended China\u2019s policy towards Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang, which the U.S. social media platform said violated its stand against \u201cdehumanizing\u201d people.  China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that it was confused by the move and that it was the embassy\u2019s responsibility to call out disinformation and clarify the truth.  The Chinese Embassy account, @ChineseEmbinUS, posted a tweet this month that said that Uighur women had been emancipated and were no longer \u201cbaby-making machines\u201d, citing a study reported by state-backed newspaper China Daily.  The tweet was removed by Twitter and replaced by a label stating that it was no longer available. Although Twitter hides tweets that violate its policies, it requires account owners to manually delete such posts. The Chinese embassy\u2019s account has not posted any new tweets since Jan. 9.  Twitter\u2019s suspension of the embassy\u2019s account came a day after the Trump administration, in its final hours, accused China of committing genocide in Xinjiang, a finding endorsed by the incoming Biden administration.  The Biden administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Twitter\u2019s move.  Twitter is blocked in China but has been embraced by Chinese state media and diplomats, many of whom have taken to the platform to aggressively defend China\u2019s positions in what has come to be known as \u201cWolf Warrior\u201d diplomacy.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action on the Tweet you referenced for violating our policy against dehumanization, where it states: We prohibit the dehumanization of a group of people based on their religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, or ethnicity,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said on Thursday.  The Chinese embassy in Washington, which joined Twitter in June 2019, did not immediately respond to a e-mailed request for comment.  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing on Thursday that it was confused by Twitter\u2019s move.  \u201cThere are numerous reports and information relating to Xinjiang that are against China. It\u2019s a responsibility for our embassy in the U.S. to clarify the truth,\u201d she said.  \u201cWe hope they won\u2019t apply double standards on this issue. We hope they can discern what is correct and truthful from disinformation on this matter.\u201d  China has repeatedly rejected accusations of abuse in Xinjiang, where a U.N. panel has said at least a million Uighurs and other Muslims had been detained in camps.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Last year, a report by German researcher Adrian Zenz published by the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation think tank accused China of using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against minority Muslims. China said the allegations were groundless and false.  This is not the first time Twitter has taken action against China-linked accounts. In June last year, it removed more than 170,000 accounts it said were tied to a Beijing-backed influence operation that deceptively spread messages favourable to the Chinese government.  Twitter\u2019s move also follows the removal of the account of former U.S. president Donald Trump, which had 88 million followers, citing the risk of violence after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol this month.  China meanwhile struck an optimistic tone towards the Biden administration on Thursday, saying \u201ckind angels can triumph over evil forces\u201d.","202":"Feb 28 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp\u2019s founder, Paul Singer, is seeking to remove Twitter Inc Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, CNBC reported on Friday citing a person familiar with the matter.

Bhushan and his lawyers were not immediately available for comment.  In June, Bhushan posted a photograph that he said showed Chief Justice S.A.

Bobde has not commented publicly on the photograph.  In another post on Twitter the same month, Bhushan said that when historians looked at how democracy had been destroyed in India in the past six years, they would note the role of the Supreme Court and the past four top justices.  Twitter blocked both of the posts.  In an 108-page order holding him guilty of criminal contempt earlier in August, the court had said the first post was \u201cpatently false\u201d.  The same order said that the second had the \u201ceffect of destabilizing the very foundation of this important pillar of the Indian democracy\u201d, referring to the judiciary.  The court then asked Bhushan, who has championed public interest litigation, to issue an \u201cunconditional apology\u201d, which he declined to do, leading to the sentence on Monday.","204":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Friday that Twitter Inc was biased against him and accused the social media company of deleting many of his followers and making it harder for users to follow him, without providing evidence.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  It was the latest salvo by Trump against social media and technology companies such as Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google for what he has described as \u201csilencing\u201d conservative views on their services.  \u201cTwitter has removed many people from my account and, more importantly, they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship, now it is a Blimp! Total Bias?\u201d Trump tweeted.  Any reduction is likely the result of Twitter\u2019s recent moves to remove millions of suspicious accounts after it and other social media services were used in misinformation campaigns attempting to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and other elections.  \u201cMany prominent accounts have seen follower counts drop, but the result is higher confidence that the followers they have are real, engaged people,\u201d Twitter spokesman Brandon Borrman said on Friday.  Trump lost 204,000, or 0.4 percent, of his 53.4 million followers in July when Twitter started its purge of suspicious accounts, according to social media data firm Keyhole.  Last week Twitter gave details of some 10 million tweets it had deleted in the belief they were the work of Russian and Iranian government-backed influence operations.  The account purge has benefited Twitter financially, as advertisers will pay more to connect with authentic users than automated accounts.  The company smashed Wall Street\u2019s profit forecasts on Thursday, and said its \u201chealth\u201d initiative to cull fake accounts will allow it to grow revenue faster over a sustained period.  Shares in Twitter posted their biggest one-day gain in a year on Thursday. They rose another 2.7 percent on Friday.  Earlier this week, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale in an opinion piece that tech companies such as Facebook and Google have become incubators of \u201cfar-left liberal ideologies\u201d that are doing \u201ceverything they can to eradicate conservative ideas and their proponents from the internet.\u201d  Parscale served as Trump\u2019s digital director for his successful 2016 White House bid, which made significant use of social media.  Despite his attacks, Trump remains an avid user of Twitter, which has allowed him to communicate directly with people and bypass traditional media outlets.  Trump\u2019s re-election team, however, is planning to circumvent such platforms for his 2020 bid, news website Politico reported this week, citing four officials involved in the campaign.","205":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Facebook Inc FB.O on Tuesday suspended several recently created and mostly right-leaning news accounts posting information about voting in the hotly contested U.S. election for violating their policies.  FILE PHOTO: Electronic cables are silhouetted next to the logo of Twitter in this September 23, 2014 illustration photo in Sarajevo. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  Twitter said the accounts had been suspended for violating its policy against \u201ccoordination\u201d by posting identical content while appearing independent or engaging in other covertly automated behavior.  One of those suspended, SVNewsAlerts, had more than 78,000 Twitter followers, after adding more than 10,000 in the past week.  The account frequently warned of election-related unrest and highlighted issues with voting safety and reliability. It pointed to fraud claims about Democrats and called attention to Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s rallies and speeches.  In fact, few if any major disruptions were reported at polling sites on Tuesday as civil liberties groups and law enforcement were on high alert for any interference with voters.  Other accounts suspended by Twitter included FJNewsReporter, Crisis_Intel and Faytuks. Some of the accounts in the past suggested that readers follow the others.  Facebook also suspended several accounts behind U.S.-based pages called SV News and FJ News, citing inauthentic behavior. The SV page had more than 20,000 followers.  Some of the suspended accounts were closely read by the media in Russia, which has been accused of meddling in the 2016 election. Both SVNewsAlerts and Faytuks, which had only 11,000 followers, have had their tweets highlighted dozens of times in state-controlled Sputnik and RT, as observed by researcher Chris Scott and confirmed by Reuters.  Even as social media companies took action, false or exaggerated reports about voting fraud and delays at the polls circulated throughout the day, in some cases helped along by official Republican accounts and online publications.  The FBI and the New York attorney general also said they were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home, which were reported in multiple battleground states.  Twitter appended fact-checking labels to multiple tweets from the @PhillyGOP account, which was among those using the hashtag #StopTheSteal. The Philadelphia Republican Party did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Twitter labels.  Far-right sites Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit both published articles claiming \u201cthe steal is on\u201d in Pennsylvania that racked up thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter.  #StopTheSteal spiked from a few dozen mentions to more than 2,000 mentions over a 15-minute period in the morning, according to media intelligence firm Zignal Labs.  Zignal said unfounded claims about closed polling stations and excessively long lines in Republican-leaning areas in Pennsylvania, one of the most closely contested states, received more than 33,000 mentions on Twitter.  Alex Stamos, former chief technology officer of Facebook and now director of the Stanford Internet Observatory, told reporters there were coordinated efforts to deliberately blow some problems out of proportion.  \u201cSpecifically in Pennsylvania - to say this example is a demonstration of something nefarious going on, and not just the kind of random mistake that happens all the time,\u201d he said on a call organized by the Election Integrity Partnership.  In one video shared widely among conservative audiences, including by both of Trump\u2019s sons, a Trump poll-watcher was seen being turned away from a site. The video was viewed 2.5 million times on Twitter.  Philadelphia officials investigated and concluded the man had mistakenly been barred under an expired law, which required authorization to enter a specific polling spot. He was then admitted.  Followers of the conspiracy movement QAnon also spread the Pennsylvania reports, according to researchers at misinformation tracking firm Alethea Group.","206":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Twitter Inc. will replace Monsanto in the S&P 500, S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Monday.

The surge in shares reversed a 19 percent fall three months ago when Twitter shocked Wall Street with a similar decline in users. This time, investors welcomed Twitter removing accounts used for disinformation, hate speech and other abuse as the best way to solidify a base of high-quality users who are attractive to advertisers.  \u201cIf they are getting rid of bots, fake accounts and fighting hate speech, then it\u2019s actually good for the health of the platform overall,\u201d said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser. \u201cThat is certainly more appealing to advertisers.\u201d  Twitter\u2019s advertising revenue jumped 29 percent to $650 million in the third quarter from a year earlier, boosted by ad sales on broadcasts from media companies including Live Nation Entertainment, Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer.  That contributed to a similar jump in overall revenue from a year earlier to $758 million, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $702.6 million, according to Refinitiv data.

Last week it disclosed it had removed some 10 million tweets that it thought were the work of Russian and Iranian government-backed influence operations.  Twitter said in a conference call on Thursday that the cleanup effort, which it launched in March and calls a \u201chealth\u201d initiative, will allow it to grow revenue faster than users for a sustained period.  \u201cHealth ultimately is a growth factor for the service, and we do believe that\u2019s important not just for the overall experience, but in terms of making Twitter long-term enduring as well,\u201d Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said during the call.  Neither Dorsey nor Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal clearly answered questions from analysts on a call after the results on how Twitter would ultimately reverse the decline users.  Monthly active users (MAUs) fell to 326 million in the third quarter, below the average analyst forecast of 331.5 million, according to FactSet. Twitter said it expects them to fall below 326 million in the current quarter, missing the average forecast of 333.4 million.  Twitter usage has been stagnant for more than a year, causing some analysts to worry that growth has peaked.  Twitter \u201cdid a superb job of explaining the monthly active user decline, which buys them time, but the stock will come under pressure if MAUs don\u2019t start to grow again in 2019,\u201d said Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities.  AD GAINS  Those concerns have been somewhat offset by increases in advertising sales from video which suggest the company is succeeding in efforts to generate more cash from each user and investors have been looking for solid evidence that it would lead to sustainable growth in revenue and profits.  \u201cTwitter continues to \u2018do a lot with a little.\u2019 User growth is lackluster, but the company is eking out more from current users,\u201d said Jim Cridlin, global head of innovation at WPP\u2019s Mindshare media buying agency.  Distribution deals with U.S. Major League Baseball, video game publisher Activision, Sony Music and Vice are starting to lure advertisers to Twitter\u2019s live premium video, he said.  Twitter said the number of its daily active users rose by 9 percent year-on-year, weaker than an 11 percent jump in the previous quarter and its slowest growth rate in two years. The company does not disclose the total number of daily users.  Twitter shares were up 17 percent at $32.05 in morning trade.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The prohibition will cover advertising of initial coin offerings (ICOs) - crowdfunding used to raise cash by creating new coins - as well as token sales, the San Francisco-based firm told Reuters on Monday.  The new policy, which will be rolled out over the next 30 days, will also ban ads by cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency wallet services, unless they are public companies listed on certain major stock markets.  For Japan, these will be limited to crypto exchanges regulated by its national financial regulator, Twitter said.  The firm had said this month it was taking measures to prevent crypto-related accounts from \"engaging with others in a deceptive manner\", but faced calls to go further after bans from Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google.  Facebook has restricted crypto-related adverts, while Google announced a ban that comes into force in June.  The price of bitcoin, already 4 percent in the red on Monday, fell further after the Twitter announcement. It traded at $7,920 BTC=BTSP on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange at 1740 GMT, down more than 6 percent on the day.  REGULATORS\u2019 WARNINGS  Regulators have stepped up warnings that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are highly speculative and that some could be fraudulent, and that investors should be prepared to lose everything.  But last week the G20 group of rich nations failed to reach a consensus on how to supervise them.  Adverts for virtual coins or ways to trade them have appeared everywhere from London\u2019s transport network to Japanese television as demand for them has soared.  \u201cWith the increasing number of ICOs coming to market, it is an impossible task for anyone, much less platforms like Twitter or Facebook, to keep on top of which ICOs and cryptocurrencies are genuine versus frauds,\u201d said Zennon Kapron, director of the financial consultancy Kapronasia.  \u201cAlthough certainly ICO advertising must have been a significant source of revenue for Twitter, the repercussions of fraudulent activities just weren\u2019t worth the risk.\u201d  Bitcoin has lost more than half its value from a December peak of almost $20,000 as fears of a regulatory clampdown spooked investors. News of the Facebook and Google bans also knocked the price.  Ethereum .MVETH and Ripple's XRP .MVXRP, the second- and third-biggest digital currencies by market capitalization, have tumbled this year too.

The San Francisco-based social media company said on Friday its suspension of Trump\u2019s account, which had 88 million followers, was due to the risk of further violence following the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week.  The move drew criticism from some Republicans for quelling the president\u2019s right to free speech, while European Union Commissioner Thierry Breton said the past week\u2019s events likely heralded a new era of heavier official control.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose relations with Trump have been frosty, criticized Twitter\u2019s ban and warned through a spokesman that legislators, not private companies, should decide on potential curbs to free expression.  The attention drawn to Twitter increased investors\u2019 worries that it could be more exposed to regulation than its bigger rivals Facebook Inc or Google and YouTube-owner Alphabet.  Other social media platforms, including Facebook, have issued similar bans on Trump, but Monday\u2019s fall of as much as 12% in Twitter\u2019s stock was much deeper than for any of its peers.

REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  The solid beat, aided by ad product improvements, convinced investors to overlook a dull forecast for user growth, which Twitter expect to slow down to low double digits this year as a boost from the pandemic fizzles.  Total revenue came in at a record $1.29 billion, an increase of 28% year over year. Shares of the company were up nearly 3% in extended trading, adding to a 11% gain in stock so far this year.  The social media company said expenses would rise 25% or more in 2021 but projected that total revenue would grow faster than costs.  The social media company has been in the spotlight amid global debates over what is allowed on the site - from its recent refusal to comply with an Indian government directive to block accounts linked to the farmers\u2019 protest to its ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump following the Capitol riot in January.  On an earnings call with analysts, CEO Jack Dorsey downplayed any impact from the much-debated January account closures.  \u201cWe are a platform that is obviously much larger than any one topic or any one account. 80% of our audience is outside the United States,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Investors are looking past Twitter\u2019s miss on user growth because of other positives during the quarter, including higher ad revenue, profitability and revenue guidance that was better than expected, said Hari Srinivasan, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman.  In the fourth quarter, Twitter said it had 192 million average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) - its term for the number of daily users who can view ads. That\u2019s up 26% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 196.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Twitter said that user growth rates may decrease to \u201clow double digits\u201d beginning in the second quarter.  Twitter said user growth had been driven by product improvements and more global conversation from events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. election. Some temporary changes to reduce misinformation around the U.S. election had a small negative impact on global user growth, it said.  Ad revenue was $1.15 billion, up 31% from the same period a year ago and beating analyst estimates.  The company is building tools that help advertisers increase product sales and finely target ads to interested users, which will help Twitter earn more money from advertisers.  Twitter acquired newsletter startup Revue last month. It also recently launched disappearing tweets called \u201cfleets\u201d and said it had in late Q4 released a beta test of \u201cSpaces,\u201d its audio-chat room feature which has similarities with voice-based app Clubhouse.  Dorsey told analysts on a conference call that the company was working on subscriptions but did not expect meaningful revenue until next year.  Net income rose to $222.1 million, or 27 cents per share, from $118.8 million, or 15 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding items, Twitter earned 38 cents per share, beating estimates of 31 cents.  Twitter\u2019s costs and expenses were $1.04 billion for the quarter, an increase of 21% year over year. It said it expected costs and expenses to rise partly due to plans to grow headcount by more than 20% particularly in engineering, product, design and research.  Twitter said it expected total revenue in the current quarter to be between $940 million and $1.04 billion.  It said it expected \u201cmodest impact\u201d from the rollout of Apple Inc\u2019s planned privacy changes to the iOS system.","218":"SAN FRANCISCO, July 23 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc missed Wall Street\u2019s lowered expectations for quarterly revenue on Thursday despite surging usage, as the coronavirus-spurred economic slowdown battered the company\u2019s largely events-oriented digital ads business.  Ad sales, which make up 82% of Twitter\u2019s revenue, sank 23% to $562 million, which the company attributed to brand spending pauses tied to the pandemic and U.S. civil unrest. Analysts had expected $585 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Even as current events prompted advertisers to pull back, people continued to flock to Twitter to discuss them. The company clocked its highest-ever yearly growth of daily users who can view ads, increasing 34% to 186 million, above analysts\u2019 target of 176 million.  Twitter has struggled to build out its ad offerings, leaving it reliant on a suite of promotional tools geared toward advertising around big events and product launches, which have all but vanished during the pandemic.  The company said it finished rebuilding its ad management technology in the second quarter, which would support faster development of new formats going forward, and was rolling out measurement tools for \u201cdirect response\u201d ads used by app developers.  Total revenue came in at $683 million, down 19% year-over-year, helped by steadier sales growth from the licensing of users\u2019 posts to researchers and marketers.  Twitter reported a second-quarter loss of $1.2 billion, largely driven by the reversal of a tax benefit established last year, when the company transferred intellectual property to Ireland. Because of the second quarter\u2019s steep coronavirus-related losses, Twitter did not make enough money to take advantage of the tax benefit.  Adjusted to exclude the tax considerations, the company incurred a loss of $127 million, or 16 cents per share, roughly in line with analyst expectations of a $125 million loss. It had an adjusted profit last year of $37 million.  Echoing earlier guidance, Twitter said it expects data licensing revenue to \u201cmoderate\u201d for the rest of the year.  It also said it was exploring \u201csubscriptions and other approaches to complement our advertising business,\u201d although it was not expecting any revenue to result this year.  Costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million, below the increase in the low teens that Twitter had forecast. The company said it anticipated expense growth of 10% or more in the third quarter.  Social media rival Snap Inc missed user growth estimates earlier this week, as its usage bump from coronavirus lockdowns petered out sooner than expected, but it beat targets for revenue gains.

Twitter-savvy and educated at Georgetown University in Washington, Kono has seen his popularity surge even as the government of his boss, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, has been battered by criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Two recent opinion polls have favoured Kono, who is also the minister for administrative reform, to be the next prime minister. As Japan launches its much awaited COVID-19 vaccination campaign, his role as the logistics head of the programme has thrust him even more firmly into the spotlight.  Part of Kono\u2019s attraction, in a nation known for wooden, script-following leaders, is his ability to engage directly with voters through social media, a sharp contrast to Suga, who has been criticised for seeming stiff and aloof from voters.  In recent weeks, Kono, 58, has used Twitter to publish videos on vaccine safety, repost memes and address media reports. He frequently responds directly to followers - 2.2 million on his Japanese account and 50,000 for his English one.  Last week he posted about conferences with governors over the coronavirus, and a black mask embroidered with a dinosaur skull he had worn the previous day.  But for all his appeal to voters and a resume that includes foreign and defence minister, some in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which he would lead as premier, are wary.  \u201cHe speaks English, he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s got a media presence, and he uses social media, so that\u2019s kind of appealing,\u201d said Scott Seaman, Asia director at the Eurasia Group in Washington. \u201cBut he would still have to run the LDP. And that\u2019s a skill.\u201d  Given the LDP\u2019s majority in parliament, its leader is virtually guaranteed the premiership. Only two LDP presidents have failed to be premier during brief spells when the party was out of power - including Kono\u2019s father, Yohei.  Some say his father\u2019s being denied the top job may have helped feed the son\u2019s ambition for the post.  Kono declined a direct answer on Tuesday about whether he could work with the party if he became premier, with his current job a possible step towards that end.  \u201cMy job is the health of the Japanese people, let\u2019s not politicise this job,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s too important to politicise.\u201d  Some in the LDP feel he is too young, given the average age since 2000 for premiers to take office is roughly 62. But their concerns also include his lone-wolf character in a land that runs on consensus, as well as an outspoken streak and occasional divergence from the standard line.  Last month Kono told Reuters that \u201canything is possible\u201d regarding the Tokyo Olympics, breaking with government vows that the Games, already postponed once, will open as planned in July.  Last year, as defence minister, he suddenly cancelled deployment of the U.S.-made Aegis Ashore missile defence system without consulting others beforehand, a move that an LDP official said may have angered key ally the United States.  \u201cI wonder if he can build a good relationship with the U.S. as a result,\u201d said the official, who asked not to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.  The faction-ridden LDP could prove difficult to run. Its tolerance of mavericks such as the wildly popular Junichiro Koizumi, premier from 2001 to 2006, has diminished in recent years, said political commentator Atsuo Ito.  \u201cHis bluntness will likely go over well with voters, but I\u2019m not sure how well it\u2019d work running a big organisation,\u201d added Ito.  Kono\u2019s popularity, though, may prove hard for the LDP to resist and was likely part of Suga\u2019s calculus in putting him in charge of the vaccine rollout, to gain some support himself, political analysts said, although they wondered if Suga was also trying to neutralise a political rival.  With a general election looming by October and the LDP chief\u2019s term expiring in September, putting Kono in the top job could bring big benefits for LDP candidates. But pitfalls remain, including Japan\u2019s rollout of the coronavirus vaccine.  \u201cThis is a gamble,\u201d the LDP official said. \u201cIf the vaccine doesn\u2019t go as planned, it\u2019s the end for both Suga and Kono.\u201d (Reporting by Elaine Lies; Additional reporting by Yoshifumi Takemoto; Editing by William Mallard)","220":"(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has amassed a stake in Twitter Inc TWTR.N and is pushing for changes, including removal of the social media company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, two people familiar with the matter said on Friday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Twitter is one of the few U.S. technology companies headed, but not controlled, by one of its founders. It has given shareholders equal voting rights, making Dorsey, who owns only about 2% of the company, vulnerable to a challenge from an activist investor such as Elliott.  Twitter shares fell last year when the company disclosed that its platform experienced glitches that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners. The San Francisco-based company\u2019s reluctance to expand beyond its core platform has also left it with limited scale compared to its larger social media peers.  Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, will be seeking to install its own nominees to Twitter\u2019s eight-member board when three of the company\u2019s directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, the sources said.  It is not clear who Elliott would like Dorsey replaced with and how big its stake in Twitter is. The New York-based hedge fund has more than $40 billion in assets under management, and has targeted companies in recent months ranging from eBay Inc EBAY.O to SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Elliott declined to comment. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg News first reported on Friday on Elliott\u2019s position in Twitter.  Dorsey, 43, is one of Silicon Valley's most prominent entrepreneurs, and also runs Square Inc SQ.N, a mobile payments company he co-founded.  While investors have tolerated this arrangement since 2015, when Dorsey became Twitter\u2019s CEO for the second time, his announcement in November that he would like to move to Africa for up to six months raised questions among analysts about his management.  Dorsey, who helped conceive Twitter in 2006, first served as CEO until 2008, when he was replaced by one of his co-founders Ev Williams. Williams had accused Dorsey of being a poor manager and not focusing enough on Twitter\u2019s profitability.  Dorsey returned as interim CEO after his predecessor Dick Costolo stepped down. Dorsey\u2019s knowledge of the company and quick launch of new products convinced Twitter\u2019s board to hand him the reins on a permanent basis a few months later.  Dorsey is not the first CEO to run two major companies. Steve Jobs led Apple Inc AAPL.O and animated movie studio Pixar for several years, while Elon Musk runs electric car pioneer Tesla Motors Inc TSLA.O and rocket maker SpaceX.","221":"SAN FRANCISCO, July 26 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc posted a better-than-expected second-quarter revenue on Friday and an uptick in daily users who see advertisements on the site, driven by changes to show users more relevant content.  However, the company forecast third-quarter revenue below many Wall Street estimates and said revenue growth would lag the first two quarters, partly due to ending some older ad formats.  Twitter\u2019s revenue and number of users have been in focus since the social media platform started deleting millions of spam or fake accounts promoting hate speech or spreading political misinformation, contributing to declines in monthly users through 2018.  The company reported a rise in monthly active users in the first quarter, fueling speculation that Twitter was returning to growth, but has since stopped disclosing its MAU count.  Instead, this quarter it reported monetizable daily active usage (mDAU), a metric it created to measure only users exposed on a daily basis to advertising on the site and exclude those who access Twitter via aggregating sites like TweetDeck.  Its monetizable daily active usage (mDAU) hit 139 million, beating analyst expectations of 135 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said machine learning improvements to deliver more relevant content helped drive up this count.  Twitter reported second-quarter profit of $1.1 billion, or $1.43 per share, compared with $100 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Profit was boosted by an income tax benefit of over $1 billion related to corporate restructuring.  Twitter\u2019s revenue rose 18% from a year earlier to $841 million, beating Wall Street expectations of $829 million, based on Refinitiv data.  Total advertising revenue rose to $727 million, an increase of 21% year-on-year, as the company continued to improve its ad platform and formats.  It forecast total revenue for the third quarter to be between $815 million and $875 million. Analysts on average were expecting about $869.3 million.  Twitter has continued to bulk up its live and on-demand video content partnerships. On Thursday, NBCUniversal said they would team up to livestream parts of the 2022 Olympic Games, Twitter\u2019s latest move in a series of deals aimed at boosting sports conversation on the platform.  It also expanded its multimedia features, launching a Snapchat-style camera feature in the Twitter app and releasing its own long-awaited tool for clipping and publishing video.  Last week, the company rolled out its redesigned site and in March launched \u201ctwttr,\u201d a prototype app where certain users can test out new features as part of its efforts to make conversations easier to find and follow.  Twitter also recently updated its policies on hateful conduct directed at religious groups and last month introduced a new policy to de-emphasize and label rule-breaking tweets from important sources like politicians, though this has not yet been used.  Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 21% to $766 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees.

Earlier on Tuesday, Trump suggested Twitter was biased against him without providing evidence. He wrote on Twitter that the company does not \u201ctreat me well as a Republican. Very discriminatory.\u201d  Twitter did not immediately return messages seeking comment. (Reporting by David Shepardson)","223":"July 16 (Reuters) - The hack of Twitter on Wednesday that compromised the accounts of prominent people including U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden, reality TV star Kim Kardashian and former U.S. President Barack Obama was one of the most dramatic of the social media era.  But it was hardly the first.  Following is a list of some of the most prominent attacks and security breaches to have impacted social media firms.  Twitter: The company said Wednesday\u2019s hack came after employees with access to its internal systems were compromised by hackers who then \u201cused this access to take control of many highly-visible (including verified) accounts and Tweet on their behalf.\u201d The company\u2019s employees have been targeted before. The U.S government said in November 2019 it had charged two former Twitter employees with spying for Saudi Arabia by accessing information on dissidents who use the platform.  According to the complaint, Twitter - which removed tens of thousands of accounts for inauthentic behaviour linked to Saudi Arabia in December - learned of the unauthorized access in late 2015.  Twitter has faced security breaches and targeted attacks on prominent Twitter users throughout its 14-year history. The account of the company\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, was hacked in August 2019, allowing an unauthorized person to send public tweets including racial slurs and curse words.  Other Twitter accounts hacked include those of the Associated Press and the Guardian in 2013, as well as celebrities such as Taylor Swift in 2015 and Donald Trump in 2013.  A 2013 hack gave attackers access to around 250,000 Twitter users\u2019 email addresses, usernames, and encrypted versions of their passwords.  In 2010, the firm agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over charges it put its customers privacy at risk by failing to safeguard their personal information.  An investigation by the U.S government in 2009-2010 found that serious lapses in Twitter\u2019s security allowed hackers to send out phoney tweets from 45 prominent accounts, including from the accounts of media outlet Fox News and then U.S president Barack Obama.  Facebook: In September 2018, Facebook said hackers had exploited software flaws to access 50 million users\u2019 accounts.  The company scaled back the size to weeks later, saying 30 million users had their access tokens stolen, while 29 million had personal information such as gender, religion, email addresses, phone numbers and search histories taken.  Facebook previously stated in 2018 that profile details from 87 million users were improperly accessed by political data firm Cambridge Analytica, resulting in a $5 billion fine by the U.S Federal Trade Commission in 2019 on charges of failing to protect its data from third parties.  The firm has also suffered narrower breaches. In 2013, Facebook disclosed a software flaw that exposed 6 million users\u2019 phone numbers and email addresses to unauthorized viewers for a year, while a technical glitch in 2008 revealed confidential birth-dates on 80 million Facebook users\u2019 profiles.  WhatsApp: The Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp said in May 2019 it had uncovered a security breach that allowed attackers to inject spyware on phones via the app\u2019s phone call function. The messaging app said the breach had signs of coming from a government using surveillance technology developed by a private company and may have targeted human rights groups.  Telegram: In 2016, Iranian hackers compromised more than a dozen accounts on the Telegram instant messaging service and identified the phone numbers of 15 million Iranian users, the largest known breach of the encrypted communications system, cyber researchers told Reuters.  LinkedIn: The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform suffered a security breach in 2012, after hackers posted the passwords of millions of its users online.  Tumblr: The blogging platform was hacked in 2013, with researchers estimating that the emails and passwords of 65 million Tumblr users were posted online.","224":"FILE PHOTO: The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 28, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Twitter Inc, which was recently targeted in a hacking campaign that compromised the accounts of prominent political figures and celebrities, said on Thursday it was implementing more security measures for certain election-related accounts in the United States.  Accounts belonging to the U.S. executive branch, Congress, presidential campaigns and political parties are among those which Twitter said in a blog post it would require to take security measures \u201cgiven the unique sensitivities of the election period.\u201d  The accounts will be required to use a strong password, Twitter will enable by default a setting that helps prevent unauthorized password changes and the users will be strongly encouraged to enable two-factor authentication.  In July, hackers were able to access Twitter\u2019s internal systems and seize control of accounts, including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and former U.S. President Barack Obama, and solicit digital currency. Twitter has said its employees were duped into sharing account credentials.  Lawmakers have expressed concerns over what would happen if a similar breach occurred a day before the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3.  After the hack, the White House said it had been in constant contact with Twitter to ensure the security of President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account, which was not jeopardized in the hack.  Other types of accounts for which Twitter is requiring or recommending these security measures include those belonging to members of the U.S. Congress, U.S. governors and secretaries of state, political candidates that have Twitter\u2019s \u201cElection Labels\u201d and some major U.S. news outlets and political journalists.  Twitter said that in the coming weeks it would put in place other internal security safeguards for the accounts, including better detections to help the company and account holders respond quickly to suspicious activity and increased login defenses to prevent malicious account takeover attempts.","225":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N on Thursday permanently banned U.S. conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his website Infowars from its platform and Periscope, saying in a tweet that the accounts had violated its behavior policies.  \u201cAs we continue to increase transparency around our rules and enforcement actions, we wanted to be open about this action, given the broad interest in this case,\u201d the company tweeted. \u201cWe do not typically comment on enforcement actions we take against individual accounts for their privacy.\u201d  In a video posted on the Infowars website on Thursday Jones said, \u201cI was taken down not because we lied but because we tell the truth and because we were popular.\u201d  The ban came weeks after Apple AAPL.O, Alphabet's GOOGL.O YouTube, and Facebook FB.O took down podcasts and channels from Jones, citing community standards.  Jones, whose conspiracy theories include that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre was a hoax, hosts the syndicated radio program \u201cThe Alex Jones Show.\u201d  Last month, Jones lost a bid to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought against him by the parents of a boy who was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting.  On Wednesday, Jones attended a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on ways to counteract foreign efforts to influence U.S. elections and political discourse. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey testified at the hearing.  Twitter said on Thursday that it would evaluate any reports regarding other accounts potentially associated with Jones and Infowars.  Last month, Twitter banned Jones and Infowars for seven days, citing tweets that it said violated the company\u2019s rules against abusive behavior, which state that a user may not engage in targeted harassment of someone or incite other people to do so.","226":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Thursday took down hundreds of Instagram accounts that were hacked and sold for their high-value usernames, including the accounts of people behind this activity.  FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of the Instagram logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  A Facebook spokeswoman said the people engaged in this rule-breaking practice were well-known figures in a community known as the OGUsers, who trade desirable usernames for popular websites from Twitter Inc to Netflix for money and clout.  The usernames, which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars, are often short words prized for their scarcity, like @food or letters like @B. Social media companies including Facebook-owned Instagram have rules against the sale of accounts.  The people accused of participating in a major Twitter hack last year, when a slew of VIP accounts were hijacked, also had ties to this practice and the online OGUsers forum.  It was the first time Facebook had shared its enforcement actions about this activity, though it said it had been removing accounts for this practice on an ongoing basis.  Twitter Inc and the short-video app TikTok also said they had recently taken action against OGUsers for breaking their rules.  An administrator of the OGUsers site did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have previously said the site bans trading accounts acquired through hacking.  The Facebook spokeswoman said phishing and SIM swapping - where hackers gain access to a phone to get into the accounts associated with it - were popular ways of stealing Instagram usernames. But she said Facebook had also seen a rise in methods like harassment, extortion, sextortion and \u2018swatting\u2019 - falsely reporting an emergency requiring a police response to an address.  Facebook, which said it was working with law enforcement, said many people involved in this practice were minors. It said it had sent cease and desist letters to about a dozen people behind the hacking and selling of about 400 accounts.  The disabled accounts included those of swappers, who move the usernames to fresh Instagram accounts and middlemen, who oversee transactions between the username buyers and sellers and take a cut of the money, usually in bitcoin.  Twitter also permanently suspended a number of accounts from the OGUsers network under its rules against platform manipulation and spam, a spokesman said, adding its investigation was done in tandem with Facebook. A TikTok spokeswoman said it had recently reclaimed a number of usernames that OGUsers had registered with the aim of selling them for a profit.","227":"FILE PHOTO: The Twitter logo is seen outside the company headquarters in San Francisco, California, U.S., January 11, 2021. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Twitter Inc has thought about whether to hold bitcoin on its balance sheet, but has not made any changes yet, the social media platform\u2019s chief financial officer, Ned Segal, told CNBC on Wednesday.  In an interview with CNBC, Segal said Twitter had considered how it might pay vendors or employees using bitcoin, should they ask to transact using the virtual currency.  \u201cWe might consider whether we would be transferring dollars to bitcoin at the time of the transaction or if we wanted bitcoin on our balance sheet ready to complete that transaction,\u201d Segal said.  Segal\u2019s comments come a couple of days after billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla Inc revealed the automaker had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the cryptocurrency shooting higher.  On General Motors Co\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, Chief Executive Mary Barra, responding to a question about accepting bitcoin as payment for vehicles, said, \u201cThis is something we\u2019ll monitor and we\u2019ll evaluate. If there\u2019s strong customer demand for it in the future, there\u2019s nothing that precludes us from doing that.\u201d  But unlike Musk, Barra said \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans to invest in bitcoin. Full stop there.\u201d  Shares of Twitter were up 11% on Tuesday after the company beat Wall Street targets for quarterly sales and profit and followed its social media peers to forecast a strong start to 2021 as ad spending rebounds from rock bottom.  Twitter top boss Jack Dorsey, who is also the chief executive of payments firm Square Inc, is a known bitcoin enthusiast and has said he believes the internet will have its own native currency.  Square in October said it had purchased about 4,709 bitcoins at an aggregate purchase price of $50 million.","228":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said on Thursday he is reconsidering a proposed stint in Africa this year due to coronavirus concerns, walking back his plans amid a call by activist investor Elliott Management for his ouster.  FILE PHOTO: Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and fin-tech firm Square, sits for a portrait during an interview with Reuters in London, Britain, June 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  \u201cWith everything happening in the world, particularly with coronavirus, I have to reconsider what\u2019s going on and what that means for me and for our company,\u201d Dorsey said, speaking at a Morgan Stanley investor conference in San Francisco.  Dorsey tweeted in November, as he was wrapping up a shorter trip through Africa, that he was planning to move to the continent for three to six months in mid-2020.  The tweet raised concerns among investors over how Dorsey would continue to run San Francisco-based Twitter and mobile payments company Square SQ.N, which he also leads, from afar. This week, activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp moved to remove Dorsey from his position at Twitter after acquiring a $1 billion stake in the company.  Twitter gives shareholders equal voting rights, and Dorsey, a co-founder of the company, owns only about 2% of the company.  New York-based Elliott will be seeking to install its own nominees to Twitter\u2019s eight-member board when three of the company\u2019s directors stand for election at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, sources told Reuters.  Dorsey said Thursday that he had made a mistake in failing to explain his reasons for wanting to spend time in Africa. He said Africa\u2019s growing population and his belief in the benefits of a \u201cdistributed model\u201d of work across time zones made the move desirable.  \u201cMy intention is not to go over and just hang out or take a sabbatical, but actually everything I\u2019m doing in San Francisco, doing on another continent,\u201d Dorsey said.  Dorsey also said he has a \u201cgood sense of what is critical\u201d in both Twitter and Square and \u201cenough flexibility\u201d in his schedule to focus on the most important priorities at each.  Twitter\u2019s shares were down 2.8% at $35.00 in afternoon trading, amid a deep selloff on Wall Street.  Twitter and other tech companies have said they were encouraging employees to work from home, citing risks related to the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.  PART-TIME CEO  Sources familiar with Elliott\u2019s thinking said the hedge fund was targeting Dorsey because he was part time, not because he was a bad CEO.  Investors told Reuters that Elliott, which was founded by billionaire Paul Singer and has targeted companies ranging from eBay Inc EBAY.O to SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, is vocalizing what others are thinking. Some said they were unsurprised at Elliott's involvement, noting that Twitter's disappointing earnings have prompted several investors to trim positions or exit completely.  Last year, Twitter shares tumbled 20% when the company missed revenue projections, after suffering from glitches that hindered its ability to target advertising. Twitter shareholder Scott Galloway, who sold his shares in the company after writing an open letter to its board calling for Dorsey\u2019s removal in December, told Reuters earlier this week that he had invested again on the news of Elliott\u2019s actions.  He said that multiple large shareholders had reached out to him in \u201cviolent agreement\u201d with Elliott\u2019s actions. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need an activist to tell you that a part-time CEO must go,\u201d said Kenneth Squire, who runs 13D Monitor and the 13D Activist Fund. Big index funds run by Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street have stood by too long in permitting Dorsey to work two big jobs, he added. But others are sticking with the company, arguing that the U.S. election and planned Olympics in Japan will drive users to the site and bolster its ad business.  Cambiar Global Equity & Ultra Focus Funds wrote recently that it \u201cremains constructive\u201d on Twitter, noting the company \u201cgenerates strong free cashflow and has significantly improved its operating and financial performance\u201d since 2017.  Several Twitter employees also tweeted their support for Dorsey using the hashtag #WeBackJack. Lara Cohen, Twitter\u2019s head of partnerships, urged followers not to underestimate \u201chow much people at a company show up for a strong leader.\u201d","229":"(Reuters) - -With less than three weeks to go until the U.S. election, and amid record early and mail-in voting, President Donald Trump heads to Iowa as he tries to make up for lost time on the campaign trail after being sidelined with coronavirus.

Twitter permanently cut off Trump\u2019s personal account and access to his nearly 90 million followers late on Friday, citing the risk of further incitement of violence, three days after Trump exhorted thousands of supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress met to certify his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden.  The resulting chaos, viewed with shock around the world, left a police officer and four others dead in its wake.  Trump\u2019s frequent use of Twitter was a key part of his campaign as he overhauled the Republican Party and beat Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the presidency in 2016. Since then he has used it to fire up his political base, attacking those who opposed him.  Twitter has long resisted pressure to suspend Trump\u2019s account. But after a \u201cclose review\u201d of the president\u2019s recent tweets, the company said on Friday evening it \u201chad permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\u201d  Trump later used the official @POTUS government to lash out at Twitter, addressing the 75 million \u201cgreat patriots\u201d who voted for him: \u201cWe will not be SILENCED!\u201d Trump said he was considering building his own social media platform.  Twitter quickly deleted those posts and soon after suspended the Trump campaign account.  The suspension came a day after a subdued Trump denounced Wednesday\u2019s violence in a video in which he also vowed to ensure a smooth transition of power.  CALLS TO RESIGN  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday that if Trump did not resign, she had instructed the House Rules Committee to move ahead with a motion for impeachment and legislation on the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 25th Amendment, which provides for removal of a president who is unable to discharge his official duties.  A copy of draft articles of impeachment circulating among members of Congress charged Trump with \u201cinciting violence against the government of the United States\u201d in a bid to overturn his loss to Biden.  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell sent a memo to Republican senators detailing a possible timetable for an impeachment trial. He noted the Senate will hold its next work session on Jan. 19 and needs the consent of all 100 senators to convene sooner - meaning a trial would not begin until Trump was out of office, a source familiar with the document said.  \u201cImpeaching President Donald Trump with 12 days remaining in his presidency would only serve to further divide the country,\u201d said White House spokesman Judd Deere.  A Reuters\/Ipsos poll conducted Thursday and Friday found 57%of Americans want Trump to be removed immediately from office following the violence.  Trump\u2019s role in encouraging Wednesday\u2019s chaos has opened a growing rift within the Republican Party.  Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a frequent Trump critic, told CBS News he would \u201cdefinitely consider\u201d impeachment because the president \u201cdisregarded his oath of office.\u201d  Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said Friday Trump should resign immediately and if the party cannot separate itself from him, she is not certain she has a future with it.  \u201cI want him out. He has caused enough damage,\u201d the Alaska senator told the Anchorage Daily News.  It is unclear whether lawmakers would be able to remove Trump from office, as any impeachment would prompt a trial in the Senate, where his fellow Republicans still hold power and two-thirds of the 100 members must vote to convict for his removal.  The House impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden, but the Senate acquitted him in February 2020.  For the 25th Amendment to be invoked, Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of Trump\u2019s Cabinet would need to declare Trump is unable to perform the duties of the presidency. Pence is opposed to the idea of using the amendment, an adviser said.

The black-and-white photo showed the fire-blasted launch site at a space center in northern Iran including a damaged gantry service tower and a downed mobile erector launcher.  Trump, in his tweet, cited the specific location of the site, saying the United States was not involved in the \u201ccatastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the Safir SLV Launch at Semnan Launch Site One in Iran.\u201d  Speaking to reporters at the White House later on Friday, Trump defended his posting of the photo and reiterated that the United States had nothing to do with the incident.  \u201cWe had a photo. I released it, which I have the absolute right to do,\u201d Trump said.  He said the Iranians \u201cwere going to set off a big missile and it didn\u2019t work out too well. Had nothing to do with us.\u201d  The rocket exploded on its launch pad on Thursday, an Iranian official said. A U.S. official also said Iran suffered a satellite launch failure.  \u201cI wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One,\u201d Trump said in his tweet.  Patrick Eddington, a former CIA satellite imagery analyst, said the photograph tweeted by Trump appeared to be a classified image taken by a U.S. spy satellite.  \u201cIf the president simply tweeted out an image from classified briefing that utilizes our most advanced overhead collection capabilities, it is no doubt welcome news to our adversaries,\u201d said Eddington, now a research fellow at the CATO Institute.  \u201cWhile he has the authority to declassify any federal document, Twitter is not a legitimate or responsible way to do so.\u201d  A U.S. defense official told CNBC that the picture, which appeared to be a snapshot of a physical copy of the satellite image, was included in an intelligence briefing on Friday.  The Pentagon did not have any immediate comment.

The organizations' letter to the firms cited a recent Reuters report documenting how cigarette maker Philip Morris International Inc has used young personalities on Instagram to sell a new \"heated tobacco\" product called IQOS.  The groups said social media firms are not doing enough to regulate \u201cinfluencers\u201d on their platforms who are hired by companies to promote nicotine products.  No law specifically prevents online tobacco or e-cigarette marketing, but social media firms have policies limiting it. The health groups said in their letter that the use of online personalities creates a \u201cloophole\u201d in those policies and allows \u201crampant marketing\u201d of tobacco and other nicotine products to youth.  Instagram and its parent company, Facebook, are studying the issue \u201cto understand how we can improve,\u201d said spokeswoman Stephanie Otway.  The platforms currently ban brand advertising of tobacco products, Otway said. Their policies require any sponsored \u201cinfluencer\u201d posts that explicitly recommended buying tobacco products be restricted only to people over 18.  But the same restriction would not apply to posts by paid influencers that depict tobacco products favorably without explicitly saying that people should buy them, Otway said.  In making policy for a billion users, the company has to draw lines between advertising, promotional posts and \u201csomeone having an opinion,\u201d Otway said.  A man pictured with the IQOS \"heated tobacco\" device, made by Philip Morris International, on an Instagram account named @iqos.iran.ir in a post May 17, 2019. @iqos.iran.ir\/Social Media  Twitter spokeswoman Elizabeth Luke said the company prohibits \u201cthe promotion of tobacco products, accessories and brands worldwide\u201d but declined to comment on whether that includes influencers paid to feature tobacco products on their accounts.  A Reuters review of Twitter policies shows that its tobacco promotion ban does not include such marketing posts by individuals.  Reuters identified several Twitter posts over the last two years from influencers who posted photographs with IQOS devices or linked back to Instagram accounts promoting the product. Twitter did not comment on the posts identified by Reuters.  Snap Inc did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters earlier this month documented how Philip Morris had used young social media influencers, including a 21-year-old woman in Russia, to promote its IQOS device. The company\u2019s internal marketing standards prohibit it from using youth-oriented celebrities or \u201cmodels who are or appear to be under the age of 25.\u201d  Philip Morris said May 10 that it launched an internal investigation and suspended all \u201cproduct-related digital influencer actions globally\u201d after Reuters sought the company\u2019s comment on examples of Instagram posts and photographs depicting young, hip women advertising IQOS.  Young women are pictured with the IQOS \"heated tobacco\" device, made by Philip Morris International, at an IQOS-sponsored VIP lounge at an April\u00camusic festival\u00cain Colombia on an Instagram account since removed from the photographer's account. @repocamera\/Social Media via REUTERS  PHILIP MORRIS SUSPENDS MARKETING, THEN DEFENDS IT  All of the posts referenced in the Reuters report remained online as of Tuesday evening. In addition, Reuters has identified new examples of Instagram content featuring young people with the IQOS posted in the days since Philip Morris said it had suspended its influencer campaigns.  Several posts under the Instagram account @iqos_egypt over the past week have featured young men and women using the device at bars or cocktail events. Other posts from accounts using the IQOS name in Poland, Armenia, Italy and Iran over the last week also showed young, trendy men and women using the devices.  Other posts emerged over the last week from a photographer who documented an IQOS-sponsored VIP lounge at an April music festival in Colombia.  A representative for an IQOS store in Sarno, Italy, said employees found the recent photos of women using IQOS elsewhere online and reposted them on the store\u2019s Instagram account. A representative of an IQOS-branded Instagram account in Armenia denied being paid by Philip Morris to promote the product.  Other Instagram account owners promoting IQOS did not respond to requests for comment. None of the influencers mentioned in the May 10 Reuters report responded to requests for comment on whether they had been asked to stop posting or remove posts marketing Philip Morris products.  Philip Morris spokesman Ryan Sparrow said the firm had \u201cdirected that there should be no new posts\u201d by influencers. Sparrow did not respond to questions about whether the company had stopped paying influencers or attempted to remove existing posts.  Sparrow said some of the new posts \u201cseem to originate from third parties, not PMI, and in countries where we do not sell IQOS,\u201d noting Eqypt and Iran.  Sparrow defended the suspended marketing campaign as a vital way to inform adult cigarette smokers about safer options. He blasted the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids for \u201ctrying to pressure us ... to effectively block these channels\u201d and \u201cin effect perpetuating the consumption of tobacco in its most harmful form: combustible cigarettes.\u201d  Caroline Renzulli, a spokeswoman for the anti-tobacco campaign, called it \u201claughable\u201d that Philip Morris used social media to market to adults.  Philip Morris International has licensed Altria Group Inc to market the IQOS device in the United States beginning this summer.  Altria, which sells Marlboro cigarettes in the United States, has previously said it has a policy of not advertising on social media. However, an online job posting from the company in March seeks a \u201cdigital marketing specialist\u201d for the \u201cIQOS brand team.\u201d The ideal candidate will develop marketing strategy for \u201ce-commerce, owned websites, social media and influencers.\u201d  Altria spokesman David Sutton said the company has no plans to use social media influencers to market IQOS but did not respond to questions about the job posting mentioning an influencer strategy.  Elicena Andrada, a model from Spain whose biography lists she was crowned Miss America Latino Del Mundo in 2017, holds an IQOS \"heated tobacco\" device, made by Philip Morris International in an Instagram post on an account called @iqos_friends, in a post from May 12, 2019. @iqos_friends\/Social Media via REUTERS  REGULATORY GRAY AREA  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last month decided to allow U.S. sales of the IQOS device after a two-year review process in which Philip Morris repeatedly assured the regulator that it would warn young people away from the product.  Digital advertising of tobacco products remains a gray area for regulators globally. Tobacco advertising regulations in the United States and elsewhere were written before the rise of social media marketing.  The FDA, however, can exert authority over the digital marketing of new devices it clears for sale. As a condition of allowing Philip Morris to sell the IQOS device, the agency requires the company to provide detailed analyses of the age ranges of consumers it reaches with online marketing.  Philip Morris, through Altria, is also required to submit information on any new U.S. advertising campaigns to the FDA at least 30 days before it plans to launch them.  A global treaty governing tobacco regulations, under the umbrella of the World Health Organization, urges countries worldwide to entirely ban tobacco advertising. A 2018 WHO report about tobacco promotion in entertainment and social media channels acknowledged the challenges of regulating it.  The ability to share posts, it found, has \u201chas blurred the lines between consumer and brand owner.\u201d","236":"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N on Thursday released data for the first time on the effectiveness of measures introduced to combat U.S. election misinformation, including labels it applied to President Donald Trump and others.  3D printed ballot boxes are seen in front of a displayed Twitter logo in this illustration taken November 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Tweets from Trump that shared false claims about voter fraud and challenged the election outcome to his 88 million followers have been shared tens of thousands of times on the platform.  WARNINGS AND LABELS  In a blog post, Twitter said it labeled about 300,000 tweets across the site with disputed or potentially misleading content under its \u2018civic integrity\u2019 rules between Oct. 27 and Nov. 11. It said these represented 0.2% of all US election-related tweets sent during that period.  Twitter said 456 of these tweets were also hidden by a warning message and had their engagement limited, meaning users could not retweet, reply to or like the tweets. A Twitter spokeswoman said this week it had stopped using these more restrictive election-related warning labels.  The company said approximately 74% of the people who viewed labeled tweets saw them after the company applied a label or warning message.  FRICTION  Twitter also prompted users to \u2018quote tweet\u2019 content rather than just retweet it, to try and slow the spread of sharing.  The company said it had data showing the change did slow the spread of misleading information.  In the blog post, Twitter said it was taking more time to study the effect but that the measure would be kept in place \u201cfor now.\u201d  RECOMMENDATIONS  The company stopped providing \u201cliked by\u201d and \u201cfollowed by\u201d tweet recommendations from accounts that users did not follow in their home timelines and notifications - but the change did not provide the desired results.  Twitter said it did not see a statistically significant difference in misinformation prevalence from the change and so would be reverting back to normal.  It said that eventually it planned to replace these recommendations with more tailor-made ones, for instance, based on topics that users follow.  CONTEXT IN \u201cFOR YOU\u201d TRENDS  Twitter said that it had seen results from only showing trends in the \u201cFor You\u201d section that its team had added context, it would not be keeping this requirement.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Twitter has locked horns with New Delhi this month over the order to remove more than 1,100 accounts and posts which the government says are spreading misinformation about farmer protests against new agricultural laws.  The dispute escalated on Wednesday when Twitter said it did not fully comply with some requests as it believed they were not in line with Indian law.  Koo said downloads had surged 10-fold in the past two days to over 3 million. Meanwhile #kooapp was the top Twitter trend in India on Wednesday with nearly 21,000 posts, followed by #BanTwitter.  WHAT IS KOO?  Koo is a Twitter-like micro-blogging platform which allows users to post multimedia content, including audio clips. A text post is restricted to 400 characters and the service supports six Indian languages, including English.  Like Twitter, Koo\u2019s logo is a bird, though yellow in colour. It allows users to use hashtags (#) or the \u201c@\u201d symbol for mentions. The app also allows users to \u2018re-koo\u2019, Koo\u2019s version of a retweet and chat instead of a direct message.  HOW DID IT START?  Koo was founded by Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka, both MBA, or business management, graduates. The duo are also the founders of Vokal, an audio-video knowledge-sharing platform similar to Quora.  The app was launched in March 2020, and won an government award for driving tech innovation. It raised more than $4 million in funding last week from new and existing investors including venture capital firms Accel and 3one4 Capital.  WHO IS ON KOO  For years, Twitter has been a major public communication tool for the Indian government. But several ministries and high-profile figures, including Bollywood actors, have also gradually begun using Koo in recent months. The technology ministry and trade minister Piyush Goyal joined this month.  Koo is however still dwarfed by Twitter, which had 17.5 million users in India as of last month, its third highest user base after the United States and Japan, according to German database firm Statista.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is yet to join Koo, spoke about the app last year in his monthly radio address. \u201cIt\u2019s called Koo,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this, we can place our opinion and interact in our mother tongue through text, video or audio.\u201d  WHAT ITS FOUNDERS SAY  The sudden increase in Koo\u2019s popularity can be compared in some respects to the surge in the use of digital payments apps in India following a ban on high-value currency notes in late 2016, Koo\u2019s co-founder Bidawatka told Reuters.  \u201cYou could say this is something similar, because a certain event happened and lot of people want to move here...

But it\u2019s pretty obvious this demand exists because the Federal Reserve, merely by saying it could buy corporate debt, has basically put a floor under the market. For as long as the central bank remains as good as its word, frontrunning the Fed should continue to be a very crowded trade. (By Anna Szymanski)  IN IT TO WIN IT? AstraZeneca has struck a deal with Oxford University researchers to produce and distribute the latter\u2019s potential Covid-19 vaccine. The treatment, developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, is already being tested in England. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot reckons the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker could produce 100 million doses by year end.  Flu vaccines alone bring in at least $4 billion a year, and demand for a Covid-19 version will be much higher. It could also require a new dosage every two years, Bernstein reckons. Still, it\u2019s not clear if AstraZeneca will have exclusive production and distribution rights. Many other players, including GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, are working on rival products. And even if the Oxford vaccine works, the 107 billion pound group will only be pricing to cover its costs for as long as the pandemic rages.  AstraZeneca shares rose as much as 5% in early afternoon trading. That looks excessive. But the fact that a large drug group sees value in a Covid-19 treatment is encouraging in itself. (By Neil Unmack)  JUDGEMENT OF SOLOMON. Goldman Sachs investors have delivered a warning to its board. Only 71% of them supported the company\u2019s executive pay package, which included a $27.5 million target payout for Chief Executive David Solomon, according to a preliminary tally from Thursday\u2019s annual meeting.  Goldman has had bigger say-on-pay thwacks, as have peers. In 2016 its pay proposals garnered just 66% support. While Bank of America has polled above 90% since the financial crisis, Citigroup lost its non-binding vote as recently as 2012. JPMorgan, whose boss Jamie Dimon is the best paid of all, got just 72% support last year, leading it to tweak its incentives.  Goldman is investing in initiatives like its Apple credit card, so it\u2019s too early to judge Solomon\u2019s progress. But it\u2019s not a great coda to his first full year on the job. On the bright side, it\u2019s a chance to show that he, and the board, are listening. (By John Foley)  BIGGER FLOCKS. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey has solved, at least for now, one of Twitter\u2019s problems. The social network is making good on growing its community. It still has a lot of work to do with sales.  Twitter on Thursday reported a whopping 24% year-over-year rise in what it calls monetizable daily active users for the first quarter to 166 million \u2013 its best rate on record. Given that Twitter is effectively a bit like a news organization, that is not too surprising. Large market newspapers in the United States saw a 6% bump in digital subscriptions just from Feb. 24 through March 23, according to Mather Economics, as the coronavirus took hold in the West.  Revenue rose only 3%, though, a challenge for Twitter even before Covid-19 snapped shut wallets. It\u2019s an opportunity, too, though: Dorsey, fresh from a fight with activist investor Elliott Management, needs to focus on the \u201cm\u201d in mDAU. (By Jennifer Saba)  SLICK MOVE. Royal Dutch Shell, has cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two. Chief Executive Ben van Beurden faced the music on an investor call, talking about the short-term jolt to the oil sector from Covid-19 and the longer-term transition to greener energy. \u201cWho knows actually where the viability of our assets will go,\u201d he wondered at one point.  Big U.S. oil companies haven\u2019t been as quick to accept the decline of fossil fuels, and they probably won\u2019t be as quick to save cash by cutting dividends either. Exxon Mobil paid out $15 billion last year. Chevron put up $9 billion. Both might do well to hold back, but both carry the burden of being so-called dividend aristocrats that have increased payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. They shouldn\u2019t wait for the kind of crunch that finally led Occidental Petroleum to slash its own regular dividend last month. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)  TOO MUCH CAPITAL? Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s first-quarter earnings report, unveiled on Thursday by Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, was a tale of two numbers: a 1.4 billion pound impairment charge for bad debt, and a bumper 14.2% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The loan-loss figure was higher than expected, but much lower as a proportion of loans than peer Barclays. The capital ratio, meanwhile, represented a 45-basis point jump from the level at the end of 2019.  That\u2019s arguably reassuring, since bank investors have been fretting about dilutive equity hikes. It\u2019s also a risk, however: supervisors like the Bank of England have made it clear that lenders should be burning through their equity capital to help virus-hit firms and households. Banks who exit the crisis with their buffers overflowing, ready to pay shareholders a chunky dividend, could have a rough ride in the court of public opinion. (By Liam Proud)  PUBLIC GLIMPSE. SoftBank Group is plumbing new depths with a second grim forecast. The value of investments made by Masayoshi Son outside of the Vision Fund are cratering. These are now expected to deliver losses of over 1 trillion yen, about $9.4 billion, up from a barely three-week-old forecast for a loss of 800 billion yen. Most trouble once again stems from The We Company. It means an even-bigger-than-expected annual loss on SoftBank\u2019s bottom line \u2013 the first red in 15 years.  The Japanese company offers a unique public window into private startup valuations \u2013 accountants are clearly breathing down Son\u2019s neck to mark its investments to some semblance of market. Still, operating performance is divorced from other reality thanks to buybacks. SoftBank stock is up 11% since the first warning in April, outperforming gains in other investments like Alibaba. There\u2019s some fight left in the Unicorn wrangler. (By Una Galani)  HEALTHY FLU. Reckitt Benckiser is benefitting from an exceptionally heavy virus season. The maker of Mucinex and Strepsils posted a 33% increase in over-the-counter medicines in the first quarter. Throw in demand for other health products and the frantic stockpiling of things like Dettol disinfectant, and given free \u2013 if unwelcome \u2013 advertising by the American president last week, and overall sales grew 13% to 3.5 billion pounds in the quarter, excluding currency moves.  Empty shelves mean it\u2019s not a perfect score for Chief Executive Laxman Narasimhan, who set out his strategy to overhaul the business in February. And it\u2019s unclear how much of the sales bump is stockpiling versus sustained higher demand. But Narasimhan may have found a cure for the supply chain glitches which have plagued Reckitt in the past. The higher costs he warned of are a small price to pay for protecting market share.

(Reuters) - Twitter Inc TWTR.N on Thursday reported higher first-quarter revenue and a smaller loss than analysts had expected amid the coronavirus pandemic, but its shares fell as investors fretted about potential weakness in the second quarter.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed logo for Twitter is seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The San Francisco-based social media company said daily users who can view ads also grew 24% to 166 million, about 2 million above estimates, as people looked to Twitter for information related to the virus.  Twitter also said its ads sales had slightly rebounded in Asia after a plunge due to the coronavirus outbreak and it accelerated work on tools to attract advertisers, becoming the latest tech company to report a lighter blow from the pandemic than forecast.  The company did not provide specific guidance on the second quarter but on a conference call with analysts, Twitter\u2019s chief financial officer Ned Segal pointed to a March 11 to March 31 time frame, when ad revenue declined approximately 27% year-over-year, as a sign of what the company has seen in April.  In comparison, Facebook Inc FB.O on Wednesday said that ad revenue was roughly flat in the first three weeks of April compared with last year, a tentative early sign of recovery following a steep decrease in March revenue.  Twitter shares, which initially rose 11% after the earning report, were down 4.8%.  The company said its March decline was particularly pronounced in the United States, its largest market by revenue.  The novel coronavirus halted travel, retail and entertainment in much of the world by March, leading to sudden budgets cuts at many advertisers and generating concerns about the prospects of ad sellers.  About 84% of Twitter\u2019s revenue comes from ads on its service and partner apps, and those sales were 27% lower in the last three weeks of March than the same period in 2019, the company said on Thursday. But sales bounced back in Asia during late March as lockdowns lifted there, Twitter said, without providing specific figures.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWe\u2019re not likely to see the full effects of the coronavirus on Twitter\u2019s revenues until Q2, but due to rapidly changing conditions, the severity of the impact is hard to predict,\u201d said eMarketer senior analyst Jasmine Enberg.  Twitter said it hoped to release tools earlier than planned this year to attract business from mobile games and other app makers. Those companies are trying to gain market share among consumers stuck at home and are continuing to buy what the ad industry calls \u201cdirect response\u201d ads.  Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O on Wednesday also said it expected revenue from direct response ads sold by its YouTube unit to return to normal faster than from other ad types.  Twitter also warned of smaller increases in non-advertising revenue.  SLASHING COSTS  Twitter\u2019s first-quarter revenue was $808 million, up 3% compared with a year earlier, above the average estimate of $776 million among analysts tracked by Refinitiv.  The company said that sales growth from licensing users\u2019 posts to researchers and marketers, which was 17% in the first quarter, is expected to \u201cmoderate\u201d the rest of the year.  Twitter lost $8 million in the first quarter, or a penny per share, better than the average estimate of two cents per share.  Twitter is aiming to stem losses by slashing its own budgets, including by limiting hiring to product development, research and user support. Expense growth in 2020 is likely to be in \u201cthe low teens,\u201d versus earlier plans to spend 20% more than last year, Twitter said.  Focusing its product teams on advertiser tools could pose challenges for Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. He pledged in February to launch new features for users this year at a faster pace to stoke growth.  The growth goal was part of an agreement allowing Dorsey to remain CEO as a revamped board of directors evaluates Twitter's leadership structure and CEO succession plan. Elliott had expressed concern about Dorsey, who is also CEO of financial tech company Square Inc SQ.N, taking on too much.","243":"Oct 9 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Friday it will remove tweets calling for people to interfere with the U.S. election process or implementation of election results, including through violence, as the company also announced more labels and restrictions to slow the spread of misinformation.  Twitter said in a blog post that, from next week, users will get a prompt pointing them to credible information before they can retweet content that has been labeled as misleading.  It said it would add more warnings and restrictions on tweets with misleading information labels from U.S. political figures like candidates and campaigns, as well as U.S.-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers or that get \u201csignificant engagement.\u201d  Twitter, which recently told Reuters that it was testing how to make its labeling more obvious and direct, said people will have to tap through warnings to see these tweets.

Twitter says it has labeled thousands of misleading posts, though most attention has been on the labels applied to tweets by President Trump.  Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the November vote.  Reuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud. On Thursday, Facebook Inc said it would ban calls for poll watching using \u201cmilitarized language.\u201d  Twitter also announced temporary steps to slow people\u2019s amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the U.S. election week, global users pressing \u2018retweet\u2019 will be directed first to the \u201cquote tweet\u201d button to encourage people to add their own commentary.

Twitter recorded most of its revenue growth in the United States, a major market where the company will face scrutiny this year over how it tackles misinformation ahead of the presidential election in November.  The company has continued efforts to boost sign-ups through measures such as allowing people to follow topics, and by trying to clean up abusive content. Late last year, it launched a feature for users to hide certain replies on their tweets.  Twitter has also focused on relevant content and notifications, which has boosted average monetisable daily active users (mDAU), or users who see ads when logged in through twitter.com or Twitter applications.  That metric rose to 152 million in the fourth quarter through Dec. 31 from 126 million a year earlier, beating the average analyst expectation of 147.5 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Shares were up 14% at $38.03 in early trading.  Quarterly revenue here grew 11% from a year earlier to $1.01 billion, also beating the expectation of $996.7 million. Total advertising revenue was $885 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year.  The company, however, forecast first-quarter revenue between $825 million and $885 million, largely below the Wall Street estimate of $872.6 million.  Rolling out new features at a faster pace is one of Twitter\u2019s top priorities for the year, Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey said during an earnings call with analysts.

Twitter also posted fourth-quarter net income lower than expectations, at $119 million, or 15 cents per share, down from $255 million a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 25 cents a share, below the expectation of 29 cents.  Twitter\u2019s total U.S. revenue rose 17% to $591 million, compared with a 3% uptick in international revenue.  In November, Twitter banned political ads amid growing pressure on social media companies to stop accepting commercials containing misleading or false information.  But this week\u2019s Iowa caucuses showed the platform was still being used to spread false allegations of voter fraud.  On Tuesday, Twitter said it would apply \u201cfalse\u201d warning labels to tweets containing synthetic or deceptively edited forms of media and remove such media if it is likely to cause harm.  Quarterly total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 22% year-over-year to $854 million, partly due to a planned increase in headcount.  Twitter said its total costs and expenses would increase 20% this year as it also plans to build a new data server, which executives said would help the company test new products and release them faster.  \u201cTheir guidance for an increase in operating expense means they won\u2019t grow profits as fast as they have in the past,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, adding he believes investors are currently more interested in the company\u2019s user growth.

Twitter said it cooperated with the review and was increasing security for its teams and platform. The company has acknowledged that some employees were duped into sharing account credentials prior to the hack.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the report demonstrated a \u201cregulatory gap\u201d and pledged the state would take the lead in introducing measures to protect users.  Cuomo had ordered a probe following the July 15 hack of celebrity Twitter accounts, in an alleged scam that stole more than $118,000 in Bitcoin.  Those whose accounts were hacked included U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden; former President Barack Obama; billionaires Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Elon Musk; singer Kanye West, and his wife Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star.  Lacewell said hackers obtained log-in credentials after calling several employees, pretending to work in Twitter\u2019s information technology department, and claiming to be responding to problems with the company\u2019s Virtual Private Network, which had become common because employees were working from home.  \u201cThe extraordinary access the hackers obtained with this simple technique underscores Twitter\u2019s cybersecurity vulnerability and the potential for devastating consequences,\u201d the report said.  Twitter\u2019s lack at the time of a chief information security officer also made the San Francisco-based company more vulnerable, the report said.  Florida prosecutors said Graham Ivan Clark was the mastermind behind the hack, and charged the 17-year-old Tampa resident as an adult with 30 felonies.  Clark has pleaded not guilty.

Trump posted the message after anti-racism protesters on Monday declared a \u201cBlack House Autonomous Zone\u201d - referencing a Seattle area taken over by activists known as the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) or Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone - in front of St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church near the White House.  Police cleared the White House area on Tuesday and blocked access to the site, where law enforcement had used violence to disperse protesters earlier this month.  Twitter said it hid Trump\u2019s tweet behind its \u201cpublic interest\u201d notice because it included a threat of harm against an identifiable group. The label restricts distribution of tweets by public officials which violate Twitter\u2019s rules, while leaving them online to allow for scrutiny.  A Twitter spokeswoman said teams within the company\u2019s safety division informed Chief Executive Jack Dorsey of the decision before applying the notice.  Facebook, which has taken a more hands-off approach to speech by political leaders, left the same post untouched.  At least 150,000 people had liked Trump\u2019s tweet and 33,000 retweeted it before Twitter restricted engagement, according to the most recent image captured by the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine.

After the company last month started applying labels to his messages, Trump announced plans to scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies in order to regulate social media platforms more aggressively.  Twitter\u2019s first public interest notice against Trump also involved a threat of force against protesters, who have been demonstrating against racial injustice since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody.  Trump had used the phrase \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d to threaten deadly force against protesters in Minneapolis, where Floyd died.

FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives at Manhattan federal court for a hearing on his fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York City, U.S., April 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan extended the deadline by one week to April 25, in response to a Thursday court filing where both sides requested the extension and said \u201cdiscussions are ongoing.\u201d  Nathan had been asked to hold Musk in contempt over a Feb. 19 tweet that the SEC said violated an earlier settlement with the agency.  If Musk and the agency fail to resolve the dispute, the judge said she would rule on the contempt request.  The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla\u2019s share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk\u2019s privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place.  Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company\u2019s lawyers pre-approve written communications with material information about the company, including tweets.  In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla\u2019s production that had not been vetted by the company\u2019s attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt.  Musk\u2019s lawyers have argued that the tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.  At an April 4 hearing, a lawyer for the SEC said that if Musk were found in contempt, the agency would ask the judge to require him to submit regular reports about his Twitter use, and to pay a series of progressively higher fines for any future violations.  Nathan declined to rule on the contempt motion at the hearing, instead ordering Musk and Tesla to meet and try to resolve the dispute on their own.  Musk is worth $20.7 billion, according to Forbes magazine. He has been chief executive of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.  The Palo Alto, California-based company built its reputation on luxury cars, but has faced several production challenges with its Model 3 sedan, which it hopes will reach a mass audience.  The Feb. 19 tweet that prompted the SEC\u2019s contempt motion said: \u201cTesla made 0 cars in 2011, but will make around 500k in 2019,\u201d meaning 500,000 vehicles.  Four hours later, Musk corrected himself, saying annualized production would be \u201cprobably around\u201d 500,000 by year end, with full-year deliveries totaling about 400,000.  The SEC said the earlier tweet conflicted with Tesla\u2019s Jan. 30 outlook, when it targeted annualized Model 3 production exceeding 500,000 as soon as the fourth quarter, and projected 360,000 to 400,000 vehicle deliveries this year.  Musk\u2019s lawyers have argued that the first tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.  Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201d  In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d","251":"FILE PHOTO: Facebook, Google and Twitter logos are seen in this combination photo from Reuters files.

In addition to discussions on reforming the law called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects internet companies from liability over content posted by users, the hearing will bring up issues about consumer privacy and media consolidation.  Republican President Donald Trump has made holding tech companies accountable for allegedly stifling conservative voices a theme of his administration. As a result, calls for a reform of Section 230 have been intensifying ahead of the Nov. 3 elections, but there is little chance of approval by Congress this year.  Last week Trump met with nine Republican state attorneys general to discuss the fate of Section 230 after the Justice Department unveiled a legislative proposal aimed at reforming the law.

Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said the company\u2019s ad platform encountered bugs, or glitches, that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners.  \u201cThese issues were in our control and we will work to do better,\u201d said Segal on a call with analysts.  Twitter\u2019s revenue rose 9% from a year earlier, but fell short of Wall Street expectations as total advertising revenue missed estimates.  Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up abusive content and make the platform more user-friendly appear to have driven up use, addressing longstanding concerns about growth of customers, and Twitter has also rolled out new video ad products that attract brands.  The ad problems were, however, a major, unexpected issue and come as the holiday buying season, the most important for ads, gets underway. Twitter cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to below Wall Street estimates.  Twitter said that it was working on a total fix for the ad problems but that it was not yet in place. Analysts tracking Twitter said the company\u2019s financials would take at least a few more quarters to stabilize, with a quick turnaround looking increasingly unlikely.  \u201cNot expecting a quick rebound in Twitter\u2019s financials for at least a few quarters, as shortfall likely will carry into 2020,\u201d said analyst Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.  On the conference call with analysts, Segal said Twitter had turned off some ad settings, which limited how the company could target ads to people or show advertisers how effective their ads were. It acted after finding two bugs that inadvertently shared certain data even if users opted out of sharing it.  FILE PHOTO: A 3D-printed logo for Twitter is seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  \u201cSo we stopped doing that and although we\u2019re working on remediation, there isn\u2019t remediation yet in place and so the effects of that will continue into Q4,\u201d said Segal.  Twitter expects revenue in the fourth-quarter, which will include Black Friday and the December holidays, to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.  The social media platform did manage to record a rise in daily users who see ads on the site, beating analyst estimates.  Twitter has stopped disclosing its monthly active users figures, instead reporting monetizable daily active usage (mDAU), a metric it created to measure users exposed on a daily basis to advertising through the site or Twitter applications that are able to show ads.  Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said growth in mDAU was driven by product improvements, including making the site easier to navigate and more proactively identifying abusive content to remove.  The company\u2019s average mDAU hit 145 million, beating analyst expectations of 141 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This alternative metric was up 17% year-over-year.  In July, Twitter launched a more personalized desktop Twitter.com as part of a plan to make the platform better for conversations. It has also experimented with the ability to follow topics and has recently expanded testing for a feature to hide replies.  Recently, the company made a six-second video bidding available for global advertisers and it has continued to expand its live and on-demand video partnerships, including deals with NBC Olympics and Eurosport for coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Games.  Third-quarter net income was $37 million, or $0.05 per share. In the same period last year, the firm reported net income of $789 million, or $106 million when adjusted to exclude certain items.  Analysts had expected net income of $161.5 million.  Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 17% year-over-year to $780 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees.

Group backers said they were organizing peaceful protests, had been working hard to police the comments and that Facebook had given no warning. Chris Barron, a spokesman for the group, said political opponents were also organizing protests but were not banned.  \u201cIf Facebook wants to become the arbiter of truth then they\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d Barron said.

For months, Trump and Republican allies have been laying the groundwork to cast doubt on the integrity of the vote in case the president lost his re-election bid.  As tallies increasingly improve the odds for Trump\u2019s Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, and as U.S. broadcasters and other major media outlets brush off Trump\u2019s claims of victory, the president and his supporters have taken to social media to try to turn the narrative around, floating conspiratorial theories using the hashtag #StopTheSteal. [nL1N2HQ0XY]  But social media companies have been signaling less patience with disinformation and calls for violence. Eleven of the president\u2019s 32 tweets since Election Day on Tuesday have been placed behind a warning label saying they were disputed, prompting him to use email and other media to voice his claims, researchers said.  \u201cSocial media platforms can\u2019t allow themselves to be used to foment anti-democratic and potentially violent activity,\u201d said Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.  BANNON SUSPENDED  On Thursday, Snap Inc\u2019s Snapchat removed a video from Trump\u2019s account in which Biden said he has an extensive \u201cvoter fraud organization.\u201d Biden\u2019s statement came during an interview in which he was discussing his team fighting voter suppression efforts, and Snap determined that Trump\u2019s use out of context violated its policy against undermining the integrity of civic processes.  Trump campaign social media manager Ryann McEnany decried Snap\u2019s action in a tweet, saying in capital letters: \u201cWhy won\u2019t they let the American people see this!?\u201d  Twitter on Thursday suspended an account used by former Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon after he recorded a video in which he called for beheading FBI Director Christopher Wray as well as government infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci for being disloyal to Trump.  A Twitter spokesman cited company policy against glorifying violence. Other services also removed the video on similar grounds.  But the takedowns and warnings are something Trump supporters appear prepared for. Before Facebook deleted \u201cStop the Steal,\u201d organizers directed members to an email sign-up page \u201cin the event that social media censors this group.\u201d  The group\u2019s membership surged because seven prominent conservatives promoted it to their hundreds of thousands of followers, according to Renee DiResta, a researcher involved in the anti-misinformation Election Integrity Partnership.  While Facebook groups typically work as forums for shared interests, they can harbor hyper-partisan misinformation.  \u201cFacebook has been enabling and amplifying the infrastructure that\u2019s now being used to attack our democratic process,\u201d said Arisha Hatch, executive director of the Color of Change political action committee, one of the country\u2019s largest online racial justice groups.  A review of a small number of comments posted to \u201cStop the Steal\u201d before its deletion found no direct calls for violence, but its organizing premise - that Republican votes are being \u201cnullified\u201d by Democrats - has no basis in fact.

The report by New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services also recommended that the largest social media companies be deemed systemically important, like some banks following the 2008 financial crisis, with a dedicated regulator monitoring their ability to combat cyberattacks and election interference.  \u201cThat Twitter was vulnerable to an unsophisticated attack shows that self-regulation is not the answer,\u201d said Linda Lacewell, the financial services superintendent.  Twitter has acknowledged that some employees were duped into sharing account credentials prior to the hack.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered a probe following the July 15 hack of celebrity Twitter accounts, in an alleged scam that stole more than $118,000 in Bitcoin.  Those whose accounts were hacked included U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden; former President Barack Obama; billionaires Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Elon Musk; singer Kanye West, and his wife Kim Kardashian, the reality TV star.  Lacewell said hackers obtained log-in credentials after calling several employees, pretending to work in Twitter\u2019s information technology department, and claiming to be responding to problems with the company\u2019s Virtual Private Network, which had become common because employees were working from home.  \u201cThe extraordinary access the hackers obtained with this simple technique underscores Twitter\u2019s cybersecurity vulnerability and the potential for devastating consequences,\u201d the report said.  Twitter\u2019s lack at the time of a chief information security officer also made the San Francisco-based company more vulnerable, the report said.  Florida prosecutors said Graham Ivan Clark was the mastermind behind the hack, and charged the 17-year-old Tampa resident as an adult with 30 felonies.  Clark has pleaded not guilty. Federal prosecutors charged two others with aiding the hack.

Investors\u2019 concerns over the weak forecast overshadowed strong fourth-quarter results for the social media company that included a 24 percent jump in total revenue, helped by growth in its video advertising business.  Monthly active users totaled 321 million in the fourth quarter, in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts but down from 330 million a year earlier and 326 million in the third quarter.  Starting in the current quarter, Twitter said it would stop disclosing the number of monthly active users, a statistic internet companies have routinely reported over the past decade. Instead, the company will provide monetizable daily active users, or the number of people who log in and are exposed to ads on Twitter on a daily basis.  \u201cWe want to align our external shareholders around one metric that reflects our goal of delivering value to people on Twitter every day and monetizing that usage,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal.  Twitter said it expected total revenue of between $715 million and $775 million for the first quarter of 2019. The midpoint of that range was below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $765 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Operating expenses were expected to surge about 20 percent year-on-year in 2019 due to efforts to improve the health of its platform, exceeding analysts\u2019 average estimate of 12 percent.  Those higher costs could eat into Twitter\u2019s future earnings, some analysts said.  \u201cYes, total user numbers are down, but we\u2019ve known for a while now that Twitter has a fake-users problem and is trying to deal with it, so that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone,\u201d said Clement Thibault, analyst at global financial platform Investing.com.  \u201cHigher operating expenses, on the other hand, are a bigger problem, as I anticipate Twitter\u2019s margins and profits to shrink considerably in 2019.\u201d  Increased spending is a common theme across social media companies, including Facebook and Google, as they double down on efforts to clean up their respective platforms, Summit Insights analyst Jonathan Kees said.  \u201cAs Twitter would describe it, pursuing \u2018health\u2019 issues are good for their advertiser base as they feel better to advertise there,\u201d Kees said.  Twitter also expects capital expenditure of between $550 million and $600 million in 2019, well above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $415 million.  Overall revenue in the fourth quarter rose to $909 million, handily beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $868.2 million.  Total advertising revenue surged 23 percent to $791 million in the quarter, with more than half of that figure coming from video ads placed by corporate clients.  Revenue from data licensing and other non-advertising businesses rose 35 percent from a year earlier to $117 million.  Excluding some items, Twitter reported quarterly profit of 31 cents a share, beating the average estimate of 25 cents.  The number of average monetizable daily active users rose to 126 million in the fourth quarter from 115 million a year ago and 124 million in the previous quarter.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The changes, which will take effect on Jan. 1, 2020, will comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).  The California law requires large businesses to give consumers more transparency and control over their personal information, such as allowing them to request that their data be deleted and to opt out of having their data sold to third parties.  Social media companies including Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google have come under scrutiny on data privacy issues, fueled by Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal in which personal data were harvested from millions of users without their consent.  Twitter also announced on Monday that it is moving the accounts of users outside of the United States and European Union which were previously contracted by Twitter International Company in Dublin, Ireland, to the San Francisco-based Twitter Inc.  The company said this move would allow it the flexibility to test different settings and controls with these users, such as additional opt-in or opt-out privacy preferences, that would likely be restricted by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe\u2019s landmark digital privacy law.  \u201cWe want to be able to experiment without immediately running afoul of the GDPR provisions,\u201d Twitter\u2019s data protection officer Damien Kieran told Reuters in a phone interview.  \u201cThe goal is to learn from those experiments and then to provide those same experiences to people all around the world,\u201d he said.  The company, which said it has upped its communications about data and security-related disclosures over the last two years, emphasized in a Monday blog post that it was working to upgrade systems and build privacy into new products.  In October, Twitter announced it had found that phone numbers and email addresses used for two-factor authentication may inadvertently have been used for advertising purposes.  Twitter\u2019s new privacy site, dubbed the \u2018Twitter Privacy Center\u2019 is part of the company\u2019s efforts to showcase its work on data protection and will also give users another route to access and download their data.  Twitter joins other internet companies who have recently staked out their positions ahead of CCPA coming into effect. Last month, Microsoft Corp said it would honor the law throughout the United States and Google told clients that it would let sites and apps using its advertising tools block personalized ads as part of its efforts to comply with CCPA.","264":"FILE PHOTO: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey addresses students during a town hall at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in New Delhi, India, November 12, 2018.

Kordestani will stay on as a director, serving on the 11-member board alongside three new directors.  The move comes three months after Elliott Management, the $40 billion hedge fund, had sought to oust CEO Jack Dorsey, pushed for improved corporate governance and wanted to see a higher share price. The two sides reached an agreement in early March that let Dorsey stay, for now, and handed board seats to Elliott among others.  Investors have been increasingly pushing for outsiders to preside over boards.  Pichette is expected to bring greater scrutiny of management and a stronger focus on financial matters to the company.

Demonstrators targeted Carlson\u2019s home in Washington with a protest and shouted threats, he told the Washington Post.  Fox News and Twitter declined to comment.  Facebook FB.O and other social media networks are facing calls for increased regulation and criticism of their handling of user data and the role their platforms have played in a divisive U.S. political climate in recent years.  Still, analysts viewed Thursday\u2019s stock drop as an over-reaction.  \u201cI think the people who want to be alarmist will say this is the first step toward losing the conservatives, and that this could snowball.

Last month, Twitter posted quarterly results that far exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates even after it purged millions of fake accounts used for disinformation and other abuses.  Conservatives in the past have complained about having their accounts unfairly closed by Twitter, and about alleged political bias in the California company\u2019s rules.  Twitter this week reinstated the account of conservative commentator Jesse Kelly after U.S. Senator-elect Josh Hawley said that Congress should investigate the company after it closed Kelly\u2019s account, and the account of Canadian feminist Megan Murphy.

Investors\u2019 concerns over the weak forecast overshadowed strong fourth-quarter results for the social media company that included a 24 percent jump in total revenue, helped by growth in its video advertising business.  Monthly active users on the social media platform fell to its lowest in two years and for a third consecutive quarter. Twitter said it would no longer disclose monthly active users, a statistic internet companies have routinely reported over the past decade, and would, instead, provide the number of monetizable daily active users.  Twitter has been emphasizing improving the health of the platform, which includes the removal of thousands of spam and suspicious accounts and allocating resources to comply with new privacy regulations in Europe.  Operating expenses are expected to surge about 20 percent year-on-year in 2019, the company said, due to efforts to improve the health of its platform, exceeding analysts\u2019 average estimate of 12 percent.  Some analysts said it was time for Twitter to show the results of efforts to safeguard its platform.  \u201cThe street is just about done giving them a break about it,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.  \u201cTwitter needs to now show results, that they can keep those people (bots and suspicious accounts) off the platform and that their enhanced security is working.\u201d  Twitter also expects capital expenditure of between $550 million and $600 million in 2019, well above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $415 million.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Shares were down more than 10 percent at $30.56 in midday trading.  Expected total revenue for the first quarter of 2019 is between $715 million and $775 million for the first quarter of 2019. The midpoint of that range was below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $765 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  NEW METRIC  Monthly active users totaled 321 million in the fourth quarter, in line with analysts\u2019 forecasts but down from 330 million a year earlier and 326 million in the third quarter.  But the number of monetizable daily active users - those able to be exposed to ads on a daily basis - rose to 126 million in the fourth quarter from 115 million a year ago and 124 million in the previous quarter.  While directly comparing the number of daily active users with those of Twitter\u2019s peers may be difficult as there is no industry standard on how social media platforms measure the metric, Snap Inc reported earlier this week that it had 186 million daily active users in the fourth quarter. Facebook had more than more than a billion in the same period.  \u201cTwitter\u2019s pivot to mDAUs (monetizable daily active users)helps ad buyers better understand the potential reach for their advertising,\u201d said Aaron Goldman, chief marketing officer at 4C Insights.  \u201cAs a platform for breaking news and live moments, many users are logging in on a daily basis, and Twitter is acknowledging this pattern by sharing metrics with ad buyers that will allow them to see the bigger picture as it relates to users who are reachable by ads.\u201d  Total advertising revenue surged 23 percent to $791 million in the fourth quarter, with more than half coming from video ads by corporate clients.  Overall revenue in the fourth quarter rose to $909 million, handily beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $868.2 million.  Revenue from data licensing and other non-advertising businesses rose 35 percent from a year earlier to $117 million.

A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment.  BlackBerry was an early provider of messaging services, including through BlackBerry Messenger, and was known for its mobile email devices.  But the Waterloo, Ontario-based company lost traction as consumers shifted to Apple\u2019s iPhone, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy and other Android-based smartphones.  BlackBerry filed its complaint with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.  The lawsuit resembles patent infringement cases that BlackBerry filed there last March and April against Facebook Inc and Snap Inc.  Last August, U.S. District Judge George Wu allowed BlackBerry to pursue most of its infringement claims in those lawsuits, which according to court records remain pending.  Wu may be assigned the case against San Francisco-based Twitter because federal courts often assign cases deemed \u201crelated\u201d to a single judge. The Facebook and Snap lawsuits were deemed related.  Since exiting smartphones in 2016, BlackBerry has shifted its focus to software to manage mobile devices and other areas including self-driving cars.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  It is far from certain that Twitter would be able to outbid Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and complete such a transformative deal in the 45 days that U.S. President Donald Trump has given ByteDance to agree to a sale, the sources said on Saturday.  The news of Twitter and TikTok being in preliminary talks and Microsoft still being seen as the front-runner in bidding for the app\u2019s U.S. operations was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  Twitter has a market capitalization of close to $30 billion, almost as much as the valuation of TikTok\u2019s assets to be divested, and would need to raise additional capital to fund the deal, according to the sources.  \u201cTwitter will have a hard time putting together enough financing to acquire even the U.S. operations of TikTok.

Twitter\u2019s own shareholders might prefer that management focus on its existing business\u201d, he added.  One of Twitter\u2019s shareholders, private equity firm Silver Lake, is interested in helping fund a potential deal, one of the sources added.  Twitter has also privately made a case that its bid would face less regulatory scrutiny than Microsoft\u2019s, and will not face any pressure from China given that it is not active in that country, the sources said.  TikTok, ByteDance and Twitter declined to comment.  TikTok has come under fire from U.S. lawmakers over national security concerns surrounding data collection.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo\/File Photo  Twitter said in a blog post it was updating its rules to recognize the changes in how people will vote in the Nov. 3 election and try to protect against voter suppression and misleading content on its platform.  The widespread use of mail ballots in the U.S. election due to the coronavirus pandemic will likely cause significant delays in tallying results, which some experts fear could allow misinformation to gain traction.  U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that voting by mail is susceptible to large-scale fraud.  Twitter also said it would label or remove misinformation creating confusion about the laws, regulations and officials involved in civic processes, as well as disputed claims that could undermine faith in the process, such as unverified information about vote tallying or election rigging.  A Twitter spokesman said whether content had specific falsehoods or could cause greater harm would determine if it would be removed, or labeled and have its reach reduced.  Social media companies have long been under pressure to combat misinformation after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia used their platforms to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, allegations Moscow has denied.  The companies have also been under scrutiny over their responses to inflammatory content posted by Trump. Since May, Twitter has attached warnings and fact-checking labels to Trump\u2019s tweets about mail-in ballots.  Twitter said its rules would be \u201capplied equally and judiciously for everyone.\u201d The new policy, which is global, will take effect on Sept. 17.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google also said on Thursday it would remove the function that attempts to predict and complete search terms when people look up the status of voting locations, voting requirements or methods - for example, \u201cyou can vote by phone\u201d or \u201cyou can\u2019t vote by phone\u201d - though users will still be able to search for this information.  It will also remove those autocomplete predictions in searches about the integrity of the election, and claims for or against any candidate or political party.  Google staff told reporters on a call that incorrect information about election results, including reports claiming an early victory, would not show up on Google Search and that it would enforce its ads policy against demonstrably false claims that could undermine trust or participation in an election, including in the post-election period.  Facebook Inc last week said it was creating a label for posts by candidates or campaigns that made premature claims of victory.

The labels will only be added to verified accounts, Pickles said.

The new countries where senior officials and institutions will be labeled are: Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.  Twitter will also label the personal accounts of heads of state from these countries and the U.N. Security Council permanent members, citing the use of these accounts for diplomacy.  The company has faced international scrutiny over its approach to world leaders\u2019 accounts. In January it banned Trump after the Capitol riot for tweets - sent from his personal @realDonaldTrump account - that it said risked inciting violence.  Twitter has generally exempted world leaders\u2019 rule-breaking content from removal because it deems their posts in the public interest, instead adding warning notices and reducing the content\u2019s reach.

It said these represented 0.2% of all US election-related tweets sent during that period.

A Twitter spokeswoman said this week it had stopped using these more restrictive election-related warning labels.  The company said approximately 74% of the people who viewed labeled tweets saw them after the company applied a label or warning message.

The moves come as social network platforms brace for what has been an unusual election cycle due to a high number of mail-in ballots that may cause a delay in final results.  Beginning on election night through the inauguration, Twitter said it would place warning labels such as \u201cofficial sources called this election differently\u201d, or \u201cofficial sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted\u201d.  Facebook will add specific information in news feed notifications in its apps and in the labels on posts if a candidate or a party declares premature victory, and will continue to show latest results in its Voting Information Center, it said in a separate statement.  Facebook said it will also monitor a range of issues in real time on Election Day, including reports of voter suppression content, and will remove any attempts to suppress participation or intimidate voters.  U.S.-based accounts with over 100,000 followers and a significant engagement will also be considered for labeling, Twitter said.  Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the November vote.  In an updated blog, Twitter said it would consider state election officials and national news outlets such as ABC News, Associated Press, CNN and Fox News that have independent election decision desks as official sources for results.

FILE PHOTO: The Twitter application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  Twitter shares surged as high as $40.16 during Tuesday\u2019s session, their highest in more than three years, after S&P Dow Jones Indices said late on Monday the stock would be added to the S&P 500 index before trading opens on Thursday.  The stock replaces Monsanto Co, which is being bought by Germany\u2019s Bayer AG.  The addition to the index gives new prominence to the micro-blogging site, which has more than 330 million monthly active users and is a favorite platform for U.S. President Donald Trump and other celebrities.  Trading volume in Twitter on Tuesday quickly topped 40 million shares. It had already eclipsed the average daily volume from the past 10 sessions within about the first half hour after the market opened.  \u201cThe S&P 500 is without a doubt the most tracked index in the world,\u201d said Dave Nadig, managing director of news and analytics publisher ETF.com. \u201cAll of those investors now have to own Twitter stock whether they want to or not.\u201d  The S&P 500, designed to measure the large-cap segment of the U.S. stock market, is often considered a proxy for the market itself. Exchange-traded and mutual funds with assets of more than $700 billion track the S&P 500, according to research service Lipper.  Funds benchmarked to the S&P 500 must purchase an estimated 77.6 million shares of Twitter, according to Ivan Cajic, vice president of Index & ETF Research at ITG.  \u201cThe market is very good at pricing these things in pretty accurately,\u201d Nadig said, reacting to Twitter\u2019s heavy trading ahead of its official addition to the index.  Twitter\u2019s share price had more than doubled over the past year. The company closed on Monday with a market value of $28.5 billion, exceeding 60 percent of companies in the S&P 500.  Shares of Netflix, which will replace Monsanto in the separate S&P 100 index, rose 1.6 percent.  Twitter went public in November 2013. Its S&P designation comes after the company showed improvement in user growth and positive trends in advertising revenue, said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.  \u201cTwitter was always a company on the cusp,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThe president is on Twitter and all these celebrities, and people follow them, but then you\u2019d look at the numbers on their earnings report, and they always had very flat user growth.\u201d  Morgan said the addition to the S&P 500 could put more pressure on the company to report solid results.  \u201cYou have to deliver on the prestige you\u2019ve gained by being in the benchmark,\u201d Morgan said.","282":"Sept 10 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc said on Thursday it would label or remove misinformation aiming to undermine confidence in the U.S. election, including posts claiming victory before results have been certified or inciting unlawful conduct to prevent a peaceful transfer of power.  Twitter said in a blog post it was updating its rules to recognize the changes in how people will vote in the Nov. 3 election and try to protect against voter suppression and misleading content on its platform.  The widespread use of mail ballots in the U.S. election due to the coronavirus pandemic will likely cause significant delays in tallying results, which some experts fear could allow misinformation to gain traction.  U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that voting by mail is susceptible to large-scale fraud.  Twitter also said it would also label or remove misinformation creating confusion about the laws, regulations and officials involved in civic processes, as well as disputed claims that could undermine faith in the process, such as unverified information about vote tallying or election rigging.  A Twitter spokesman said whether content had specific falsehoods or could cause greater harm would determine if it would be removed, or labeled and have its reach reduced.  Social media companies have long been under pressure to combat misinformation after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russia used their platforms to meddle in the 2016 vote, allegations that Moscow has denied.  The companies have also been under scrutiny over their responses to inflammatory content posted by President Trump. Since May, Twitter has attached warnings and fact-checking labels to Trump\u2019s tweets about mail-in ballots.  Twitter said its rules would be \u201capplied equally and judiciously for everyone.\u201d The new policy, which is global, will take effect on Sept. 17.  Facebook Inc last week said it was creating a label for posts by candidates or campaigns that made premature claims of victory. It also said it would stop accepting new political ads in the week before Election Day.

The social media company said in a blog post that it plans to relaunch its verification program, including a new public application process, in early 2021. It said a public feedback period for the new policy would open on Tuesday and run until Dec. 8.  Twitter said it paused public submissions for verification in 2017 after hearing feedback that the program \u201cfelt arbitrary and confusing to many people.\u201d It said at the time the check mark was being confused with \u201can endorsement or an indicator of importance.\u201d  A year later, Twitter said it was putting fixes to the verification program on the back burner to focus on issues like election integrity, though it has continued to verify some accounts, such as medical experts tweeting about COVID-19 this year.  \u201cSince then, we haven\u2019t been clear about who can become verified and when, why an account might be unverified, or what it means to be verified,\u201d Twitter said in the Tuesday blog post.  The company laid out more detailed criteria for the \u201ccore types\u201d of notable, active accounts it will verify, such as government officials, companies, nonprofits, news organizations, entertainers, sports teams, athletes and activists.  Twitter said it also may verify accounts that meet other standards such as being one of the top-followed accounts in the user\u2019s country and having \u201coff-Twitter notability,\u201d which could be assessed through Google search trends, Wikipedia references or coverage in news outlets.  Twitter also released proposed grounds for denying verification, for example, accounts that have been locked out for violating rules in the last six months or accounts of individuals associated with hateful content or who have been found to have committed \u201cgross human rights violations.\u201d  The company said it may cut the blue badge from accounts that severely or repeatedly violate rules, such as its policies on hateful conduct, civic integrity or glorification of violence. But it said these removals would not be automatic and would be assessed case by case.  Twitter aims to introduce the final policy on Dec. 17. It also indicated plans for more ways for users to identify themselves with new account types and labels.

Twitter\u2019s average monetizable daily active users (mDAU) increased 34% year over year to 186 million, above analysts\u2019 estimate of 176 million, in a rise it said was primarily driven by external factors such as shelter-in-place requirements and increased conversation around the COVID-19 pandemic.  But the company missed Wall Street\u2019s lowered expectations for quarterly revenue, as the coronavirus-spurred economic slowdown battered the company\u2019s largely events-oriented digital ads business.  Ad sales, which make up 82% of Twitter\u2019s revenue, sank 23% to $562 million, a drop the company attributed to brand spending pauses tied to the pandemic and U.S. civil unrest. Analysts had expected $585 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Chief Executive Jack Dorsey opened a conference call with analysts by apologizing for the hack that compromised the accounts of high-profile users last week, saying \u201cwe feel terrible.\u201d In a statement, Dorsey said Twitter had taken steps to improve its security and \u201cresiliency against targeted social engineering attempts.\u201d  Total revenue came in at $683 million, down 19% year-over-year, helped by steadier sales growth from the licensing of users\u2019 posts to researchers and marketers.  Twitter has struggled to build out its ad offerings, leaving it reliant on a suite of promotional tools geared toward advertising around big events and product launches, which have all but vanished during the pandemic.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company said it finished rebuilding its ad management technology in the second quarter, which would support faster development of new formats going forward, and was rolling out measurement tools for \u201cdirect response\u201d ads used by app developers.  On the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal declined to give details about the impact of a July social media advertising boycott that was intially focused on Facebook FB.O but spread to other platforms. Dorsey said Twitter's actions to protect conversations on the platform were being noted by advertisers.  Twitter also said it was exploring \u201csubscriptions and other approaches to complement our advertising business,\u201d such as commerce, though it was not expecting any revenue to result this year Dorsey said on the call that the company would have a \u201creally high bar for when we would ask consumers to pay for aspects of Twitter.\u201d  The company reported a second-quarter loss of $1.2 billion, largely driven by the reversal of a tax benefit established last year, when the company transferred intellectual property to Ireland. Because of the second quarter\u2019s steep coronavirus-related losses, Twitter did not make enough money to take advantage of the tax benefit.  Adjusted to exclude the tax considerations, the company incurred a loss of $127 million, or 16 cents per share, roughly in line with analyst expectations of a $125 million loss. It had an adjusted profit last year of $37 million.  Echoing earlier guidance, Twitter said it expects data licensing revenue to \u201cmoderate\u201d for the rest of the year.  Costs and expenses grew 5% to $807 million, below the increase in the low teens that Twitter had forecast. The company said it anticipated expense growth of 10% or more in the third quarter.  Social media rival Snap Inc SNAP.N missed user growth estimates earlier this week, as its usage bump from coronavirus lockdowns petered out sooner than expected, but it beat targets for revenue gains.","288":"(Deletes incorrect reference to Q3 2019 adjusted profit, corrects to show was 2018 figure)  SAN FRANCISCO\/BENGALURU, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc posted worse-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, plagued by technical issues that hurt its advertising, and unusually low demand over the summer, sending its shares down about 20%.  Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said the company\u2019s ad platform encountered bugs, or glitches, that hindered its ability to target ads and share data with partners.  \u201cThese issues were in our control and we will work to do better,\u201d said Segal on a call with analysts.  Twitter\u2019s revenue rose 9% from a year earlier, but fell short of Wall Street expectations as total advertising revenue missed estimates.  Twitter\u2019s efforts to clean up abusive content and make the platform more user-friendly appear to have driven up use, addressing longstanding concerns about growth of customers, and Twitter has also rolled out new video ad products that attract brands.  The ad problems were, however, a major, unexpected issue and come as the holiday buying season, the most important for ads, gets underway. Twitter cut its fourth-quarter revenue forecast to below Wall Street estimates.  Twitter said that it was working on a total fix for the ad problems but that it was not yet in place. Analysts tracking Twitter said the company\u2019s financials would take at least a few more quarters to stabilize, with a quick turnaround looking increasingly unlikely.  \u201cNot expecting a quick rebound in Twitter\u2019s financials for at least a few quarters, as shortfall likely will carry into 2020,\u201d said analyst Craig Huber of Huber Research Partners.  On the conference call with analysts, Segal said Twitter had turned off some ad settings, which limited how the company could target ads to people or show advertisers how effective their ads were. It acted after finding two bugs that inadvertently shared certain data even if users opted out of sharing it.  \u201cSo we stopped doing that and although we\u2019re working on remediation, there isn\u2019t remediation yet in place and so the effects of that will continue into Q4,\u201d said Segal.  Twitter expects revenue in the fourth-quarter, which will include Black Friday and the December holidays, to be between $940 million and $1.01 billion. Wall Street on average expects $1.06 billion.  The social media platform did manage to record a rise in daily users who see ads on the site, beating analyst estimates.  Twitter has stopped disclosing its monthly active users figures, instead reporting monetizable daily active usage (mDAU), a metric it created to measure users exposed on a daily basis to advertising through the site or Twitter applications that are able to show ads.  Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said growth in mDAU was driven by product improvements, including making the site easier to navigate and more proactively identifying abusive content to remove.  The company\u2019s average mDAU hit 145 million, beating analyst expectations of 141 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This alternative metric was up 17% year-over-year.  In July, Twitter launched a more personalized desktop Twitter.com as part of a plan to make the platform better for conversations. It has also experimented with the ability to follow topics and has recently expanded testing for a feature to hide replies.  Recently, the company made a six-second video bidding available for global advertisers and it has continued to expand its live and on-demand video partnerships, including deals with NBC Olympics and Eurosport for coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Games.  Third-quarter net income was $37 million. In the same period last year, the firm reported net income of $789 million, or $106 million when adjusted to exclude certain items.  Analysts had expected net income of $161.5 million.  Total operating expenses, including cost of revenue, rose by 17% year-over-year to $780 million, partly due to plans to hire more employees.","289":"FILE PHOTO: People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken in Warsaw September 27, 2013.

The microblogging site launched \u2018Ads Transparency Center\u2019 to allow anyone to view ads that have been put on Twitter, with greater transparency about U.S. federal election campaign ads.

Facebook said on Thursday it would go even further by enabling users to see listings of all active ad campaigns, whether the advertiser is political in nature or not. Users can also view a log of name changes to a Facebook page.  The features should help people spot misuse of Facebook, it added.

One in five girls and young women has abandoned or cut down on using a social media platform after being targeted, with some saying harassment started when they were as young as eight, the survey by girls\u2019 rights group Plan International showed.  \u201cGirls are being silenced by a toxic level of harassment,\u201d said the organisation\u2019s chief executive, Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen.  Attacks were most common on Facebook, where 39% of girls polled said they had been harassed, followed by Instagram (23%), WhatsApp (14%), Snapchat (10%), Twitter (9%) and TikTok (6%).  The charity, which will share the report with social media companies and lawmakers around the world, said the abuse was suppressing girls\u2019 voices at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic was increasing the importance of communicating online.  It called on social media companies to take urgent action to address the issue and urged governments to pass laws to deal with online harassment.  The study found reporting tools were ineffective in stopping the abuse, which included explicit messages, pornographic photos and cyberstalking.  Nearly half of girls targeted had been threatened with physical or sexual violence, according to the poll. Many said the abuse took a mental toll, and a quarter felt physically unsafe.  \u201cIt is time for this to stop. Girls should not have to put up with behaviour online which would be criminal on the streets,\u201d the report said.  Facebook and Instagram said they used artificial intelligence to look for bullying content, constantly monitored users\u2019 reports of abuse and always removed rape threats.  \u201cKeeping women safe on our apps is critical and we invest heavily in keeping abuse off our platforms,\u201d said Cindy Southworth, head of women\u2019s safety at Facebook.  She said Facebook was working with Plan International to better understand how it can support young women around the world.  Twitter said it also used technology to catch abusive content and has launched tools to improve users\u2019 control over their conversations.  The survey polled 14,000 girls and young women aged 15 to 25 in 22 countries including Brazil, India, Nigeria, Spain, Thailand and the United States.  Albrectsen said activists, including those campaigning for gender equality and on LGBT+ issues, were often targeted particularly viciously, and their lives and families threatened.  \u201cDriving girls out of online spaces is hugely disempowering in an increasingly digital world, and damages their ability to be seen, heard and become leaders,\u201d she added.  In an open letter to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, girls from around the world called on social media companies to create more effective ways to report abuse.  \u201cWe use (your platforms) not just to connect with friends, but to lead and create change. But they are not safe for us. We get harassed and abused on them. Every. Single. Day,\u201d they wrote.  \u201cAs this global pandemic moves our lives online, we are more at risk than ever.\u201d  Plan International also urged the companies to do more to hold to account those behind such abuse, and to collect data on the scale of the problem.

If it is approved by a judge, the deal means the Tesla founder no longer faces the prospect of being held in contempt for violating an earlier settlement with the agency, which had required him to submit statements \u201cmaterial\u201d to investors for prior review.  The new agreement, disclosed in a filing in Manhattan federal court, lays out in more detail exactly what kinds of statements must be reviewed.  Shares of Tesla rose 1.4 percent to $238.50 in after hours trading. The agreement lifts a cloud that has hung over Musk as Tesla tries to ramp up production of its most important vehicle, the Model 3 sedan, and make a profit at the same time.  \u201cIt could really have turned out far worse for him,\u201d said Stephen Diamond, a professor of securities law at Santa Clara University. \u201cThe consequences of thumbing his nose at the SEC could have been far worse for him and the company.\u201d  Tesla has struggled with logistics difficulties in delivering its Model 3 to global customers, a declining share price and lingering questions about the sustainability of demand. Earlier this week, the electric vehicle maker posted a $702 million loss, and warned of a loss in the second quarter.  Musk\u2019s lawyer did not immediately return a request for comment.  TWEET APPROVAL  The SEC sued Musk last year after he tweeted on Aug. 7 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The agency said the tweet, which sent Tesla\u2019s share price up as much as 13.3 percent, violated securities laws. Musk\u2019s privatization plan was at best in an early stage and financing was not in place.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk (C) exits after attending a S.E.C. hearing at the Manhattan Federal Courthouse in New York, April 4, 2019. REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz  Musk settled the lawsuit, agreeing to step down as chairman and have the company\u2019s lawyers pre-approve written communications, including tweets with material information about the company.  In February, the SEC accused Musk of violating that settlement by sending a tweet about Tesla\u2019s production numbers that had not been vetted by the company\u2019s attorneys, and asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan to hold him in contempt.  At an April 4 court hearing, the judge declined to rule on the contempt motion and told the SEC and Musk to work out their differences and come to a settlement.  Musk\u2019s lawyers have argued that the February tweet did not contain new information that was material to investors, and that Musk did not need pre-approval for all tweets about Tesla under the settlement.  They also argued the settlement was too ambiguous for Musk to be held in contempt.  The new agreement unveiled Friday addresses that ambiguity by listing what kinds of statements must be vetted. They include statements about Tesla\u2019s financial condition, proposed or potential deals, production numbers, performance projections, financing or lending arrangements and Musk\u2019s own transactions in the company\u2019s securities.  It also gives the company\u2019s board of directors the right to seek preapproval about additional topics if they believe doing so would protect shareholders\u2019 interests.  Diamond said the new language adds clarity to the original agreement and places significant restraints on Musk\u2019s use of Twitter.  \u201cAny attempt by Musk to circumvent the process will be much more easily policed,\u201d he said.  Musk has been an outspoken critic of the SEC throughout his legal dispute with the SEC, which he once dubbed the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201d  In the early morning of Feb. 26, after the regulator filed its contempt motion, Musk tweeted: \u201cSomething is broken with SEC oversight.\u201d  Musk has been CEO of Tesla since 2008 and has more than 25 million followers on Twitter.","302":"U.S. President Donald Trump takes part in a forum called Generation Next at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Twitter\u2019s algorithms and content monitoring on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Chris Wattie  The system, or \u201cstandard,\u201d would not be owned by any single private company, Dorsey said, and would enable individuals to use a variety of services to access the same network, just like they choose different email providers to see the same messages.  Policing speech on social media sites has required hefty investments while still failing to stem criticism from users who find the policies either too aggressive or too lax.  \"Centralized enforcement of global policy to address abuse and misleading information is unlikely to scale over the long-term without placing far too much burden on people,\" Dorsey tweeted here.  He said the new approach would also allow Twitter to \u201cfocus our efforts on building open recommendation algorithms which promote healthy conversation, and will force us to be far more innovative than in the past.\u201d  The idea, as outlined in articles Dorsey shared, is that developers could use their own algorithms to offer like-minded individuals targeted access to the same social media networks.  For instance, an individual could sign up with a provider that would aggressively filter out racist material, or another that would promote conversations over other types of content.  The open standard, however, could upend Twitter\u2019s business model in the process, giving rise to competitor services that offer filters, content suggestions or other tools that prove more popular with consumers.  In an article that Dorsey shared called \u201cProtocols, Not Platforms,\u201d tech news site Techdirt founder Mike Masnick outlined how an open standard could give rise to a \u201ccompetition for business models\u201d among developers.  Some providers might collect less user data for ads, while others might abandon advertising altogether, instead charging users for access to premium services like filters or data storage, Masnick wrote.  Dorsey said Twitter\u2019s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal, will be in charge of hiring a lead for the research team, called BlueSky. Twitter will fund the project, which will take many years to complete, but will not direct it, he said.  He went on to suggest that blockchain technology might provide a model for decentralizing content hosting, oversight and even monetization of social media, without elaborating on possible alternatives to Twitter\u2019s ads-driven business."}}
