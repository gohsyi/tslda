REUTERS\/FIles  (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc on Monday forecast 2021 profit above market estimates and posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings as it continues to gain from upbeat demand for its COVID-19 tests and materials for vaccine production.  Thermo Fisher has been one of the major providers of COVID-19 tests to governments and healthcare providers during the pandemic and also manufactures some of the raw materials used to make vaccines against the novel coronavirus.  Earlier this year, Thermo Fisher purchased Belgium-based Henogen SA, a unit of contract manufacturing services provider Novasep that manufactures viral vectors used in gene therapies and some vaccines.  The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company also has a contract via Henogen to provide materials to AstraZeneca Plc, which slashed deliveries to the European Union by 60% in January, citing supply constraints.  Thermo Fisher, which purchased Mesa Biotech last month to bolster its diagnostic testing business, struck a deal in September to provide contract manufacturing services to Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing a vaccine for the health crisis.  \u201cThere are many scenarios where I see testing demand being very robust for a long period of time,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper said during an investor call on Monday. \u201cThe truth is this pandemic is going to be around in some form around the world.\u201d  Thermo Fisher, the world\u2019s largest maker of scientific instruments, estimated annual profit of $21.62 per share and revenue of $35.1 billion, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $20.74 per share for profit and a revenue of $33.70 billion, according to Refinitv data.  The company also forecast COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue to increase to $1 billion this year, while COVID-19 tests and products brought in sales of $3.2 billion during the fourth quarter.

The company, the world\u2019s largest maker of scientific instruments, disclosed in a regulatory filing last month that overheated equipment at one of its data centers had released a fire suppressant gas, temporarily affecting some systems.  This had caused a delay in orders, lowering the company\u2019s organic revenue growth by 1% in the second quarter, Thermo Fisher said.  The technical problem has been resolved and the affected systems are running now, Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper said on a conference call.  The company said its organic revenue rose 5% in the quarter, lower than analysts\u2019 estimates of a 5.5% rise, according to three analysts.  The sales miss overshadowed an otherwise strong quarter, as the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast for earnings and sales, helped by a 9% rise in revenue at its life sciences solutions unit.  \u201cThis is a fine print given the circumstances, but expect a healthy amount of debate,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note.  Thermo Fisher\u2019s quarterly sales rose 4% to $6.32 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.30 billion. The company said although acquisitions increased revenue by 1% in the quarter, currency fluctuations lowered the overall revenue by 2%.  The company forecast full-year adjusted earning per share between $12.16 and $12.26, compared with its prior range of $12.08 to $12.22.  Revenue at the company\u2019s life sciences unit, which makes tools and compounds used in medical research, rose to $1.71 billion, from $1.57 billion a year earlier, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.65 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Excluding items, the company earned $3.04 per share in the quarter ended June 29, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $3 per share.  Thermo Fisher said its quarterly net income rose nearly 50% to $1.12 billion, or $2.77 per share.  The company raised its full-year revenue forecast range to $25.30 billion to $25.50 billion, from $25.17 billion to $25.47 billion.  Shares of the company were down 3% at $284.64, after touching a low of $279.18.","8":"March 30 (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc:  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC FILES FOR POTENTIAL, TWO-PART SENIOR NOTES OFFERING; SIZE NOT DISCLOSED - SEC FILING Source: (bit.ly\/2xBysLK) Further company coverage:","9":"Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc:  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC TO DOUBLE ITS CAPACITY OF VIRAL VECTOR MANUFACTURING  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC - $180 MILLION PROJECT WILL MORE THAN DOUBLE CO\u2019S COMMERCIAL VIRAL VECTOR CAPACITY  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC - NEW PLAINVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, SITE WILL ACCELERATE COMMERCIALIZATION OF CELL AND GENE THERAPIES  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC - CONSTRUCTION OF NEW 290,000-SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2022 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","10":"Feb 25 (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc:  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INCREASES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC - AUTHORIZED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.22 PER COMMON SHARE  * THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC - NEW DIVIDEND REFLECTS A 16% INCREASE OVER PREVIOUS DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $0.19.

Activist investor Davidson Kempner, owner of an 8% stake in Qiagen which campaigned against Thermo Fisher\u2019s bid, said management should now improve its interactions with shareholders, focus on high-growth businesses and be disciplined about its investments.  Evercore ISI analysts said they were doubtful a new industrial bidder was waiting in the wings as the longevity of COVID diagnostics demand was very hard to predict and earnings and market valuation may be peaking.  Thermo Fisher in July sweetened its offer to 43 euros per share from 39 euros after pressure from some investors, but still did not win over Davidson Kempner.  As part of the sweetened offer, Thermo Fisher also reduced the minimum acceptance threshold from 75% of outstanding ordinary share capital.

European Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton, wearing protective gear, enters a lab during a visit at the Thermo Fisher plant, former Novasep, producing COVID-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca in Seneffe, Belgium, February 10, 2021. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  The apparent dispute could lead to further EU pressure on AstraZeneca to deliver more doses in the winter, as its COVID-19 vaccine began being rolled out in the 27-nation bloc this week.  The factory, which U.S. firm Thermo Fisher Scientific acquired from Novasep in January, has been identified as the cause of the cuts by AstraZeneca in internal meetings, several EU officials have said.  \u201cWe have complied with all the contractual requirements we have with AstraZeneca,\u201d Thermo Fisher\u2019s vice president for the EU, Cedric Volanti, told a news conference on Wednesday, when asked about possible production problems the plant had faced.  AstraZeneca on Jan. 15 announced cuts in its supply of vaccines to the EU in the first quarter, which EU officials said amounted to a 60% reduction to 31 million doses through March.  The company declined to comment on Wednesday on Thermo Fisher\u2019s remarks. In a public statement it had said the drop in expected doses was caused by a lower than anticipated yield, or the amount of vaccine that can be made from base ingredients.  EU officials repeatedly said AstraZeneca had told them that the problem had been caused by production issues at the factory in Belgium. AstraZeneca has never denied this but has also never publicly accused the Belgian plant.  Volanti declined to comment on the number of doses the company has committed to producing for AstraZeneca and underscored that the change of ownership had had no negative impact on the production capacity of the factory.  When asked whether the Belgian plant, located in Seneffe at an hour drive from Brussels, sold doses to Britain, Volanti said the company sends vaccines to an Italian facility that bottles them before delivering to clients.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  He added that the timing of deliveries depended on AstraZeneca.  EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton, who leads an EU task force to expand COVID-19 vaccine production, said he was confident about the production capacity of the Thermo Fisher plant.  LOW TARGET  After the supply cut announced in January, which followed an earlier downward revision of its initial 120 million-dose delivery target for the first quarter, AstraZeneca raised its commitment to the EU to 40 million doses through March from 31 million.  The company has not said from where the additional doses would come.  The EU has said that increase was a positive first step, but urged the company to further ramp up its immediate deliveries to the bloc, which has a contract for 300 million doses and options for another 100 million.  In meetings with the EU, AstraZeneca said it could not send doses from factories in Britain because of contractual obligations to London.  Breton declined to comment on whether AstraZeneca could further raise deliveries by the end of March but said output from a factory producing COVID-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca in the United States would go \u201calmost entirely\u201d to Europe.  The Commission had so far said that doses for the EU were meant to come from four factories, one each in Belgium and Germany and two in Britain.  Separately on Wednesday, AstraZeneca announced a partnership with German firm IDT Biologika to speed up output of finished COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter.","52":"(Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog said on Wednesday Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc's TMO.N $925 million acquisition of Roper Technologies Inc's ROP.N unit Gatan raised concerns that prices of microscopes could go up and quality could suffer.

Qiagen, which has its main operations in Germany but is headquartered in the neighbouring Netherlands, is one of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of products to prepare tissue and blood samples for advanced testing.  These genetic tests play a major role in research and treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders.  Last month it also began shipping a new rapid testing kit for the coronavirus to hospitals in China. The outbreak has claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 people globally, after spreading from China to 77 other countries and territories  At 39 euros per share, Thermo Fisher\u2019s cash offer was accepted at a 23% premium to Qiagen\u2019s closing price on Monday, Qiagen said, adding that the bid valued the company at 10.4 billion euros ($11.5 billion), including 1.26 billion euros in net debt.  Qiagen shares rose 18% on the news to 37.5 euros, on track for their best daily gain in two decades.Thermo Fisher, which has a market valuation of around $120 billion, is the leading maker of instruments, software and other services for scientific research, including the vaccines and diagnostic tests now under development to combat coronavirus.  Thermo Fisher fist approached Qiagen about a potential takeover last year, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details are confidential.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  In December, Qiagen ended the talks because it was not satisfied with the price offered and harbored concerns about the deal getting past antitrust regulators, one of the sources added.  Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher\u2019s chief executive officer, said that the instrumentation giant had long considered Qiagen a potential strategic partner. Qiagen\u2019s coronavirus testing capabilities were not a significant part of the deal\u2019s rationale, he added.\u201dDeals happen when they happen,\u201d Casper said in an interview. \u201cWhen we got into the last few weeks, things really accelerated here. We were able to come to a price and deal terms that both companies felt are compelling.\u201d  Shares in Thermo Fisher rose 3.5% to $315.50 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  The deal was the second to be announced this week in the healthcare sector, illustrating how some companies are braving the current market volatility to pursue deals. On Monday, Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O said it would buy smaller biotechnology company Forty Seven Inc FTSV.O for its research in immuno-oncology in a $4.9 billion deal.  QIAGEN\u2019S TOUGH YEAR  The acquisition of Qiagen, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021, will immediately add to Thermo Fisher\u2019s earnings after the deal closes, the companies said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Thermo Fisher said the deal would generate $200 million in savings by three years after the deal\u2019s close.  Jefferies analysts said they had long viewed Qiagen\u2019s strong position in research labs, plus front-end prep for molecular diagnostics as attractive to larger life science conglomerates.  For Qiagen, the deal comes after a tumultuous few months. The company's long-serving CEO Peer Schatz resigned in October when it announced a reversal of its strategy, saying it would stop developing its next-generation genome sequencing machines and instead collaborate with industry leader Illumina ILMN.O.
