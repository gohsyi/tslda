The victory for the billionaire investors puts the Japanese company further on the back foot in any new negotiations with Xerox, although it is by no means out of contention as Xerox is now expected to go up for sale in an auction at a higher price.  Xerox said that it had over several weeks repeatedly asked Fujifilm to immediately start talks about improved terms for a proposed transaction.  \u201cDespite our insistence, Fujifilm provided no assurance that it will do so within an acceptable timeframe,\u201d the U.S. firm said in a statement on its decision to drop the deal.  Fujifilm was quick to take a combative stance, saying it disputes Xerox\u2019s right to terminate the deal and would look at all options including legal action seeking damages.  The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control. That prompted Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U.S. firm was being undervalued, to launch a proxy fight.  The activist investors have also said they are unhappy with the current structure of the joint venture, and settlement creates uncertainty concerning potential changes to a business that accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm\u2019s revenue.  Icahn and Deason have said they believe other investors are \"waiting in the wings\" for Xerox while people familiar with the matter have previously said that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has expressed interest in a bid for Xerox.  INSEPARABLE?  But analysts believe the two firms are inextricably intertwined and that Fujifilm is not without bargaining power, while also doubting that talk of other buyers is that substantial.  \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be good if it goes elsewhere. But are there really other potential buyers? Icahn and Deason say there are, because they want a higher price, but you don\u2019t really know whether that\u2019s for real,\u201d said Ichiyoshi Asset Management senior executive officer Mitsushige Akino.  Fuji Xerox, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm, handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe, and Fuji Xerox services in Asia. Moreover, Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox.  Xerox said its new board would meet immediately and \u201cbegin a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Icahn and Deason have said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share. In contrast to the investors\u2019 argument that Fujifilm is only offering $28 per share, analysts have said the Japanese firm\u2019s offer is not too far off that per share valuation, albeit not in cash.  The settlement will see Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson - the main architect of the deal with Fujifilm - as well as five other directors step down. John Visentin is expected to take the helm.  Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  It is Xerox\u2019s second settlement with the activist investors in just two weeks. The first settlement agreement was allowed to expire as Xerox came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm and also took into account a stock dive that followed the agreement.  \u201cWe are extremely pleased that Xerox finally terminated the ill-advised scheme to cede control of the company to Fujifilm,\u201d Icahn said in a statement.  Xerox also said it was ending the deal partly because Fujifilm had failed to provide audited financial information for Fuji Xerox by an April 15 deadline and that there were \u201cmaterial deviations\u201d between audited Fuji Xerox financial statements and unaudited statements provided previously.","2":"(Adds Telecom Italia, Vodafone, Boost Mobile, Warburg Pincus, PNE, Coty Inc)  Nov 18 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2100 GMT on Monday: ** HP Inc said on Sunday it was open to exploring a bid for U.S. printer maker Xerox Corp after rebuffing a $33.5 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer from the latter as \u201csignificantly\u201d undervaluing the personal computer maker. ** INWIT, the mast group controlled by Telecom Italia , said it would pay a special dividend of 0.5936 euros per share once a merger of its assets with the Italian mobile towers of Vodafone is complete.  ** Boost Mobile founder Peter Adderton is willing to pay up to $2 billion to buy back the prepaid wireless brand from Sprint Corp, he told Reuters, a significant potential premium to what satellite TV provider Dish Network agreed to pay for Sprint\u2019s entire prepaid wireless business.  ** U.S. buyout fund Warburg Pincus has clinched a deal to sell its European airline services firm Accelya to rival private equity fund Vista Equity Partners for an undisclosed amount.  ** PNE shareholder ENKRAFT has called for a special audit into an approved takeover bid for the German wind project firm, an investor letter seen by Reuters showed.  ** Coty Inc said it would pay $600 million for a majority stake in Kylie Jenner\u2019s make-up and skincare businesses, as it looks to tap into the reality TV star\u2019s huge social media reach.  ** United Bankshares Inc said it would buy CresCom Bank parent Carolina Financial Corp in a deal valued at $1.1 billion, expanding its banking network in North and South Carolina. ** Qiagen NV shares jumped to their highest in almost 19 years on Monday after the German genetic testing company said it would start talks with several potential suitors. ** Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp, Japan\u2019s largest chemical maker, said it will pay 491.8 billion yen ($4.51 billion) to make Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp a fully owned subsidiary.  ** Blackstone said it will continue talks with Japanese hotel chain Unizo Holdings on its proposed $1.6 billion takeover bid and plans to make an announcement by Nov. 22.  ** British life and general insurer Aviva Plc will keep its operations in Singapore and China, it said, two days ahead of an expected strategy update and following speculation of a sale of the Singapore business. ** Swedish pharmaceutical group Recipharm has agreed to buy British peer Consort Medical for 505 million pounds or 6.3 billion crowns ($649 million), the companies said ** Bulgaria\u2019s competition regulator has rejected appeals against the transport ministry\u2019s decision to pick a consortium led by asset manager Meridiam to run and operate Sofia Airport, a posting on its website showed. ** Pan-European stock market operator Euronext and Switzerland\u2019s SIX sparked a bidding war for Spain\u2019s Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles (BME), with both trying to snap up one of Europe\u2019s last standalone stock exchanges. ** SoftBank Corp plans to merge internet subsidiary Yahoo Japan with messaging app operator Line Corp to create a $30 billion tech group, as it strives to compete more effectively with local rival Rakuten and U.S. tech powerhouses. ** Australia\u2019s Saracen Mineral Holdings Ltd said it would buy Canadian-listed Barrick Gold Corp\u2019s 50% stake in the Super Pit gold mine in Western Australia for $750 million.  ** Consort Medical Plc said Sweden\u2019s Recipharm AB would buy the London-listed healthcare company for 1,010 pence per share in cash. ** Software company Sage Group Plc said it will sell its payment processing unit Sage Pay for about 232 million pounds ($296.87 million) to Elavon, a payments company and unit of U.S. Bancorp.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - A company synonymous with copying should expect some duplication. Xerox has become aggressive since pushy investor Carl Icahn arrived on the scene. After rancorously blowing up a deal and ending a 57-year joint venture with Japan\u2019s Fujifilm, the U.S. printer maker initiated a hostile $35 billion bid for rival HP. Now a longtime partner of HP\u2019s is threatening to break ties if the takeover is successful.  HP has been resisting the advances of its smaller competitor. Rushing to Chairman Chip Bergh\u2019s side is the boss of one of the company\u2019s largest suppliers of laser-printer components: Canon.  It was Icahn, and the Xerox boss he installed, John Visentin, who helped torpedo a $6.1 billion sale to Fujifilm two years ago. The transaction was controversial, but things got nasty. When Fujifilm sued Xerox for abandoning the merger, Visentin responded with an ornery letter to his counterpart, Shigetaka Komori, calling it a \u201cdesperate, misguided negotiating ploy.\u201d The two companies eventually unwound a decades-long alliance, with Fujifilm buying Xerox\u2019s 25% stake last November for $2.3 billion.  As HP rejected Xerox\u2019s tender offer last week, Canon CEO Fujio Mitarai told Nikkei he is prepared to tear up his company\u2019s storied association with HP if Xerox becomes the new owner. That\u2019s a remarkable declaration considering that in 2018 HP accounted for nearly 14% of Canon\u2019s $38 billion of revenue, which has been falling. The company\u2019s shareholders weren\u2019t obviously spooked, but the provocation is nevertheless telling.  The HP-Canon bond is the stuff of business lore. An account in the 2008 management book \u201cThe Power of Two\u201d says the unwritten rule at HP was that \u201cif you screw up the relationship with Canon, you will get fired.\u201d Eight years later, when HP bought Samsung Electronics\u2019 printer business, comments from Mitarai were included in the press release, signalling the importance of HP\u2019s now 35-year link with Canon.  Maybe threatening to throw all that away is just a tactic to preserve an arrangement that\u2019s advantageous to Canon. It could also, however, reflect a distaste for the kind of distracting, public spat that Xerox had with Fujifilm. Whether Xerox likes it or not \u2013 and whether there is a cheaper vendor to be found \u2013 strong relationships matter in corporate Japan and beyond. It should be little surprise that hard-nosed tactics invite copycat responses.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Trump, who is known to have a strong protectionist bent on trade, has said the United States will impose tariffs on European car imports if it is unable to reach a trade deal with the European Union.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in July that Trump promised he would hold off for the time being while the two sides sought to improve trade relations, such as with a deal to cut tariffs on \u201cnon-auto industrial goods\u201d.  A confidential report by the U.S. Commerce Department sent to Trump last weekend was expected to pave the way for the U.S. president to impose duties of up to 25 percent on imported autos and auto parts by designating them as a threat to U.S. national security.  The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28-member EU, has said it is preparing a list of U.S. products to target with tariffs should Trump decide EU car imports need to be restricted.  The Commission told national ministers at a meeting about trade in Bucharest that its list was ready, EU diplomats said, although it did not disclose what was in it.  It would go after 20 billion euros ($22.7 billion) worth of U.S. imports, although the list would take the form of categories of products, rather than specific companies.  EU car and car parts exports to the United States are worth around 50 billion euros per year, with the bulk of them coming from Germany.  The EU has already imposed its own import tariffs on 2.8 billion euros worth of U.S. products ranging from bourbon to motor-bikes as a response to U.S. punitive duties on EU steel and aluminium imports, which had been worth 6.4 billion euros.  \u201cShould there be tariffs on cars and car parts, we don\u2019t know, but if it happens we have started internally to prepare a list of rebalancing measures,\u201d EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a news conference in Bucharest.  \u201cThere is full support to do this. Of course if it happens we would immediately publish that list for formal consultation,\u201d she continuing, adding that U.S. car tariffs would also lead to the end of planned trade negotiations with Washington.

A spokeswoman later clarified this meant Fujifilm could end merger talks.  Xerox could not be reached for comment.  The two companies in January agreed to a complex deal that would merge Xerox into their 56-year-old Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox, which Fujifilm would control with a 50.1 percent stake.  But Xerox scrapped the deal last month in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who opposed the takeover by Fujifilm saying it undervalued the U.S. company.  Fuji Xerox - 75 percent owned by Fujifilm - can grow on its own, but Xerox depends on Fuji Xerox to produce almost all of the U.S. firm\u2019s copier machines, Komori said.  Under the current joint venture agreement, Fuji Xerox is focused on Asia Pacific - the region with the highest growth potential - while Xerox covers the rest. The terms on regional coverage expire in March 2021.  Icahn and Deason, who together own about 15 percent of Xerox, had said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share.  Fujifilm said the previously agreed deal valued Xerox at $8.6 billion, or an 8 percent premium over the average Xerox stock price of $29.7 per share over a month before the deal was announced. But the value would be higher if benefits from an estimated $1.7 billion worth of synergies is included.  Komori said Fujifilm is \u201cnot opposed to considering any new proposal from the new Xerox board if it\u2019s beneficial for both firms,\u201d but the $40 per share sought by Icahn and Deason is \u201ctoo high\u201d.  The typical premium offered in buyout deals is 30 percent but that would not be possible in this case, Komori said.  \u201cWe could procure funds, but many shareholders are demanding that money should be used on healthcare businesses,\u201d he said.  The photocopier business accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm\u2019s revenue and operating profit. The firm is seeking growth, however, through buying businesses involved in regenerative medicine and pharmaceuticals.","24":"TOKYO, June 7 (Reuters) - Fujifilm Holdings Corp said on Thursday it may have no choice but to give up on a $6.1 billion merger with Xerox Corp if there is no progress in talks with the new board for about half a year.  \u201cI don\u2019t have a specific deadline in mind, but it should normally be around six months.

In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Fujifilm accused Xerox of breach of contract and engaging in \u201cintentional and egregious conduct\u201d in abandoning the $6.1 billion merger announced in January.  Icahn, the billionaire, and Deason together owned 15 percent of Xerox shares, and said the merger undervalued the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company.  \u201cIt is inconsistent with shareholder democracy to allow Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, minority shareholders with only 15 percent of Xerox\u2019s shares, to dictate the fate of Xerox,\u201d Fujifilm said in a statement.  The merger was scrapped on May 13 when Xerox, in a settlement with Icahn and Deason, agreed to install several new directors and replace Jeff Jacobson as chief executive with technology executive John Visentin.  Xerox also cited unresolved accounting issues as a reason to end the merger.  In a statement on Monday, Xerox said it remained \u201cextremely confident\u201d it had a contractual right to back out, and would seek remedies for Fujifilm\u2019s \u201cmismanagement and misconduct.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Fujifilm Holdings' logos are pictured ahead of its news conference in Tokyo, Japan January 31, 2018. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  A spokeswoman for Deason had no immediate comment. Icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Xerox has been exploring strategic options, including transactions with other companies, but the lawsuit could force it to address Fujifilm\u2019s grievances sooner.  A merger would have combined Xerox with the 56-year-old joint venture Fujifilm Xerox, in which Fujifilm and Xerox had stakes of 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively.  Thereafter, Fujifilm would have owned 50.1 percent of Xerox\u2019s common stock, and Xerox shareholders would have received a $2.5 billion special dividend.  Fujifilm had hoped the merger would deliver at least $1.7 billion of cost savings and $1 billion of new revenue annually.  Its lawsuit also seeks punitive damages and a $183 million merger termination fee.  \u201cXerox has recently been subject to the whims of activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who, notwithstanding their minority ownership of Xerox shares, have yanked the Xerox Board in more directions than can be counted,\u201d Fujifilm said.  Fujifilm has appealed an April 27 temporary injunction sought by Deason and granted by a New York state judge to block the merger.  Deason, who had accused Jacobson of arranging the merger to keep his job, is still pursuing a lawsuit accusing Fujifilm of aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty by Xerox\u2019s old board. Fujifilm filed counterclaims on June 14.  Xerox shares closed down 17 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $27.24 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Xerox made the offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov. 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.  Responding to Xerox\u2019s offer on Sunday, HP said in a statement that it would saddle the combined company with \u201coutsized debt\u201d and was not in the best interest of its shareholders.  However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer of Xerox, stating that it recognized the potential benefits of consolidation.  \u201cWith substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction,\u201d HP said in its statement.  The move puts pressure on Xerox to open its books to HP. Xerox did not immediately respond on Sunday to a request for comment on whether it will engage with HP in negotiations as the potential acquisition target, rather than the acquirer.  HP on Sunday published Xerox CEO John Visentin\u2019s Nov. 5 offer letter to HP, in which he stated that his company was \u201cprepared to devote all necessary resources to finalize our due diligence on an accelerated basis.\u201d  The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox\u2019s board last year together with fellow billionaire businessman Darwin Deason, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has also amassed a 4% stake in HP.  Xerox had offered HP shareholders $22 per share that included $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox shares for each HP share, according to the Nov. 5 letter. The offer would have resulted in HP shareholders owning about 48% of the combined company. HP shares ended trading on Friday at $20.18.  Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.  Xerox scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year under pressure from Icahn and Deason.  Xerox announced earlier this month it would sell its 25% stake in the joint venture for $2.3 billion. Fujifilm also agreed to drop a lawsuit against Xerox, which it was pursuing following their failed merger.  TEST FOR NEW HP CEO  The negotiations with Xerox represent a major test for HP\u2019s new CEO, Enrique Lores, the former president of HP\u2019s imaging and printing business, who officially took over earlier this month.  HP is mindful of large acquisitions given its fateful deal for British software company Autonomy almost a decade ago. HP bought Autonomy for $11.1 billion in 2011 as the centerpiece of its unsuccessful pivot to software. Little over a year later, it wrote off $8.8 billion, $5 billion of which it put down to accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures.  More recently, HP has been struggling with its printer business segment recently, with the division\u2019s third-quarter revenue dropping 5% on-year. It has announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16% of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years.  Xerox\u2019s stock has rallied under Visentin, who took over last year as CEO. However, HP said on Sunday that a decline in Xerox\u2019s revenue since June 2018 from $10.2 billion to $9.2 \u201craises significant questions\u201d regarding the trajectory of Xerox\u2019s business and future prospects.","30":"(Corrects prior year figure in paragraph six to $40 million, or 14 cents per share)  May 2 (Reuters) - Xerox Corp, battling shareholder disapproval over its $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings , on Wednesday reported a 42.5 percent drop in quarterly profit partly due to a charge linked to its venture with the Japanese firm.  Xerox said on Tuesday its chief executive officer and most of its board will step down to settle a suit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, paving the way for new management to reconsider the contentious deal with Fujifilm.

That deal was scrapped under pressure from Icahn and Deason, and control was handed over to new management under Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, an Icahn aide.  \u201cWe remain focused on removing complexity in the way we work, organizing more effectively ... and we are seeing those efforts reflected in this quarter\u2019s results,\u201d Visentin said. \u201cWe are well positioned as we enter 2019.\u201d  The Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said it expected to report 2019 profit of between $3.70 and $3.80 per share on an adjusted basis, well above analysts\u2019 average expectation of $3.53, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Some analysts, however, pointed to a shortfall in Xerox\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue, which was $2.53 billion compared to consensus forecasts of $2.56 billion, asking whether cost-cutting alone can deliver its promised profits.  \u201cThe biggest question is how they will be able to mitigate revenue declines because the ability to reduce costs is finite and then to continue to grow EPS, they need to actually grow revenue,\u201d Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said.  Net income attributable to Xerox was $137 million, or 56 cents per share, compared to a loss of $190 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.14 per share, beating estimates of $1.04, helped by a 5 percent drop in total costs.","34":"Feb 13 (Reuters) - Xerox Corp:  * XEROX RESPONDS TO CARL ICAHN AND DARWIN DEASON OPEN LETTER  * XEROX CORP - BOARD OF CO HAS REVIEWED FEBRUARY 12, 2018 LETTER SIGNED BY CARL ICAHN AND DARWIN DEASON  * XEROX CORP - \u201cCOMBINATION OF XEROX AND FUJI XEROX WILL CREATE A STRONGER, MORE COMPETITIVE COMPANY WITH ENHANCED GROWTH PROSPECTS\u201d Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","35":"(The May 4 story was corrected to add a dropped part of the quote by Subramanian to show full context of his remark, in the third paragraph)  FILE PHOTO - Xerox chief executive officer, Jeff Jacobson (L), smiles as he stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., January 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp XRX.N on Friday appealed a New York court ruling to block its deal with Fujifilm Holdings 4901.T, just hours after the company announced that its ousted CEO and directors would remain in place.  Xerox said its entire board and management team would stay, as the agreement to oust them reached with dissenting shareholders Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn expired late Thursday.  \u201cWith the caveat that I have not been privy to these negotiations, I find the rejection of the settlement by the Xerox board to be extraordinary and highly unusual,\u201d said Guhan Subramanian, a professor at Harvard\u2019s law and business schools who served as an expert witness for Xerox in the litigation.  Officially, Xerox and the activists said the agreement had expired over last-minute issues that arose in negotiations with the judge overseeing the case that made the parties unable to finalize their settlement ahead of a self-imposed deadline Thursday evening.  A source familiar with the matter said Xerox\u2019s board let the settlement expire because it came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm. Xerox\u2019s board also took into account that the company\u2019s shares had fallen more than 10 percent since it announced its settlement with the activists.  The judge said in a hearing on May 3 that he was not prohibiting Xerox from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm, according to a court transcript.  In fact, Xerox has already started renegotiating its deal with Fujifilm, according to the source, who did not want to be identified because the matter is private. The companies are discussing adding $5 a share to the $2.5 billion special cash dividend of roughly $9.80 per share that Xerox shareholders would receive as part of the deal, the person said.  The two companies could also come up with a new structure all together, the person added. Fujifilm declined to comment on the negotiations on Friday, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.  Xerox shares closed little changed at $28.38 per share on Friday.  AMMUNITION FOR ACTIVISTS?  Xerox and Fujifilm agreed in late January to a $6.1 billion deal that would merge the U.S. printer and copier maker into Fuji Xerox, an existing joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm.  A New York court temporarily blocked the transaction last week, saying that Xerox Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson was \u201chopelessly conflicted\u201d and that he sought to conclude the deal even though he was advised to end negotiations.  In its appeal on Friday, Xerox disputed the court\u2019s findings that the board breached its fiduciary duties in approving the deal and said the board unanimously authorized the deal.  Meanwhile, Deason and Icahn, who own about 15 percent of the company, have vowed to keep fighting Xerox, and will nominate a slate of directors at the company\u2019s upcoming annual board meeting.  Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at University of Delaware, said the confusing turn of events at Xerox \u201cgive the activists more ammunition\u201d in a proxy fight.  Deason and Icahn have argued that Xerox\u2019s board acted in a self-interested fashion and failed shareholders by approving a deal that undervalues the company.  Xerox's board has also been exploring its options. Reuters previously reported that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has approached Xerox to express interest in a possible acquisition.  Fujifilm, which had objected to the settlement between Xerox and the activists, said it was satisfied that Xerox had not settled with the activists this week. Fujifilm is also planning to appeal last week\u2019s court order and said in a statement on Friday that Xerox shareholders should decide for themselves the merits of any deal.  But a deal under new terms between Fujifilm and Xerox is far from certain. Fujifilm shares have been falling since the deal announcement in late January as investors have been questioning the benefits of the deal.","36":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan\u2019s Fujifilm Holdings Corp has won an appeal in its legal battles with Xerox Corp, with a New York court overturning preliminary injunctions requested by an activist investor that had blocked their planned merger.  FILE PHOTO: Fujifilm Holdings' logos are pictured ahead of its news conference in Tokyo, Japan January 31, 2018. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  Xerox in May scrapped a $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also handed control of the U.S. photocopier giant to new management.  The ruling by the New York State Appellate Court could give the Japanese firm leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table. Fujifilm is also suing Xerox in a separate U.S. suit that seeks well over $1 billion, accusing it of breach of contract in abandoning the deal.  Its chances of success are, however, unclear as Xerox\u2019s new management, backed by Icahn and Deason, is opposed to the proposed merger. Analysts have said the only way for Fujifilm to gain any traction with Xerox now is to raise its offer.  Fujifilm said in a statement it stands by its view that the original planned merger remains the best option for the shareholders of both companies.  \u201c(The) Court\u2019s decision will allow us to discuss with Xerox the fulfillment of the original agreement. All Xerox shareholders ought to be able to decide for themselves the operational, financial, and strategic merits of the transaction to combine Fuji Xerox and Xerox,\u201d it said.  The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control. That prompted Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U.S. firm was being undervalued, to launch a proxy fight.  Representatives for Xerox, Deason and Icahn were not immediately available for comment.  The New York court found in its Oct. 16 ruling that Xerox\u2019s former CEO Jeff Jacobson, accused by Deason of negotiating the deal to save his own job, had neither misled or misinformed the board.  \u201cThe board, which engaged outside advisors and discussed the proposed transaction on numerous occasions prior to voting on agreeing to present it to the shareholders, did not engage in a mere post hoc review, nor was the transaction unreasonable on its face,\u201d the ruling also said.  The bitter legal wrangling has created much uncertainty for the two firms which are seen by many analysts as inextricably intertwined through their Fuji Xerox joint venture.  The venture accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm\u2019s revenue while Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox.  Xerox has said it would start sourcing products from new vendors for sale directly to customers in Fuji Xerox\u2019s primary Asia-Pacific market.  The U.S. firm is now led by John Visentin who worked as a consultant to Icahn in the proxy fight and just this month it appointed Louie Pastor, previously deputy general counsel at Icahn Enterprises, as general counsel.  Fujifilm Chief Executive Shigetaka Komori said in June the company was \u201cnot opposed to considering any new proposal from the new Xerox board\u201d but added many of its shareholders were demanding that its money would be better off spent on its healthcare businesses.  \u201cThe latest ruling is a step forward for Fujifilm to make the deal happen,\u201d said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan who believes Fujifilm should focus on healthcare. \u201cBut concerns remain about whether taking over Xerox is the right step for the company.\u201d  Fujifilm\u2019s shares were up 1.3 percent in afternoon trade, in line with the broader market.","37":"Oct 23 (Reuters) - Xerox Corp, engaged in a tense standoff with Fujifilm Holdings Corp over an aborted merger, reported a 5.8 percent drop in quarterly revenue on Tuesday, as corporates cut back spending on printers and photocopiers.

REUTERS\/Vasily Fedosenko  (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has approached Xerox Corp XRX.N to express interest in a possible acquisition, casting new uncertainty over the U.S. printer company's $6.1 billion sale to Japan's Fujifilm Holdings 4901.T, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.  The development marks the latest twist in Xerox\u2019s saga. On Tuesday, Xerox said its chief executive, Jeff Jacobson, and most of its board will step down to settle a lawsuit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.  Apollo's interest in Xerox has been reinforced by the appointment of John Visentin as the company's new CEO, the sources said. Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of Presidio Inc PSDO.O, two companies in which Apollo invested.  There is no certainty that Apollo\u2019s approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox, while the new board of the latter reviews it.  The sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo and Xerox declined to comment, while Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deason declined to comment while Icahn could not be reached for comment.  Xerox shares pared losses on news of Apollo\u2019s approach, and were down 5.8 percent at $30.42 on Wednesday afternoon after plunging as much as 8 percent on news of the outcome of Icahn and Deason\u2019s legal challenge. Xerox has a market capitalization of $7 billion.  As part of the settlement with Icahn and Deason announced on Tuesday, Xerox said its board of directors would meet immediately to begin evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including ending or restructuring Xerox\u2019s deal with Fujifilm.  Icahn and Deason had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox. A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been \u201chopelessly conflicted\u201d in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.  Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents.","41":"March 2 (Reuters) - Xerox Corp:  * XEROX - SENT LETTER TO DARWIN DEASON IN RESPONSE TO DEASON SEEKING A WAIVER TO NOMINATE DIRECTORS TO XEROX BOARD  * XEROX - CONCLUDED DEASON DOES NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO NOMINATE DIRECTORS TO SERVE AS MEMBERS OF XEROX BOARD OUTSIDE OF NOMINATION WINDOW - SEC FILING  * XEROX - CONCLUDED DEASON DOES NOT HAVE RIGHT TO A WAIVER OF XEROX\u2019S ADVANCE NOTICE BYLAW PROVISION Source text (bit.ly\/2CSIdCl) Further company coverage: (Reuters.Brief@thomsonreuters.com)","42":"Feb 20 (Reuters) -  * CARL ICAHN AND DARWIN DEASON RELEASE OPEN LETTER TO XEROX SHAREHOLDERS  * CARL ICAHN & DARWIN DEASON, IN LETTER TO XEROX SHAREHOLDERS, SAY THERE ARE \u201cVIABLE ALTERNATIVES\u201d TO PROPOSED FUJI SCHEME  * CARL ICAHN & DARWIN DEASON, IN LETTER TO XEROX SHAREHOLDERS, SAY BEST ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO CONSOLIDATE WITH OR SELL TO A COMPETITOR  * CARL ICAHN & DARWIN DEASON - \u201cWE SUSPECT THERE IS AT LEAST $500 MILLION IN COST CREEP THAT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY REPORTED\u201d BY XEROX  * CARL ICAHN & DARWIN DEASON - DIVERSIFYING AWAY FROM FUJI OVER TIME, AND BRINGING IN NEW MANAGEMENT WOULD BE BETTER FOR XEROX THAN CURRENT PROPOSED DEAL Source text: bit.ly\/2sJmqNL Further company coverage:","43":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Xerox company is seen on a building in Minsk, Belarus, March 21, 2016.

Xerox and Fujifilm are discussing increasing the financial consideration for Xerox shareholders, according to a separate source close to the situation.  Xerox declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Fujifilm confirmed the company had received a request for a renegotiation from Xerox.  Keegan was speaking as part of a court hearing connected to Xerox shareholder Darwin Deason\u2019s lawsuit, filed in March, to block Xerox\u2019s deal with Fujifilm and also nominate directors to Xerox\u2019s board.  Under the agreement announced in late January, Fujifilm would take over Xerox and combine the U.S. company into their existing joint venture to gain scale and cut costs as demand for office printing declines.  The deal is opposed by top Xerox shareholders Deason and activist investor Carl Icahn, who say that it unfairly favors Fujifilm.  In Deason\u2019s lawsuit, he argues that he has the right to nominate directors to Xerox\u2019s board despite missing a deadline because the current board had made significant decisions and disclosures to stockholders after the deadline for nominations.  Deason could not be reached for comment on Thursday.  Icahn also tweeted on Thursday in support of Deason\u2019s plan for Xerox to pursue alternatives to its deal with Fujifilm.

Baker and Ritsuko Ando  NEW YORK\/TOKYO, May 2 (Reuters) - Xerox Corp said its CEO and most of its board will step down to settle a suit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, handing over to new management which will reconsider a contentious deal with Fujifilm Holdings.  The move is a triumph for Icahn and Deason, who together hold 15 percent of Xerox. They had criticized the $6.1 billion deal to combine the U.S. printer and copier maker into Fuji Xerox, an existing joint venture with the Japanese company.  The two had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox. A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been \u201chopelessly conflicted\u201d in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.  \u201cWe believe Friday\u2019s decision and this agreement mark a watershed moment for corporate governance generally and for Xerox specifically,\u201d Icahn said in a statement.  In addition to Jacobson, six others of the 10-member board will be replaced by members backed by Icahn and Deason, while the two shareholders will withdraw their proxy fight as part of the settlement.  Fujifilm, which saw its shares drop 5.5 percent in Tokyo after news of the ouster, said it planned to file an objection with a court over the settlement.  It will also appeal last week\u2019s court ruling, it said in a statement, adding that Xerox\u2019s new board had an obligation to comply with agreements in January.  In a complex deal, Fuji Xerox would buy back Fujifilm\u2019s 75 percent stake in their joint venture before Fujifilm would then purchase 50.1 percent of new Xerox shares. Ultimately, Fujifilm would take control of Xerox, whose brand became synonymous with photocopying.  REEVALUATING PARTNERSHIP  Xerox said the new board will meet to reevaluate its joint venture deal with Fujifilm, including terminating its relationship with the company.  Keith Cozza, CEO of Icahn Enterprises, will become Xerox\u2019s chairman while John Visentin, who had previously led Novitex Enterprise Solutions, will become CEO.  Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist him in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents.  Xerox said it decided to settle given the risks and uncertainty of prolonged litigation. The settlement did not resolve the activists\u2019 claims against Fujifilm, which the shareholders have criticized for aiding previous Xerox management.  The Fuji Xerox joint venture, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm and 25 percent by Xerox, has struggled with slow demand for office photocopying products.  As more businesses go paperless, Fujifilm has looked elsewhere for growth, expanding in biotechnology and healthcare.  Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan, said Fujifilm\u2019s deal with Xerox was \u201cnot forward-looking\u201d anyway, and its resources would be better spent focusing on the new areas.  \u201cI think they might be better off putting their energies into the medical business,\u201d he said.  Shares in Xerox were flat in after-hours trading, giving the U.S. company a market value of about $8.2 billion.

Xerox shareholders were also due to receive a $2.5 billion special cash dividend.  The firms have not, however, disclosed a per share valuation for Xerox for the deal.  UBS analysts estimated in February that the deal valued Xerox at $40 a share - $9.80 in cash for every Xerox share held and calculated the stake in the proposed new Fuji Xerox to be worth $30. That value mostly matches the current demands of the activist shareholders, except they want it all in cash.  Shannon Cross from Cross Research said an incremental five dollars plus benefit from synergies from the Fuji-Xerox deal should result over time in a value for Xerox stock that would be above the $40 per share.  \u201cAt the end of the day, Carl Icahn has always wanted more money for this deal, I am not sure that running the business is what he looks to do,\u201d said Cross.  While some Tokyo-based analysts say Fujifilm would be better off putting its money into its non-copier and printer businesses, others argue that the Japanese firm, which relies on the joint venture for nearly half of its revenue, should cede to the activist shareholders\u2019 demands.  Xerox had at one stage reopened talks on the deal with Fujifilm but those discussions were suspended after Deason won a temporary court order blocking the deal. The judge said, however, that Xerox was not prohibited from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm.  Xerox said on Wednesday that it will pursue an appeal of the lower court\u2019s ruling in the Deason lawsuit, which it believes \u201cwas wrongly decided and will be reversed\u201d.  Fujifilm is also pursuing an appeal.  Shares of Xerox closed 1.6 percent higher at $28.96 on Wednesday.

A \u201ccrown jewel\u201d agreement is an offer to sell the stock or assets of a company to an investor most desirable to management - to prevent hostile takeovers.

For any of them to assert that these agreements were \u2018shrouded in mystery\u2019 is disingenuous, at best,\u201d the company said in a statement early on Tuesday, before the lawsuit was made public.  Deason also included former Xerox Chief Executive Ursula M. Burns in the lawsuit, saying she was chairman of Xerox between May 2010 and May 2017 and had full knowledge of the Fuji-Xerox joint venture agreements.  In a letter to shareholders, who still have to approve the deal, Xerox said that walking away from the joint venture would require it to completely rebuild its supply chain, which would be extremely expensive and take years to implement.

The decision hands victory in one of the biggest ongoing U.S. proxy fights to activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who say they can secure better offers for the company than the deal with Fujifilm.  Some Tokyo-based analysts warned a long renegotiation of price and terms as well as attempts to restructure the pair\u2019s existing joint venture could damage both companies.  \u201cThere is a large gap between our assessment and Xerox\u2019s largest investors\u2019 assessment of Xerox\u2019s value,\u201d said Ryosuke Katsura, senior analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.  \u201cWe think that it would be negative for both firms if a break-off in negotiations is followed by a protracted period of uncertainty.\u201d  Xerox shares fell 7.4 percent to $27.82, while Fujifilm shares rose 1.5 percent.  The share price decline shows that the scrapping of the deal will result in the loss of a $9.80 special dividend, said David Holt, analyst at CFRA research.  Holt also said there are potential interests from other competitors such as HP Inc.  \u201cWhen you put these two companies together, the value proposition looks attractive,\u201d Holt added.  Xerox and Fuji agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control. That prompted Icahn and Deason, who control 15 percent of the company, to demand changes to the board.  The settlement with the billionaire investors outlined by Xerox on Sunday puts the Japanese company further on the back foot in any new negotiations with Xerox, although a number of analysts have said Fujifilm is under no pressure to rush.  Xerox said it had repeatedly tried to convince Fujifilm to start talks on improved terms for buyout to no avail. Fujifilm said on Sunday it disputed Xerox\u2019s right to terminate the deal and would look at all options including legal action seeking damages.  Icahn and Deason have said they believe other investors are \u201cwaiting in the wings\u201d for Xerox, while people familiar with the matter have previously said that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC has expressed interest in a bid for Xerox.

Xerox, which has been exploring options including a sale of the company, was sued by Fujifilm for over $1 billion, seeking punitive damages and a $183 million merger termination fee.  The merger was announced in January and abandoned on May 13 when Xerox, in a settlement with shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, agreed to install new directors and replace the chief executive officer with Icahn-backed John Visentin.  Xerox also threatened to end its technology agreement with the 56-year-old joint venture Fuji Xerox, and said it would start sourcing products from new vendors to lower its dependency on Fujifilm. In response, the Japanese firm said it was ready to compete against Xerox in Asia-Pacific and challenge it in America and Europe if it failed to renew its agreement in 2021.  Fuji Xerox, 75 percent owned by Japan\u2019s Fujifilm and the rest by Xerox, handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe, as well as Fuji Xerox services in Asia.

But a dramatic decision in the Xerox case has spurred lawyers and academics to ask whether Delaware has become too deferential to corporate boards.  On Friday, Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager issued a preliminary injunction barring Xerox from holding a shareholder vote on the proposed Fuji merger at its annual meeting in June. After a two-day evidentiary hearing in which Justice Ostrager heard live testimony from eight witnesses, including Xerox\u2019s CEO and the chairman of its board, the judge concluded the Fuji deal was so tainted with conflict that it was likely the CEO and the board, abetted by Fuji, had breached their duty to Xerox shareholders. The judge also ruled that Xerox must allow activist shareholder Darwin Deason to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the meeting in June.  Ostrager blocked the deal even though a highly credentialed board unanimously approved the Fuji offer and no bidder has emerged with better terms than the complex, no-cash transaction Fuji proposed. Xerox\u2019s lawyers at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison had argued that the board\u2019s fully-informed approval, which came after 10 months of board-supervised negotiations and some heated internal debate, showed independent directors acting carefully to decide what\u2019s best for shareholders.  Justice Ostrager found that depiction to be not credible, adopting instead the account of events proffered by Deason\u2019s lawyers at King & Spalding and lead shareholder class action counsel from Grant & Eisenhofer and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. In their depiction, Xerox\u2019s CEO, Jeff Jacobson, was on the verge of losing his job under pressure from activist Carl Icahn, who, along with Deason, controls about 15 percent of Xerox shares. As Xerox\u2019s board was searched for Jacobson\u2019s replacement, Jacobson stepped up desultory talks with Fuji, a Xerox joint venture partner, proposing a deal structure that would minimize Fuji\u2019s cash outlay. Fuji executives, sensing an opportunity to take advantage of Jacobson\u2019s precarious state, promised to keep him in charge. And the board, despite some early opposition, went along with the deal because Fuji pledged to retain five Xerox directors after the merger.  The judge agreed Jacobson\u2019s priority in the Fuji deal was his own job \u2013 and the board didn\u2019t give enough weight to Jacobson\u2019s conflict. \u201cOnce Jacobson learned that he had been targeted for replacement by Xerox\u2019s largest shareholder and eventually the board itself, he abandoned the board\u2019s request to obtain a value-maximizing all-cash transaction and engineered the framework for a one-sided deal that includes Jacobson retaining his position as CEO post-transaction,\u201d wrote Justice Ostrager (who was formerly an ace corporate defense litigator at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett). \u201cThere is ample evidence that he collaborated with Fuji to make himself indispensable to the transaction.\u201d  One of the most damning documents, which Ostrager said would have been sufficient by itself to prove the board\u2019s likely breach of its fiduciary duty, was a text message, witnessed by board chairman Robert Keegan and another director, in which Jacobson told a high-ranking Fuji executive that he and Fuji were a \u201cteam\u201d aligned against Icahn, their \u201cmutual enemy.\u201d  From nearly the beginning of the litigation, said Deason lawyer Richard Marooney of K&S and shareholder class action lawyer James Sabella of G&E, Ostrager was determined to hear from Xerox witnesses, not just lawyers on both sides. Last month he set a punishing pre-trial schedule, including a pair of depositions in Japan of Fuji witnesses. \u201cHe did it right,\u201d said Marooney, who credited his firm\u2019s New York litigators for running at the judge\u2019s fast pace. He wanted to understand the facts, and not just on paper. He wanted to get to the truth.\u201d  That hearing probably wouldn\u2019t have happened, said shareholder lawyer Sabella, if this case had been litigated in Delaware. As recently as 2012, Delaware judges would, in rare instances, enjoin transactions. In 2011, Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster blocked a shareholder vote on a $3.5 billion leveraged buyout of Del Monte because of its financial advisor\u2019s alleged conflicts. The following year, Chancellor Leo Strine (now Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court) enjoined Martin Marietta\u2019s hostile tender offer for Vulcan Materials.  But in 2014\u2019s C&J Energy Services v. City of Miami General Employees\u2019 and Sanitation Employees\u2019 Retirement Trust, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed an injunction against C&J\u2019s merger with Nabors Industries. The state justices essentially said that when independent boards exercise their business judgment to approve strategic mergers \u2013 and give shareholders a right to vote on the deals \u2013 Chancery Court should not stand in the way, particularly if there\u2019s no competing bid for the company.  Since then, said Harvard law school professor Guhan Subramanian, the trajectory in Delaware Chancery Court has been away from scrutiny of deal processes. Subramanian, who was an expert witness for shareholders in the Xerox case, said he was impressed that, in contrast to Delaware courts in recent years, Justice Ostrager was willing \u201cto engage in a meaningful way\u201d with details of the deal.  Even if Delaware judges were deciding the Xerox case based on the record developed before Justice Ostrager, said Brooklyn Law professor Minor Myers, they might well have rejected shareholder attempts to block the deal. \u201cYou could easily image a Chancery judge, with all the factual findings, nevertheless saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to let shareholders vote,\u2019\u201d said Myers, who was not involved in the Xerox case but read Friday\u2019s ruling.  It\u2019s going to be interesting, said shareholder lawyer Sabella, to track whether shareholders who suspect deals were tainted by real conflicts try to find a way to bring their cases in New York after the Xerox decision. Xerox is incorporated in New York, so filing in state court in Manhattan was an easy call for its shareholders. But for shareholders of Delaware-incorporated companies headquartered in New York, \u201cthis decision is going to make New York a more attractive jurisdiction,\u201d Sabella said.  I emailed Xerox counsel Jay Cohen of Paul Weiss and Fuji lawyers Erik Olson and James Hough of Morrison & Foerster but didn\u2019t hear back. Xerox told Reuters on Friday that it will appeal Justice Ostrager\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe company strongly believes that its shareholders should be allowed to exercise their right to vote on the transaction and decide for themselves,\u201d Xerox said. \u201cThe Xerox board undertook a rigorous process to reach its decision to approve the proposed transaction, including a comprehensive review of the company\u2019s strategic and financial alternatives, as well as potential transaction structures in its negotiations with Fujifilm.\u201d","106":"NEW YORK\/ZURICH\/MUMBAI\/LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.

That pales next to the other impacts of the disease on Xerox\u2019s business. Clearly, demand for copiers and printers isn\u2019t what it was.

European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis on Tuesday unveiled some \u201cquick fixes\u201d to encourage banks to lend to virus-hit firms and households. They needn\u2019t set aside a shedload of capital when they grant borrowers a pandemic payment holiday, he said. Nor do they have to treat state-guaranteed credit as punitively as normal credit when provisioning for non-performing loans.  Yet he failed to allow sovereign debt to be excluded from the most basic calculation of balance-sheet strength, the leverage ratio. The Federal Reserve has given U.S. banks that concession until March 2021, effectively encouraging them to load up on Treasuries. Europe\u2019s restraint is laudable. European supervisors already allowed banks to breach their leverage ratios, so extra help would be overkill. Given Italian and Spanish bonds are riskier than U.S. Treasuries, which are the benchmark for the world, it\u2019s appropriate that banks have to account for that. (By Liam Proud)  EXCESS FOR EXOR. Of all the companies going into the Great Lockdown, the Agnelli family\u2019s investment vehicle should have been one of the least to worry about having enough cash. Exor in early March agreed to sell PartnerRe for $9 billion to French insurer Covea. And the pending merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles with Peugeot promised 5.5 billion euros of dividends to shareholders, of which Exor is the largest. So Exor\u2019s 500 million euro sale of 10-year bonds this week raised a few eyebrows.  But as with all best-laid plans, life gets in the way. Though Covea has signed on the dotted line, there are still a few formalities to be ironed out before the money arrives. And while the FCA-Peugeot deal makes even more industrial sense post-pandemic, the car industry\u2019s ructions will put big dividends off for some time. Grabbing some cash now makes sense \u2013 and to pay just 2.25% is arguably a show of strength. (By Rob Cox)  SELF-RELIANCE.

The only bright spot in Tuesday\u2019s statement is that the group\u2019s banks are being lenient. They have provided an extra 1.1 billion pounds through a revolving credit facility and relaxed or removed debt covenants until September 2021. That gives Rowe a little time to find a long-term fix for the struggling retailer. (By Aimee Donnellan)  CLEAR AS MUD. Wirecard\u2019s Chief Executive Markus Braun, also the German payments group\u2019s biggest shareholder with 7%, presumably hoped to reassure his fellow investors on Tuesday morning. The company said that an investigation by auditors KPMG had found no evidence of \u201cbalance sheet forgery\u201d, and that none of the four main areas of the report had turned up a reason to adjust its financial accounts between 2016 and 2018.  It\u2019s unlikely to put the matter to bed. KPMG\u2019s findings, published in German, are heavily caveated and cite a lack of willingness to cooperate on the part of Wirecard\u2019s third-party partners. Those businesses were central to allegations of suspect accounting made by the Financial Times, which Wirecard has always denied. Investors were hoping for a full rebuttal of the claims. A 15% share-price fall after the report\u2019s release suggests they\u2019re understandably disappointed.

The logo of Xerox company is seen on a building in Minsk, Belarus, March 21, 2016. REUTERS\/Vasily Fedosenko  The move is a triumph for Icahn and Deason, who together hold 15 percent of Xerox. They had criticized the $6.1 billion deal to combine the U.S. printer and copier maker into Fuji Xerox, an existing joint venture with the Japanese company.  The two had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox. A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been \u201chopelessly conflicted\u201d in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.  \u201cWe believe Friday\u2019s decision and this agreement mark a watershed moment for corporate governance generally and for Xerox specifically,\u201d Icahn said in a statement.  In addition to Jacobson, six others of the 10-member board will be replaced by members backed by Icahn and Deason, while the two shareholders will withdraw their proxy fight as part of the settlement.  Fujifilm, which saw its shares drop 5.5 percent in Tokyo after news of the ouster, said it planned to file an objection with a court over the settlement.  It will also appeal last week\u2019s court ruling, it said in a statement, adding that Xerox\u2019s new board had an obligation to comply with agreements in January.  In a complex deal, Fuji Xerox would buy back Fujifilm\u2019s 75 percent stake in their joint venture before Fujifilm would then purchase 50.1 percent of new Xerox shares. Ultimately, Fujifilm would take control of Xerox, whose brand became synonymous with photocopying.  REEVALUATING PARTNERSHIP  Xerox said the new board will meet to reevaluate its joint venture deal with Fujifilm, including terminating its relationship with the company.  Keith Cozza, CEO of Icahn Enterprises, will become Xerox\u2019s chairman while John Visentin, who had previously led Novitex Enterprise Solutions, will become CEO.  Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist him in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents.  Xerox said it decided to settle given the risks and uncertainty of prolonged litigation. The settlement did not resolve the activists\u2019 claims against Fujifilm, which the shareholders have criticized for aiding previous Xerox management.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Fuji Xerox joint venture, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm and 25 percent by Xerox, has struggled with slow demand for office photocopying products.  As more businesses go paperless, Fujifilm has looked elsewhere for growth, expanding in biotechnology and healthcare.  Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan, said Fujifilm\u2019s deal with Xerox was \u201cnot forward-looking\u201d anyway, and its resources would be better spent focusing on the new areas.  \u201cI think they might be better off putting their energies into the medical business,\u201d he said.  Shares in Xerox were flat in after-hours trading, giving the U.S. company a market value of about $8.2 billion.

Shares of the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company that have fallen about 9 percent this year so far, rose marginally in early trading on Tuesday.  Fujifilm, which was to take a majority stake in the combined company as part of the deal, has sued Xerox, winning an appeal last week giving the Japanese company leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table.  \u201cWe don\u2019t believe (the appeals court\u2019s ruling) means very much for Xerox, because Xerox terminated that transaction for reasons unrelated to the injunctions,\u201d said Visentin.

While some analysts say Fujifilm would be better off putting its money into its non-copier and printer businesses, others argue that the Japanese firm, which relies its joint venture with Xerox for nearly half of its revenue, should cede to the activist shareholders\u2019 demands.  \u201cIt\u2019s not cheap, for sure,\u201d said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. \u201cBut for Fujifilm, it\u2019s still better than a complete collapse of the deal, which could mess up Xerox in a major way. Fujifilm shouldn\u2019t waste this opportunity.\u201d  Icahn and Deason, who together own about 15 percent of Xerox, oppose a complex $6.1 billion deal that would give Fujifilm control of the U.S. copier and printer maker and values it at about $28 per share.

The letter also attacked Xerox\u2019s board for going back on an agreement to settle their dispute.  Xerox said in a statement that it has \u201crefrained from engaging with Icahn\/Deason on their campaign against the company, even as they have targeted our management and Board with personal, unsubstantiated attacks.\u201d The company also said that Icahn\u2019s comments to the Nikkei Tuesday that \u201ca combination of Xerox and Fuji Xerox creates a risk of bankruptcy is false and highly irresponsible.\u201d  Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has approached Xerox to express interest about a possible acquisition, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters.  Xerox will now have to wait until September before its appeal can be heard, according to a court filing on Monday.  Fujifilm said in a statement it believes it will win its own appeal to the injunction blocking the deal, adding that the current deal valuations were fair. A spokeswoman for the company said it was not in any talks to renegotiate the deal with Xerox but declined to comment further.  Fujifilm and Xerox have become heavily reliant on each other through their joint venture Fuji Xerox, and many analysts argue the two businesses are inextricably intertwined.  The venture, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm, is focused on Asia, the region with the highest growth potential. But it also handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe, and Fuji Xerox services in Asia.  Moreover, Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox, while Fuji Xerox is also seen as needing Xerox\u2019s brand power to boost its presence in China and other parts of Asia.  Xerox first agreed to a deal with Fujifilm in late January but then sought better terms at the behest of Icahn and Deason, who gained the court order last month to temporarily block the deal.  Granting the order, a New York judge agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been \u201chopelessly conflicted\u201d in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.  In a dramatic turn of events last week, Xerox agreed to fire Jacobson and part of its board to settle the litigation with Icahn and Deason. But it then said the agreement had expired over last-minute issues that arose in negotiations with the judge overseeing the case that made the parties unable to finalize their settlement.
