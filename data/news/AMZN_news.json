- Amazon.com Inc on Friday sued New York\u2019s attorney general to stop the state from filing its own lawsuit over the online retailer\u2019s early response to COVID-19, including its firing of activist Christian Smalls.  In a complaint in Brooklyn federal court, Amazon accused Attorney General Letitia James of overstepping her bounds by threatening to sue unless it met several demands including surrendering some profit and slowing down operations.  Amazon said federal labor and safety laws take precedence over New York\u2019s, and is seeking an injunction to block James from suing.  The Seattle-based retailer had drawn scrutiny 10 months ago when workers protested conditions at a Staten Island warehouse, and Amazon fired Smalls for violating a paid quarantine.  James said at the time that Amazon may have broken the law. New York City announced its own probe, and senators questioned Amazon\u2019s actions.  In a statement, James said she is still reviewing her legal options.  She called Amazon\u2019s lawsuit \u201ca sad attempt to distract from the facts and shirk accountability for its failures to protect hardworking employees from a deadly virus. Let me be clear: We will not be intimidated by anyone, especially corporate bullies that put profits over the health and safety of working people.\u201d  It is rare for companies to file preemptive lawsuits to short-circuit threatened regulatory actions.  The lawsuit shows Amazon\u2019s belief it was unfairly maligned despite its many COVID-19 precautions, most recently tests and plans for vaccine administration, and how it will not back down from criticism of its workplace conditions.  According to the lawsuit, Amazon passed an unannounced city inspection of its Staten Island facility on March 30, 2020, the day of the protest, with the lead inspector concluding that complaints about safety were \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d  Amazon also accused James of ignoring evidence of its safety-related reasons for acting against Smalls, including photos of him not social distancing.  Smalls has said he would keep protesting until workers were protected. In November, he filed a class action lawsuit seeking damages for Black and Hispanic workers.","1":"LOS ANGELES, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Grammy-winning R&B singer Lizzo on Thursday announced she had signed a deal to produce television programming for Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Studios.  Lizzo, speaking on a video call with reporters, provided few details but said she would \u201cshare amazing stories\u201d through the partnership with Amazon.

The opinion came from Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).  The Luxembourg-based court, which follows such non-binding recommendations in the majority of cases, would normally give a ruling in the next two to four months.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Amazon and Walmart's WMT.N Flipkart are facing mounting criticism from India's brick-and-mortar retailers, which accuse the U.S. giants of violating Indian law by racking up billions of dollars of losses to fund deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers. The companies deny the allegations.  Bezos said on Wednesday Amazon would invest $1 billion to bring small businesses online in the country, adding to the $5.5 billion the company had committed since 2014.  \u201cThey may have put in a billion dollars but then if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars,\u201d Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal told a security conference in New Delhi.  \u201cSo it\u2019s not as if they are doing a great favour to India when they invest a billion dollars.\u201d  Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.  Ahead of Bezos\u2019 visit, the Competition Commission of India launched a probe into Amazon and Flipkart to look at allegations of deep discounting and whether the companies discriminate against small sellers.  The allegations were \u201can area of concern for every Indian\u201d, Goyal said.  India only allows foreign e-commerce firms to operate marketplace platforms where third-parties sell goods to retail consumers. Small retailers say Amazon and Flipkart circumvent those rules by creating proxy sellers or vendors through which it offers deep discounts, allegations the companies deny.  Goyal welcomed Amazon\u2019s investment over recent years, but questioned whether the funds merely covered losses incurred through discounting.  MODI MEETING UNLIKELY  Amazon\u2019s marketplace unit in India reported a loss of 56.85 billion rupees ($802 million) in the fiscal year ending March 2019, the Economic Times reported in October, citing filings on India\u2019s Registrar of Companies. Reuters could not immediately access the filings.  \u201cHow can a marketplace make such a big loss, unless they are indulging in predatory pricing or some unfair trade practices? These are real questions that need answers,\u201d Goyal said.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was unlikely to meet Bezos during his visit despite repeated requests by the company in light of traders\u2019 concerns and the ongoing antitrust investigation, three sources told Reuters on Thursday.  Last year, India enforced new stringent rules for foreign investment in e-commerce which forced Amazon to rework its business structures and strained ties between New Delhi and Washington.","4":"MADRID, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. tech giant Amazon will raise fees for Spanish companies using its platform to sell their wares in response a digital tax imposed by the government, El Confidencial reported on Friday.

The S&P 500 last closed at a record high on Jan. 26, and a new peak would reassure investors who have worried in recent months that almost a decade of gains on Wall Street might be ending. After a 0.28 percent rise on Tuesday, the S&P 500 was up almost 7 percent in 2018.  A sharp rally in tech stocks has already helped the Nasdaq recover much faster than the broader markets from a sell-off in February, hitting a record high late last month.  \u201cWe might hit the record and blow through it. As long as there are still strong earnings and there are no corporate blowups, there\u2019s nothing that says we have to stop. Momentum can go on for a long time,\u201d said Liz Young, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York.  The financial sector rose 0.48 percent as higher yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note buoyed bank stocks.  \u201cFinancials really have been trading a lot with the bond market. To the extent that bond yields go higher, specifically on the 10-year Treasury note you seem to see rallies in financials,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon.com Inc is seen in Sao Paulo, Brazil October 17, 2017. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker\/File Photo  The talks concerning Casino's Via Varejo SA VVAR3.SA unit, which includes Brazil's third-largest e-commerce operation and more than 900 stores in the country, would accelerate Amazon's previously tepid advances into Latin America's largest market.  The negotiation comes as the U.S. e-commerce leader and Casino have struck an agreement to sell groceries from the French group\u2019s upmarket Monoprix through Amazon.  The Brazil deal, a more complex negotiation that has been discussed alongside the French partnership since January, could be structured using the same model or as an outright sale of Via Varejo, the source said.  News of the talks sent shares of GPA SA PCAR4.SA, Casino's Brazilian supermarket chain that owns Via Varejo, as much as 5.5 percent higher in Sao Paulo trading. Units of Via Varejo, which blend preferred and common stock, also rose up to 5.5 percent.  Via Varejo and Amazon representatives in Brazil declined to comment. Casino and GPA reiterated that they put a controlling stake in Via Varejo up for sale in October 2016, adding that the sale process is underway and there is no news to report at the moment. Casino also denied any partnership involving Via Varejo.  Via Varejo attracted little initial interest in 2016 as its then-traditional infrastructure kept costs high and hurt its bottom line. It has since expanded its e-commerce operations and turned a profit in four of the last five quarters.  Amazon has waded slowly into Brazil\u2019s complex and highly competitive online retail market, starting with e-book sales in 2012, adding physical books two years later and offering third-party sales of electronics in October.  Reuters reported in recent months that the world\u2019s largest online retailer has been preparing to ramp up its Brazilian presence, courting local suppliers of appliances and electronics and eyeing a large warehouse outside of Sao Paulo.  JPMorgan analysts told clients that a Via Varejo deal could be \u201ca potential shortcut for Amazon expansion in Brazil, particularly by providing fulfillment capabilities that have been a key issue.\u201d Via Varejo has some 26 distribution centers throughout Brazil.  Shares of Brazilian e-commerce rivals B2W Cia Digital BTOW3.SA and Magazine Luiza SA MGLU3.SA both fell around 3 percent on news of Amazon's talks with Casino.  GPA and Via Varejo have sharpened their focus on e-commerce in recent weeks, replacing the chief executives of both companies in a move that will take effect in April.  In February, GPA said it would replace its CEO with Peter Paul Estermann, the current head of Via Varejo, who is credited with the electronics retailer\u2019s digitally focused turnaround.  The top job at Via Varejo will go to Flavio Dias, who leads the company\u2019s online division and has been described by the company as an e-commerce pioneer in Brazil.","13":"May 28 (Reuters) - MacKenzie Bezos, the former wife of Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, pledged on Tuesday to give away half her fortune to charity, following a movement founded by billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates.

The two companies described the investment announced on Monday as one piece of a broader partnership that will include the promotion of JD.com products on Google\u2019s shopping service. This could help JD.com expand beyond its base in China and Southeast Asia and establish a meaningful presence in U.S. and European markets.  JD.com\u2019s U.S.-listed shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $43.76 on Nasdaq.  Company officials said the agreement initially would not involve any major new Google initiatives in China, where the company\u2019s main services are blocked over its refusal to censor search results in line with local laws.  JD.com\u2019s investors include Chinese social media powerhouse Tencent Holdings Ltd, the arch-rival of Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and Walmart Inc.  The partnership not only lets Google bolster its retail ambitions in China but also allows it to further tighten its relationship with Walmart. Together, the two companies could challenge the dominance of Amazon and Alibaba in key markets around the world, analysts said.  In the past year, Google has partnered with Walmart on multiple fronts. In August 2017, the two companies joined forces to offer hundreds of thousands of Walmart items on Google's voice-controlled Google Assistant platform to counter the dominance of Amazon in the voice shopping market.

Google is also reportedly pursuing picking up a stake in India\u2019s Flipkart, where Walmart picked up a 77 percent stake for $16 billion.  Google declined to comment on the rumored Flipkart deal.  STEPPING UP INVESTMENTS IN ASIA  Google is stepping up its investments across Asia, where a rapidly growing middle class and a lack of infrastructure in retail, finance and other areas have made it a battleground for U.S. and Chinese internet heavyweights. Google recently took a stake in Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek.  The JD.com investment is being made by the operating unit of Google rather than one of parent company Alphabet\u2019s investment vehicles.  Google will get 27.1 million newly issued JD.com Class A ordinary shares as part of the deal. This will give them less than a 1 percent stake in JD, a spokesman for JD said.  For JD.com, the Google deal shows its determination to build a set of global alliances as it seeks to counter Alibaba, which has been more focused on forging domestic retail tie-ups. Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, which is making big internet investments around the globe, is a major investor in Alibaba.  Morningstar analyst Chelsey Tam said the investment will help JD.com expand into developed markets such as the United States and Europe, where it has lesser exposure compared to Google.  \u201cThis partnership with Google opens up a broad range of possibilities to offer a superior retail experience to consumers throughout the world,\u201d said Jianwen Liao, JD.com\u2019s chief strategy officer, in a statement.

That\u2019s not the case at Dignity, the UK provider of burial and cremation services, which scrapped its full-year outlook on Monday and said that operating profit had fallen 11% to 19.4 million pounds in the first quarter. The decline was largely due to customers looking for cheap funerals and eschewing luxury add-ons like polished, satin-finished coffins.  Investors should brace for more bad news. Even though the spike in the UK death rate means more funerals, government guidelines on social gatherings mean Dignity has stopped offering more expensive items like church services and limousines. And extra deaths in 2020 probably mean fewer burials in 2021 and 2022. None of this will help Dignity\u2019s share price, which is down nearly 60% since the beginning of the year.

To boost online payments, Amazon launched its Amazon Pay digital wallet in 2016. It has since introduced a credit card, signed up to a state-backed payments network, and processes payments for movie and flight tickets as well as telephone and utility bills.  It began offering auto insurance in July and gold investment products in August - both a first for Amazon.  Its U.S. fin-tech efforts have been modest by comparison, stymied in part by merchant reluctance to use services offered by their biggest retail rival.  In India, however, where it has over 100 million registered users, Amazon is better placed to use financial services to win subscribers to its annual $13 Prime plan which offers faster shipping and music and video streaming, tech executives said.  To that end, the company aspires to make Amazon Pay the country\u2019s payment method of choice, said Mahendra Nerurkar, head of Amazon Pay in India, which has signed up 4 million merchants.  \u201cApparently Chinese fashion designers are leaving the back pockets off jeans because no one uses them anymore (for wallets),\u201d Nerurkar told Reuters. \u201cWe would love to make that happen in India.\u201d  India\u2019s digital payment market is set to more than double in value to $135 billion by 2023 from 2019, showed a study by professional services firm PwC and Indian lobby group ASSOCHAM.  THIN-MARGIN BUSINESS  A ban on high-value currency notes in late 2016 amplified a digital payment drive in India, with Amazon joined in the sphere by Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, Walmart Inc's WMT.N PhonePe, and Paytm, backed by SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T.  Later prospective entrants have faced tougher regulatory scrutiny. Facebook Inc's FB.O WhatsApp, which boasts over 400 million users in India, has been awaiting approval to offer payment services for over two years as regulators wrestle with new data-localisation rules.  Yet for incumbents, profit has been elusive. Paytm, also backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N, has booked losses running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. PhonePe has said it hopes to turn profitable by 2022.  Indeed, profit margins in the digital payments business are generally thin, so to make money, Amazon may have to rely on services such as lending and insurance, industry watchers said.  \u201cIt is likely that the next step for Amazon would be to distribute exchange-traded funds and mutual funds,\u201d said Niren Shah, India head of Silicon Valley firm Norwest Venture Partners.  Others said Amazon\u2019s sheer muscle does not necessarily mean it can succeed in a market as huge and complex as India.  \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy to win over the Indian fin-tech market,\u201d said a person who declined to be identified due to a business relationship with Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s competitive and varied, so it\u2019s going to be a slow process.\u201d","21":"FILE PHOTO: A man works on a tent for NXP Semiconductors in preparation for the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) at Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada January 4, 2015.

Amazon sued in 2015 to block companies that were writing fake reviews and then selling them to retailers on the site looking to boost their products\u2019 sales.  The senators said the lack of information on how Amazon determines which products receive the badge has led them to question whether Amazon is using it to \u201cpromote its own products over competitors\u2019 products, potentially disadvantaging smaller sellers on the platform.\u201d  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The senators requested a \u201cdetailed explanation of the process\u201d that Amazon uses to determine which products are deemed as Amazon\u2019s Choice and if the retailer uses an algorithm to do so. They also asked if Amazon employees personally review the products to \u201censure they meet a certain quality threshold.\u201d  Amazon has been criticized for its power over third-party sellers on its site, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private-label sales by Amazon\u2019s own brands.

Shares rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trade. The report may come as a relief to investors in the U.S. technology sector, still reeling from a profit warning by Facebook Inc Wednesday that plunged its stock 19 percent.  Amazon\u2019s report shows how the world\u2019s largest online retailer has increasingly learned to compensate for the high costs of fast package delivery and video streaming, which it has marketed around the globe to huge success. It was the first mover in the business of selling data storage and computing power in the cloud, a bet that continues to pay dividends and give it the leeway to invest in grand projects.  For instance, the company is working to ship food from Whole Foods Market stores across the United States, in an ambitious attempt to bring groceries into the age of online retail.  Amazon\u2019s spending typically climbs in the summer quarter, pressuring profits as the company prepares for Christmas and the winter holidays, its peak sales period each year.  Yet the company said it expects an operating profit between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, up from $347 million a year earlier. Amazon does not forecast net income, but analysts were expecting an $843 million profit in the third quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company also reported a second-quarter profit of $2.5 billion, its largest ever.  \u201cA big contributor to the quarter and the last few quarters obviously has been strong growth in our highest profitability businesses and also advertising,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call with media. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a greater-than-expected efficiency in a lot of our spend in things like warehouses, data centers, marketing.\u201d  The Seattle-based company cut hundreds of consumer jobs in its headquarters earlier this year, in a move that may have lowered costs and freed up resources for fast-growing areas like Amazon\u2019s voice aide Alexa.  \u201cHow can we move people to some of our new investments areas?\u201d Olsavsky said as an example of Amazon\u2019s focus on efficiency.  Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter called the expansion in the company\u2019s gross profit margin \u201cremarkable,\u201d citing impressive results from cloud sales and services to third-party merchants on Amazon.  \u201cThat drove the bulk of the earnings beat,\u201d he said.  CFO Olsavsky noted that third-party sales were changing the profit equation for Amazon, too. The company for years was notorious for roller-coaster results.  More lucrative than sales of goods that Amazon owns, third-party transactions offer the company a commission that increases significantly when merchants choose to hand over fulfillment and advertising to Amazon, as many do. Half of all units sold through Amazon are from these sellers, and these sales keep growing.  SHOPPING BLITZ  Highly profitable ad sales were a bright spot last quarter. The company said revenue from the category and some other items grew 132 percent to $2.2 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\u2019s profit center, posted a 49 percent rise in sales to $6.1 billion, also beating the average estimate of $6 billion.  These key businesses, along with a July event that the company created to drum up sales during the summer shopping lulls, are helping Amazon overcome high costs in the third quarter.  During the event, called Prime Day, popular brands now agree to put their inventory on sale for members of Amazon\u2019s loyalty club Prime, while rival retailers scramble to drive traffic back to their websites.  This year, Amazon said the July event saw Prime members purchase more than 100 million products. The company said it now expects third-quarter sales of between $54 billion and $57.5 billion, up from $43.7 billion a year earlier.  Even more crucially, more people joined Prime on July 16 than on any previous day in the company\u2019s history, Amazon said.  Prime includes fast shipping and video streaming for $119 per year in the United States and is the cornerstone of Amazon\u2019s strategy. Its more than 100 million members globally spend above average amounts on Amazon, to get the most out of their subscriptions.  Hiking the annual U.S. price of Prime 20 percent during the second quarter showed few signs of discouraging sign-ups: the company said subscription revenue increased 57 percent to $3.4 billion.  Total net sales for the second quarter rose 39 percent to $52.89 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $53.40 billion.","38":"June 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has agreed to pay over $1 billion to buy self-driving startup Zoox Inc, the Information reported on Thursday, citing sources, in a move that would expand the e-commerce giant\u2019s reach in autonomous-vehicle technology.

Amazon bought grocery chain Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion last year, and expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred France\u2019s top retail companies to improve their own online offerings.  The Fevad federation said on Thursday that some 37.4 million people made online purchases in the quarter, an increase of 893,000 from a year ago.  Sales generated on web-based marketplaces rose 12 percent, while sales via tablets and smartphones rose 25 percent.  The average value of the basket fell 4.5 percent to 65 euros in the first quarter, albeit with an increase in the frequency of purchases, added Fevad.  There were, on average, 10.7 online transactions per buyer in the first quarter, up from 9.4 in the year-ago quarter.  Three of the most visited e-commerce websites in France are Amazon, CDiscount which is owned by French retailer Casino , and book and CD retail chain Fnac Darty.  In 2017, E-commerce represented 8.7 per cent of overall French retail sales, up from 7.7 per cent in 2016.  In February, Fevad said online retail sales in France could exceed 90 billion euros for 2018 and 100 billion euros in 2019.  BUYING FOOD ONLINE  A separate survey of 2,000 web users conducted from April 12 to April 23 by Fevad and Mediametrie also showed that 47 percent of those polled had already purchased one food item online.  Some 54 percent of those purchasing food online shopped at least once a month online and 28 percent at least twice a month.  Drive-through services - where consumers order online but collect the shopping by car - and home delivery made 42 percent and 34 percent, respectively, of the delivery modes chosen for food purchased online, with the average order worth 80 euros.  Amazon has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its global ambitions to expand into food retail.

For the first quarter, eBay expects revenue of between $2.55 billion and $2.60 billion, while analysts were expecting $2.64 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  However, the company\u2019s revenue of $2.82 billion in the fourth quarter came in above analysts\u2019 expectation of $2.81 billion.

EBay said active buyers grew 2% to 183 million in the quarter from a year earlier, but they remained unchanged from the third quarter.

Amazon\u2019s video budget ballooned to an estimated $4.5 billion or more in 2017, and the company has said it plans to spend more this year. It is seeking content that can attract viewers to its Prime streaming and shopping service around the world.  Salke\u2019s biggest task may be managing Amazon\u2019s blockbuster bet on a television prequel to \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d a leap away from the niche content the studio was used to producing. People familiar with the matter say the studio offered $250 million for the fantasy series\u2019 rights alone last year.

The launch of conglomerate Reliance\u2019s telecoms venture Jio in 2016 began an era of cheap data tariffs in India, aiding the growth of video and audio streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon\u2019s Prime Video.  That in turn created a market for streaming devices such as the Fire stick.  Seattle-based Amazon\u2019s move to make the device in India coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s push to make the country a hub for electronics manufacturing to compete with the likes of China and Taiwan.  New Delhi\u2019s local manufacturing drive has persuaded iPhone makers Foxconn and Wistron to expand in India. Pegatron, another big contract manufacturer, has also set up base in the country.

FILE PHOTO: Conveyors are seen at a Walmart Stores Inc distribution centers in Bentonville, Arkansas June 6, 2013. REUTERS\/Rick Wilking\/File Photo  On April 25, Amazon said it plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club Prime in just one day and expects to spend $800 million toward the shipping goal in the second quarter alone.  Walmart\u2019s offer applies to fewer products. As many as 220,000 items, which are the most frequently purchased, ranging from laundry detergent to toys and electronics will qualify for one-day shipping. The orders have to be worth at least $35 to qualify.  The Walmart deal will be available to online shoppers in Phoenix and Las Vegas and then expand to Southern California in the coming days, the head of its U.S. ecommerce service, Marc Lore, told Reuters in an interview.  The service will be rolled out gradually, with a plan to reach approximately 75% of the U.S. population this year, which includes 40 of the top 50 U.S. metro areas, Lore said.  One-day shipping marks the latest salvo in a fight between two retailers that have consistently tried to outdo each other in everything from online order delivery to grabbing a bigger share of the online grocery market.  Walmart started offering same-day pickup in its stores in 2011 and caught up with Amazon\u2019s two-day free shipping two years ago by offering it without a membership fee. It has made progress in closing the gap with its e-commerce rival by rolling out services such as curbside grocery pickup and same-day grocery delivery - options that have quickly become popular with shoppers.  Amazon, on the other hand, has hastened to reproduce the assets of brick-and-mortar rivals such as Walmart and has a mixed record with those projects. It is now racing to open shops with top-selling items ranging from books to cell phones; rolling out same-day curbside grocery pickup and gearing up to accept returns at all U.S. Kohls Corp department stores.  \u201cWe have been working on this since I have gotten here...we have been building out the infrastructure for the last few years to support this,\u201d said Lore, who joined the retailer in 2016 when it acquired his company, Jet.com.  The vast majority of the order volume for such a service comes from the \u201cfirst couple of hundred thousand\u201d products, he said.  The move will cost Walmart less as orders will be delivered from warehouses closer to the customer and arrive in a single box instead of multiple packages, Lore said.  \u201cIt is counter-intuitive... but the way we have structured our network, we will see improved profitability as a result of lower shipping cost,\u201d he said.  Walmart sends out boxes from multiple warehouses around the country under its two-day shipping program, but with one-day shipping, it is stocking inventory in the closest single warehouse to the shopper, Lore said.  In a note on Monday, investment bank UBS anticipated a move to one-day shipping from brick-and-mortar retailers and estimated the price tag.  \u201cThe bottom line is that these costs are pretty manageable,\u201d the note says.  Walmart will put down $215 million of incremental investment. The U.S. business could see a drag on operating margins of 5 basis points on an annualized basis and 3 basis points for Walmart overall over a similar period if they follow Amazon\u2019s one-day shipping offer, the note says.  Lore told Reuters the math in the note was not accurate.  He also said the recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports will not hurt demand as most are best-sellers and popular items that shoppers will keep buying even if prices rise.","47":"BRUSSELS, April 26 (Reuters) - EU lawmakers and member states on Thursday struck a deal that will allow countries to force online streaming services including Netflix and Amazon\u2019s video service to help fund the production of European films and TV shows.

Amazon has said it will spend more than $5 billion and create up to 50,000 jobs in the city it chooses for its second headquarters, to be announced this year.  Seattle City Council in April proposed a tax plan affecting the city\u2019s roughly 500 largest businesses.  The proposal, an employee hours tax that would transition to a payroll tax in 2021, would generate $75 million per year for Seattle, most of which would go to building affordable housing.

FILE PHOTO: Broadcom Limited company logo is pictured on an office building in Rancho Bernardo, California May 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/Files  Looser US tax rules could produce a record year for M&A deals. About US$120bn of M&A loans have been completed or are in process so far this year, including a record US$100bn loan backing Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for rival Qualcomm.  This compares with US$203bn of loans completed in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.  In a bid to fight off Broadcom, Qualcomm increased its own bid to buy NXP Semiconductors to US$44bn and said that it intended to fund the additional consideration with cash and new debt.  In an eventful week, Broadcom also reduced its bid for Qualcomm to US$117bn from US$121bn, after objecting to Qualcomm\u2019s NXP bid.  Broadcom\u2019s record loan, which has required the biggest-ever bank commitments of more than US$10bn each from some lenders, has been receiving a positive response from lenders undaunted by its size.  \u201cThe Broadcom\/Qualcomm deal shows that you can raise US$100bn pretty easily, and banks are clamoring to get in,\u201d a senior banker said.  Another jumbo multibillion dollar loan is looming for drugstore operator Walgreens to back its potential purchase of drug distributor AmerisourceBergen to boost its 26% stake. General Mills\u2019 US$8bn acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products is also backed by a bridge loan provided by Goldman Sachs.  \u201cDeals beget deals,\u201d the senior banker said. \u201cTo me, the single biggest change is that you\u2019ve got clarity on tax and regulatory rules.\u201d  M&A deals backing Wyndham Worldwide Corp\u2019s purchase of La Quinta Holdings\u2019 hotel operations and Hubbell\u2019s acquisition of Aclara Technologies have already been completed this year.  The swelling pipeline also includes large financings backing the merger of beverage companies Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Keurig Green Mountain as well as Energizer Holdings\u2019 buy of Spectrum Brands\u2019 battery and portable lighting business.  SLOW GOING  M&A activity was muted in 2017 due to uncertainty about whether the Trump administration could push through the biggest overhaul of the US tax system in more than 30 years, but the bill was signed in late December.  The US corporate tax rate was cut to 21% from 35%, which helps to boost profits and better position some companies to pull the trigger on takeovers.  \u201cThere was uncertainty around tax at the end of the year, which made it hard to do a large deal, but now that there\u2019s clarity, some of that pent up demand for assets is going to come out,\u201d said another senior banker. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty broad-based: healthcare, pharma, tech, industrials.\u201d  Fear of online retailer Amazon is also driving consolidation that is reshaping entire sectors, spurred by the giant retailer\u2019s acquisition of upscale grocer Whole Foods Market last year.  \u201cAmazon comes in and buys Whole Foods, and suddenly all hell breaks loose in grocery retail and everyone has to respond,\u201d the first senior banker said. \u201cThere\u2019s now Walgreens with AmerisourceBergen, seeking scale to compete with Amazon, which wants to get into the drug delivery chain.

While some companies are accelerating growth by making acquisitions, others, including General Electric and Honeywell International, will be shedding businesses to streamline and enhance profits.  Those spinoffs will also create demand for loans to support the new entities, helping to boost income earned from arranging the funding.  Lenders of the US$100bn in loans for Broadcom\u2019s proposed purchase of Qualcomm stand to pull in as much as US$300m to US$400m from upfront arrangement fees, according to Freeman Consulting Services.  If the US$31bn bridge-to-bond portion is replaced by bonds, there could be an added US$150m to US$200m earned on underwriting.

The move by competition chief Margrethe Vestager, the latest European salvo against U.S. tech giants, comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified Amazon\u2019s role in the global economy, with online sales soaring in lockdowns.  The European Commission has been investigating Amazon\u2019s position as both a marketplace for merchants and a rival seller, while the firm also faces scrutiny in the United States over its alleged mistreatment of sellers, as well as its dual role.  The EU regulator looked into how Amazon collects data on competitors that sell on its platform, offering everything from electronics and toys to food and kitchenware. It says that Amazon uses that sensitive information, which shows what is proving popular or not, to better target its own products.  \u201cThe use of these data allows Amazon to focus on the sale of the best-selling products and it marginalises third-party sellers and caps their ability to grow,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Vestager told a news conference.  Vestager, who has a reputation of being one of the world\u2019s toughest antitrust enforcers, said that regulators had to ensure that dual-role platforms with market power, such as Amazon, did not distort competition.  Amazon disagreed with the EU assertions.  \u201cAmazon represents less than 1% of the global retail market, and there are larger retailers in every country in which we operate,\u201d the company said.  A U.S. Congressional antitrust report earlier this year into the alleged abuse of market power by Amazon also raised the concerns highlighted by the EU and is likely to influence the case U.S. regulators bring against the company.  U.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and the top antitrust lawmaker in the House, applauded the EU and urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commision to take similar action.  \u201cAs we found as part of a 16-month bipartisan investigation, Amazon has monopoly power over sellers on its platform,\u201d Cicilline said.  The EU charges are the latest example of how watchdogs around the world, led by Europe, are grappling with the challenges of regulating Big Tech, companies that have achieved dominance in their fields and vast troves of user data.  On Vestager\u2019s watch, the EU has imposed large fines on Alphabet\u2019s Google and other companies. See FACTBOX:  FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  A final EU decision could come next year. Amazon faces being fined up to 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching antitrust rules. However it can avoid a hefty penalty and a finding of wrongdoing by offering concessions to settle.  NEW INVESTIGATION  The EU competition enforcer has been investigating Amazon since July last year after rival traders voiced their grievances. The regulator said the charges related to Amazon\u2019s activities in France and Germany, its two biggest markets in Europe and where it is the dominant player.  The case focuses on its use of merchant data on its platform. Vestager said her officials had trawled 80 million transactions and reviewed 100 million products on Amazon\u2019s platform to put the case together.  The European Commission also opened a new investigation into Amazon on Tuesday, over the possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon\u2019s logistics and delivery services.  That probe will look into the possible preferential treatment of Amazon\u2019s own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon\u2019s logistics and delivery services.  Regulators will investigate the criteria the company uses to select winners of its \u201cbuy box\u201d, which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.  \u201cIts rules should not artificially favour Amazon\u2019s own retail offers or advantage the offers of retailers using Amazon\u2019s logistics and delivery services,\u201d Vestager said, citing the importance of e-commerce, an area which has gained importance with the COVID-19 pandemic.","53":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has launched its signature delivery business for third-party sellers in Australia, the company said in Sydney on Tuesday, marking the latest phase of its expansion on the continent.

That impacted global stocks, in turn fuelling bids for safer assets and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields dropped to a near two-month low of 2.71 percent on Monday.  On Tuesday, German 10-year government bond yields briefly dropped to 0.48 percent, close to a 2-1\/2 month low of 0.473 percent hit last week.  While economic news in the single currency bloc has continued to be positive this year, it is no longer surprising on the upside as it was through 2017.  So any failure to meet expectations could drive further interest in bonds as investors ratchet back expectations for rate hikes from the European Central Bank.  \u201cIt will be interesting to see which way the data goes ahead of euro zone inflation numbers tomorrow,\u201d said Lenk of DZ Bank.","57":"(Reuters) - Two shareholders in self-driving car startup Zoox Inc have sued the company, alleging that a rival bid would have been better for common stockholders than a $1.3 billion offer from Amazon.com AMZN.O announced in June.  The lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery filed August 18 but publicly released on Wednesday alleges that the Amazon deal created disproportionate rewards for executives and investors holding preferred shares at the expense of common stockholders.  Reuters reported last month that Amazon planned to create $100 million in restricted stock awards to retain Zoox\u2019s employees alongside a $125 million cash \u201ctransaction bonus pool\u201d paid out in proportion to shares for current employees.  In the complaint, James Wei and Yanxin Zhang, two former employees who are common stockholders, alleged that those rewards \u201cdwarfed\u201d the proceeds that will be available to common stockholders, including employees who put in years at the company but left before May 2020. Zoox was founded in 2014.  The two allege that a competing offer to purchase Zoox made after the company had signed an exclusivity agreement to negotiate with Amazon but before the two had reached a deal was \u201cactually more favorable to Zoox common stockholders than the (Amazon) Acquisition\u201d because of how much of the deal was diverted to executive bonuses and other compensation.  Reuters previously reported that Cruise, the self-driving company backed in part by General Motors Co GM.N, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, had stepped in to make a $1.05 billion offer to purchase Zoox.  Wei and Zhang are asking the court to order Zoox to open its books \u201cin order to determine whether it is appropriate to pursue litigation against all or some members of the Board and\/or Company management or others based on the apparent wrongdoing in connection with the Acquisition.\u201d  Zoox, Wei and Zhang did not immediately return requests for comment.","58":"NEW DELHI\/BENGALURU (Reuters) - An Indian antitrust investigation of Amazon.com Inc and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart has been put on hold by a court, three lawyers involved in the proceedings told Reuters on Friday.

Chinnappa\/File Photo  Amazon this week challenged the investigation in a court in Bengaluru and the court has granted a stay of two months, according to a lawyer from P&A Law Offices representing Amazon and two other legal counsels involved in the matter.  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) last month ordered a probe into Amazon and Flipkart over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices.  \u201cThis comes as a major relief,\u201d said the Amazon counsel, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.  The CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The CCI ordered its probe after a New Delhi-based trader group complained that the e-commerce giants were promoting select sellers and in turn hurting business for other smaller players.  Over three days of hearings in the Bengaluru court, Amazon denied the allegations and argued that CCI did not have sufficient evidence to order the probe.  A lawyer for the Indian trader group, Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, said he would appeal against the court\u2019s decision to put the investigation on hold.  Amazon and Flipkart have faced mounting criticism from Indian retailers which accuse them of violating local laws by racking up billions of dollars of losses to fund deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers.  The companies deny the allegations.  Last month, the trade minister said Amazon wasn\u2019t doing India any \u201cgreat favor\u201d by announcing $1 billion in investment, laying bare the tensions with the U.S. online retailer.","59":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is looking into whether hefty discounts offered on Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.com during their online festive sales violate foreign investment rules, a commerce ministry official told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/Illustration\/File Photo  India introduced new rules in February aimed at protecting the 130 million people dependent on small-scale retail by deterring big online discounts. The rules forced e-commerce firms to tweak their business structures and drew criticism from the United States, straining trade ties between New Delhi and Washington.  While Amazon and Flipkart say they\u2019ve complied with the federal rules, local trader groups say the two companies are violating them by burning money to offer discounts - of more than 50% in some cases - during the ongoing festive sales.  Reuters reviewed emails and internal training material from Flipkart showing the company is in some cases offering to reduce, or forfeit, its sales commission from sellers that offer discounts.  The commerce ministry official told Reuters the government was reviewing complaints and evidence filed by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a group representing some 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers, alleging Amazon and Flipkart were violating the foreign investment rules.  The official declined to comment on possible action, but executives from Amazon and Flipkart were summoned to meet commerce ministry officials last week to discuss the matter.  Flipkart in a statement said it had a \u201cgood meeting\u201d with government officials and it was \u201cdeeply committed to doing business the right way in India\u201d.  Amazon said it had an \u201copen & transparent discussion\u201d with officials and has a high bar for compliance.  Seeking to attract shoppers around the key Hindu festival of Diwali, both retailers have placed full-page advertisements in top national daily the Times of India to showcase discount offerings stretching from Samsung and Apple phones to clothing and diapers.  \u201cCustomers are going online because of the unbelievable discounts. Because of this sales at offline businesses are down 30% to 40% this month,\u201d CAIT\u2019s secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said.  FLIPKART INCENTIVES  Two emails received by Flipkart sellers in September, just days ahead of the inaugural phase of the festive sales, showed it offering to partly fund discounts.  The company would \u201cburn\u201d 3% of the discount if a seller lowered a product price by 15%, or 9% if the seller discounted by 30%, said one of the emails.  In training material posted on Flipkart\u2019s restricted website for its sellers, seen by Reuters, the company asks them to prepare for the festive season by saying \u201cnothing is bigger than this\u201d and explaining how they can benefit by discounting products for Flipkart\u2019s premium customers.  \u201cWe want to ensure that you fetch as much profit from it as possible ... whatever the discount you are offering, half of that will be reimbursed to you by Flipkart,\u201d a post said.  A Flipkart source said the incentives were compliant with Indian regulations and were aimed at promoting sellers\u2019 earnings by effectively reducing the commission they pay.  All India Online Vendors Association, whose 3,500 members sell products on various online platforms including Flipkart, in a statement said fewer than 100 of its members benefited from Flipkart\u2019s partial discount funding, giving some sellers an unfair advantage.","60":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States Postal Service should have more flexibility to raise rates for packages, according to recommendations from a task force set up by President Donald Trump, a move that could hurt profits of Amazon.com Inc and other large online retailers.  The task force was announced in April to find ways to stem financial losses by the service, an independent agency within the federal government. Its creation followed criticism by Trump that the Postal Office provided too much service to Amazon for too little money.  The Postal Service lost almost $4 billion in fiscal 2018, which ended on Sept. 30, even as package deliveries rose.  It has been losing money for more than a decade, the task force said, partially because the loss of revenue from letters, bills and other ordinary mail in an increasingly digital economy have not been offset by increased revenue from an explosion in deliveries from online shopping.  The president has repeatedly attacked Amazon for treating the Postal Service as its \u201cdelivery boy\u201d by paying less than it should for deliveries and contributing to the service\u2019s $65 billion loss since the global financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, without presenting evidence.  Amazon\u2019s founder Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper whose critical coverage of the president has repeatedly drawn Trump\u2019s ire.  The rates the Postal Service charges Amazon and other bulk customers are not made public.  \u201cNone of our findings or recommendations relate to any one company,\u201d a senior administration official said on Tuesday.  Amazon shares closed down 5.8 percent at $1,669.94, while eBay fell 3.1 percent to $29.26, amid a broad stock market selloff on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO - A view shows U.S. postal service mail boxes at a post office in Encinitas, California in this February 6, 2013, file photo. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/Files  The Package Coalition, which includes Amazon and other online and catalog shippers, warned against any move to raise prices to deliver their packages.  \u201cThe Package Coalition is concerned that, by raising prices and depriving Americans of affordable delivery services, the Postal Task Force\u2019s package delivery recommendations would harm consumers, large and small businesses, and especially rural communities,\u201d the group said in an emailed statement.  Most of the recommendations made by the task force, including possible price hikes, can be implemented by the agency. Changes, such as to frequency of mail delivery, would require legislation.  The task force recommended that the Postal Service have the authority to charge market-based rates for anything that is not deemed an essential service, like delivery of prescription drugs.  BAD NEWS FOR AMAZON  \u201cAlthough the USPS does have pricing flexibility within its package delivery segment, packages have not been priced with profitability in mind. The USPS should have the authority to charge market-based prices for both mail and package items that are not deemed \u2018essential services,\u2019\u201d the task force said in its summary.  That would be bad news for Amazon and other online sellers that ship billions of packages a year to customers.  \u201cIf they go to market pricing, there will definitely be a negative impact on Amazon\u2019s business,\u201d said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL International Inc.  If prices jumped 10 percent, that would increase annual costs for Amazon by at least $1 billion, he said.  The task force also recommended that the Postal Service address rising labor costs.  The Postal Service should also restructure $43 billion in pre-funding payments that it owes the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, the task force said.  Cowen & Co, in a May report, said the Postal Service and Amazon were \u201cco-dependent,\u201d but that Amazon went elsewhere for most packages that needed to arrive quickly.  Cowen estimated that the Postal Service delivered about 59 percent of Amazon\u2019s U.S. packages in 2017, and package delivery could account for 50 percent of postal service revenue by 2023.  The American Postal Workers Union warned against any effort to cut services. \u201cRecommendations would slow down service, reduce delivery days and privatize large portions of the public Postal Service. Most of the report\u2019s recommendations, if implemented, would hurt business and individuals alike,\u201d the union said in a statement.  Amazon, FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc did not return requests for comment.","61":"May 1 (Reuters) - Some workers at Amazon.com Inc, Target Corp and Instacart Inc are staging protests and sick-outs on Friday to demand a safer work environment and better pay during the coronavirus outbreak.  The protests are taking place in New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon and other states, organizers said in social media posts and interviews. Labor groups and unions involved include the United Food and Commercial Workers and Workers United. Workers across the country can join in by calling in sick.  May 1, known as International Workers\u2019 Day or May Day, is a worldwide holiday to celebrate working classes.  The protests are the latest by workers deemed essential in the pandemic who risk their lives working in warehouses and grocery stores. They argue that employers have fallen short in providing for their safety while making record sales.  Their demands include hazard pay and the shuttering of facilities with confirmed coronavirus cases. Workers at Target and Instacart are also requesting protective equipment like masks.  It is unclear how many workers will take part in the protest. Organizers said they are collecting signatures through Google Docs for a tally.  Amazon responded in a statement that while it respects the right of expression, it objects to \u201cthe irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon.\u201d  Instacart welcomed feedback from shoppers, saying in a statement it was moving quickly to get them tens of thousands of pieces of personal protective equipment.  Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  One Whole Foods employee in Massachusetts, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, said he joined the sick-out because he believed the Amazon-owned grocer should expand its two-week paid sick policy to cover symptomatic workers who may still be seeking a COVID-19 diagnosis.  \u201cWe\u2019re acting in solidarity, because we all have similar demands for better safety practices, for protecting the workers and fairly compensating us for the risk we\u2019re taking,\u201d the employee said.  Amazon said it has prioritized workers\u2019 safety, spending nearly $700 million on higher pay and over 150 measures such as providing masks and performing temperature checks.  Union leaders say such protests are meant to raise concerns to the companies, and to urge regulators to exercise more scrutiny on working conditions during the pandemic.  \u201cThe emphasis now is on putting pressure on our governments to take action against employers who are not doing enough to protect workers,\u201d said Patricia Campos-Medina, co-director at union federation AFL-CIO\u2019s New York arm, who helped coordinate the protests.

While Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has said little publicly about the company\u2019s ambitions in the sector, the strategy is aimed at leveraging Amazon\u2019s strengths in logistics, cloud computing and digital services together with new interests in related fields from robotics to manufacturing, according to more than two dozen people, including Amazon executives and industry executives familiar with the strategy, and a Reuters analysis of Amazon\u2019s patent activity.  With these new investments and alliances up and down the auto supply chain - and by hiring key auto industry veterans and amassing a robust patent portfolio - Amazon is positioning itself to challenge corporate customers and partners ranging from United Parcel Service Inc to Uber Technologies Inc.  Businesses such as Amazon Web Services and Fulfillment by Amazon started as internal efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency in serving consumers, and later expanded to corporate customers. However, companies working closely with Amazon also risk losing business to the online retailer as its transportation expertise grows, according to some analysts and industry insiders.  Corporate customers \u201cshould be very scared\u201d of Amazon\u2019s move into the dashboard, said John Ellis, a transportation consultant and former global technologist at Ford Motor Co. As consumers pay less attention to horsepower and more to streaming content and services, he expects more consumers \u201cwon\u2019t really care whether you\u2019re in a Ford or a Chrysler or a Chevrolet or a BMW.\u201d  Ned Curic, a former Toyota Motor Corp executive recruited by Amazon to oversee Alexa Auto in 2017, said in a written response to Reuters that the company is \u201calways looking for ways to more closely integrate Amazon services if we think it\u2019ll bring value to the customer.\u201d  PATENT PUSH  A Reuters analysis of more than 5,000 patents granted to Amazon from December 2016 through May 2019 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office indicates at least 210 of those patents cover transportation-related topics from drones to automated ground vehicles. The auto-related patent push outpaced tech rivals Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, whose sister company Waymo is a self-driving pioneer.  Amazon was granted several patents that involve the transport of passengers, including a 2017 patent to provide an on-demand transportation service through a network of self-driving vehicles - a potential competitor to Uber, Lyft Inc and Waymo, as well as major auto customers such as Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors Co.  Patents do not always evolve into specific businesses and processes, Amazon said.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cLike many companies, we file a number of forward-looking patent applications that explore the full possibilities of new technology. Patents take multiple years to receive and do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services,\u201d an Amazon spokesman said in a statement.  The patent push comes with a boost in Amazon\u2019s transportation-related investments. Since February, it has joined other major investors in providing nearly $2 billion in funding to three high-profile startups: electric truck maker Rivian Automotive, self-driving systems developer Aurora and food delivery firm Deliveroo.  In the past two years, Amazon has built out its transportation ecosystem further with the acquisition of three startups \u2014 Dispatch, Canvas and Tapzo \u2014 while investing hundreds of millions of dollars in at least nine others, including Shuttl, an Indian company developing an app to help commuters find seats on buses.  Amazon\u2019s business partners in the sector include automotive suppliers such as Aptiv, Panasonic Corp and Nvidia Corp, big transportation providers such as Uber and Avis, and self-driving heavy truck startups Embark and China\u2019s TuSimple.  \u201cINDUSTRIAL CLOUD\u201d  The company, through its $33 billion Amazon Web Services unit, also is rapidly expanding its business with corporate customers, notably through two major cloud-based initiatives this year with Ford and VW.  The strategic alliance with VW, which includes German supplier Siemens AG, aims to create an \u201cindustrial cloud\u201d to digitally connect the automaker\u2019s far-flung manufacturing operations - 122 plants worldwide - and up to 30,000 supplier factories, according to Jonathan Allen, head of professional services in AWS\u2019 global automotive practice.  Volkswagen in March said AWS cloud-based services, including machine learning and data analytics, would help the automaker to \u201cincrease plant efficiency and uptime, improve production flexibility and increase vehicle quality.\u201d  AWS has been one of Amazon\u2019s fastest-growing, highest-margin businesses and provides a platform for corporate customers - from BMW and Toyota to Avis and Formula One - to manage, analyze and in some cases monetize data.  Gavin Sherry, CEO of Ford\u2019s Autonomic web services subsidiary, said the No. 2 U.S. automaker can learn a lot from Amazon, which is working with Autonomic and Ford to build a cloud-based platform for the transportation industry.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cThey have the relationships, credibility and know-how that we will need in order to fulfill our vision,\u201d he told Reuters.  ALEXA + LOGISTICS  Alexa, Amazon\u2019s digital assistant, is taking a leading role in the company\u2019s drive to get inside cars.  Amazon is collaborating with a number of automakers to embed Alexa in vehicles, and has made deals with GM, Ford, Volvo and Honda Motor Co Ltd to allow online orders to be delivered to owners\u2019 cars.  \u201cOur goal is to bring Alexa to as many vehicles as possible, either through direct integrations with automakers or through automotive accessories with Alexa built in,\u201d Curic said.  \u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d Curic added, including \u201cbringing Alexa to more vehicles and accessories, building new Alexa features for the car and launching our own automotive product, Echo Auto.\u201d  Beyond Alexa Auto, much of Amazon\u2019s focus has one clear theme: cutting the cost of transporting packages, mainly through the company\u2019s Prime and Prime Air delivery and freight services.  It has strengthened those capabilities with the addition of Amazon delivery vans and cargo planes. Its investments in Rivian, which has designed a flexible electric truck architecture, and Aurora, which is developing a software \u201cdriver\u201d for autonomous vehicles, point to eventual development of self-driving, electric delivery vehicles, analysts said.  Amazon, which spent more than $8 billion in shipping costs last quarter, is building out the entire logistics infrastructure through the automation of its warehouses, long-haul truck shipments and last-mile deliveries with Scout robots and aerial drones, according to public records.  Electric vehicles are also now a part of Amazon\u2019s strategy for connecting homes to its network. Amazon is supplying home charging systems for Audi\u2019s e-tron mid-sized electric SUV - a deal that could be a step toward managing vehicle fleets, said Roland Berger partner Stephan Keese.  DATA PRIVACY  One frequently mentioned concern - common to Amazon, Google and Apple - is the security and privacy of data collected from vehicles and their occupants.  Curic said voice data collected by Alexa from consumers is used by Amazon \u201cto deliver and improve our services.\u201d  Data gathered through Amazon Web Services \u201cis absolutely secure and confidential,\u201d said Curic. \u201cNo customer, including Amazon\u2019s Consumer business, has access to any other AWS customer\u2019s data.\u201d  Allen told Reuters AWS is working with corporate customers to provide advanced data analytics and build services that could generate revenue from the data and enhance the customer experience.  \u201cThat\u2019s going to lead to monetization\u201d of data by those companies, Allen said.","64":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is planning to split its second headquarters evenly between two cities, people familiar with the matter said Monday, in a twist to a more than year-long contest that has drawn overtures from locales across North America.  Dallas, Long Island City in New York and Arlington near Washington, D.C. are all among the finalists with which Amazon is holding advanced talks, one of the people said on condition of anonymity. The person would not confirm which two are expected to win or if any others remain in the running.  Amazon declined to comment on the news, first reported by the Wall Street Journal.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer sparked a bidding frenzy in September 2017 when it announced it would invest over $5 billion to create an \u201cHQ2\u201d in addition to its home base in Seattle and hire up to 50,000 people.  One of the major reasons for the decision was for Amazon, which has satellite operations around the world, to recruit top talent. Offering a choice of head offices could help it win new workers in a battle with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and others, with which Amazon competes in areas such as cloud computing and voice-controlled technology.  \u201cAmazon is going where it won\u2019t have to jostle with Google and Facebook as much as it would in San Francisco or it does in Seattle,\u201d said Alex Snyder, analyst at CenterSquare Investment Management near Philadelphia.  The HQ2 split also could help Amazon ease the same degree of congestion and jump in costs of living that led to unrest in Seattle. An affordable housing crisis there prompted the city council to adopt a head tax on businesses in May, which Amazon helped overturn in a subsequent city council vote.  It was unclear what incentive packages were offered to Amazon. New Jersey early in the contest proposed $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon located in Newark and stuck to hiring commitments.  On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state was in talks with Amazon. \u201cWe have a great incentive package,\u201d which was not \u201ccrazy\u201d like other states\u2019 offers, he said, according to audio from WCBS 880 Radio.  \u201cI\u2019ll change my name to Amazon Cuomo if that\u2019s what it takes,\u201d he said.","65":"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s long-awaited launch of its Swedish website on Wednesday was marred by glitches and translation errors, including mistaking the Argentinian flag for Sweden\u2019s.

The word valdtakt, which means rape in Swedish, is being used on several products instead of raps - the correct Swedish word for a plant.  Some product descriptions use a Swedish word for male genitals, instead of the word for rooster, and a frying pan has been listed as a product for women.  Many users took to Twitter to point out the errors.  \"Your choice of words is a catastrophe for your launch and you need a new director for overseas sales.

Seventy-five years after the liberation of the Nazi German Auschwitz death camp by Soviet troops, world leaders and activists have called for action against rising anti-Semitism.  \u201cHunters\u201d, released on Friday and starring Al Pacino, features a team of Nazi hunters in 1970s New York who discover that hundreds of escaped Nazis are living in the United States.  However, the series has faced accusations of bad taste, particularly for depicting fictional atrocities in Nazi death camps, such as a game of human chess in which people are killed when a piece is taken.  \u201cInventing a fake game of human chess for @huntersonprime is not only dangerous foolishness & caricature. It also welcomes future deniers,\u201d the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted.  \u201cWe honor the victims by preserving factual accuracy.\u201d  The Auschwitz Memorial is responsible for preserving the Nazi German death camp in southern Poland, where more than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease.  \u201cWhile Hunters is a dramatic narrative series, with largely fictional characters, it is inspired by true events. But it is not documentary. And it was never purported to be,\u201d David Weil, creator and executive producer of \u2018Hunters\u2019 said in a statement.  \u201cIn speaking to the \u2018chess match\u2019 scene specifically\u2026 this is a fictionalized event. Why did I feel this scene was important to script and place in series? To most powerfully counteract the revisionist narrative that whitewashes Nazi perpetration, by showcasing the most extreme \u2013 and representationally truthful \u2013 sadism and violence that the Nazis perpetrated against the Jews and other victims,\u201d Weil added.  The Memorial also criticized Amazon for selling anti-Semitic books.  On Friday, the Memorial retweeted a letter from the Holocaust Educational Trust to Amazon asking that anti-Semitic children\u2019s books by Nazi Julius Streicher, who was executed for crimes against humanity, be removed from sale.  \u201cWhen you decide to make a profit on selling vicious antisemitic Nazi propaganda published without any critical comment or context, you need to remember that those words led not only to the #Holocaust but also many other hate crimes,\u201d the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted on Sunday.  \u201cAs a bookseller, we are mindful of book censorship throughout history, and we do not take this lightly. We believe that providing access to written speech is important, including books that some may find objectionable,\u201d an Amazon spokesman said in a comment emailed to Reuters.  In December, Amazon withdrew from sale products decorated with images of Auschwitz, including Christmas decorations, after the Memorial complained.  Separately, prosecutors launched an investigation into a primary school in the Polish town of Labunie, which staged a reenactment of Auschwitz with children dressed as prisoners being gassed, local media reported.  The school is accused of promoting fascism in the performance in December.

Microsoft's market capitalization was Wall Street's highest in late 1998 through early 2000 before the dot-com bubble burst.  Amazon\u2019s shares dropped 7 percent, the most in nearly three years after its holiday season sales outlook missed targets, fanning concerns that Wall Street\u2019s tech darlings are finally starting to face stronger competition.  Microsoft fell a more modest 1.1 percent in a broad technology sell-off that was also driven by a weaker-than-expected report from Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, leaving the Nasdaq composite index .IXIC down 1.9 percent late Friday afternoon.  (Graphic: Market cap - Apple, Amazon and Microsoft - tmsnrt.rs\/2ORT0Yq)  Shares of Microsoft remain up nearly 4 percent from Wednesday, when the four-decade-old software company beat quarterly profit expectations, driven by its cloud computing business that competes with Amazon\u2019s.  Its stock market value on Friday stood at $823 billion, on track to close above Amazon\u2019s for the first time since April, when it gave up its spot as second largest company by market capitalization.  Amazon was worth $805 billion on Friday, after falling below Microsoft's in extended trade on Thursday. The drop was equivalent to the combined values of Target Corp TGT.N and Corning Inc GLW.N.  Amazon\u2019s tumble left it up around 40 percent year to date, while Microsoft has gained about 25 percent in 2018. On Wednesday, Amazon\u2019s stock traded at the equivalent of 70 times expected earnings, its lowest level since 2011.  The average analyst price target for Microsoft puts its market cap at $963 billion, while the average price target for Amazon values it at $1.068 trillion.

Tops said it expects the 169 stores it operates in upstate New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont to remain open while it restructures under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code in White Plains, New York.  The Williamsville, New York-based company said it had $977 million of assets and $1.18 billion of liabilities as of Dec. 30, 2017, and employs more than 14,200 people.  Some supermarket chains are struggling with falling sales and profit margins as big-box retailers, membership clubs and warehouses, and online retailers such as Amazon expand their food operations and undercut them on price.  Management acquired Tops in 2013 from Morgan Stanley's MS.N private equity arm, which had bought the company six years earlier from the Dutch retailer now known as Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize NV AD.AS.  In a court filing, Tops said \u201ctransactions undertaken by prior ownership\u201d left it with unsustainable leverage.  It also said a heavily unionized workforce, changing customer tastes, rivals\u2019 pricing power and \u201cintense competition from online retail giants such as Amazon\u201d made it increasingly difficult to compete.  Amazon last year bought Whole Foods Market, which overlaps with Tops in parts of New York.  Tops said it has lined up $265 million of financing to help operate during the reorganization process, and is in \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with some bondholders.  The company retained Evercore Inc EVR.N as its investment banker, and also hired FTI Consulting Inc as its restructuring advisor Weil, Gotshal & Manges as its law firm.

U.S. stocks were unable to hold initial gains and held near the unchanged mark. After rising nearly 8 percent, Amazon.com Inc shares pulled back and were last up 4.85 percent after its quarterly earnings report.  The energy sector, off 1.23 percent, was weighed down by a 3.49-percent drop in Exxon Mobil Corp. The world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices.  \u201cThe market is a little hesitant after a very strong day in response to some earnings that were taken quite positively,\u201d said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.  U.S. stocks had rallied on Thursday, with each of the major Wall Street indexes climbing more than 1 percent with strong gains in tech shares. Still, the S&P 500 was on track for a modest weekly decline.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 49.15 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,273.19, the S&P 500 gained 0.19 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,667.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.29 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,119.96.  European shares pulled back from earlier highs but were still on track for their fifth straight weekly climb.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.08 percent and MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.22 percent.  Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield declined for a second straight day after hitting a four-year high earlier in the week.  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 9\/32 in price to yield 2.9587 percent, from 2.99 percent late on Thursday.  But the margin between U.S. shorter-dated Treasury yields and longer-dated ones shrank as a smaller-than-expected decline in domestic economic growth in the first quarter renewed bets the Federal Reserve would stick to its rate-hike campaign to keep inflation in check.  The U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter to a 2.3 percent annual rate as consumer spending grew at its weakest pace in nearly five years, but the setback is likely temporary against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and large fiscal stimulus.  The dollar held steady after the GDP data, putting the greenback on track for its best week since November 2016. The solid week has lifted the currency to its highest level since January 11.  The dollar index rose 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.07 percent to $1.2109.  Sterling slumped to its lowest since March 1 against the dollar. Data showed Britain\u2019s economy slowed much more sharply than expected in the first quarter of 2018, slashing market expectations of a Bank of England rate hike in May.  Sterling was last trading at $1.3794, down 0.86 percent on the day.","77":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of French retailer Casino is pictured outside a Casino supermarket in Nantes, France, July 20, 2017.

The companies said on Tuesday that they were in talks to jointly negotiate purchases with their main, multi-national food and non-food suppliers.  Casino\u2019s planned partnership with Auchan in this area comes just a week after it struck a deal with Amazon.

Amazon\u2019s purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, along with a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons, have led to speculation that Amazon could bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.

The accusation, published in a blog post, is the latest twist in a weeks-long saga that has brought the world\u2019s richest person\u2019s private life into the spotlight and thrusts him deeper into a battle with the leading U.S. tabloid publisher, which has had close links with the president of the United States.  \u201cOf course I don\u2019t want personal photos published, but I also won\u2019t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cI prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\u201d  American Media Inc (AMI), the owner of the National Enquirer, did not immediately return a request for comment.  Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage, following a period of \u201cloving exploration\u201d and trial separation. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.  Since the affair, Bezos opened an investigation into the leak led by Gavin de Becker, a public safety expert and former appointee of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. De Becker proceeded to tell media that the leak was politically motivated.  Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, have all been targets of attacks on Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump.  \u201cIt\u2019s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,\u201d Bezos wrote. \u201cPresident Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets.\u201d  The suggestion that the National Enquirer\u2019s reporting on him was politically motivated concerned AMI, according to Bezos.  In his blog, Bezos reproduces an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposes a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that \u201cthey have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI\u2019s) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u201d  In return for such an acknowledgement, according to the email, AMI offered \u201cnot to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos.\u201d  Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an \u201cextortionate proposal.\u201d  The alleged extortion raises questions about whether AMI and its chief executive David Pecker have violated a cooperation agreement AMI made last year with federal prosecutors in connection with a $150,000 hush-money payment given to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claims she had an affair with President Donald Trump.  The payment was made during the 2016 presidential election to influence that election, according to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. The deal not to prosecute was conditional on AMI not committing another crime, the office said.  \u201cClearly Bezos will have a civil claim against AMI if they chose to bring it, but the question is whether it is criminal,\u201d said David Berger, a litigation partner with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.

At a press event in Seattle, Amazon unveiled one of the dark gray Prime-logoed vans that it wants to lease to delivery businesses on what it says are attractive terms. It also said it would provide uniforms, fueling plans and insurance programs for fleet operators and even offer classes on tax, payroll and other small-business challenges.  The new program promises more competition for delivery companies like United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and FedEx Corp FDX.N.  Amazon says qualified entrepreneurs could start businesses with as little as $10,000, although that does not include the cost of hiring drivers. \u201cA 40-vehicle fleet could earn as much as $300,000 a year in profits,\u201d said Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide operations.  Clark said he would expect to see operators with 20 to 40 vans employ 100 drivers. Amazon did not offer any details on the incentives or say whether it would pay per delivery, per mile driven or per month.  The branded vans can only be used for Amazon deliveries, an Amazon spokeswoman said. Last-mile delivery is among the retail industry\u2019s biggest challenges as customers increasingly expect quick and cheap delivery of almost anything ordered online.  Amazon rivals like U.S. grocery chain Kroger Co KR.N and retail giant Walmart Inc WMT.N are also experimenting with different delivery models.  Slideshow ( 16 images )  Earlier this year, Reuters reported that Walmart had ended grocery delivery partnerships with ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft. Walmart has also offered to pay its store employees to complete deliveries on their way home from work. Walmart is now doing grocery delivery with DoorDash and Postmates.  Meanwhile, Amazon has for nearly three years had its Flex program where drivers can get paid for deliveries using their personal cars. That program will continue, Clark said, but only solves part of the problem.  \u201cFlex is all about leveraging available capacity,\u201d said Clark. Salting the landscape with new delivery operators offers scale.  \u201cWe looked at our history with small business\u201d on the Amazon marketplace platform, Clark said, \u201cand we said we can do the same thing in last mile and people can own a manageable size business.\u201d","81":"FIle Photo: The logo of Amazon is seen on the door of an Amazon Books retail store in New York City, U.S., February 14, 2019.

The Halo band, which does not feature a display screen unlike most of its rivals, is priced at $99.99, while the app membership costs $3.99 per month, Amazon said.  The scope of growth in the fitness band market has prompted tech giants such as Apple Inc and Samsung to introduce many sophisticated features for health tracking, including electrocardiogram and blood pressure sensor.  In comparison, Amazon has featured a relatively new technology in the market called tone analysis, which reviews users\u2019 tone during conversations. When enabled, a microphone on the band listens to detect emotions such as happiness, confusion or affection in the speaker\u2019s tone.  It remains to be seen if consumers would embrace this feature or would it spark privacy concerns. Amazon said the technology was designed in a way that protects privacy.  The company said the water-resistant band, with a battery life of up to 7 days, also contains an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, a heart rate monitor and can measure body fat percentage.  Alphabet Inc-owned Google is also making strides into the fitness market. Google in November said it would buy Fitbit Inc for $2.1 billion, a deal that is currently under regulatory scrutiny.

Most retailers lock in their holiday shipping partnerships well in advance. FedEx Corp threw a wrench in Amazon\u2019s plans this summer, ending its relationship with the e-commerce company due to strategic reasons.

Amazon\u2019s air delivery contractors pay their pilots significantly less than UPS and FedEx, where hourly pay was $288 and $243 respectively in 2018, according to Flightpath Economics.  That compares with $152 at ATSG and $139 at Atlas, which is locked in a bitter contract talks with pilots. ABX and Atlas pilots say the low pay make it difficult to attract and retain skilled flight crews amid a global pilot shortage.

Additionally, all part- and full-time hourly team members at Whole Foods Market stores and facilities will receive double their regular hourly base rate of pay for every overtime hour worked in a workweek from March 16 through May 3, 2020, the national food retailer said in an emailed statement on Saturday.  Lawmakers have urged companies to do a better job protecting workers, especially those at warehouses and grocery stores who do not have the luxury of working from home and who are now on the frontlines battling against the further spreading of the virus. They bear a higher risk to their health while continuing to fulfill supplies Americans need to survive while staying indoors.  \u201cWe continue to see increased demand from customers to have products delivered to support social distancing in their communities,\u201d Amazon wrote to employees. \u201cMaking that possible means that some of us must work to keep good flowing.\u201d  Just hours before Amazon\u2019s Saturday announcement, four Democratic U.S. senators, including Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders on Friday expressed concern in a letter to Amazon\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos that the world\u2019s largest online retailer has not taken enough measures to protect its warehouse staff. They specifically asked if the company would provide \u201ctime-and-a-half\u201d hazard pay for its workers. {nL1N2BE02N]  Other businesses have also acted. HEB, a Texas-based grocery chain with 140,000 employees in Texas and New Mexico on Friday said it raised workers\u2019 pay by $2 an hour through April 12 that went into effect on Monday.  Amazon has offered unlimited unpaid time off to encourage employees to stay home if they don\u2019t feel well, which could contribute to higher-than-usual absence rate in the warehouses. It has also staggered workers shifts and prohibited them from sitting next to each other in the lunchroom to limit contact.  Amazon on Thursday reported its first warehouse employee in the United States tested positive for the virus, forcing the company to temporarily shutter a warehouse in New York.  As the virus spreads across the United States, several clothing retailers and department-store chains have shut stores and cafe and restaurant operators have closed down or limited services to delivery and take-away.  Online retailers and grocery stores are trying to capture rising demand as more Americans are ordered to stay at home to reduce the spread of the outbreak.  Rival retailer Walmart Inc said on Thursday it plans to hire 150,000 hourly associates in the U.S. and announced $550 million in cash bonuses to reward workers.  The highly contagious coronavirus has infected more than 274,800 people across the world and led to more than 11,300 deaths globally forcing governments across the world to issue mass lockdowns of people in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.

These patents relate to what the university called the \u201creinvention of the light bulb\u201d by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara led by professor Shuji Nakamura, who won the 2014 Nobel prize for physics.  The university is seeking unspecified damages, including royalties, in lawsuits filed with the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, and wants the retailers to enter license agreements.  It has also asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to open a probe into the retailers\u2019 conduct, saying the retailers have failed to require their suppliers to honor the university\u2019s patents.  None of the retailers immediately responded to requests for comment.  Filament LED light bulbs are sometimes called \u201cEdison\u201d or \u201cvintage\u201d bulbs because they resemble light bulbs created by Thomas Edison that have glowing filaments visible inside.  They became widely available only in the last five years in the United States, where sales in 2019 are expected to top $1 billion, according to court papers.  According to the university\u2019s lawyers at Nixon Peabody, the litigation is the first-of-its-kind \u201cdirect patent enforcement\u201d campaign against an entire industry.

Amazon drivers had an on-time rate of 93.7% for the Cyber Monday week ended Dec. 7, down from 98.2% during the Thanksgiving week ended Nov. 30, according to ShipMatrix. This was the first year that the consultancy measured on-time deliveries for the world\u2019s No. 1 online retailer\u2019s growing logistics business.  This holiday season is a crucial test for Amazon\u2019s in-house delivery operations that trace back to 2013, when an unexpected surge in Amazon packages swamped shippers, delayed gifts and prompted the Seattle company to take control of delivering merchandise to people\u2019s homes.  The drivers who work for companies that deliver exclusively for Amazon did have a better on-time rate than other carriers. Cyber Monday week results were 92.7% for United Parcel Service Inc, 90.4% for FedEx Corp and 92.3% for the U.S. Postal Service.  Amazon van drivers work primarily in well-populated urban areas and will drop off roughly 275 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, more than double last year\u2019s number.  Amazon did not immediately comment on the holiday performance of the drivers, who deliver its merchandise to customer doorsteps.  Nation-wide delivery firms, including UPS and USPS are forecast to deliver another 180 million Amazon packages during the holiday season, according to ShipMatrix, which has been using proprietary software to track on-time deliveries since 2013.

Shares of Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, fell 5% in after-hours trade.  Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder and world\u2019s richest person, said in a statement, \u201cwe\u2019re not thinking small,\u201d a sign that the e-commerce company would invest heavily during the pandemic. Rival brick-and-mortar retailers have had to shut stores while Amazon hired 175,000 people.  This quarter, with government-mandated lockdowns in full swing, Amazon said it could see a 28% rise in revenue to $81 billion.  Under normal circumstances, Amazon would earn an operating profit of at least $4 billion in the current second quarter, but its costs will rise by that amount or more so it can respond to the pandemic, the company said. The Seattle retailer forecast operating income will range from a loss of $1.5 billion to a profit of $1.5 billion, versus earnings of $3.1 billion in the same period a year prior.  Amazon has unsettled investors in the past with heavy spending on cloud data centers, streaming video and voice-controlled gadgets, which often paid off in the form of new businesses. Since mid-February, Amazon\u2019s shares have risen by more than 10% including Thursday\u2019s after-hours drop, while the broader stock market has sunk.  Bezos\u2019 personal stake alone has grown by some $5 billion in that time.  The company is increasing investments because of the novel coronavirus in a similar way, said Kim Khan, U.S. markets analyst at Investing.com.  \u201cAmazon built its commanding position by spending all its cash to grow before it became the profit-making machine it is today. It\u2019s doing the same thing during this lockdown period and will likely come out a winner again,\u201d Khan said.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  At the same time, Amazon is facing new labor risks. The virus has infected workers at dozens of locations, igniting small protests and prompting labor organizers to demand site closures. Amazon has rolled out masks and temperature checks to all its U.S. and European warehouses, announced software to monitor for social distancing and taken other measures to ensure it stays operational.  BOON TO GROCERY, \u2018MIXED BAG\u2019 FOR ADS  Revenue for the first quarter rose 26% to $75.5 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $73.6 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Grocery sales in March were a bright spot for Amazon, which owns Whole Foods Market, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts. Household staples and home office supplies have been in high demand, while interest in discretionary items like apparel dipped, he said.  Last month, the number of people who streamed video on Amazon for the first time nearly doubled, Olsavsky said.  Subscription revenue grew 28% to $5.6 billion in the first quarter.  Still, advertising, a lucrative business in which merchants pay for top placement of their goods on Amazon, was somewhat of a \u201cmixed bag,\u201d Olsavsky said.  Merchants had less reason to sponsor products in March when the company paused accepting non-essential items into warehouses for delivery. Some pulled back on placing ads, the price of which went down; however, strong traffic to Amazon\u2019s websites helped offset the trend, Olsavsky said.  Advertising and other revenue was up 44% in the first quarter to $3.9 billion.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\u2019s cloud computing unit, also is seeing demand vary by industry. Hospitality and travel customers quickly and severely cut their spend. Remote education and entertainment services had much higher AWS usage, and overall, revenue increased 33% to $10.2 billion, short of analysts\u2019 estimate of $10.3 billion.  In the midst of the change, Amazon expects to spend $300 million in the second quarter to develop the capability to test staff for the virus, Olsavsky said. That could approach $1 billion for the full year if the early effort is successful, with the goal of \u201cmaking testing widely available,\u201d he told reporters earlier on Thursday.  Meanwhile, social distancing at worksites has made Amazon less efficient, and warehousing challenges have taken a toll on a year-long effort to halve delivery times to one day for Prime members, Olsavsky said.  Total operating expenses rose 29% in the first quarter to $71.5 billion.  Internationally, the pandemic has hit Amazon the hardest in India, where the company has had to forgo sales to comply with the government restricting delivery to essential goods such as groceries, Olsavsky said.","91":"FILE PHOTO: Chile's President Sebastian Pinera speaks after a meeting with Brazilian President Michel Temer at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil April 27, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The world\u2019s largest online retailer is facing mounting scrutiny as it juggles a surge in online orders during government lockdowns to curb the pandemic and employees\u2019 safety, and France has become a major battleground.  Amazon closed six French warehouses employing about 10,000 people on April 16, following a lower court\u2019s ruling that sided with unions last week, ordering Amazon to focus only on delivering essential items like food while it revised health protocols.  Amazon\u2019s lawyers said on Tuesday that excessive restrictions on the types of goods it can deliver would penalise clients stuck in confinement and were difficult to enforce.  \u201cWe all need IT, telephone equipment, products for our young children ... we need products to be able to continue our physical activities,\u201d Francois Farmine, one the U.S. company\u2019s attorneys, told the court in the former royal city of Versailles.  Judges said they would deliver a verdict on April 24.  France is the only country where Amazon has shut all of its so-called fulfillment centres after unions complained that they were still too crowded and filed a legal challenge.  A growing number of unions have joined the backlash, including France\u2019s biggest, CFDT, which is seen as more moderate than the leftist SUD, which instigated the litigation.  Amazon\u2019s lawyers said that the Seattle-based group, controlled by billionaire Jeff Bezos, did its best to provide employees with health precautions, including sanitary gels and face masks.  In the hearing that took place in a room commonly used by criminal trial courts, Farmine said the unions\u2019 goal was to shut activity altogether, which in turn would penalise small businesses that use the platforms to sell their goods.  \u201cThe aim is... to block this company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely dangerous, because if the manager of this company can\u2019t operate his activities, extremely serious consequences can follow,\u201d he added, hinting at a possible divestment from France.  The unions\u2019 leading lawyer, Judith Krivine, said that staff representatives had been open to talks with management to find a way to keep delivering certain goods while making sure social distancing was guaranteed to prevent coronavirus contagion.  \u201cSince the beginning of the pandemic, Amazon\u2019s results are almost comparable to what they do at Christmas and we\u2019re being told that the situation they\u2019ve been put in is unfair, untenable, unbearable,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it decent, please.\u201d","101":"(Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O rose 4 percent to hit an all-time high after the online retailing giant's quarterly profit topped $2 billion for the first time, powered by its best operating margin in 13 years.

The company said in addition to replacing packaging materials such as bubble wraps and air pillows with \u201cpaper cushions\u201d, it had also swapped out packaging tapes with other bio-degradable options.  \u201cWe have successfully eliminated single-use plastic in all our fulfillment centers a 100%,\u201d Akhil Saxena, vice-president of customer fulfillment for the APAC, LATAM and Middle East and North Africa regions, said in an interview.  Amazon, often criticised for using too much plastic and thermocol to wrap its billions of packages of shipments, had said last September that its India unit would replace single-use plastic in its packaging by June 2020.  Saxena said on Monday the COVID-19 pandemic had slowed down some of their work, but Amazon India managed to meet its target as the unit had started on the elimination project even before the national lockdown was imposed.  Last October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called on citizens to help end the usage of single-use plastic - seen as a pollutant - by 2022.  The Asian country of 1.3 billion does not have an organized system for management of plastic waste, leading to extensive littering.  Many Indian cities rank among the world\u2019s most polluted, and waste generated from single-use plastic has been a growing problem.  Walmart Inc's WMT.N India e-commerce unit Flipkart, a local rival to Amazon, said last month that it had cut down the usage of plastic packaging in its own supply chain to about 50%.","106":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, its latest move to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.  The change does not mean Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or that sellers have to ship directly to consumers.  The move reflects how the global spread of the virus has created challenges for retailers, from supply chain to delivery.  In a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to \u201cquickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.\u201d  Amazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well.  \u201cWe understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  The company said the new protocol applies to its retail inventory as well as to the products of third-party sellers on its platform.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  The move follows Amazon\u2019s Monday announcement that it will hire 100,000 more workers, as the world\u2019s largest online retailer is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.  LESS AD REVENUE?  The news may hurt demand for lucrative services that Amazon offers to merchants, like advertising.  Amy Roskelley, owner of Utah-based Health Beet, said she pays Amazon around $1,000 a month to promote her flatware products that help consumers portion their meals. Now that she can\u2019t add inventory to Amazon\u2019s warehouses, she plans to cut ad spend in half.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to justify spending money if I don\u2019t have enough inventory to fill\u201d customers\u2019 orders, she said.  Roskelley is considering other ways to reduce her dependence on Amazon, too, whether shipping directly to customers or driving traffic to her own website.  Slideshow ( 13 images )  \u201cI have been concerned that they\u2019ll shut down Amazon\u2019s warehouses and won\u2019t ship out at all, and that would just devastate me,\u201d she said.  Amazon has yet to indicate any such closures. Still, the months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the Seattle e-commerce company\u2019s operations.  Merchant Zengxie Pang said Amazon\u2019s change came just as the China-based seller\u2019s factories had resumed production.  \u201cNow we can\u2019t ship to warehouses until April,\u201d Pang said. \u201cWe are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies, and they will likely run out of stock.\u201d  Chief executive of personal massager company LuLu, Michael Gawrychowski, said his supplier in China woke him in the middle of the night with news of Amazon\u2019s change.  \u201cPeople are freaking out,\u201d he said. Gawrychowski immediately sent a request for a 25,000-unit shipment. That was rejected, but a second request went through, he said.  Amazon\u2019s two-day shipping guarantee has in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday\u2019s announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon\u2019s business.  \u201cThis change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay, Wish, Walmart, Facebook Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,\u201d Sebastian said.  Customer searches for popular items including iPhone cases, AirPods and Apple Watch bands have fallen from the week prior, an indication of shifting shopper interests, according to research from Helium 10, which provides tools to sellers.  Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses have been furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus, and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession.  For sellers, which account for over half of sales on Amazon, the new warehouse policy only adds to the economic uncertainty they are facing, said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com.  \u201cSellers are rethinking their entire strategies for selling in 2020,\u201d he said.","107":"Oct 25 (Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc fell nearly 6% in early trading on Friday, as investors were let down by a lower-than-expected sales outlook and surprised by slower revenue growth at its lucrative AWS cloud business.  As many as 16 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock. Analysts said higher costs to keep its one-day delivery Prime members happy played a big part in weaker profits.  \u201cGoing forward, it is difficult to assess when Amazon will once again begin to deliver profit upside. We think that the buildout of next day delivery is likely to take several quarters, and don\u2019t expect a return to outsized profits anytime soon,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.  Amazon\u2019s median price target is $2,220, a 33% premium to where its shares are indicated to open.  Although sales rose 24% to $70 billion in the third quarter, its prediction of $80 billion to $86.5 billion sales in the fourth quarter fell short of the $87.4 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Amazon was again hurt by heavy investments to speed up deliveries to its Prime members as it tries to beat back Walmart Inc, which is swiping market share.  Amazon expects costs to cater to Prime members to nearly double to $1.5 billion during the holiday season from what it spent on one-day delivery during the second quarter.

The decision to greenlight the book\u2019s sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said.  The Tesla chief, who earlier this month said he would take a break from Twitter, has a history of being outspoken on the social media platform. A tweet in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private led to a lawsuit against Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the parties later settled. Musk has lashed out about shelter-at-home restrictions to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus as well.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/  The move, which was initially reported by Reuters on Sunday, points to how the U.S. firm\u2019s China strategy is evolving after it decided earlier this year to stop operating a marketplace in the country for domestic-selling merchants.  In April, it said it would instead increase its focus on selling goods from abroad to Chinese buyers and on its other businesses in the country like cloud services.  Amazon had found it difficult to compete with entrenched, home-grown players such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s Tmall and its rival marketplace from JD.com Inc. In a sign of Tmall\u2019s dominance, Amazon opened an online store on the platform in 2015.  Its decision to open a store on Pinduoduo, however, points to how the four-year-old startup has disrupted Alibaba and JD.com\u2019s dominance of China\u2019s e-commerce market through its popularity with China\u2019s rural residents.  Competition between the three firms have heated up in recent months and Pinduoduo, which woos customers with deep discounts and group-buying deals, suffered an $11 billion slump in value last week after it posted a much wider-than-expected quarterly loss that stemmed from efforts to fight rivals with heavy subsidies.  \u201cThe Amazon Global Store pop-up store on Pinduoduo provides customers with a curated selection of about 1,000 overseas products with competitive prices, authenticity guarantee and convenient shipping,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement.  \u201cWe look forward to enabling customers to enjoy cross-border shopping through this store, in addition to more deals and tens of millions of products available on z.cn,\u201d she said, referring to the website Amazon.cn.

The government discussions coincide with a growing number of complaints from India\u2019s brick-and-mortar retailers, which have for years accused Amazon and Walmart Inc-controlled Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass federal rules, allegations the U.S. companies deny.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers. It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.  Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart were last hit in Dec. 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  Now, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.  The changes could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect equity stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India.  Amazon, Walmart and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Yogesh Baweja, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which is working on the issue, confirmed to Reuters any changes will be announced through a so-called \u201cpress note,\u201d which contains foreign direct investment rules. He did not give any details.  \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Baweja said, adding an internal meeting on the subject last took place about a month ago.  \u201cOf course Amazon\u2019s a big player so whatever advice, whatever suggestions, whatever recommendations they make, they are also given due consideration.\u201d  FRAYED TIES  The 2018 rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to rework their business structures and soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy change favoured local e-tailers over U.S. ones.  India\u2019s e-commerce retail market is seen growing to $200 billion a year by 2026, from $30 billion in 2019, the country\u2019s investment promotion agency Invest India estimates.  Domestic traders have been unhappy about the growth. They see foreign e-commerce businesses as a threat to their livelihoods and accuse them of unfair business practices that use steep discounts to target rapid growth. The companies deny they are acting unfairly.  \u201cThe way the government is thinking is that marketplaces are not doing what they are supposed to do. The government wants to tinker with the nuts and bolts of the policy,\u201d said one of the sources who is familiar with the talks on the policy changes.  LIMITING WHOLESALE TIES  India\u2019s trade minister Piyush Goyal has been critical of e-commerce companies in private meetings and told them to follow all laws in letter and spirit, Reuters has previously reported.  In the face of growing trader complaints and an antitrust investigation, Goyal last year said Amazon was not doing \u201ca great favour to India\u201d by making fresh investments.  Among other changes, the government is considering changes that would effectively prohibit online sales by a seller who purchases goods from the e-commerce entity or its group firm, and then sells them on the entity\u2019s websites, two of the sources said.  Under existing rules, a seller is free to buy up to 25% of its inventory from the e-commerce entity\u2019s wholesale or another unit and then sell them on the e-commerce website.  A boom in e-commerce in India accelerated last year when the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online. Flipkart, in which Walmart invested $16 billion in 2018, and Amazon are among the top two players.  \u201cEcommerce has already made its mark for itself in the country, particularly during COVID-19,\u201d Commerce Ministry\u2019s Baweja said. \u201cThey are bound to grow and a conducive environment should be there, which is good for the brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce.\u201d (Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Krishna Das in New Delhi; Additional reporting by Aftab Ahmed; Editing by Euan Rocha and Barbara Lewis)","111":"(Corrects typo in headline)  June 24 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Monday unveiled its online professional beauty store to sell supplies to licensed professional stylists, barbers and estheticians, weighing on shares of other beauty retailers.

The cameras in effect measure how much heat people emit relative to their surroundings. They require less time and contact than forehead thermometers, earlier adopted by Amazon, the workers said.  Cases of the virus have been reported among staff at more than 50 of Amazon\u2019s U.S. warehouses. That has prompted some workers to worry for their safety and walk off the job. Unions and elected officials have called on Amazon to close buildings down.  The use of cameras, previously unreported, shows how America\u2019s second-biggest corporate employer is exploring methods to contain the virus\u2019 spread without shuttering warehouses essential to its operation.  U.S. states have given Amazon the green light to deliver goods with nearly all the country under stay-at-home orders.  In France, Amazon has closed six of its fulfillment centers temporarily - one of the biggest fallouts yet from a dispute with workers over the risks of coronavirus contagion.  Other companies that have explored using the thermal camera technology include Tyson Foods Inc and Intel Corp. The camera systems, which garnered widespread use at airports in Asia after the SARS epidemic in 2003, can cost between $5,000 and $20,000.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  This week and last, Amazon set up the hardware for the thermal cameras in at least six warehouses outside Los Angeles and Seattle, where the company is based, according to employees and posts on social media.  Thermal cameras will also replace thermometers at worker entrances to many of Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods stores, according to a recent staff note seen by Reuters and previously reported by Business Insider.  The company performs a second, forehead thermometer check on anyone flagged by the cameras to determine an exact temperature, one of the workers said. An international standard requires the extra check, though one camera system maker said the infrared scan is more accurate than a thermometer.  How widely Amazon will deploy the technology at a time when camera makers are grappling with a surge in demand could not be determined. A Whole Foods representative said cameras ordered weeks ago were starting to arrive for use.  Amazon confirmed that some warehouses have implemented the systems to streamline checks. The company is taking temperatures \u201cto support the health and safety of our employees, who continue to provide a critical service in our communities,\u201d it said in a statement.  Early this month, Amazon said it would offer face masks and start checking hundreds of thousands of people for fevers daily at all its U.S. and European warehouses. Associates walk up to a Plexiglas screen, and an employee on the other side scans their forehead by pointing a thermometer through a small hole.  That process has not been without challenges. A worker performing temperature checks in Houston said his proximity to associates made him uncomfortable, in spite of the screen separating them.  \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for this,\u201d he said.  A Los Angeles-area employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said a line once formed outside her warehouse, and employees could not receive masks until after they had entered the building and had their temperatures taken.  The thermal camera system is faster, two other workers said, with no stopping in front of a screen necessary. The cameras connect to a computer so an employee at a distance can view the results, one said.  Amazon did not disclose whose gadgets it was using. One of the employees, at a warehouse outside Seattle, said the technology came from Infrared Cameras Inc in Texas.

Amazon.com rolled out one-day shipping in April. A few months later, FedEx Corp canceled its air and home delivery agreement with the world\u2019s leading online retailer.  Amazon van drivers handle the lion\u2019s share of Amazon\u2019s own deliveries, which often originate from local hubs in primarily urban areas. They are expected to drop off roughly 275 million packages between Thanksgiving and Christmas, more than double last year\u2019s number, according to ShipMatrix.  SMALL MARGIN FOR ERROR  Analysts have warned that Amazon\u2019s decision to accelerate delivery speeds just months before the busiest time of the year would dial up pressure on the company.  \u201cThe more you ratchet down (delivery) time frames, the less margin you have for error,\u201d said Evan Armstrong, president of supply chain consulting firm Armstrong & Associates.  Many Amazon shoppers pay $119 a year for \u201cfree\u201d one- and two-day Prime shipping.  \u201cIf you ordered on Amazon and it\u2019s late, Amazon\u2019s going to get the blame,\u201d said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. \u201cI don\u2019t think this year people are going to be as forgiving as in the past.\u201d  PRIME CUSTOMER DISAPPOINTED  Lacheal Wright waited eight days for the Vtech writing tablet, Nerf toys and hard-to-find Bumblebee Transformer figure she ordered from Amazon on Cyber Monday. Those Christmas gifts for her son were originally slated for delivery on Dec. 5 but arrived Dec. 10.  Wright, 37, whose home in Cincinnati is 20 minutes from two Amazon warehouses, said she had been looking all over for the Bumblebee Transformer and said that was the only reason she did not cancel the entire order. Now that it has arrived, she plans to cancel Prime.  \u201cI pay for Prime. I expect it on time,\u201d Wright said. Her area, which is home to Amazon\u2019s air hub, had snow the weekend before Cyber Monday. A check of that week\u2019s weather showed precipitation of less than 1 inch.  Amazon\u2019s logistics unit in just a few short years has built a U.S. network with hundreds of facilities, nearly 50 leased airplanes and some 30,000 delivery vans.  \u201cSince Amazon is a retailer, fulfillment company and delivery carrier (all-in-one) ... delays could be resulting from delays in the fulfillment of the order,\u201d ShipMatrix President Satish Jindel said.  On-time delivery rates during Cyber Monday week were 92.7% for United Parcel Service Inc, 90.4% for FedEx Corp and 92.3% for the U.S. Postal Service. UPS said it experienced weather-related delays in multiple regions during the week. The company and other nationwide carriers move packages greater distances and are more exposed to disruptions than Amazon van drivers who handle short \u201clast-mile\u201d deliveries.  UPS, USPS and other carriers are expected to deliver 180 million Amazon packages during the holiday season, according to ShipMatrix, which has been using proprietary software to track on-time deliveries since 2013.  In 2013 an unexpected surge in Amazon packages swamped shippers, delayed gifts and prompted the Seattle company to take control of delivering merchandise to people\u2019s homes.","117":"FILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is pictured outside the company's JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island, New York, U.S. November 25, 2020.

Full-time operations staff in the United States who are employed by Amazon from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31 will receive a bonus of $300, while those in part-time roles will get $150, the online retailer said here in a blog post.  Several retailers, including Walmart Inc and Home Depot Inc, have spent millions in bonuses to compensate staff for catering to a surge in online shopping during the pandemic.  In an earlier round of one-time bonuses in June, Amazon spent $500 million in one-time payments to front-line employees and partners.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer has been facing intense scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and unions over whether it is doing enough to protect staff from the coronavirus.","118":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - As Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc worked toward a high-profile distribution deal at least a couple of years ago, one proposal on the table was for Apple to have \u201ccompeting ads removed from search\u201d results on Amazon, according to documents released on Wednesday from a U.S. House of Representatives investigation.  The document, which is not dated but shows Apple products released in late 2017, offers rare insight into how two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies considered using their size for special treatment from one another.  For years, Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, carried only a limited set of Apple products. Users often found used Apple products, and in some cases, knockoffs.  That changed in 2018 when the two announced a deal for Apple and some approved resellers to market iPhones to Amazon customers in several countries in exchange for a promise from Amazon to rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by Apple.  Investigators for the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel asked for documents related to the deal, turning up a slide presentation marked \u201cApple Confidential\u201d that appeared to discuss principles and proposed terms.  Among them was that Amazon would have a \u201cDifferentiated Apple Customer Experience\u201d that would include \u201ccompeting ads removed from search,\u201d product detail pages and checkout pages, according to the document. It proposed that ad treatment would be the same \u201cas for Amazon products.\u201d  Another was that Amazon\u2019s \u201cBuy Box\u201d would be turned off \u201cfor limited Apple-agreed situations.\u201d The Buy Box is Amazon\u2019s automated recommendation for which merchant out of several selling the same item should get the sale and whose non-public algorithms bear heavily on the success of independent sellers.  It was unclear if the proposals were ultimately discussed or part of the final agreement.  Amazon and Apple did not immediately comment.","119":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, January 19, 2019.

The Amazon logo is seen at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  The logistics investment, which would be four times the size of its current book-shipping operation in the country, is a sign the online retailer may soon handle distribution of electronics and other goods sold on its Brazilian website.  That would be the first step of its kind for Amazon in Latin America\u2019s largest economy, where it currently relies on third parties to ship their own goods sold on its marketplace, and it underscores the seriousness of the e-commerce giant\u2019s renewed push into Brazil.  Amazon declined to comment on the possible warehouse lease.  While an estimated two-thirds of Brazil\u2019s 209 million people have internet access, online retail was slow to take off at first, amid concerns over security and complications with tax and logistics in the continent-sized country.  E-commerce accounts for around 5 percent of Brazil\u2019s roughly $300 billion retail market \u2014 about half its share in the United States \u2014 but it has doubled in the past four years and is forecast to keep growing annually at a double-digit pace.  Now Amazon, which expanded its Brazil business from books to electronics in October, is gearing up to fight rivals such as Latin Ameria's homegrown e-commerce champion Mercado Libre Inc MELI.O and B2w Cia Digital, BTOW3.SA which is indirectly controlled by partners of private equity group 3G Capital.  \u201cYou obviously can\u2019t underestimate a company like Amazon,\u201d said Pedro Guasti, CEO of Brazilian online consultancy Ebit. \u201cIt has huge capacity to invest and it\u2019s obviously taking a bigger bite of the cake than it did last year.\u201d  Mercado Libre Inc, B2w and local retailer Magazine Luiza SA MGLU3.SA have gotten the jump on Amazon by storing and shipping goods appearing on their websites even when offered by third-party sellers, to ensure speed and customer satisfaction.  Amazon, by contrast, has been slow to tackle the challenges of shipping in a country where tricky logistics and tax issues have long made online retail an unprofitable venture.  After the Reuters report that Amazon was eyeing the new Brazilian warehouse space, shares of Mercado Libre plunged as much as 7 percent, while Magazine Luiza dropped 5 percent and rival Via Varejo SA VVAR11.SA shed up to 6 percent. All three stocks closed the day about 3 percent lower.  B2W lost as much as 8.5 percent and closed 7 percent lower.  \u201cMarkets get spooked when they see an investment by Amazon,\u201d a Brazilian trader said. \u201cThere is fear that the company will become more aggressive with its strategy in Brazil.\u201d  MEXICAN CONTRAST  In Mexico, Amazon has already taken a more aggressive approach, launching its third-party marketplace coupled with its own shipping service, called \u201cFulfillment by Amazon,\u201d in 2015.  The contrast has been stark. Nearly 20 percent of reviews on Amazon\u2019s Brazilian marketplace are negative, compared with 10 percent in Mexico and just 4 percent in the United States, according to e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse.  Complaints in Brazil often focus on delayed or cancelled orders - a problem dramatically reduced in other countries when Amazon itself packs and posts orders of third-party goods stored at its warehouse facilities.  In an early sign of Amazon\u2019s Brazilian logistics push, the company posted more than a dozen listings for distribution jobs in the country to LinkedIn last year, including \u201cSite leader, Fulfillment Center\u201d.  The new warehouse site outside of Sao Paulo, in the municipality of Cajamar, looks to be a step in that direction.  There San Francisco-based logistics company Prologis Inc PLD.N has offered a 50,000-square-meter space to Amazon in a new industrial park that hosts DHL and Samsung, according to sources, who said adaptation of the warehouse had not begun.  Prologis, which also partnered with Amazon on a mega-warehouse north of Mexico city last year, declined to comment.  The preparations in Brazil come as Luft, the local logistics operator for Amazon\u2019s book business, readies a move into another Prologis site nearby in Cajamar, sources said, leaving its current 12,000-square-meter facility in the city of Barueri.  Amazon registered in October to conduct operations in Cajamar, according to municipal records seen by Reuters.","121":"Nov 19 (Reuters) - Business software provider Salesforce.com Inc said on Tuesday it would use artificial intelligence (AI) technology from Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud computing unit to improve customer service apps.  Salesforce makes software systems that businesses use to house customer information, like which products or services a customer has purchased and how long they have been a customer. Agents use the information to solve customer issues.  Salesforce said it will use technology from Amazon Web Services to turn the customer\u2019s spoken words into text, where it can be translated into different languages or analyzed to determine whether the customer is angry or satisfied, all in real time.  From there, Salesforce\u2019s own software can read the text and make suggestions using data already in the business\u2019 Salesforce-based systems, such as recommending answers to the customer\u2019s questions.  Bret Taylor, Salesforce\u2019s president and chief product officer, said the practical effect of the software could be as simple as not having to put a customer on hold.  For instance, he said, when a customer calls an insurance company to ask the size of a policy\u2019s deductible, instead of an agent putting a customer on hold to look up the data, the software can fish it out of the system automatically.  \u201cIt really shortens the time to resolution on these calls, which is really great for both sides of that interaction,\u201d Taylor said in an interview. \u201cFor people who are in a contact center, improving the efficiency of all those calls is a huge cost (savings). And for you as a consumer, it means you get off that call more quickly, you solve your problem more quickly.\u201d  Salesforce plans to unveil the software at a user conference in San Francisco on Tuesday, which draws tens of thousands of attendees to the city.  The partnership brings Salesforce and Amazon into more direct competition with call center technology providers such as RingCentral Inc. RingCentral has built out cloud technology for call centers and recently executed a deal to supply Avaya Holdings Corp, which was evaluating sale or merger options after struggling to build out similar technology on its own.","122":"PARIS, April 23 (Reuters) - French supermarket retailer Casino said on Tuesday that it was beefing up its partnership with tech giant Amazon following the success of an earlier deal between its Monoprix supermarket chain and Amazon in Paris.  The new, extended partnership entails the installation of 1,000 so-called Amazon lockers in Casino stores across France and the availability of Casino-branded products on Amazon.  Amazon and Monoprix will also extend their partnership on the Prime Now grocery delivery service outside Paris and onto new cities in the next twelve months.","123":"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is launching its long-awaited in-house fulfillment and delivery network in Brazil after months of delays caused by complicated logistics and a highly complex tax system in the largest Latin American economy.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Amazon, which some rivals had expected to kick off direct sales of items beyond books as soon as the Christmas selling season, said it will directly sell 11 categories of merchandise from over 800 suppliers from L\u2019Oreal to Black & Decker as of Tuesday.  Its shift to stocking and delivering goods itself from acting mostly as a marketplace is expected to intensify competition for fast delivery of goods in Latin America\u2019s largest economy as it exits a painful recession.  \u201cWe are launching (our direct sales platform) with 320,000 different products in stock, including 200,000 books... Our obsession is always to increase this catalog and to have everything Brazilian consumers seek and want to buy on the internet\u201d, Amazon\u2019s Brazilian country manager Alex Szapiro told Reuters.  In November, Reuters reported that Amazon\u2019s attempt to advance with its so-called Fulfillment by Amazon program in Brazil had run into difficulties such as the nations\u2019s tangled tax system, complicated logistics and testy relations with some prominent vendors.  \u201cAs in every negotiation, you take a seat at a table and you want to agree on the best possible terms\u201d, said Szapiro when asked on the tone of conversations with suppliers, without entering in details.  Amazon entered Brazil quietly in 2012, selling e-readers, books and then streaming movies in the fast-growing Brazilian market. The company made its first big move into merchandise in October 2017, when it began offering the use of its Brazilian website to third-party merchants to sell electronics.  The company does not reveal the number of sellers in its marketplace, which it has slowly expanded over the past year, adding new categories while laying the ground for a direct sales platform.  As part of the fulfillment program, Amazon leased a 47,000 square-meter (505,904-square-foot) warehouse just outside of Sao Paulo, as first reported by Reuters almost a year ago.  Szapiro, who previously worked as Brazil country manager for Apple Inc, declined to say how much the company is spending on the new distribution center or how many people it is hiring, but said Amazon employs directly and indirectly over 1,400 people in Brazil.  In a report published on Monday, analysts at investment bank BTG Pactual said the expected direct sales launch signaled the company was ready \u201cto strengthen investments, potentially via more partnerships with fulfillment operators and last-mile carriers.\u201d  Even though the bank predicted Amazon would take a \u201cgradual approach\u201d and was likely to vye for a \u201clow double-digit market share,\u201d shares of Brazilian retailers reacted negatively to BTG\u2019s report, with B2W, Magazine Luiza e Lojas Americanas among the biggest losers in Monday\u2019s session.","124":"FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City,U.S., January 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday said it was launching curbside pickup at Whole Foods stores, in its latest tactic to win over U.S. grocery shoppers.  Customers can place orders via Amazon\u2019s Prime Now app and ask to have groceries loaded into their car upon arrival at a store, the company said in a statement. The service is now available in Sacramento, California, and in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with plans to launch in other cities this year.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer is working to crack the $800 billion market for U.S. groceries by popularizing delivery from Whole Foods stores, and now pickup. Cheaper than delivery, pickup has long been touted by far larger grocery companies Kroger Co and Walmart Inc, which have been rolling out the service to thousands of stores.  Whole Foods has 467 U.S. stores and roughly 1 percent share of the fragmented U.S. grocery market. Amazon bought the chain last year in a $13.7 billion deal, and since then it has lowered prices and added delivery services so it could begin capturing shoppers\u2019 weekly spending on groceries.  Customers of the new pickup service will get designated parking spots at stores, Amazon said. They must be members of Amazon\u2019s subscription club Prime to use the service.  Amazon said pickup in an hour is free for orders of at least $35, while pickup in 30 minutes costs $4.99.","125":"March 14 (Reuters) - Amazon.Com Inc:  * DENNY\u2019S - TEAMED UP WITH AMAZON TO FURTHER EXPAND ITS DIGITAL ORDERING NETWORK WITH ADDITION OF AN AMAZON ALEXA VOICE ORDERING SKILL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","126":"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission has opened a formal antitrust investigation to assess whether Amazon\u2019s use of sensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace is in breach of EU competition rules.  It wants to know whether Amazon\u2019s dual role as both a marketplace hosting third-party merchants and as a powerful retailer in its own right on the same platform, often selling the same products, gives it an unfair competitive advantage.  The probe is examining two main areas: the standard agreements between Amazon and marketplace sellers, and the role of data in the selection of the winners of Amazon\u2019s so-called \u201cBuy Box\u201d, a prized button that drives four-fifths of sales.  The Commission believes Amazon may be in breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits agreements that prevent, restrict or distort competition within the EU single market, or Article 102, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.  Below is an explanation of the issues.  WHAT IS AMAZON\u2019S STANDARD AGREEMENT?  Amazon has a standard agreement with third-party retailers who use its platform to sell their products, which gives it wide-ranging access to those merchants\u2019 data, technology and product information.  The concern is that Amazon could use that information to hone its own competitive pricing strategy, gain information about consumers to make its own marketing more effective, and give its own goods an advantage in search results.  \u201cYou\u2019re controlling the whole interface while you\u2019re trying to compete within it,\u201d says Joseph Evans, senior research analyst at London-based media research firm Enders Analysis.  The Amazon standard agreement stipulates: \u201cYou grant us a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to use, reproduce, perform, display (public communication), distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create and exploit derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all of Your Materials\u201d - with some exclusions for trademarks.  \u201cMaterials\u201d are defined as \u201call Technology, Your Trademarks, Content, Your Product information, data, materials, and other items or information provided or made available by you or your affiliates to Amazon or its affiliates.\u201d  WHAT IS AMAZON\u2019S BUY BOX?  The Buy Box is the clickable box that appears on the right of a product-detail page on Amazon saying \u201cBuy now\u201d or \u201cAdd to basket\u201d. It is estimated that more than four in five of all Amazon sales happen through this box.  Every product has just one Buy Box, for which multiple sellers offering the same product, including Amazon, must compete. It may rotate between sellers. Sellers without the box appear far less prominently.  Amazon, which does not disclose what share of the Buy Box it wins, says this competition is aimed at providing the best customer experience.  It uses a proprietary algorithm to determine the winner using criteria including price and customer reviews.  Some merchants fear this can be manipulated to show biased results, echoing a previous EU case in which Google was found to have given illegal advantage in search results to its own comparison shopping service.  Advisers to Amazon merchants say fulfilment, including ability to fulfil Amazon\u2019s super-fast Prime delivery service, is an increasingly important factor in winning the Buy Box.","127":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window)  * Tech stocks rise as Apple hits record high, Alphabet gains  * Alphabet, Amazon jump as Morgan Stanley lifts price targets  * Canada, U.S. resume NAFTA talks amid growing optimism  * Dick\u2019s Sporting falls on weak sales, weighs on Under Armour  * Indexes up: Dow 0.27 pct; S&P up 0.51 pct, Nasdaq up 0.79 pct (Changes comments, updates prices)  By Shreyashi Sanyal  Aug 29 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit all-time highs for the fourth session in a row on Wednesday, boosted by a jump in Amazon.com and Alphabet, and on optimism over trade talks between the United States and Canada.  Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet, becoming the most bullish Wall Street brokerage on the so-called FANG members, causing the stocks to rise by 2.3 percent and 1.3 percent.  The technology sector rose 0.92 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, on gains in Alphabet. Apple hit a record high and was last up 1.0 percent.  The consumer discretionary index was up 0.70 percent, as Amazon\u2019s gains more than offset a drop in retailers. Amazon\u2019s stock hit a record high and moved closer to following Apple into the $1 trillion-market cap club.  Also helping sentiment was Commerce Department data that showed second-quarter U.S. economic growth was a bit stronger than initially thought, notching its best performance in nearly four years as businesses spent more on software and imports fell.  After striking a deal with Mexico on Monday, the United States is in trade talks with Canada to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement amid signs Ottawa was open to taking a more conciliatory approach.  Also on the trade radar is an upcoming Sept. 5 deadline for public comment on a U.S. proposal to slap tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.  \u201cThe theme of the day is the trade talk with Canada which is a big step, although the elephant in the room is still China.

Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods tumbled 5.5 percent as the sportswear retailer\u2019s quarterly same-store sales fell more than expected.  The company blamed tighter controls on gun sales and weak sales of Under Armour products, which pushed shares of the sportswear maker down nearly 1 percent.  In a weak day for retailers, department store chains Macy\u2019s , Kohl\u2019s and Nordstrom fell more than 2 percent while Tiffany\u2019s dropped 4.9 percent.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise was up 3.1 percent after the IT products and services provider topped revenue and profit estimates.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.66-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 43 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 87 new highs and 13 new lows.

The service, Ultra Fast Fresh, involves retrofitting nine existing depots within the country to handle fresh produce and fulfill grocery orders within hours, the magazine reported.  The project could involve making Amazon Fresh, Amazon\u2019s grocery delivery service, a free benefit of Prime in the UK instead of the monthly add-on fee or per-order charge it currently charges, the weekly magazine reported.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  The protest drew support from groups including Friends of the Earth and the \u201cGilets Jaunes\u201d, who have mounted months of demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron.  Some 240 people blocked access to Amazon's AMZN.O main office in Paris, organizers said, with many denouncing the online giant's business practices, saying it wasn't paying its fair share of tax or paying its employees a fair wage.  Around 70 people blockaded a distribution center in the southern city of Toulouse and another 80 were gathered at a center near Lille in the north, with workers forced to go home and operations at both warehouses halted, organizers said.  In a statement sent to Reuters, Amazon said it respected the right of protesters to express their opinion, but defended its business practices, saying it paid all the taxes it owed.  \u201cWe are very proud of our work environment and of the thousands of employees we have in France,\u201d it said. \u201cWe invite anyone who wants to come and visit any of our sites and form their own opinion.\u201d  The retailer earlier announced the creation of 1,800 new jobs in France as it looks to raise its number of permanent staff to 9,300 by the end of the year.  The demonstrators said they were angered by a report issued last week that showed France was falling behind on its commitments to reduce CO2 emissions and combat climate change.  \u201cWe have to be radical with our demands,\u201d said Alma Dufour, a Friends of the Earth campaigner. \u201cThere are no little steps left to take when it comes to climate change. We want a transformation of the system.\u201d  Organizers said the aim was not to have Amazon shut down in France but to cancel its plans for expansion in 2020.  The U.S. online retail giant has expanded rapidly in the French market, prompting domestic rivals to up their game.  But environmental activists say Amazon needs to do more to limit its environmental impact, including changing a policy of destroying unsold non-food items such as clothes, cosmetics and luxury goods.  French Prime Minister Edouard Phillipe called for a ban on the destruction of non-food items last month, saying he hoped it could be brought into effect within four years.  Protests against climate change have expanded across northern and western Europe in recent months, with Swedish teenaged activist Greta Thunberg leading a high-profile campaign in which students have walked out of school on Fridays.  Last Friday, French police used pepper spray to forcibly remove scores of members of the Extinction Rebellion group who were occupying a bridge over the River Seine.  The French government on Monday ordered an inquiry into tactics used against a peaceful protest.","130":"MUMBAI\/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos and Mukesh Ambani, two of the world\u2019s richest men, face a turning point in a battle for preeminence in India\u2019s booming, nearly trillion-dollar retail market.

The U.S. company, which won an injunction from an arbitrator to block the Reliance-Future deal, accuses its partner of breaching some pre-existing agreements, misleading the public and insider trading. Future denies the allegations.  Amazon, Reliance and Future did not respond to requests for comment.  Bezos\u2019s behemoth is a formidable foe, but Ambani has a history as a disrupter. He has shaken foreign telecom firms by offering dirt-cheap data. Industry executives see his e-commerce plans as a threat for Amazon and Walmart Inc\u2019s Flipkart.  \u201cIf Reliance moves faster and faster, obviously it\u2019ll become very difficult for anyone else to gain,\u201d said Himanshu Bajaj, head of consulting firm Kearney\u2019s India retail practice.  Reliance, seeking to expand its JioMart e-commerce business, this month completed a $6.4 billion fund-raising by selling a stake in its retail arm to such investors as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co.  GROCERIES, \u2018BIG BROTHER\u2019 IN AMERICA  India\u2019s retail market will grow 46% over the next four years to an annual $1.3 trillion, reckons Forrester Research. The key battle is over groceries, expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.  Founded by Kishore Biyani, dubbed India\u2019s retail king, Future transformed the country\u2019s retailing in recent decades, before COVID-19 hit the business so hard this year that Biyani was forced to find a new buyer.  Around 1,300 of Future\u2019s more than 1,700 retail outlets in 400 cities sell groceries. Its budget supermarkets cater to middle-class shoppers, while its upmarket stores offer products like imported cheese and fresh guacamole, relatively rare in India\u2019s retail landscape.  That makes Future a prized asset for both Reliance and Amazon.  Reliance and Future dominate the market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd\u2019s DMart, having just 220 outlets in around 70 cities.  While Reliance boasts around 11,000 retail stores, just 800 of those offer food and groceries, UBS estimates. Future\u2019s retail assets would nearly triple Reliance\u2019s footprint in the grocery segment and boost its e-commerce plans, said Forrester analyst Satish Meena.  Amazon sees Future as a long-term play to optimise its supply chain for grocery delivery, an area where it has lagged, Meena said.  \u201cGrocery is the category in which you fight,\u201d he said, while losing Future to Reliance would \u201cslow Amazon\u201d.  Amazon, Future and Reliance this month hired some of India\u2019s top lawyers, who argued at length before a New Delhi judge. She is expected to decide soon whether to restrain Amazon from approaching regulators to block the Future-Reliance deal.  Amid heated legal arguments and patriotic appeals, Future\u2019s lawyer attacked Amazon as \u201cBig Brother\u201d in America, arguing Future faces bankruptcy if the Reliance deal fails.  \u201cPlease don\u2019t allow this American giant to kill Future,\u201d the lawyer urged the judge.","131":"PARIS, April 14 (Reuters) - A French court on Tuesday ordered Amazon to limit its business to essential goods within 24 hours to allow for an assessment of epidemic risks, trade union Sud said on Tuesday.

Some unions had been calling for the complete closure of Amazon\u2019s activities in France, or at the very least a further clampdown on deliveries, after raising concerns over health standards during the coronavirus outbreak.  Amazon also came under scrutiny from labour inspectors and was told to improve conditions at five French sites.

A surge in demand for furniture, exercise equipment and other goods for shoppers sheltering at home in a worsening COVID-19 pandemic has upended normal trade flows.  That has stranded empty cargo containers in the wrong places, spawning bottlenecks that now stretch from factories to seaports. Container ship operators ferry the majority of consumer goods, and transportation and trade sources warn that prolonged industry disruption could cause shortages and complicate the global economic recovery. Thompson, founder of Washington-based Plugable Technologies, sells work-from-home staples like laptop docking stations. He diversified sourcing to be less reliant on a single country for manufacturing and less exposed to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.  Things did not go as planned and now, like many other importers, he is concerned about keeping enough product in stock. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved production out of China and moved ourselves right into a disadvantage,\u201d said Thompson.  His new factory in Thailand was first to suffer delays of about four weeks, in part because shipping companies routed empty containers to the top priority U.S.-China trade lane. Those logistical snags cascaded and now his remaining shipments from China - the world\u2019s No. 1 manufacturer \u2013 are postponed by as much as three weeks. And he is not alone - U.S. retailer Costco Wholesale Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd in the United Kingdom have also suffered delays. \u201cEveryone\u2019s trying to squeeze through this narrow opening all at once,\u201d said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Illinois-based Learning Resources which supplies educational toys to Amazon.com and other major retailers. It can \u201creally screw up your plans,\u201d he said. Container ships have been sailing at full load since August \u2013 something that has not happened in a decade, said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst with trade association BIMCO.  Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of Germany\u2019s Hapag-Lloyd, told investors that the container line was \u201cdeploying every available ship\u201d. MOUNTING FRUSTRATION Frustration is building.

Port staffing reductions due to COVID safety rules also play a part.  \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of strong volume and slower and less efficient operations,\u201d said Lars Mikael Jensen, head of network with Denmark\u2019s A.P.

An Apple logo is seen in the window of an authorised apple reseller store in Galway, Ireland August 30, 2016. REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  With Microsoft and Apple rallying almost 3 percent, Apple\u2019s market capitalization for a few seconds was $806.6 billion, exceeding Microsoft\u2019s by $200 million and Amazon\u2019s by about $1.2 billion.  Microsoft quickly returned to its spot as the most valuable company, but Apple was on track to end the session above Amazon, up 0.4 percent, taking the No 2 spot.  Average analyst price targets imply Amazon would become by far the most valuable U.S. publicly-listed company at $1.03 trillion, followed by Microsoft at $967 billion, Alphabet at $927 billion and Apple at just $835 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Tech heavyweights' market cap - tmsnrt.rs\/2HTwYRR  Apple\u2019s stock has risen 11 percent since its quarterly report last Tuesday, with investors betting it was oversold following months of concern about a slowdown in iPhone demand, and the company\u2019s rare revenue warning on Jan. 2 related to soft demand in China.  After touching a record $1.1 trillion last October, Apple\u2019s market capitalization fell gradually, and it was overtaken in December by Amazon and Microsoft.  Apple\u2019s stock market value hit a low of $675 billion on Jan. 3 after its revenue warning, but then steadily recovered, helped in part by a quarterly report that was better than feared by investors.  While Apple has gained in recent sessions, Microsoft and Amazon\u2019s stocks have fallen after their quarterly reports. Amazon has declined about 4 percent since Thursday, when it forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates and warned over new regulations in India.  Since Wednesday, when Microsoft met targets for its quarterly results and forecast, its stock has slipped nearly 1 percent.  Google-parent Alphabet was up 2.6 percent, putting its stock market value at $788 billion. After the bell, the company is expected to post quarterly revenue of $38.9 billion, up 20 percent, and a 12 percent increase in non-GAAP net income to $7.7 billion, according to Refinitiv data.","135":"(Reuters) - Kohl\u2019s Corp forecast full-year profit above Wall Street estimates on Tuesday, as partnerships with Amazon and a range of new brands attract more shoppers.

It signed a deal with Amazon to display its Echo dot speakers and Kindle e-readers in its stores, while it partnered with millennial-focused Popsugar to launch a new line of clothes.  Earlier this year, Kohl\u2019s teamed up with Weight Watchers to promote a healthy lifestyle through workshops and events at its Chicago store, which is expected to push sales of kitchenware and cookware.  \u201cI definitely think Kohl\u2019s initiatives are working,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said, pointing to several factors including improvements in its loyalty program and the partnership with Amazon.  For the three months ended Feb. 2, Kohl\u2019s sales at stores open for more than a year rose 1 percent, above the 0.3 percent Wall Street had expected.  In contrast, last week Macy\u2019s Inc reported same-store sales growth that rose an anemic 0.7 percent, but missed Wall Street forecasts. Target Corp posted a 5.3 percent rise in sales and beat expectations.  Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl\u2019s projected earnings of $5.80 to $6.15 per share for fiscal year 2019.

Over the past two years, major U.S. retailers, including Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Kohls Corp and others, have spent billions of dollars to overhaul existing programs or launch new loyalty schemes. According to estimates compiled by market intelligence firm Beroe, the U.S. loyalty program market was worth between $47 billion and $55 billion in 2018 in terms of spending by companies and sector analysts expect it to keep growing by 2 percent to 4 percent a year between 2018-2020.  Data from research firm LoyaltyOne showed retailers now invest at least 2 percent of their total revenue on loyalty programs and double that or more on related customer targeting and analytics. Department stores and apparel retailers typically invest more than the others.  Its report \u201cLoyalty Big Picture\u201d based on an international survey of 1,200 loyalty plan providers and some 4,500 members said 69 percent of executives reported a rise in spending on royalty schemes over the past two years, and 55 percent expected a further increase in investment in the next two years.  Around in some form for over a century, loyalty programs have long relied on a simple concept - reward shoppers with coupons, discounts, prizes or air miles and they will come back.  E-commerce has changed that.  It has made shopping around for bargains easier than ever while Amazon\u2019s Prime program set a new benchmark with perks, such as free two-day shipping, video streaming or cloud storage.  Just last month, Amazon raised the stakes again announcing it would spend $800 million to ensure one-day delivery for its Prime members.  \u201cIn the age of Amazon, it\u2019s very much \u2018what have you done for me lately type of retail environment\u2019,\u201d Matt Lindner, senior ecommerce analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel.  \u201cThe challenge these retailers are facing is how do you offer attractive rewards without totally compromising your bottom line.\u201d  Realizing that expensive advertising is unlike to win back shoppers lost to online rivals, traditional retailers have shifted their focus to retaining existing customers and making them spend more, industry analysts say.  \u2018BIGGEST AND BADDEST\u2019  Those most successful have employed sophisticated data gathering and analytics to better tailor offers to customers\u2019 tastes while providing perks that Amazon cannot match, such as private dressing rooms, members-only stores or beauty workshops.  \u201cRetailers are finally realizing that they need to respond to the \u2018biggest and baddest\u2019 loyalty program in the market right now and that is Amazon Prime,\u201d research firm Gartner director Tom Gehani said.  They have done so over the past five years by combining revamped loyalty schemes with increased online presence, in-store pickup for online purchases, upgraded stores and new or improved mobile apps that tie in with loyalty programs.  Macy\u2019s, for example, relaunched its scheme in mid-2017 after 10 straight quarters of comparable sales declines as a tiered plan with special privileges to its most loyal and big spending customers. The perks include ticketed seats to Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade sales, concerts, fashion shows and cooking classes.  When a year later, Macy\u2019s reported third quarter 2018 earnings that nearly doubled Wall Street\u2019s predictions, the department store chain attributed some of the growth to its \u201cStar Rewards\u201d program.  \u201cThe program is outperforming our expectation,\u201d Macy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gennette said in February.  Rival Nordstrom redesigned its customer loyalty program, \u201cThe Nordy Club\u201d, in October 2018. It offers more reward points, fast redemptions, curbside pickup of purchases, and perks such as beauty and style workshops or brands not available to other shoppers. Today, the program\u2019s 11 million members account for a third of Nordstrom\u2019s customers and over half of its sales.  Members can also save items in an app that will send push notifications to remind them of their wish list once they get close enough to a Nordstrom store.  Only three or four years ago the retailer would spend most of its advertising dollars on seasonal campaigns, said Sean Claessen, executive vice president of Bond Brand Loyalty.  \u201cYou are now seeing them turn their attention to the \u2018Nordy Club\u2019 and those kind of components,\u201d he said.  Brand retailers have also joined the fray.  J Crew launched its first rewards program in July 2018 with free shipping and exclusive sales and offers, while Nike has a members-only floor at its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City.  Members of its no-fee NikePlus program get free courier delivery for purchases at the store, exclusive access to in-demand shoes and one-on-one assessments by its experts.  \u201cMy favorite perks would be the fact that they can reserve a pair of sneakers for you, also exclusive wear where you can only get it if you\u2019re a member and birthday discounts,\u201d said Carlos Pena, 23, a college student from New York City. Pena said he bought a pair of sneakers for his 22th birthday using the program\u2019s discount.  In December, Lululemon said it was testing its first ever annual membership program for $128 with perks such as access to workout classes, free shipping and a pair of yoga pants.  \u201cThe standards of what it takes to win and keep customers are just going to keep getting higher,\u201d Gartner\u2019s Gehani said. \u201cAmazon is a company that has risen to meet that challenge and every other retailer is learning that they need to continually rise to meet that challenge too.\u201d (Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru Additional reporting by Melissa Fares in New York Editing by Tomasz Janowski)","137":"Nov 7 (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s Zip Co Ltd said on Thursday that Amazon Inc\u2019s local unit will offer its buy now, pay later platform as a payment option, a sign of its growing popularity despite heightened regulatory scrutiny.

As part of the deal, Zip will issue warrants to buy as much as 14.6 million of its shares to an affiliate of Amazon.  The move highlights the growing popularity of installment-based payment options, especially with Millennial and Gen Z shoppers due to its accessibility in comparison with traditional credit routes.  However, the success of the buy now, pay later (BNPL) sector has also brought greater regulatory scrutiny.

Together with Facebook, the five largest U.S. companies account for 15 percent of the S&P 500.

The U.S. retail giant has seen sales soar globally as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus sent consumers online, making it difficult for some bricks-and-mortar shops to compete.  To level the playing field, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire this week called on supermarkets and online retailers to postpone Black Friday, which runs from Nov. 27 to Nov. 29, as shops selling non-essential goods would have to remain closed during lockdown.  Competition from Amazon first prompted European retailers to adopt the U.S. tradition of making Black Friday - the day after U.S. Thanksgiving - the kickoff to the holiday shopping season.  Amazon France Chief Executive Frederic Duval said on Thursday the company would push the event back to Dec. 4, joining other retailers such as European market leader Carrefour and France\u2019s Leclerc.  \u201cWe have decided to delay the date of Black Friday if this can help shopkeepers reopen before Dec. 1,\u201d Duval said on TF1 television on Thursday.  Amazon confirmed Duval\u2019s comments in an emailed statement, but did not respond to requests for further comment on Friday.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Online and traditional retailers unanimously agreed on Friday to push back Black Friday sales by a week on condition stores would be allowed to reopen by then, the Finance Ministry said after a meeting with sector representatives.  While helping to generate record profits, the coronavirus crisis has also triggered scrutiny of Amazon\u2019s efforts to protect staff from the pandemic, particularly in France, where a lengthy battle over safety measures led to the temporary closure of warehouses.  Amazon\u2019s ability to keep selling during the lockdown has also deepened frustration among opponents of the company in France who say it represents a U.S.-style consumer culture at odds with the country\u2019s long tradition of mom-and-pop neighborhood stores.  Some 30,000 people have signed an online petition to boycott Amazon, according to its organiser, lawmaker Mathieu Orphelin, who left President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party last year to set up a more environmentally focused party.  \u201cA lot of people use our name to get noticed, but Amazon makes up only 1% of retail in France,\u201d Duval said, when asked on France Info radio on Friday how to explain negative sentiment against his company.  President Emmanuel Macron has said France\u2019s second national lockdown, which started on Oct. 30, would last at least four weeks. Curbs include the closure of non-essential stores, restaurants and bars.  But with recent data showing France on track to rein in a surge in coronavirus infections, the government is under pressure from shops and businesses to ease restrictions at the end of November in time for the Christmas shopping season, when many retailers make the bulk of their annual turnover.  Eager to keep shoppers from crowding stores to swoop on potential discounts, the finance ministry said on Thursday that a one-week delay in Black Friday sales would help ensure shops reopen in France under maximum safety conditions.","142":"March 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc:  * AMAZON EXTENDS POLICY ON PRIORITIZING ESSENTIAL ITEMS BEYOND APRIL 5 - AMAZON SERVICES SELLER FORUMS  * AMAZON SAYS LIST OF ESSENTIAL ITEMS WILL BROADEN ON ITEM-BY-ITEM BASIS, GIVEN CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS - AMAZON SERVICES SELLER FORUMS Further company coverage:","143":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said it has launched a pilot program in New York that allows consumers dependant on food stamps to use them to buy groceries online, a move that is likely to boost sales at retailers like Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc.

Net income jumped 63 percent to $3 billion for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates.  Yet investors focused their attention on Amazon\u2019s international operation, where the company has long lost money in the hopes of future profit. Though its international operating loss shrunk to $642 million in the quarter from $919 million a year earlier, new regulations in India are poised to take a toll. The rules seek to protect local businesses by prohibiting foreign e-commerce companies from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest.  Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters that the \u201csituation in India is a bit fluid right now.\u201d  The company began removing a wide array of products from its India website late on Thursday to comply with the new foreign investment curbs that kick in on Feb. 1, Reuters reported.  Still, Olsavsky said, \u201cIndia remains a good long-term opportunity.\u201d  Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird Equity Research, said, \u201cThe issues in India are taking a toll on the Q1 outlook, even as growth overall slows domestically. Not a bad report, but there are enough questions where (the) stock will likely be under pressure.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  HIGHER SPENDING  The company forecast net sales of between $56 billion and $60 billion for the first quarter, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $60.77 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The guidance includes two percentage points of negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates.  Olsavsky said that investments would increase this year. The company had little need to splurge in 2018 thanks to prior spending on warehouses, headcount and other areas, boosting profit. But this year investments will rise, though Olsavsky did not detail where or how much.  \u201cAs a result, the profit story in \u201819 may not be as good as it was in \u201818,\u201d said Tom Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson, adding that this might not be a bad thing.  \u201cIf they are stepping on the accelerator, that means they like what they\u2019re seeing, and it\u2019s worthy of more investment,\u201d he said.  Amazon forecast operating income will be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion this quarter, compared with $1.9 billion a year earlier.  A large chunk of the company\u2019s hiring has gone to Amazon Web Services, its lucrative business selling data storage and computing power in the cloud. Revenue for the unit surged 45.3 percent to $7.43 billion, beating an average estimate of $7.26 billion.  Overall, net sales for the fourth quarter were $72.38 billion and beat analysts\u2019 average estimate of $71.87 billion on the back of a strong holiday season, which includes the major U.S. shopping event Black Friday.  The results demonstrate that Amazon continued its \u201crelentless assault\u201d on other retailers over Christmas, Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.  Amazon said tens of millions of shoppers signed up for its loyalty club Prime during the season - more than in any prior quarter - helping boost revenue from subscription fees 25 percent to $4.0 billion. The company said last year it has more than 100 million Prime members globally.  This expansive customer base has lured merchants to sell goods on the company\u2019s marketplace, to the point where more than half of products sold on Amazon come from third-parties.  Making Amazon more profitable still are ad sales. The company now ranks alongside Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc as titans in marketing, letting these same merchants pay for high placement in Amazon\u2019s search results.  Ad sales and \u201cother\u201d revenue jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.","147":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is temporarily blocking third-party sellers from using FedEx Corp's FDX.N ground delivery network to handle Prime shipments as it strives to hit accelerated delivery deadlines this holiday season.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  This is likely to affect only a small number of sellers but \u201climits the options for those small businesses on some of the highest-demand shipping days in history,\u201d a FedEx representative said.  Amazon and FedEx did not say how many packages would be affected by the restriction. Amazon declined to say how long the move would last. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that the ban was due to FedEx\u2019s on-time performance.  Amazon said sellers can still use FedEx\u2019s pricier and faster Express services, including air transport, for Prime deliveries. The FedEx Ground and Home delivery options that are temporarily restricted for sellers\u2019 Prime shipments remain available for non-Prime shipments. Third-party sellers offer more than 50% of the goods on Amazon\u2019s site.  Amazon Prime members pay $119 per year for fast, \u201cfree\u201d delivery.  Tensions between Amazon and FedEx became public this summer. FedEx canceled its delivery agreements with the world\u2019s leading online retailer just months after Amazon announced plans to speed up Prime shipping to one day from two days on millions of items.  On-time delivery rates during the record-setting Cyber Monday sales week were 90.4% for FedEx Corp, 92.3% for the U.S. Postal Service and 92.7% for United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, according to consultancy ShipMatrix.  Amazon van drivers delivered 93.7% of U.S. packages on time during that week.  ShipMatrix President Satish Jindel said the performances were not directly comparable because Amazon vans handle short-distance \u201clast-mile\u201d deliveries from fulfillment centers to customer doorsteps. Major shippers like FedEx and UPS move packages great distances - at times from factories on one U.S. coast to customer doorsteps on another - and are more exposed to weather and other disruptions.  News of the FedEx restrictions hit just ahead of FedEx\u2019s quarterly financial report on Tuesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about service, it\u2019s about being irritated with the relationship,\u201d Jindel said of Amazon\u2019s decision.  And it could have unintended consequences for Amazon, which is under increasing scrutiny from regulators, labor groups and consumer protection advocates.  \u201cIt will create more ill will toward Amazon and drive more third-party sellers to re-evaluate how they are managing their brands and if they want to be dictated to by Amazon,\u201d said Evan Armstrong, president of supply chain consulting firm Armstrong & Associates.","148":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen on the door of an Amazon Books retail store in New York City, U.S., February 14, 2019.

The FTC said Amazon in 2015 advertised that a program called Flex would pay drivers $18 to $25 an hour to make deliveries and that they would receive 100% of any tips.

The chief executives of Abbott Laboratories and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc have told Amazon they would like to work with the e-commerce company, though the U.S. government is taking up all of their testing capacity at present, the notes said.  The company also discussed whether it could start such tests in at least one warehouse near its Seattle headquarters, the status of which was unclear. The nature of Amazon\u2019s conversations with the test makers and the exact assistance they might offer were unclear.  The document separately indicated Amazon is looking into the ability to screen more than one person at a time for the virus, and it also wants to partner with a medical organization in its testing efforts. It did not give further details on multi-person testing or name a partner.  In a statement on Saturday, Abbott Laboratories confirmed it has been contacted by Amazon and other companies to provide testing for their workforces.  \u201cWe know it\u2019s important for several industries for their workforces to be safe, but as we\u2019ve said, right now we\u2019ve prioritized the healthcare frontline workforce in outbreak hotspots and have been working with the White House Task Force, FDA, FEMA and CDC and state authorities to ensure they get to those areas,\u201d said an Abbott spokesperson.  Thermo Fisher did not return a request for comment late Friday. Amazon declined to comment.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, is rolling out face masks and temperature checks for workers at all its U.S. and European warehouses by next week.  Longer term, however, it wants to test workers for the virus and hopes other companies will follow suit, according to the notes, in which Amazon\u2019s general counsel also criticized an employee who was fired on Monday.  The notes reveal how the company is focused on coronavirus testing as important to its operation and to bolstering the U.S. economy. They also show how Amazon remains in the early stages of determining how to start checks for the virus and tackle a shortage of tests.  The attempts to increase screening measures come at a time when high-profile protests have hit several Amazon warehouses, as employees increasingly fear they will contract the virus by showing up to work. The COVID-19 disease already has been reported among staff from at least 19 of its U.S. warehouses.  More than a million people globally have been infected and more than 58,000 have died in the pandemic.  Abbott has U.S. marketing approval for a diagnostic test that can give patients results in minutes, for use in physicians\u2019 offices and other community healthcare settings. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a Thermo Fisher test as well.  The type of evaluation Amazon was considering was also unclear, whether diagnostic to detect current infections or an antibody test to tell if someone may be immune.  Amazon has had a growing interest in healthcare. The company announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co two years ago to lower health costs for their employees, a venture now known as Haven.

Decisions including one on Wednesday by officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed an unusual appeal by Amazon to block the non-binding proposals from being voted on at the company\u2019s upcoming annual meeting.  One proposal would require Amazon to cease offering facial recognition to governments unless the company\u2019s board determined sales did not violate civil liberties. A second would call for an audit to examine the harm to rights and privacy, if any, that might result from the service, known as Rekognition.  Both proposals face uphill battles to receive a majority of support from investors in the world\u2019s largest online retailer and cloud computing company. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos will retain voting rights over about 16 percent of shares after he and MacKenzie Bezos divorce, she said on Thursday.  Amazon declined to comment on the SEC decisions. The company is one of many marketers of facial recognition technology and has disclosed sales to law enforcement and to private customers using the service for purposes such as identifying celebrities.  Civil liberties groups have raised concerns including findings by researchers that Amazon\u2019s technology struggles more than some peers\u2019 to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, prompting fears of unjust arrests. Amazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law.  Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC, an advocacy group working with shareholders, including a religious order, who brought the resolutions, said the SEC decisions show the developing rules around facial recognition are \u201creally a critical issue for a company like Amazon and how it handles the business risk associated with the technology.\u201d  According to correspondence posted on the SEC website, Amazon had sought the regulator\u2019s permission to skip the proposals as being insignificant to its business, among other things, but was turned down on March 28.  Amazon then took the unusual step of asking for a reconsideration of that decision, but was again rebuffed in a April 3 letter from the agency.  Other letters show the SEC gave Amazon permission to skip proposals for things like a risk oversight committee, and that Amazon resolved climate concerns raised by other investors.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com\u2019s aggression has a sustainable fuel supply. The $840 billion e-commerce giant\u2019s holiday quarter sparkled with revenue growing 20 percent. Web services and advertising are two of the biggest sources of this expansion. They\u2019re also the most profitable \u2013 and have plenty of juice left in the tank.  Amazon\u2019s growth may be somewhat slower than in the past, but it is remarkable to see a company this big expand at such a pace. One supporting factor is that Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has largely managed to finance the business with the significant amount of cash it generates. He has also followed up well on his belief that new markets, such as grocery delivery or online video, are worth entering.  Amazon Web Services is particularly powerful. At $7.4 billion, its top line jumped by 45 percent in the three months to the end of December. And its operating margin expanded to 28 percent. That means it accounted for more than half of Amazon\u2019s overall $3.8 billion operating profit in the three months to the end of December.  Advertising margins may well be higher as the business sells an extra service on top of Amazon\u2019s existing web pages. Amazon doesn\u2019t break out its revenue, but advertising is the major component of the \u201cother\u201d line in earnings. That ballooned 95 percent to $3.4 billion.  Growth isn\u2019t likely to taper significantly for these businesses for a long time. Only about 7 percent of all enterprise IT spending is currently on cloud-based services, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. And despite so many consumers using Amazon as their default place to search for goods, the ad revenue generated by Bezos\u2019s company pales beside that of Alphabet, which is likely to record over $30 billion worth in the fourth quarter, based on I\/B\/E\/S\/ data from Refinitiv.  Shareholders may occasionally grumble that Amazon always deploys all the capital it generates into expansion. Its twin profit engines of web services and advertising look set to generate substantially more for some time. Bezos doubtless already has plenty of ideas about how to use it.","157":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon Web Services (AWS) is seen during the 4th annual America Digital Latin American Congress of Business and Technology in Santiago, Chile, September 5, 2018.

You have to know what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working.\u201d  He cited Netflix\u2019s decision to cannibalize its own DVD rental business in favor of streaming.  The focus on the future is fitting given Jassy\u2019s career is defined by his leading Amazon into a wholly new market: cloud computing. Amazon Web Services rents space and software programming for customers to run their technical operations on the company\u2019s servers. The arm now fuels Amazon\u2019s profits and dominates the cloud market just as the company leads the world of e-commerce.  Jassy, who joined Amazon after graduating from Harvard Business School, worked as a technical assistant for Bezos in the early 2000s and was instrumental in leading the company\u2019s push outside of book sales.  Jassy\u2019s rise to the top job looked clear after longtime executive and consumer chief Jeff Wilke announced his retirement after more than two decades with the company. Wilke was Amazon\u2019s second most high-ranking official along with Jassy.  His attitude of embracing change also made him a favorite.  At the same speech in December, Jassy noted just 83 of the Fortune 500 companies from 1970 are still on the list -- and only half are on the list from 2000.  \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to build a business that sustains for a long period of time,\u201d Jassy said, adding, to stay on the list, he said, \u201cyou are going to have to reinvent yourself\u201d and often more than once.  He said the pandemic has boosted the shift to the cloud.  \u201cWhen you look back on the history of the cloud it will turn out the pandemic accelerated cloud adoption by several years,\u201d Jassy said.

Boozt and other Nordic retailers are, however, bracing for a pick-up in competition after U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon.com AMZN.O said earlier this month it was preparing to launch a Swedish site, confirming long-running rumours.  Boozt said second-quarter sales rose 38% from a year earlier to 1.22 billion Swedish crowns ($140.2 million) as its core platform Boozt.com grew 29% and cut-price Booztlet.com - on which the group has said it is increasing focus - jumped 168%.  Operating profit leapt 146%, to 120 million crowns.  \u201cThe migration from offline to online has accelerated and we have worked hard to strengthen our market position,\u201d CEO Hermann Haraldsson said.  \u201cWe welcomed more than 300,000 new Nordic customers to our platforms during the second quarter and they, as well as our returning customers, have increasingly shopped in our adjacent categories to fashion, such as kids, sport, and beauty. Men also increased its share of revenue,\u201d he said.  Boozt\u2019s shares were up 7% in early trade, taking their year-to-date rise to 116%.  Physical stores in the Nordic countries have largely not been forced to shut down during the pandemic, but other government restrictions and wariness among consumers have reduced footfall to varying extents.  Boozt, which does around 95% of business in the Nordics, forecast a full-year operating margin of 3.5-4.5%. In June it had forecast a margin of 3-4% on sales growth of 20-25%, a sharp increase on its previous projections.","166":"FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016.

As the virus spreads across the United States, Amazon has offered unlimited unpaid time off to encourage employees to stay home if they don\u2019t feel well. It has also staggered workers shifts and prohibited employees from sitting next to each other in the lunchroom to limit contact.  But four Democratic U.S. senators, including Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders on Friday expressed concern in a letter to Amazon\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos that the world\u2019s largest online retailer has not taken enough measures to protect its warehouse staff. They specifically asked if the company would provide \u201ctime-and-a-half\u201d hazard pay for its workers. {nL1N2BE02N]  Amazon on Thursday reported its first warehouse employee in the United States tested positive for the virus, forcing the company to temporarily shutter a warehouse in New York.

Online retailers and grocery stores are trying to capture rising demand as more Americans are ordered to stay at home to reduce the spread of the outbreak.  Rival retailer Walmart Inc said on Thursday it plans to hire 150,000 hourly associates in the U.S. and announced $550 million in cash bonuses to reward workers.

Tri Huynh, a former director of business development, accused Walmart of having betrayed the principles of integrity and honesty espoused by founder Sam Walton in its push to show \u201cmeteoric growth\u201d in e-commerce.  The complaint alleges various wrongdoing, including the mislabeling of products, enabling Walmart to charge excessive sales commissions, and failure to properly process customer returns, enabling it to boost results.  \u201cWal-Mart cut corners and cheated in a race to expand and gain market-share,\u201d having been \u201cdesperate to gain the ground it had long lost to Amazon,\u201d Huynh said in his complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.  Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the litigation is based on allegations by a disgruntled former employee, who was let go when the business was restructured.  \u201cWe take allegations like this seriously and looked into them when they were brought to our attention,\u201d he said. \u201cThe investigation found nothing to suggest that the company acted improperly.\u201d  Walmart will vigorously defend itself against the claims, Hargrove added.  The retailer\u2019s shares closed down 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $87.51, after earlier falling as much as 2 percent.  The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has spent billions of dollars in recent years to compete with Amazon, including through its 2016 purchase of Jet.com, and last month said quarterly online sales, including the December holidays, had risen 23 percent.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  But Amazon\u2019s sales in North America grew 40 percent in the same quarter, and analysts have said its price war has weighed on Walmart\u2019s margins.  Huynh accused Walmart of charging higher sales commissions from sellers on its online marketplace, where third-party sellers list and sell products, with commissions rising as high as 15 percent compared with the normal 6 percent to 8 percent.  Walmart\u2019s internal controls allegedly failed to detect the problem, causing the retailer to overstate revenue.  Huynh also said Walmart failed to process more than $7 million of customer returns, inflating the total value of merchandise sold from September 2015 to March 2016.  The plaintiff, who was born in Vietnam and lives in Washington state, said Walmart abruptly fired him in January 2017 in retaliation for his repeated complaints about its e-commerce reporting and internal controls.  Huynh said he was fired not long after raising concerns with U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore, and was dismissed under the \u201cfalse pretenses\u201d of a broader workforce reduction and alleged performance issues.  He said he had told human resources the prior May of his efforts to deal with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  \u201cWal-Mart sacrificed and betrayed its Founder\u2019s key principles of integrity and honesty, pushing those core values aside in its rush to win the E-commerce war at all costs,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cIn doing this, it realized it must silence any whistleblower who spoke up.\u201d  The lawsuit, which accuses Walmart of violating the federal Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower law and various California state laws, seeks punitive and other damages.

Separately on Wednesday, the e-commerce giant said it had partnered with homebuilder Lennar Corp to convert some of the home construction company\u2019s model homes into showrooms for Alexa.  Amazon\u2019s latest deal is another sign that the online behemoth sees the value of in-store pickup and in-person service that\u2019s core to brick-and-mortar retail, that it and rivals see room to cooperate.  Over the past year, the online retailing giant has entered into partnerships with physical chains such as department store operator Kohl\u2019s Corp to sell Amazon-branded items as well as use its retail locations for picking up online orders. .  In April, Amazon tapped electronics chain Best Buy to sell smart televisions with the capabilities of its artificial assistant, Alexa, baked in. In return, Best Buy would become the exclusive merchant of these TVs on Amazon.com.  For Sears, the new deal extends its partnership with Amazon, where it already sells its Kenmore home appliances. It is a welcome boost for the struggling company that has seen years of declining sales as competition within the retail industry intensifies from the likes of Wal-Mart and other e-commerce platforms.  Sears said the service would roll out to its Sears Auto Centers centers in the U.S. over the next couple of weeks.  The company\u2019s shares were up 21 percent at $3.35 in afternoon trading.

Amazon is keen to get a piece of Brazil\u2019s roughly $30 billion in spending on make-up, hair treatments and other personal care products \u2014 behind just the United States, China and Japan.  The e-commerce giant\u2019s aggressive cosmetics play, less than a year after it expanded beyond books and streaming video in Latin America\u2019s largest economy, flips the company\u2019s usual playbook. In other markets, Amazon focused on beauty products years after establishing itself in core segments such as electronics, toys and home goods.  Amazon said in an emailed response that in the last five years it has \u201cheld hundreds of meetings with potential sellers and suppliers about its Brazil business and possible future plans,\u201d adding that the company would not \u201cspeculate about future plans.\u201d  Natura and Boticario did not respond to requests for comment.  Partnering with Amazon would accelerate the cautious approach that Brazil\u2019s major cosmetics firms have taken so far with e-commerce, as they try to protect profit margins and longstanding relationships in traditional sales channels.  Natura has been reluctant to shake up a network of more than 1 million direct sales \u201cconsultants\u201d in Brazil, sticking to a business model pioneered by Avon Products Inc. In 2014, Natura began offering its independent sellers tools for online sales, which now account for less than 4 percent of total sales in the country.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  A source with direct knowledge of Natura\u2019s thinking said the company had met as recently as last week with Amazon, but was still mulling its proposals.  Privately-held Boticario has relied on franchisees to build a network of some 4,000 stores. The company may sell non-proprietary products via Amazon platforms in Brazil, such as make-up from Revlon Inc, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations.  The person said talks between the companies began \u201cquite recently\u201d and Boticario was not looking to sell proprietary brands on Amazon platforms \u201cfor now.\u201d  So far, Amazon has relied on third-party vendors to ship their own goods sold on its Brazilian website. However, several moves this year suggest the company is ramping up its own logistics presence in the country.  In February, Reuters reported that Amazon was looking to lease a warehouse near Sao Paulo, in a sign that it could soon begin fulfilling orders in Brazil.  In April, Reuters reported that Amazon was in talks with Brazilian airline Azul SA to ship goods domestically, laying the groundwork for speedy nationwide distribution.","177":"MADRID\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chico\u2019s FAS Inc warned in January that it would shutter at least 250 stores across its namesake brand, along with its White House Black Market and Soma labels.  But the U.S. women\u2019s clothing chain is expanding a different storefront - its Chico\u2019s-branded micro site on Amazon.com Inc.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer now sells around 2,300 Chico\u2019s styles, from crease-proof trousers to fine-knit sweaters, representing nearly six times more product offerings than when it started last May, Chico\u2019s told Reuters.  While that growth should entice any retailer, Chico\u2019s is one of a growing number of clothing brands treading carefully.  From Nike Inc and Under Armour Inc to Lands\u2019 End Inc and Levi Strauss & Co, major brands are distributing clothing and accessories directly through Amazon.com, attracted by more than 100 million members of Amazon\u2019s loyalty club Prime and its advanced delivery network.  The risk in this relationship, according to interviews with retailers and industry analysts, comes if Amazon uses real-time data from customer purchases to help it quickly build out its own private label clothing brands, and ends up stealing market share from its current retail partners.  \u201cThe word that\u2019s most commonly used with respect to Amazon from a brand perspective, and also retailers to some extent, is \u2018frenemy,\u2019\u201d said Kate Delhagen, an independent retail consultant and former senior director of global digital business development at Nike. She had input into Nike\u2019s decision process to partner with Amazon, but left the shoe company shortly before the deal was finalized in July 2017.  Recognizing the concern from retailers, the European Commission has launched a preliminary antitrust investigation into Amazon and whether it might \u201cgain access to competitively sensitive information about competitors\u2019 products which it could use to boost its own retail activities at the expense of third party sellers on its marketplace,\u201d an EU spokesman said.  The company told Reuters it does not use an individual seller\u2019s data to give its private label products an advantage.  It declined to comment on the early-stage probe, or say how many private label clothing brands it had and how fast it was churning out new ones.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  A spokeswoman noted that Amazon\u2019s private label products account for about 1 percent of its total retail sales. \u201cOur private brands supplement the great assortment that our selling partners provide,\u201d she said.  A Nike spokeswoman said its business with Amazon continued to perform well, but said the company\u2019s approach was broader than Amazon alone and that it continued to engage with a number of digital marketplaces.  To sell through Amazon, Chico\u2019s and other clothing retailers can either sell product to Amazon in a traditional wholesale relationship or sell directly to consumers as third-party merchants, paying a 17 percent referral fee on clothing and accessories sold.  Retailers pay Amazon extra to store and ship their orders under the \u2018fulfillment by Amazon\u2019 model.  Amazon has set a goal of being a leader in the apparel space for around a decade, former Amazon director Mike Pazak told Reuters, and has invested heavily in the sector. It has recently ramped up its own private label apparel brands.  It had 109 of its own brands in clothing, shoes and jewelry categories at the start of 2019, which is more than a five-fold increase over two years, according to TJI Research.  \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re aware of and understand the risks,\u201d said George Nahra, senior vice president of strategy, business development and international at Chico\u2019s, which flies executives to Seattle regularly to review the growing Amazon business.  OVERTAKING WALMART  Amazon markets fashion across the world from Brazil to China. It has made its Prime Wardrobe concept, which allows Prime members to order clothing with no upfront charge and free delivery, available in the United States, Britain and Japan.  The online giant has sponsored fashion weeks in the United States, Mexico, Japan and India and has photography studios for fashion shoots in New York, London, Tokyo and New Delhi. It is a patron of the British Fashion Council.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States, according to a Coresight Research survey.  In Britain, Amazon has outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC as the most-shopped clothing retailer, according to an HSBC survey.  Amazon Prime member Abby Kidd bought a pair of Silver brand $80 jeans the first time she used the Prime Wardrobe service.  \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll look anywhere else for jeans as long as Amazon keeps expanding their options,\u201d said the 35-year-old private tutor, based in Oak Harbor, Washington who also shops at chain stores Macy\u2019s Inc and Maurices.  Classic American clothing retailer Lands\u2019 End turned to Amazon more than a year ago when it looked to increase sales after a bruising exit from previous owner Sears.  \u201cWe\u2019d be ostriches sticking our heads in the sand if we didn\u2019t take heed and pay attention to where customers are going,\u201d said Sarah Rasmusen, senior vice president of e-commerce at Lands\u2019 End, founded in the 1960s as a mail-order business.  Lands\u2019 End started selling core items such as flannel shirts and down coats on Amazon in February last year as part of its strategy to branch out from troubled Sears stores, where it has lost dozens of retail locations.  Lands\u2019 End\u2019s key swimwear lines compete with Amazon\u2019s Coastal Blue swimwear private label on the site.  Both Chico\u2019s and Lands\u2019 End declined to say what percentage of their sales were made through Amazon, but said the platform was a useful customer acquisition tool that was not drawing clients away from their own e-commerce sites.  A gripe for retailers is that selling on Amazon loses the direct customer relationship they get from their own website or store.  \u201cYou don\u2019t know where your customer\u2019s coming from, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re clicking on once they get to the site,\u201d said Melanie Travis, founder of upmarket swimwear brand Andie who has talked to Amazon, but decided against selling on the platform.  Others are satisfied with the limited data they get from Amazon. For instance, Chico\u2019s gets enough to mail catalogs to new Amazon customers, said senior vice president Nahra.  Canadian shoe retailer Aldo, which deepened its 10-year relationship with Amazon to a wholesale model this year, said it receives more information as a result, such as the basket composition of customers who buy Aldo\u2019s products on Amazon. That allows it to adapt its product offering accordingly.  Insights shared by Amazon can influence how the retailer designs collections, Aldo said. Its products compete with Amazon\u2019s footwear private label The Fix on the platform.  \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting partnership you get by selling to Amazon instead of selling through Amazon,\u201d said Justin Cohen, senior director of e-commerce for Aldo North America. \u201cWe\u2019re just starting to lean back into that relationship.\u201d","178":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, January 19, 2019.

British retailers\u2019 investment plans are the lowest in seven years ahead of Brexit, and job cuts in the sector have gathered pace, according to a survey from the Confederation of British Industry, published on Friday.  Amazon said the new apprentices would add to more than 27,500 permanent employees currently in Britain.  Last June, the group said it was committed to the country. It added more than 2,500 permanent jobs in Britain in 2018.  Once qualified, the apprentices will work across Amazon\u2019s UK corporate and operations sites, including its UK head office in London and three development centers in Edinburgh, Cambridge in eastern England and in the capital where teams work on innovations including Alexa, machine learning, Prime Video, Prime Air and Amazon\u2019s advanced distribution centers.","179":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday forecast a jump in holiday sales - and costs related to COVID-19 - as consumers continued to shop more online during the pandemic.  A company executive added that heightened spending on delivery infrastructure would likely continue over years, and shares fell 2% in after-hours trading.  Since the start of the virus outbreak in the United States eight months ago, consumers have turned increasingly to Amazon for delivery of groceries, home goods and medical supplies. Brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors; Amazon by contrast moved to recruit over 400,000 workers and earned $6.3 billion in the just-ended quarter, its second consecutive record profit.  That has kept the world\u2019s largest online retailer at the center of workplace and political tumult. Democratic politicians this month accused Amazon of holding \u201cmonopoly power\u201d over merchants on its platform, which the company disputes. Meanwhile, more than 19,000 of Amazon\u2019s U.S. employees contracted COVID-19, and some staff protested for site closures.  Amazon\u2019s response now includes an estimated $4 billion in costs related to COVID-19 this holiday, up from $2.5 billion last quarter. It is testing employees for the virus and getting protective gear for new hires. It also is working less productively because of social distancing at its warehouses, which accounts for a big part of its pandemic expense, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.  Amazon forecast operating profit to be between $1.0 billion and $4.5 billion, short of $5.8 billion analysts were looking for, according to research firm FactSet.  Competition this holiday remains fierce for the company in retail - and in the cloud. A traditional bright spot, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) is dueling with smaller rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for business with a big potential during the pandemic, from remote work to cloud-based gaming.  FILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is seen at the Amazon fulfilment center in Bretigny-sur-Orge near Paris, France, October 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  In the just-ended third quarter, AWS sales grew 29%, while Microsoft reported a 48% rise in revenue for its Azure cloud.  \u2018TIGHT ON CAPACITY\u2019  Still, Amazon\u2019s sales are shaping up to hit a record level. Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive and richest person in the world, said in a press release, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts, which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented holiday season.\u201d  The company reported that customers in its loyalty club Prime were shopping more often, renewing their membership at higher rates and, internationally, turning to Amazon much more for video entertainment. Merchants also expanded their budgets for advertising on Amazon in the third quarter versus a contraction during the pandemic\u2019s spring peak.  The question for some analysts has been whether Amazon\u2019s consumer division can keep up with still-growing purchases during the pandemic.  The company has long worked to avoid a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without presents on Christmas Day. Amazon now handles more deliveries in house, and this year it moved its marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, letting customers place holiday orders early.  CFO Olsavsky told reporters that the company is \u201cnot totally insulated\u201d from challenges its delivery partners may be facing this quarter, though the online retailer feels ready for the holiday season.  \u201cWe do think it will be tight on capacity industry-wide, and we\u2019re no exception to that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does behoove shoppers to shop early.\u201d  Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that Amazon\u2019s fulfillment and logistics square footage would be 50% higher this year. He said the company already has spent heavily on expanding its transport capability, part of some $30 billion in capital expenditures and leases through the third quarter. The heightened transportation investment will likely continue over years to come, he said.  For the fourth quarter, Amazon said it expects net sales of $112 billion to $121 billion. That would mark the company\u2019s first over $100 billion and follows a third-quarter revenue beat that analysts such as eMarketer\u2019s Andrew Lipsman did not expect.  \u201cWhile it was clear that the pandemic-driven shift to e-commerce would keep Amazon\u2019s topline elevated, it surprised by easily surpassing an already high bar,\u201d Lipsman said.","180":"April 4 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc may submit an offer here to buy Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, which is currently in talks with Walmart Inc for a stake sale, local daily Mint reported, citing sources.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Before Rivian has even begun commercial production at its factory in Normal, Illinois, the Amazon order rocketed it to the forefront of electric vehicle makers.  Amazon AMZN.O Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in Washington that as part of the online retailer's plan to be carbon neutral by 2040 it would order the electric vans from Rivian, with deliveries starting in 2021. The goal is to deploy all the vehicles by 2024.  Rivian, a potential rival to Silicon Valley's Tesla IncTSLA.O, unveiled its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV last November, but had piqued Amazon's interest earlier. Bezos personally reached out to Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe last summer to express interest in an investment, sources previously said.  Plymouth, Michigan-based Rivian, founded in 2009, has raised close to $1.9 billion from investors, including a $700 million February round led by Amazon.  The deal solidifies Rivian\u2019s place among EV builders, said Sam Fiorani, a vice president with Auto Forecast Solutions. \u201cIt helps boost the image of the (Rivian) brand,\u201d he said.  Rivian aspires to be the first to produce a mass market electric pickup. It intends to begin selling its R1T by the end of 2020, a target that has not changed with the Amazon deal in place, said Rivian spokeswoman Amy Mast said.  Traditional U.S. automakers Ford Motor CoF.N, a Rivian investor, and General Motors CoGM.N, as well as Tesla, are pushing to develop their own electric pickups.  The Amazon vans, under the exclusive deal, will be built at Rivian\u2019s plant, a former Mitsubishi factory in Normal, Illinois, Mast said. The first vehicles will be delivered in 2021 and 10,000 should be on the road by late 2022, she said. The vehicles will be serviced by Rivian.  Scaringe has described the Rivian vehicle\u2019s platform as a skateboard that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower center of gravity.  Amazon is looking to speed packages to shoppers' doorsteps regardless of spikes in consumer demand or shortages of delivery personnel. Last year, Daimler AG'sDAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz said Amazon had become the biggest customer of its Sprinter vans, securing 20,000 vehicles for delivery contractors.  Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in April with plans to use the Rivian EV platform to build a new vehicle in North America. Details of that vehicle were not disclosed. Ford is not involved in the Rivian deal, Mast said.  Cox Automotive Inc, the owner of the Autotrader online automobile market and the Kelley Blue Book car valuation service, invested $350 million in Rivian this month. The companies will explore partnerships in digital retailing, service operations and logistics.  Other backers include Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co, Sumitomo Corp of Americas and Standard Chartered Bank.  Amazon\u2019s reputation and the contract size would raise Rivian\u2019s status with potential customers and investors, Fiorani said. It also offers the advantage of not having to chase buyers or ship vehicles all over the country.","183":"OAKLAND, Calif., Nov 20 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and hundreds of smaller retailers are bolstering their online gift features, hoping to challenge Amazon.com Inc\u2019s dominance as a seller of holiday gifts to homebound shoppers.  The new services seek to take some of the drudgery out of gift-giving. The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift\u2019s price.  Amazon\u2019s rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving.  Consumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share.  \u201cThis is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,\u201d said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon\u2019s ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient.  Walmart.com on Oct. 28 added a \u201cgift eligible\u201d label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging.  With gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.  BestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered.  Estee Lauder Companies Inc this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping.  Americans will spend $160 billion on gifts during the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago as people put savings from skipped outings into celebrating Christmas and other year-end holidays, according to industry analyst Coresight Research.  Adobe Inc\u2019s e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship 67% more holiday gifts than a year ago and to 18% more recipients as travel gets curbed.  But Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019.  Amazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon\u2019s product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1\/2 times the rate over the same period last year.  It pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon\u2019s largest ever.  The company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts for some items.  MYSTERIOUS SENDER  But some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card.  \u201cThe gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,\u201d said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked.  Amazon said its gift features remain popular.  Jeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper.  Though Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he \u201clearned his lesson.\u201d (Reporting by Paresh Dave; Additional reporting by Melissa Fares in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)","184":"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected Parler\u2019s demand that Amazon.com Inc restore web hosting services for the social media platform, which Amazon had cut off following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Seattle said Parler was unlikely to prove Amazon breached its contract or violated antitrust law by suspending service on Jan. 10, and that it was \u201cnot a close call.\u201d  She also forcefully rejected the suggestion that the public interest would be served by a preliminary injunction requiring Amazon Web Services to \u201chost the kind of abusive, violent content at issue in this case, particularly in light of the recent riots at the U.S. Capitol.\u201d  \u201cThat event,\u201d she added, \u201cwas a tragic reminder that inflammatory rhetoric can - more swiftly and easily than many of us would have hoped - turn a lawful protest into a violent insurrection.\u201d  Parler was not immediately available for comment.  \u201cWe welcome the court\u2019s careful ruling,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cThis was not a case about free speech.

PARLER.COM WEBSITE \/via REUTERS  Researchers have said far-right groups at the Capitol had a vigorous online presence on platforms including Parler, where they spread violent rhetoric.  Parler said there was no evidence apart from anecdotes in the press that it had a role in inciting the riots, and that it was unfair to deprive millions of law-abiding Americans a platform for free speech.  It also said Amazon had no right to threaten its \u201cextinction\u201d by pulling the plug, and had been motivated by \u201cpolitical animus\u201d to benefit Twitter Inc, a larger Amazon client that Parler said did not censor violent content targeting conservatives.  Rothstein rejected that argument, saying Parler had merely raised the \u201cspecter of preferential treatment\u201d for Twitter.  Many supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump favor Parler, which has claimed it had more than 12 million users.  Parler remains largely offline after being dropped by Seattle-based Amazon and the app stores of Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google following the Washington unrest.  Those companies also cited Parler\u2019s record of policing violent content.  Parler Chief Executive Officer John Matze told Reuters on Jan. 13 that Parler may be offline for good, but later pledged it would return stronger.  Matze and his family were forced to \u201cgo into hiding\u201d after receiving death threats, his lawyer said on Jan. 15.  A static version of Parler\u2019s website recently returned, including a notice saying Parler was having technical difficulties, and a handful of posts from people like Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Mark Levin.  Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Wernick said on Tuesday that Parler was posting comments on behalf of \u201cfriends who reached out.\u201d  The site\u2019s internet protocol address is owned by DDos-Guard, which is controlled by two Russian men and provides protection from distributed denial-of-service attacks, according to infrastructure expert Ronald Guilmette.","185":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Thursday it was teaming up with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Amazon.com AMZN.O to give its future electric car customers a range of charging options from highways to homes.

Allen has long denied the allegation by Dylan Farrow and her mother Mia Farrow, who appeared in a dozen of his films and was his longtime partner. He has not been charged.  The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan follows more than two decades of modest commercial fortunes for many Allen films.

China Labor Watch said its nine-month investigation found that about 40 percent of workers at the plant were dispatch workers, far exceeding the 10 percent limit under Chinese law.

Inside Rx, a subsidiary of Cigna\u2019s Evernorth, administers that benefit, Amazon said.  Still, the pandemic may help bring drug orders online. E-commerce has surged this year as governments told people to stay home to stave off infections of COVID-19, and Prime members - more than 150 million globally - may be receptive to buying medication online now that it\u2019s from Amazon.  The company said Prime subscribers get up to 80% off generic and up to 40% off brand drugs when they pay without insurance, as well as two-day delivery.

The move is likely to trigger renewed debate on the legality of corporate donations in U.S. elections while drawing an immediate court challenge.  A six-member committee of Seattle City Council has already unanimously approved the measure, making it almost certain that the full nine-member council will pass it on Monday.  The bill is widely viewed as aimed at reining in political spending from companies such as Am  azon.com. Amazon, Seattle\u2019s largest employer, donated a record $1.5 million to back a slate of pro-business candidates in the November council elections - a campaign that was largely unsuccessful.  At least 9% of Amazon\u2019s stock is owned by foreign investors, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.  A spokesman for Amazon, which has been butting heads with the city for two years over attempts to levy more taxes on the company, declined to comment.  \u201cWhat they are proposing is likely an unconstitutional backdoor ban on U.S. companies speaking about local elections,\u201d Jim Manley, an attorney with the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, told Reuters.  The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling struck down limits on political contributions by corporations or unions. Companies and unions may not give money directly to campaigns but may spend unlimited amounts on ads and other means.  The legislation before the Seattle City Council says that companies that have at least 5% of their shares held by foreigners, or 1% by a single foreigner, are subject to foreign influence and therefore cannot participate in elections.  Amazon\u2019s $1.5 million political donation for Seattle\u2019s November elections represented more than half of the nearly $2.7 million raised by a Super Pac for those elections. Four years ago, Amazon donated $25,000.  Super Pacs may accept unlimited contributions from any non-foreign source.  Amazon began to prominently flex its political muscle in May 2018 when the Seattle council approved an employee \u201chead tax\u201d on the city\u2019s largest companies, in order to combat a housing crisis. Just four weeks later, the City Council repealed the tax after a coalition of businesses, with Amazon at the forefront, mounted a well-financed campaign for a referendum to repeal the tax.  Seattle is not the first city to take aim at campaign spending. St. Petersburg, Florida, approved a similar ordinance on foreign-influenced corporations in 2017 that has not yet been challenged in court.

In coming weeks, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer will sell the latest editions of Apple\u2019s iPhone, iPad and other devices in the United States, Europe, Japan and India. Amazon sold a limited assortment from Apple previously that included Mac computers and Beats headphones.  The deal underscores how top brands such as Apple and Nike Inc NKE.N, which long resisted distributing products via Amazon, are increasingly turning to the e-commerce site because it has become a critical channel for reaching customers. Amazon has taken a harder line on counterfeit goods as well.  As of Jan. 4, Amazon will rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by the Cupertino, California-based technology company. Still, shoppers will be able to find non-branded accessories - like headphones - that are compatible with Apple devices.  Third-party merchants will be allowed to sell as they have been through the holiday season, while Amazon will add Apple products to its official Apple at Amazon page.  The lineup will include the Apple Watch but not the Apple HomePod, a high-end alternative to Amazon\u2019s voice-controlled Echo device. Such competition in Silicon Valley has often come at the expense of customers.  Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google pulled its video streaming app YouTube from two Amazon devices last year because of several complaints against the online retailer, including its decision not to sell some of Google's products.

Names that have rallied since March lows, such as Apple Inc , Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com, all fell.  Tesla Inc rose slightly, initially helping to limit the Nasdaq\u2019s losses before the tech-heavy index\u2019s slide widened.

Justice Department on Apple: This probe, which was revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple\u2019s app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products and then pushing out apps which compete with them. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest quality apps in the app store.

A man walks past an advert for Amazon Locker outside a Whole Foods Market store in Santa Monica, California, U.S. March 19, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods last summer shook the grocery industry, spawning worries that the ecommerce giant would disrupt groceries the way it upended books, toys and electronics.  In a restructuring effort underway before the acquisition, Whole Foods earlier this year began requiring suppliers to use a firm of its choosing to restock shelves and run promotions. As first reported in the Washington Post, Whole Foods is charging some suppliers the equivalent of 3 percent to 5 percent of sales to cover the cost of those broker services.  In addition, Whole Foods adopted a Costco Wholesale Corp COST.O style model for in-store sampling, asking companies to pay fees when Whole Foods offers shoppers free samples of their products.  Those changes caused heartburn for some small upstart brands. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of brands at Whole Foods that probably shouldn\u2019t have been there to begin with,\u201d said food industry consultant Phil Lempert, who added that it should not be a surprise that the formerly freewheeling retailer is beginning to act like a more mainstream business.  Several mid-sized suppliers told Reuters they supported Whole Foods\u2019 efforts to date.  \u201cWe have a chance to move faster,\u201d said Califia Farms Chief Executive Greg Steltenpohl, among those who said he planned to attend the summit.

Kelly said Whole Foods has worked for the last two years to streamline its processes across global and regional purchasing teams to ensure all its suppliers are supported under a consistent company-wide set of protocols.  Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey and members of the chain\u2019s marketing and merchandising team will host the summit.  PIONEER 2.0  Whole Foods explosive growth faltered after Kroger Co KR.N, Walmart WMT.N and other retailers started charging less for the many of the natural, organic and niche products that once set Whole Foods apart, giving it the ability to charge premium prices.

One employee, Barbara Chandler, said she tested positive for COVID-19 in March and later saw several household members became sick, including a cousin who died on April 7.  The lawsuit said Amazon has made JFK8, which employs about 5,000, a \u201cplace of danger\u201d by impeding efforts to stop the coronavirus\u2019s spread, and boost productivity at the expense of safety.  It said Amazon forces employees to work at \u201cdizzying speeds, even if doing so prevents them from socially distancing, washing their hands, and sanitizing their work spaces.\u201d  Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Seattle-based company has benefitted from the coronavirus pandemic, which forced many consumers unable to visit physical stores to shop online more.  But unions, elected officials and some workers have faulted Amazon\u2019s treatment of workers, including the firing of some critics of warehouse conditions.  Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said last week that Amazon has not fired people for raising such concerns, but such criticism would not excuse unrelated policy violations.  Amazon is spending more than $800 million on coronavirus safety in this year\u2019s first half, including for cleaning, temperature checks and face masks.  At least 800 workers in U.S. distribution centers have tested positive for COVID-19, according to an employee\u2019s unofficial tally.  Amazon ended 2019 with 798,000 full- and part-time employees.

Amazon in November picked National Landing, a site jointly owned by Arlington County and the City of Alexandria, just outside of Washington, along with New York for its so-called HQ2 or second headquarters.  That followed a year-long search in which hundreds of municipalities, ranging from Newark, New Jersey, to Indianapolis, competed for the coveted tax-dollars and high-wage jobs the project promises.  Amazon in February abruptly scrapped plans to build part of its second headquarters in New York after opposition from local leaders, who were upset by incentives promised by state and city politicians.  While opposition in Arlington is still nascent, the vote has become a political flashpoint between the project\u2019s supporters and activist opponents. It has given local activists the chance to push for a delay so that the county\u2019s proposal can be reviewed and debated further.  A five-member panel of the Arlington County Board will vote on whether Amazon will receive the estimated $51 million, a fraction of the $481 million promised by the county. Only 5 percent of the incentives are direct.  Amazon has also been offered a $750 million package by the state that the Virginia General Assembly approved with little opposition.  The scene at Saturday\u2019s vote is likely to be different. At least 100 members from local activist groups are expected to attend.  Protests are expected to begin at least an hour before the vote comes up for hearing at 1 pm EST, Reuters has learnt from labor groups.

The grant is contingent upon Amazon occupying six million square feet of office space over the first 16 years.  Arlington has also offered to invest about $28 million over 10 years of future property tax revenue in onsite infrastructure and open space at the headquarters site.  A filing on the county board\u2019s website says the $23 million grant and the $28 million in strategic public infrastructure investments were \u201cinstrumental in Amazon choosing Arlington for its headquarters.\u201d  A county spokesman declined to comment.  Arlington County Chair Christian Dorsey has stated publicly he had \u201cno interest\u201d in postponing the vote, had heard no suggestions to do so from other board members, and expected the measure to pass.

The world\u2019s largest online retailer plans to spend $5 billion on the two new developments in Long Island City and Arlington, Virginia, and expects to get more than $2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more.  The prize, which Amazon called HQ2, attracted hundreds of proposals from across North America in a year-long bidding war that garnered widespread publicity for the company. Amazon ended the frenzy by dividing the spoils between the two most powerful East Coast U.S. cities and offering a consolation prize of a 5,000-person center in Nashville, Tennessee, focused on technology and management for retail operations.  Losers said they learned from the process, while winners said it was costly but worthwhile.  \u201cEither you are creating jobs or you are losing jobs,\u201d New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference on Tuesday.  With more than 610,000 workers worldwide, Amazon is already one of the biggest employers in the United States and the world's third-most valuable company, behind Apple Inc AAPL.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.  Still, it faces fierce competition for talent from Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and other companies working to build new technologies in the cloud. Those rivals routinely offer free food and perks in sunny California, seen by many as a better draw than Amazon's relative frugality in rain-plagued Seattle. Google also has a growing footprint in New York City.  Already marketing its forthcoming location in the New York City borough of Queens, Amazon talked up Long Island City\u2019s breweries, waterfront parks and easy transit access. Rents there are typically lower than in Midtown Manhattan, which is just across the East River. The former industrial area also has a clock counting down the hours until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s first term in office.  The choice of Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from downtown Washington D.C., could hand Amazon greater political influence in the U.S. capital, where it has one of the largest lobbying shops in town. Locating close to the Pentagon may also help Amazon win a $10 billion cloud-computing contract from the U.S. Department of Defense, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.  Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive and the world\u2019s richest person, privately owns the Washington Post, which has written critical articles about Trump. In turn, Bezos\u2019s companies have been a frequent target of broadsides from the president. The newspaper maintains full editorial independence from its owner.  Amazon\u2019s choice largely bypassed the middle of the United States, where many cities had hoped for an economic boost and bid for the new jobs. The company already had large corporate workforces in greater Washington and New York.  \u201cMy heart is broken today,\u201d Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said.  TAX BREAKS  At the outset of its search last year, Amazon said it was looking for a business-friendly environment. The company said it will receive performance-based incentives of $1.525 billion from the state of New York, including an average $48,000 for each job it creates.  It can also apply for other tax incentives, such as New York City\u2019s Relocation and Employment Assistance Program that offers tax breaks potentially worth $900 million over 12 years. What benefit the company would actually get was unclear.  In Virginia, Amazon will receive performance-based incentives of $573 million, including an average $22,000 for each job it creates.  These rewards come on top of $1.6 billion in subsidies Amazon has received across the United States since 2000, according to a database from the Washington-based watchdog Good Jobs First.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Amazon says it has invested $160 billion in the country since 2010 and that the new offices will generate more than $14 billion in extra tax revenue for New York, Virginia and Tennessee over the next two decades.  It expects an average wage of more than $150,000 for employees in each new office.  HOUSING CRISIS  Amazon\u2019s emphasis on new, high-paying jobs earned publicity as it faced criticism for low wages in its sprawling warehouses.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  The company got $148 million worth of media attention across the English-language press in the two months following the launch of its search last September, according to media measurement and analytics firm mediaQuant Inc.  Amazon received 238 proposals and New York and Virginia beat out 18 other finalists from a January short list, which included Los Angeles and Chicago.  New Jersey made headlines early in the contest by proposing $7 billion in potential credits against state and city taxes if Amazon located in Newark and stuck to hiring commitments.  Others with less money to offer took a more creative approach: the mayor of the Atlanta suburb of Stonecrest, Jason Lary, said he would create a new city from industrial land called Amazon and name Bezos its mayor for life.  In evaluating its options, Amazon looked at the quality of schools, meeting with superintendents to discuss education in science and math. Amazon also wanted helicopter landing pads for the new sites, documents it released on Tuesday show.  The company has already had to navigate community issues at its more than 45,000-person urban campus in Seattle. An affordable housing crisis there prompted the city council to adopt a head tax on businesses in May, which Amazon helped overturn in a subsequent city council vote.  Some critics had pushed for more transparency from cities and states in the bidding process, warning that the benefits of hosting a massive Amazon office may not offset the taxpayer-funded incentives and other costs.  \u201cOur subways are crumbling, our children lack school seats, and too many of our neighbors lack adequate health care,\u201d New York State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said in a joint statement. \u201cIt is unfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check to Amazon in the face of these challenges.\u201d  Amazon shares closed down 0.3 percent at $1631.17, giving the company a market value of almost $800 billion.","247":"PARIS (Reuters) - Amazon AMZN.O has no clarity yet on when its warehouses in France might reopen, the head of its French business said on Thursday, after the e-commerce giant clashed with unions over the measures taken to limit the risks of coronavirus contagion.

France is the only country where it has shut down all of its so-called fulfillment centres after unions complained that they were still too crowded and filed a legal challenge.  A court sided with the workers on Tuesday, ordering Amazon to focus only on delivering essential items like food while it revised health protocols.  Amazon\u2019s French Chief Executive Frederic Duval rejected the court\u2019s order on Thursday, saying the company had spent \u201ccolossal amounts\u201d on health precautions including sanitary gels and face masks. The firm will appeal, he said.  Duval added that rather than limiting its activities, Amazon had temporarily suspended trade through the warehouses because the court order, which included a 1 million-euro ($1.1 million) per day penalty for non-compliance, was too vague.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The court did not order the closure of the warehouses but requested they limit deliveries to groceries, medical supplies and hygiene products.  \u201cThere is a huge ambiguity,\u201d Duval told RTL radio. \u201cIs a nail clipper a hygiene product?

Amazon, with its growing network of delivery planes, trucks and vans, is regarded as a potential long-term threat to FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc, both of which have long counted the e-commerce company as a customer.  A Morgan Stanley analysis from last week estimated that Amazon logistics delivered about 20% of company\u2019s packages last year and nearly 46% in 2019 through August.  The brokerage estimated the Amazon delivery network will move 6.5 billion packages for the company by 2022, more than UPS at 5 billion and FedEx at 3.4 billion.

The weak results from Amazon and Google parent Alphabet were the latest setback for the high-growth quartet of stocks known as FANG, which also includes Facebook Inc FB.O and Netflix Inc NFLX.O.  Nasdaq futures NQcv1 fell 0.8 percent and S&P futures EScv1 lost 0.5 percent, suggesting the U.S. stock market may see more selling when it opens on Friday.  Wall Street favorites in recent years, the FANG stocks have been punished in a month of volatility for U.S. equities that has some investors worried a decade-old bull market may be ending.  The FANG group, along with heavyweight tech stocks Apple and Microsoft MSFT.O, have made outsized contributions to the S&P 500's gains in recent years, and a prolonged downturn for those stocks would be a major setback for the market.  After the bell, Amazon tanked 8 percent. The fall came after the online retailer and cloud computing heavyweight reported that its quarterly net sales rose to $56.58 billion from $43.74 billion a year earlier. That missed analyst estimates of $57.1 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Alphabet missed analysts\u2019 estimates for third-quarter revenue, while rising expenses trimmed its operating margin for the third straight quarter, fanning concerns about regulatory scrutiny. Its stock fell 4.7 percent.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Reacting after hours, Netflix dipped 3 percent and Facebook, which reports results on Oct. 30, lost 2.3 percent.  During Thursday's official trading session, all four FANG stocks rallied by between 3 percent and 7 percent, regaining some of the territory lost in recent weeks during a broad market sell-off. The Nasdaq .IXIC jumped 2.95 percent, but remained down 10 percent from its August record high close.  Apple AAPL.O fell 1.6 percent after hours, while Twitter TWTR.N dipped 2.5 percent. Earlier in the day, Twitter surged 15 percent in its biggest one-day gain in a year after the social media company easily beat Wall Street's revenue and profit estimates.  Snap SNAP.N slumped 11 percent in extended trade after the Snapchat owner said its number of daily active users fell to 186 million in the third quarter from 188 million in the June quarter, hurt largely by an app redesign and competition from Facebook's Instagram.  Chipmaker Micron Technology MU.O lost 3.8 percent in extended trade after Western Digital WDC.O said it was taking steps to align its output of flash memory chips with projected weak demand. Western Digital dropped 8 percent in extended trade.  Intel Corp INTC.O jumped 3.5 percent in extended trade after posting one of Thursday's few upbeat quarterly reports.","251":"An UberEATS food delivery bike is seen parked next to a Deliveroo scooter in London, Britain September 7, 2016. Picture taken September 7, 2016. REUTERS\/Neil Hall  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The jury is out on whether there is any money to be made ferrying hot meals to time-poor urbanites. Amazon\u2019s investment in loss-making Deliveroo, which operates in 500 European and Asian cities, defers the answer. It also means investors\u2019 bellies will remain empty for the foreseeable future.  London-based Deliveroo, whose panting cyclists have become a fixture in the British capital\u2019s affluent neighbourhoods, on Friday announced it had raised $575 million from investors led by the $940 billion web giant. American Will Shu, who founded the company after finding a dearth of quality delivery options while working as a banker in Canary Wharf, has so far raised $1.5 billion.  The fundraising replenishes Shu\u2019s war chest for his ongoing assault on rival Uber Eats, part of the ride-hailing group. The companies charge restaurants and diners a fee for each delivery, which helps pay for drivers. In 2017 \u2013 the last year for which figures are available \u2013 direct costs like paying cyclists and moped riders ate up almost four-fifths of Deliveroo\u2019s 277 million pounds of sales. Its operations and investments consumed 155 million pounds ($198 million) of cash, or two-fifths of the money Shu raised that year. Though the company has expanded since, it remains locked in a price war with Uber Eats, which has cut the fees it charges restaurants.  Amazon\u2019s arrival looks set to prolong the conflict. The company founded by Jeff Bezos first poked its head into the kitchen with a UK takeaway service in 2016, but closed it late last year. Amazon twice approached Deliveroo about an acquisition, the Telegraph reported, suggesting Friday\u2019s investment might be an appetiser for a full purchase. Alternatively, it could just be a way to learn more about the business of delivering pizzas and burgers \u2013 an area where Amazon trails Uber in the United States. Deliveroo, which previously touted a $2 billion price tag, didn\u2019t mention a valuation on Friday, suggesting Bezos extracted favourable terms.  The biggest losers from Amazon\u2019s investment are rivals like Uber, who now face a much better funded rival. The value of publicly traded peers Just Eat, Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero fell in value by a collective $965 million, or 5%, on Friday morning. Thin margins and deep-pocketed rivals are the perfect ingredients for perpetual losses all round.","252":"(Adds Amazon merchant comment on ad spend)  NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, its latest move to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.  The change does not mean that Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or sellers have to ship the products directly to consumers themselves.  In a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand from consumers. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to \u201cquickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.\u201d  Amazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well.  \u201cWe understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  The company said the new protocol applies to both first-party vendors and third-party sellers. That suggests that the company is not protecting its own products.  The move follows Amazon\u2019s announcement it will hire 100,000 workers for its warehouses on Monday, as the Seattle-based giant is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.  LESS AD REVENUE?  The news may hurt demand for lucrative services that Amazon offers to merchants, like advertising.  Amy Roskelley, owner of Utah-based Health Beet, said she pays Amazon around $1,000 a month to promote her flatware products that help consumers portion their meals. Now that she can\u2019t add inventory to Amazon\u2019s warehouses, she plans to cut ad spend in half.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to justify spending money if I don\u2019t have enough inventory to fill\u201d customers\u2019 orders, she said.  Roskelley is considering other ways to reduce her dependence on Amazon, too, whether shipping directly to customers or driving traffic to her own website.  \u201cI have been concerned that they\u2019ll shut down Amazon\u2019s warehouses and won\u2019t ship out at all, and that would just devastate me,\u201d she said.  Amazon has yet to indicate any such closures. Still, the months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the e-commerce giant\u2019s operations, from supply chain to deliveries, as the virus spreads from China to the rest of the world.  \u201cOur factories just resumed production, but now we can\u2019t ship to warehouses until April,\u201d said Zengxie Pang, a China-based seller, \u201cWe are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies and they will likely run out of stock, as well as other products people use when they\u2019re stuck at home.\u201d  Amazon\u2019s two-day shipping guarantee has in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday\u2019s announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon\u2019s business.  \u201cThis change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay, Wish, Walmart, Facebook Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,\u201d Sebastian said.  Third-party sellers account for over half of the sales on Amazon. Amazon has been courting sellers to use its own fulfillment system, enabling many of them with faster delivery without the risks of sitting on inventories.  One consultant said the announcement landed as third-party sellers were grappling with economic uncertainty amid the outbreak. Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses are furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession.  \u201cSellers are rethinking their entire strategies for selling in 2020,\u201d said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com.","253":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos was spotted schmoozing in NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s booth during the Super Bowl in February, the media world exploded with anticipation about Amazon\u2019s imminent domination of sports media.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  But two years after first dabbling in live sports streaming, Amazon has yet to settle on a strategy as it continues to experiment and analyze consumer behavior, Marie Donoghue, Vice President of Global Sports Video, told Reuters.  \u201cWe\u2019re literally at day one in sports, so we\u2019re learning and experimenting,\u201d Donoghue said in New York this week in her first interview after she took over the sports media division of the world\u2019s largest online retailer last fall.  The arrival of Donoghue, a nearly twenty-year veteran of Walt Disney Co\u2019s ESPN cable network and who was responsible for shows including the \u201830 for 30\u2019 series and \u2018OJ: Made in America,\u2019 signaled a new level of seriousness to Amazon\u2019s pursuit of live sports.  While the real impact of her arrival remains to be seen, that hasn't stopped chatter of a big tech takeover of live sports as Amazon, Facebook Inc FB.O, Twitter Inc TWTR.N and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O YouTube's threaten to loosen TV's grip on one of the last remaining reasons to pay for live television.  Tech companies and startup digital platforms - like DAZN, which in October agreed to pay boxing champion Canelo Alvarez a minimum of $365 million for five years, the richest contract in sports history - are also seen driving up the cost of media rights when major contracts start coming up for renewal in 2021.  Will Amazon lead the pack in pursuing streaming rights for live sports? \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about specific rights ... as a matter of course, but also because we\u2019re just not sure yet,\u201d Donoghue said.  Since 2017, Amazon has snapped up digital rights to some of England\u2019s Premier League soccer matches, U.S. Open Tennis Championships in the UK and three seasons of Thursday Night Football, among others.  Donoghue said the current focus is on how to enable Amazon Prime subscribers to control nearly every component of their viewing experience, including how, when and where they watch.  As a streaming service, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to serve the same content in the same way to everybody,\u201d she said.  To figure out which sports products are successful and what to offer next, Amazon is analyzing market research and its own viewership data, as well as consumers\u2019 use of its X-Ray tool for digging into details about shows.  It also co-streams Thursday Night Football on its Twitch video game streaming platform, which has an interactive extension that lets viewers predict game developments, including who they think will win.  \u201cWe\u2019re watching all of that,\u201d Donoghue said. \u201cWe want to use live sports to drive value for Prime customers.\u201d","254":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France on February 20, 2017.

An employee prepares an order for Amazon at Porona warehouse in Bruay-sur-l'Escaut near Valenciennes, France, April 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a surge in online orders from people under lockdown, but also fuelled protests by Amazon workers from the United States to Italy over its sanitary protocols.  In France, these protests spiralled into a legal battle, highlighting how companies may struggle to keep going while protecting their workers, just as firms across Europe need to figure out how to let staff safely return to offices and factories once restrictions are lifted.  The spat has also accentuated losses for some French businesses that were still managing to sell and ship through Amazon, in spite of a furore over whether some goods are really essential.  \u201cIt\u2019s been horrendous,\u201d said Yannick Jan, whose stationery company on the outskirts of Paris has been trying to handle 600 orders a day from its own premises, rather than the usual 80, since Amazon warehouses shut on April 16. The firm brought back some staff it had laid off.  Jan\u2019s monthly sales were already on the wane due to the pandemic. Skyrocketing shipment costs were now eating into margins, he said, after he resorted to more expensive delivery firms including the French postal service.  Some 10,000 third-party French vendors sell though Amazon\u2019s site and many use its logistics too. The French government, facing an 8% economic downturn this year, has encouraged businesses to operate when possible.  A French court handed unions a first victory last week after it told Amazon to restrict shipments to only food, hygiene and medical products while it improved its health measures. This followed complaints the warehouses were too crowded and still processing everything from sex toys to video games.  Amazon - which had already said it would prioritise some products during the outbreak, though not to such an extreme - shut its warehouses, arguing the ruling was too vague and it could not risk a fine.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  It has extended the closures until April 25 at least as it awaits the appeal. If Amazon\u2019s appeal is thrown out on Friday, it could yet find a compromise with workers allowing warehouses to reopen, though a ruling in unions\u2019 favour would add weight to their demands.  \u201cI can reassure everyone - we are heading towards a solution,\u201d said Laurent D\u00e9gous\u00e9e of the Sud union that brought the claim, and which wants Amazon and postal services to restrict the shipments they process.

Sylvain Flipot, who sells goods including riding saddles and dressing-up costumes across Europe through Amazon, said much of his stock had become stranded in the company\u2019s Lauwin-Planque warehouse in northern France.  His business, Ponera, had offset some of the hit from the coronavirus crisis with sales of hygiene products like soaps. But his French revenues have fallen 80% since the warehouses shut, and exports are tricky.  \u201cWe\u2019re sending some goods to an Amazon warehouse in Germany,\u201d Flipot said. \u201cBut it\u2019s costing four times as much, and there are long delays.\u201d  With most retailers closed in France, e-commerce has become a lifeline for many small firms.

Jay Carney, the company\u2019s top policy executive, told New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that the world\u2019s biggest online retailer would not go ahead with plans to invest $2.5 billion to build a second head office in the New York City borough of Queens.  Carney, a former press secretary for President Barack Obama, told New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio the same shortly after.  Abruptly scuttling its Big Apple plans blindsided Amazon\u2019s allies and opponents alike. The company said the decision came together only in the last 48 hours, made by its senior leadership team and Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, chief executive and the richest person in the world.  Yet by some measures the decision was months in the making, as community opposition signaled to the company that it was not entirely welcome.  Seattle-based Amazon captivated elected officials across North America in September 2017 when it announced it would create more than 50,000 jobs in a second headquarters dubbed HQ2. Cities and states vied desperately for the economic stimulus, with New Jersey offering $7 billion in potential credits and the mayor of an Atlanta suburb promising to make Bezos mayor for life of a new city called \u201cAmazon.\u201d  A backlash began in earnest when Amazon announced two winners to split the offices last November: Arlington, Virginia, and New York\u2019s Long Island City neighborhood, with New York offering incentives worth $1.53 billion to Amazon. The company could apply for $900 million more, too.  New York State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said that day that it was \u201cunfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check\u201d to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies considering the city\u2019s crumbling subways and overcrowded schools.  City Council meetings in December and January showed Amazon executives who showed up the stern opposition they could expect from some elected officials and labor organizers.  Protesters interrupted the meetings. A television report showed people unfurling signs saying, \u201cAmazon delivers lies,\u201d and \u201cAmazon fuels ICE deportations\u201d - a reference to the company\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. Department in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Amazon felt that a small number of local and state officials had no desire to collaborate on a path forward, the company later said, despite what it said was strong popular support for its project.  RELATIVELY PAINLESS EXIT  Tension ratcheted up earlier this month, when Gianaris was nominated to a state panel set to vote in 2020 on whether to approve the financial terms for Amazon.  Days later, Amazon executives weighed the pros and cons of whether to follow through with its New York headquarters, two people briefed on talks inside the company said. Concerned that Amazon could be in limbo for more than a year ahead of the state panel\u2019s vote, the growing consensus within the company was that it did not make sense to move ahead in the face of persistent opposition with a headquarters in New York City, where it already has 5,000 employees.  Amazon had no binding legal contracts to acquire or lease the land for the project. It could exit with relatively little pain, the people said.  Company officials also concluded Amazon could shift the jobs that would have been created in New York to other corporate centers it has across the United States, from the San Francisco Bay Area to Boston. Reopening talks with former HQ2 contestants did not make sense, the people said.  Gianaris blamed Amazon for the reversal.  \u201cAmazon never showed willingness to look seriously at the concerns that were raised,\u201d he said.  Still, up to the moment of the announcement, there were signs that the parties could work together.  One union leader said he and other labor organizers met on Wednesday with Cuomo and four Amazon officials, including Brian Huseman, its vice president of public policy.  \u201cWe had such a productive meeting yesterday. Everyone left happy,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, head of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.  The group is trying to organize workers at an Amazon facility in Staten Island, another New York City borough, despite the company\u2019s past opposition to unionization.  \u201cIt was a complete surprise that they would say they look forward to working with us, and we talked about next steps, and then they call it all off the next morning,\u201d said Appelbaum.","263":"NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Prime Day is now a major marketing opportunity and shopping event in the annual calendar for other U.S. retail companies, rivaling the Thanksgiving holiday\u2019s Black Friday as a driver of sales.  Walmart Inc, Target Corp and eBay Inc all run their own special promotions to coincide with the annual sale, which this year Amazon has stretched to two days.  Target announced deal days which will run on the same days as Prime Day - July 15 and 16.

Amazon\u2019s break-neck pace of growth, which has seen increasing numbers of shoppers ordering online instead of going to brick-and-mortar stores, is pushing other retailers to respond as they seek to remain competitive.  \u201cThere is this enormous halo effect to Prime Day,\u201d said Jaysen Gillespie, head of analytics and data science at ads firm Criteo, adding that non-Amazon retailers should experience large increases both in traffic to their websites and in sales.  \u201cThe rest of the industry is taking advantage of the free marketing that Jeff Bezos is providing, and they should really send him a thank you card saying, \u2018Hey, thanks for the awareness marketing - we\u2019ll take care of the conversion and close the deal now on our websites.\u2019\u201d  Some retailers also flaunted no membership fees.  Customers have to join Amazon Prime to get discounts during the 48-hour event. U.S. members of the club pay $119 per year for benefits including one-day shipping, and they tend to buy more goods, more often from Amazon.  The mid-summer shopping event is estimated to bring in $5.8 billion in sales this year for Amazon globally, compared to $3.9 billion last year, according to Coresight Research. Amazon does not disclose figures for revenues generated during Prime Day shopping events.  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group reported sales of $30.8 billion during its 24-hour online retail frenzy Singles\u2019 Day in 2018.  Last year, when Prime Day lasted 36 hours and faced technical glitches, online shoppers bought more than 100 million products worldwide, at the time recording the largest daily sales for Amazon\u2019s own-brand Echo range of smart speakers, while the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and Echo Dot were the best-selling devices.  Other top-selling products around the world were table salt in India, Coke Zero and Kleenex tissues in Singapore and electric toothbrushes in China.

The case presents a new regulatory challenge for Amazon in India, where it has committed $6.5 billion in investment but is battling a complex regulatory environment.  In January, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had ordered an investigation of Amazon and rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart, over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices, which Amazon is challenging, according to court filings.  In the latest case, the All India Online Vendors Association, members of which sell goods on Amazon and Flipkart, allege Amazon engages in unfair business practices.  The group alleges that Amazon India\u2019s wholesale arm buys goods in bulk from manufacturers and sells them at a loss to sellers such as Cloudtail. Such sellers then offer goods on Amazon.in at big discounts.  \u201cThis anti-competitive arrangement ... is causing foreclosure of competition by driving independent sellers out of the market,\u201d the group alleged in its Aug. 10 filing at CCI, seen by Reuters.  Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it complies with all Indian laws and treats all sellers equally on its platform.  A Cloudtail spokeswoman said it was in \u201ccompliance with all applicable laws in its operations.\u201d  Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the CCI are not made public. In the coming weeks, the CCI will review the case and could decide to launch a wider investigation or dismiss it.  The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.  Chanakya Basa, a lawyer for the sellers group, confirmed the case filing with the CCI but declined to elaborate.  India\u2019s regulations allow Amazon to operate an e-commerce marketplace where sellers can list goods for a fee.  India tightened regulations last year to deter steep discounts, but small sellers still say Amazon uses complex business structures to bypass restrictions, an allegation the company denies.  The latest case filing, running to more than 700 pages, includes screenshots of product listings on Amazon\u2019s website that showed some products, including groceries and detergents, discounted by between 8% to 45% compared with retail prices visible on the e-commerce website.  The seller group also alleges that Amazon charges lower fees to selected sellers, which effectively makes it difficult for independent online retailers to compete on its website.  Cloudtail, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest India sellers, pays a fee to Amazon of 6.3% for electronic products, while independent sellers pay roughly 28.1%, the group alleged in its filing.  Amazon has said it helps to provide an e-commerce platform in India to more than 650,000 sellers who make their own pricing decisions while listing goods.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Last week, Microsoft won the Pentagon contract termed Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, that will be worth up to $10 billion over a period of 10 years, beating out favorite Amazon\u2019s AWS.  Shares of Microsoft rose as much as 3.4% to a record high of $145.67 on Monday.  \u201cBottom line, the contract is a significant win for Microsoft and vaults Azure forward in the cloud platform wars,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy said.  Amazon\u2019s Amazon Web Services currently holds about 32% of the cloud computing market, while Microsoft\u2019s Azure has about 18%, according to research firm Canalys.  While AWS contributes nearly 13% to Amazon\u2019s total net sales, Azure accounts for about 33% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue and are both a major cash cow for the companies.  Friday\u2019s decision came after months of controversy and protest over the process for awarding the deal and even drawing the attention of President Donald Trump, who has publicly taken swipes at Amazon, long considered the frontrunner.  Analysts at brokerage firm Compass Point said the deal was a \u201csignificant victory\u201d for Microsoft over AWS and added that Amazon could challenge the decision.  \u201cWe expect a degree of handwringing among Congressional Democrats given the political and practical dimensions of this issue, but our sense is that lawmakers are unlikely to wade too deeply into these waters,\u201d Compass Point\u2019s Marshall Senk said.  Brokerages Mizuho and Independent Research raised their price target on the Microsoft stock at the prospect of the company getting a boost from the contract.  \u201cIn the end, the fact that Azure was chosen as the sole provider for this important project is a testament to just how far it has come over the past couple of years,\u201d said Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz, who raised his price target by $8 to $160.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives noted that the deal helps Microsoft gain a bigger chunk of an estimated $1 trillion of next decade cloud business and $100 billion of U.S. government business.

The news reflects Amazon\u2019s growing security business since its acquisition of smart doorbell maker Ring in 2018, an effort that\u2019s drawn scrutinty from civil liberties advocates. It also represents Amazon\u2019s latest push into shoppers\u2019 homes, which evolved from package delivery years ago to gadgets that let consumers turn off the lights or stream media by voice command.  Amazon\u2019s indoor drone, the Ring Always Home Cam available next year, aims to capture video where customers otherwise lack static cameras. It can show users video where an alarm has gone off, said Amazon Vice President Daniel Rausch.  \u201cIt\u2019s super reassuring to be able to get a view inside your home,\u201d he said in an interview. The device only records while flying, Ring said.  The company also announced a car device that sounds an alarm when a break-in or bump is detected. It unveiled a vehicle security camera, and the Ring Car Connect software that works with other vehicle cameras for video play back and alerting. Tesla Inc TSLA.O is the first automaker whose models are compatible.  Ring devices have garnered criticism from civil liberties advocates such as the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which has said the company should end partnerships with police.  \u201cAmazon and other companies offer a high-speed digital mechanism by which people can make snap judgments about who does, and who does not, belong in their neighborhood, and summon police to confront them,\u201d EFF staff wrote in a June blog post.  Ring President Leila Rouhi said in an interview the company will never proactively share videos with law enforcement; users control what to share. Ring\u2019s aim is to give peace of mind, she said.  Amazon also announced a cloud-based gaming service called Luna, spherical Echo speakers and features for its voice assistant Alexa, like the ability to delete all prior recordings. Various subscriptions help Amazon monetize the products.  The new devices come as Amazon is working to maintain U.S. market share in smart speakers over rivals Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google.

Customers with a 'Prime' subscription can order meat, produce, snacks and other household essentials from Amazon UK's 'Fresh' service in two-hour windows for orders above 40 pounds ($52), the e-commerce giant said here.  Amazon said the service, which it aims to implement across the United Kingdom by the end of the year, applies to around 300 postcodes. The minimum order value for Prime customers has also been lowered to 15 pounds from 40 pounds.  Orders made before 9 p.m. will be delivered the same day in most areas, it said.  \u201cAmazon is not widely considered as a food supplier in the UK so it will take time for the company to build a brand presence in the business and make its presence felt,\u201d AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.  \u201cBut the company has deep pockets, huge ambitions and an uncanny habit of emerging as a leader in its targeted fields.\u201d  Amazon has been tapping into this sector since 2016, when it first launched its \u2018Fresh\u2019 service, although it has been selling food and drinks since the launch of its grocery store in 2010.  The lockdown has led to changing consumer behaviour with nearly one in five British households now buying over the internet, market researcher Kantar said last month.  Kantar said earlier this month that although grocery sales have been rising year-on-year, the pace of growth has slowed compared to previous weeks since lockdown restrictions eased.  Internet supermarket group Ocado forecast earlier this month that online grocery shopping will double its share of the UK market over the new few years, building on a huge increase during the lockdown.

Instacart, a San Francisco-based company that shops for and delivers groceries from about 200 retailers including Target Corp and Costco Wholesale Corp, said the new funding values the company at about $4.2 billion. That\u2019s up from the $3.4 billion valuation the company commanded when it raised $400 million nearly a year ago.  The new round was led by Coatue Management and included Glade Brook Capital Partners and existing investors. Instacart was previously backed by Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Whole Foods Market, among other investors.  Instacart makes an app that allows shoppers to order groceries that are delivered to their home the same day. The company makes money through delivery fees and also through promotions and coupon deals it has with a number of brands including General Mills Inc, Coca-Cola Co and Pepsico Inc.  But Instacart faces uncertainty with the recent acquisition of Whole Foods by Amazon. Whole Foods has been one of Instacart\u2019s largest and most important grocery store partners, as the startup in 2016 signed a multi-year deal to be the exclusive delivery provider for most Whole Foods goods.

Amazon\u2019s plan to split its second headquarters, dubbed \u201cHQ2\u201d, evenly between two cities will boost its presence around New York and the nation\u2019s capital as it seeks to gain a recruiting edge over Silicon Valley tech firms.  The source, who is familiar with the matter, told Reuters that Amazon will also announce a significant investment in one other city, in addition to revealing the two HQ2 locations.  The company had originally said, in September 2017, that it would spend more than $5 billion and add up to 50,000 workers at a single location for its second headquarters.  It has got more than 200 proposals since then from cities and states promising billions of dollars of tax breaks and other inducements in exchange for Amazon\u2019s \u201cHQ2\u201d. The bidding locales also handed over infrastructure, labor and other data that could prove useful in other ways to the world\u2019s top online retailer.  Among the finalists that Amazon was holding advanced talks with were Dallas, Long Island City in New York and Arlington near Washington, D.C., Reuters has reported here, citing sources.  The New York Times reported here last week that Amazon was finalizing plans to select the Long Island City, New York and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Amazon had made the decision.  Amazon did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  PROS AND CONS  The headquarter split will give Amazon more diversity for recruiting and could also help lessen congestion and cost-of-living increases that would have accompanied one bigger office.  The company has already had to navigate similar issues at its more than 45,000-person urban campus in Seattle. An affordable housing crisis there prompted the city council to adopt a head tax on businesses in May, which Amazon helped overturn in a subsequent city council vote.  The particular neighborhoods chosen by Amazon for its \u201cHQ2\u201d offer lower rents and more attractive zoning than central business districts nearby, a Brookings Institution report said.  However, the split could also mean economic benefits for the hosts will be muted relative to expectations, especially given the selected cities\u2019 size versus some of the other contenders.  The two areas already have relatively low unemployment rates, and Fitch Ratings has noted that even a full HQ2 represented only 1.5 percent of the Washington area and 0.5 percent of the New York area\u2019s labor force.  Some critics had pushed for more transparency from cities and states in the bidding process, warning that the benefits of hosting a massive Amazon office may not offset the tax-payer funded incentives and other costs.  SKEPTICISM  New York Representative elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the planned investment by Amazon late Monday in a series of tweets.  \u201cAmazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here,\u201d she wrote.  \u201cWhen we talk about bringing jobs to the community, we need to dig deep: - Has the company promised to hire in the existing community? - What\u2019s the quality of jobs + how many are promised? Are these jobs low-wage or high wage? Are there benefits? Can people collectively bargain?\u201d  Amazon says it has helped boost Seattle\u2019s economy indirectly by $38 billion between 2010 and 2016. Construction and service work increased there, catering to the retailer, and the company says it helped attract other Fortune 500 businesses to Seattle.  Amazon has already been awarded more than $1.6 billion of state and local public subsidies across the United States since 2000, with most of that after 2012, according to a database from the Washington-based government watchdog Good Jobs First.  Some of the awards may not yet be in effect, and the awards can take many forms, from tax rebates and abatements to grants, loans, infrastructure assistance and training reimbursements.","272":"(Adds statement from Amazon, quote, details, background,)  Feb 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has ordered more than 1,000 truck engines that run on compressed natural gas as it tests ways to shift its U.S. fleet away from heavier polluting trucks, the company told Reuters on Friday.  The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a surge in delivery activity for the likes of Amazon which saw sales soar 38% in 2020 , and similar uptick in activity for delivery vehicles that emit higher levels of pollution than passenger vehicles.  Transportation companies are building their stable of electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The deal represents a major endorsement of Rivian\u2019s electric vehicle technology by the world\u2019s largest online retailer. Amazon is hoping Rivian will assist it in its development of delivery vehicles that will bolster its logistics network, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential strategy.  Reuters reported on Tuesday that Amazon and General Motors Co were in talks to invest in Rivian. GM\u2019s talks with Rivian about an investment are continuing and any deal would be announced at a later date, people familiar with the talks said on Friday.  Rivian could ultimately be valued at between $3 billion and $4 billion, one of the sources said.  The Rivian deal comes as its much larger electric car manufacturing rival, Tesla Inc, struggles to stabilize production and deliver consistent profits as it ramps up its Model 3 sedan, with pricing ultimately aimed at giving it mass market appeal.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors in August that an electric pickup is \u201cprobably my personal favorite for the next product\u201d from the company. But he has spoken only in general about a potential launch, saying that it would happen \u201cright after\u201d Tesla\u2019s Model Y, which the company has targeted to start production in 2020.  Rivian unveiled its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV for the first time at the Los Angeles Auto Show last November. But the company had piqued Amazon\u2019s interest earlier, according to one of the sources.  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos personally reached out to Rivian founder and CEO R.J. Scaringe last summer to express interest in an investment, the source said. Since then Amazon has stepped up its investment in the car sector, participating in a $530 million funding round announced last week in self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation Inc.  Amazon is looking for deals that can speed packages to shoppers\u2019 doorsteps regardless of spikes in consumer demand or shortages of delivery personnel. Last year, Mercedes said Amazon had become the biggest customer of its Sprinter vans, securing 20,000 vehicles for delivery contractors.  Amazon has sought to win customers inside the car as well. Working with BMW AG, Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp, Amazon has enabled its Alexa virtual assistant to be installed in new models so drivers can dictate what music they want to hear and what tasks they want it to perform, hands-free.  Rivian aspires to be the first to produce a mass market electric pickup. It intends to begin selling its R1T by the end of 2020.  Scaringe has described the Rivian vehicle\u2019s platform as a skateboard that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower center of gravity.  He has also said the company plans to partner with outside firms to develop advanced self-driving technology, rather than try to do so on its own.  Rivian\u2019s existing financial backers include Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co, Sumitomo Corp of Americas and Standard Chartered Bank.  Some existing shareholders participated in the funding round, Rivian said, stressing that it will remain an independent company.","275":"HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp shares jumped 16 percent on Wednesday after the company announced a tire service partnership with Amazon.com, part of Chief Executive Officer Edward Lampert\u2019s strategy to make the troubled retailer profitable again.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru, India, April 20, 2018. Picture taken April 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  Under the deal, Sears will install tires sold by Amazon at its U.S. auto centers. Lampert, who announced the deal at Sears\u2019 annual shareholders meeting, said he was trying to reach a new customer base through Amazon.  Sears has seen years of declining sales as competition intensifies from the likes of Walmart Inc, Amazon and other e-commerce platforms.  Lampert has closed unprofitable stores, sold assets, cut costs and tried to forge partnerships for Sears products and boost membership of its Shop Your Way rewards program. The recovery has yet to arrive.  \u201cLet me be the first one to acknowledge we are on the right path but we haven\u2019t gotten over the hump. We need to convert our vision into reality,\u201d Lampert said at the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting at Sears\u2019 headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates.  Sears shares, which were worth $119 a decade ago, rose as high as $3.46 on Wednesday, but were still about 70 percent below their 52-week high hit on May 10, 2017. The shares closed up 15.9 percent at $3.20.  Lampert is the biggest shareholder in Sears, with a more than 30 percent stake.  After warning about Sears\u2019 ability to continue as a going concern last year, Lampert infused the company with cash, and last month said his hedge fund, ESL Investments, would be interested in acquiring Sears\u2019 real estate, including its $1.2 billion in debt, Kenmore appliances brand and parts of its home services business.  \u201cWe needed liquidity; I\u2019ve provided it, but we can\u2019t operate if we don\u2019t have the necessary liquidity,\u201d he said, adding that the company is \u201cfar from where I hoped we would be at this point.\u201d  Under the new partnership with Amazon, Sears will expand its DieHard products available on Amazon to include DieHard tires. Sears also already sells its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon.  The tire service will roll out to Sears Auto Centers in the United States over the next couple of weeks.  \u201cThe partnership with Amazon, while a positive for Sears Auto Centers, is unlikely to impact the overall deteriorating revenue and profit picture at Sears stores in a meaningful way,\u201d said Ken Perkins, founder of Retail Metrics. He said previous Sears stock rallies have been short-lived given the company\u2019s debt levels, operating losses and store closures.  As of February, Sears operated 1,002 stores, down from 2,019 stores in 2012.  Separately on Wednesday, Amazon said it had partnered with homebuilder Lennar Corp to convert some of the home construction company\u2019s model homes into showrooms for its digital voice assistant Alexa.  Over the past year, Amazon has entered into partnerships with physical chains such as department store operator Kohl\u2019s Corp to sell Amazon-branded items as well as use its retail locations for picking up online orders.. In April, it tapped electronics chain Best Buy to sell smart televisions with the capabilities of Alexa baked in. In return, Best Buy would become the exclusive merchant of these TVs on Amazon.com.","276":"FILE PHOTO: An Amazon.com Inc driver stands next to an Amazon delivery truck in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 21, 2016.

The death toll in Italy from COVID-19 has risen by 812 in the last 24 hours, the Civil Protection Agency said on Monday, reversing two days of declines. The country, the hardest hit in the world, saw its total death tally rise to 11,591 since the outbreak emerged in northern regions on Feb. 21.  To grapple with an unprecedented health emergency, the Italian government on March 22 ordered non-essential businesses to close until at least April 3. But it said others in strategic and essential sectors should keep working.  Parcel and mail delivery is considered essential and has not halted, provided the one-meter safety distance is respected and workers wear face masks and gloves.  \u201cSeveral employees working at the site use face masks for days instead of having new ones each day,\u201d one union representative told Reuters. He added that Amazon representatives did not attend a meeting called by local authorities in Florence to discuss the health emergency.  Amazon said it has reduced deliveries in Italy since March 22, focusing on products that are most-wanted by customers and stopped accepting orders for many products not considered a priority.  \u201cAs customers use e-commerce as a useful tool for their social distancing efforts, we too have adopted specific measures within our sites so that our employees can respect social distance and work safely,\u201d the company said in a statement.

Amazon led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May last year making what the two parties called \u201ca minority investment\u201d and pitching it against Uber Eats and Just Eat Takeaway.com in the global race to dominate the market for meal deliveries.  Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a detailed investigation in December, saying the deal could damage competition by discouraging Amazon from re-entering the online restaurant food market and further developing its presence within the online convenience grocery delivery market.  The CMA provisionally cleared the deal in April, saying it had become clear that the coronavirus crisis was damaging Deliveroo\u2019s revenues, given the closure of a large number of the restaurants available through its platform during the lockdown. It said Deliveroo could go out of business without Amazon\u2019s investment.  That provisional clearance was criticised in submissions by companies including Just Eat Takeaway and Dominos Pizza.  The regulator was due to make its final ruling by June 11 but has now extended the deadline to August 6.  \u201cIn taking this decision, the (CMA) had regard to the need to take full account of representations received from the parties and third parties in response to the provisional findings and to reflect the impact of Coronavirus...in its assessment,\u201d it said on Wednesday.

Shares soared as much as 13% in after-hours trade, putting the online retailer back in the $1 trillion market capitalization club. If the share gain holds on Friday, it will be the biggest daily jump for Amazon since October 2017.  Amazon also forecast operating income of up to $4.2 billion in the current quarter, down from $4.4 billion the year prior. Still, that appeared to assuage investor concerns about Amazon\u2019s continued spending on fast delivery, which could have erased windfalls from e-commerce, advertising and cloud computing sales.  \u201cWe\u2019re past the worst in terms of the margin pressure from the one-day shipping initiative,\u201d said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. That and the \u201cmassively overstated\u201d concerns about cloud competition rebutted some of the biggest arguments against buying the stock, he said.  Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters that additional investment in one-day shipping came slightly under the $1.5 billion the company had forecast for the fourth quarter, despite more customer orders. Extra costs in the current period will be about $1 billion for the delivery effort, he said.  Olsavsky added that spending on video would rise going forward, but the company was still determining its overall level of investment for 2020.  Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the world\u2019s biggest online retailer now has more than 150 million paid members in its loyalty club Prime, a 50% increase from its last disclosure in April 2018.  Subscribers keep returning to Amazon to benefit from perks like fast delivery, television and music streaming. Its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers has prompted still more engagement from customers, and grocery orders more than doubled in the holiday quarter in a vote of confidence for Amazon\u2019s 2017 bet to buy Whole Foods Market.  This formula has helped make Bezos the richest person in the world.  Amazon is hoping that cutting delivery times to one day for Prime members will let it outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart Inc WMT.N that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. The company made progress in the holiday season, reporting that it quadrupled one-day and same-day deliveries over the year-ago quarter.  Revenue from subscription fees grew 32% to $5.2 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, Amazon said, as more shoppers signed up for Prime than in any period prior.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  WATCHING CORONAVIRUS  Net sales rose 21% to $87.4 billion while net income rose 8% to $3.3 billion - each over $1 billion more than analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The profit rise reflects the evolving nature of Amazon\u2019s business. The company has been moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it takes lucrative fees for shipping and advertising the products of other merchants on its platform.  This has helped weather massive spending at Amazon, a company that has long passed up short-term results in favor of bets that could reap it future profit.  For instance, faster delivery has meant a surge in hiring and related costs. The company said its full-time and part-time headcount rose 23% to 798,000 in the quarter, as it expanded both fulfillment and corporate software roles.  Expenses similarly grew as the company moved inventory closer to customers and built out its last-mile delivery network, which now handles the biggest share of Amazon-ordered packages in the United States. Amazon said worldwide shipping costs rose 43% to $12.9 billion.  Amazon Web Services (AWS) also has seen infrastructure and marketing costs rise. The unit responsible for selling data storage and computing power in the cloud lost out to Microsoft Corp MSFT.O in a high-profile deal last quarter to sell technology to the U.S. Department of Defense, in what could have netted the company $10 billion over a decade. Amazon is contesting the contract decision.  Microsoft on Wednesday reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales for its Azure cloud computing service. Yet Amazon posted better results than feared, growing revenue 34% to $9.95 billion, similar to its third-quarter increase.  \u201cThis is important because it ends six quarters of measurable decline in AWS growth, reassuring investors that the segment has signs of stability,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, said in a research note.  Amazon's international business also narrowed losses to $617 million in the fourth quarter. The company has less exposure to China than Apple Inc AAPL.O and other technology industry peers, which may help it weather economic uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of the coronavirus.  Olsavsky said Amazon is watching the situation very carefully and is starting to put China travel restrictions on employees. The company considers China to be a far less strategic market than India, which CEO Bezos visited earlier this month partly to announce a new $1 billion investment in the country.

The decision culminates a two-year battle between Amazon and civil liberties activists, who have voiced concern that inaccurate matches could lead to unjust arrests.  The death of George Floyd, a black man who died under the knee of a white police officer last month, has fanned worries that facial recognition would be used unfairly against protesters.  Critics have pointed to a past study showing Amazon\u2019s \u201cRekognition\u201d service struggled to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, research that Amazon has contested.  The company, which sells cloud computing technology via its Amazon Web Services division, said in a statement it has pushed for regulations to ensure the software was used ethically.  \u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested,\u201d Amazon said.  Congress has been weighing possible regulation of the technology for months. On Monday, IBM wrote lawmakers to say it no longer is offering facial recognition generally, while rival Microsoft Corp has turned down some sales and backed regulations but not a moratorium.  Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, gave Amazon credit while calling for a more \u201cblanket\u201d moratorium.  \u201cFace recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us,\u201d Ozer said in a statement. \u201cWe urge Microsoft and other companies to join IBM, Google, and Amazon in moving towards the right side of history.\u201d  Microsoft spokespeople did not immediately answer a request for comment.  Amazon, due to its prominence and defense of facial recognition, has faced the brunt of criticism, giving symbolic significance to its announcement. Still, firms such as Idemia and NEC Corp are known to have more facial recognition government business. Private-sector sales of Rekognition accounted for around $3 million of Amazon\u2019s $25.7 billion in cloud revenue in 2018, according to news site The Information.  One law enforcement user of Rekognition said Amazon was \u201cthrowing us under the bus.\u201d Agencies generally have said they use facial recognition for post-crime investigations, not real-time monitoring.  \u201cAfter over and over again saying that they stand by us and how we use the tech, they are making it seem like all of a sudden they don\u2019t think we use it right,\u201d the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Amazon said it would continue to permit the technology\u2019s use by customers that help law enforcement find human trafficking victims.","282":"VIENNA, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Non-profit group noyb, led by privacy activist Max Schrems, said it had filed a complaint against Amazon to the German data protection authority over a lack of data security in a case it said could lead to fines of more than $4 billion.  Amazon\u2019s email servers, used for direct communication between customers and third-party sellers on the platform, do not allow baseline industry encryption in some cases, breaking security rules under the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), noyb said on Wednesday.  \u201cNoyb submitted a complaint to the supervisory authority of the state of Hessia in Germany on behalf of an Amazon seller,\u201d the group said in a statement.  The complaint was submitted to the Hessia data protection authority (DPA) because the seller was located in the German state, Schrems said. It was likely that the Luxembourg watchdog would have to investigate the matter too as Amazon has its European headquarters there.  Amazon did not immediately provide a comment.  European regulators have taken a tough line on U.S. tech giants. In the present case GDPR foresees fines of up to 2% of global revenue for companies that break the rules, according to noyb. Amazon reported 2019 sales of $280 billion.  Schrems is a veteran privacy campaigner who took his first legal action against Facebook as a student in 2011. His case ultimately resulted in what lawyers called a \u201cbombshell\u201d ruling in 2015, knocking down the Safe Harbour data transfer framework between the European Union and the United States.  Now a lawyer, Schrems has filed complaints against Facebook, Amazon, Google, Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years.

FILE PHOTO: A FedEx delivery worker carries a package for a delivery in Wilmette, Illinois, October 27, 2015. REUTERS\/Jim Young  Amazon has been building out its own delivery network of planes, trucks and vans, a development that is seen posing a potential long-term challenge to FedEx and delivery rival United Parcel Service Inc, both of which count Amazon as a customer.  FedEx described the decision as a strategic move that would allow it to focus on the broader e-commerce market, a group that would include rivals of Amazon scaling up one- and two-day delivery. FedEx forecast that the market would double to 100 million packages per day in the United States by 2026.  \u201cAmazon had a better rate with UPS so it made no sense for them to use FedEx,\u201d said Dean Maciuba, director of consulting services at Logistics Trends and Insights.  The decision does not impact any existing contracts between Amazon and other FedEx business units or relating to international services, the package delivery company said.  Amazon accounted for less than 1.3% of FedEx\u2019s revenue last year, the company said in its statement.  Analysts said that the ending of FedEx Express\u2019 contract with Amazon is likely to benefit UPS, which gets a relatively larger share of revenue from the online retailer.  \u201cWe would expect UPS to report much stronger volume growth in next-day air products over the next several quarters,\u201d Bernstein analyst David Vernon wrote in a client note.  UPS volumes have been boosted by Amazon\u2019s move to one-day shipping for its paid Prime service, and \u201cthis news means more growth in lower priced, lower weight, lower service level ... domestic express products at UPS,\u201d Vernon said.  In recent years, Amazon has steadily expanded its fleet of delivery aircraft, which Air Transport Services Group Inc and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings have operated.  The company is investing $1.5 billion to build an air cargo hub in northern Kentucky, setting it up to rely less on others for air shipping.  Amazon already has 40 leased cargo planes and has signed an agreement to induct 10 more planes into the fleet in the next two years.  \u201cWe respect FedEx\u2019s decision and thank them for their role serving Amazon customers over the years,\u201d Amazon said in an emailed statement.  Shares of FedEx, which rose as much as 1.65% earlier in the session, pared gains and closed up 0.75% at $158.02. Amazon shares ended the day 2.8% higher at $1,804.03.

Amazon on Thursday described an \u201cunlikely... string of events\u201d that made Alexa send an audio recording of the family to one of their contacts randomly. The episode underscored how Alexa can misinterpret conversation as a wake-up call and command.  A local news outlet, KIRO 7, reported that a woman with Amazon devices across her home received a call two weeks ago from her husband\u2019s employee, who said Alexa had recorded the family\u2019s conversation about hardwood floors and sent it to him.  \u201cI felt invaded,\u201d the woman, only identified as Danielle, said in the report. \u201cA total privacy invasion.

This means that an utterance quite like Alexa, even from a TV commercial, can activate a device.  That\u2019s what happened in the incident, Amazon said.  \u201cSubsequent conversation was heard as a \u2018send message\u2019 request,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAt which point, Alexa said out loud \u2018To whom?\u2019 At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer\u2019s contact list.\u201d  Amazon added, \u201cWe are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.\u201d  Assuring customers of Alexa\u2019s security is crucial to Amazon, which has ambitions for Alexa to be ubiquitous - whether dimming the lights for customers or placing orders for them with the world\u2019s largest online retailer.

Located in one of the company\u2019s Seattle offices, the eighth Amazon Go store is near the original and a quarter the size, at a mere 450 square feet.

As you surely know, Amazon disclosed on Jan. 10 that it was suspending its web-hosting services for Parler because, in Amazon\u2019s view, Parler had failed to respond to a steady increase in violent content after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill. Parler alleged in its lawsuit the next day and in an accompanying motion for a temporary restraining order that Amazon, driven by \u201cpolitical animus\u201d and a desire to boost Parler\u2019s competitor Twitter, had sabotaged Parler at precisely the moment that Parler was poised for explosive growth. Parler counsel David Groesbeck accused Amazon of violating federal antitrust law in addition to breach of contract, arguing that Amazon\u2019s actions illegally favored Twitter.  Amazon\u2019s lawyers at Davis Wright Tremaine filed the company\u2019s brief opposing the TRO Tuesday night. Citing scores of chilling posts by Parler users - including vivid threats of violence to politicians, social media executives, journalists, Amazon delivery drivers, even teachers \u2013 Amazon argued that it was Parler, not Amazon, that had breached their agreement. Amazon\u2019s terms of service, the brief said, prohibit content that \u201cviolates the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others.\u201d If its web services customers violate those terms, Amazon said, it has the right to suspend or terminate their accounts immediately. And, according to Amazon, it gave Parler plenty of opportunity to come up with protocols to comply with Amazon rules, as an Amazon executive recounted in a redacted declaration. (Amazon said it had redacted the name of the executive for fear its employee would be attacked.) Parler\u2019s response \u2013 an inchoate plan to use volunteers to identify dangerous posts \u2013 was inadequate, Amazon said.  Amazon also pointed to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the clause conservatives love to hate. Section 230, as you know, restricts liability for online service providers. In this case, Amazon said, it precludes Parler\u2019s claims because Amazon acted in good faith. Under Section 230, Amazon said, it can\u2019t be liable for acting in good faith to block violent and harassing content.  But for me, Amazon\u2019s most interesting argument refuted Parler\u2019s allegation that Amazon violated the Sherman Act by favoring Twitter, even though, according to Parler, Twitter\u2019s content can be just as violent and abusive as posts on Parler. The pleading standard for federal antitrust claims, as Amazon\u2019s Davis Wright lawyers said in their brief, is notoriously strict after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 ruling in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly (550 U.S. 544). Antitrust plaintiffs must plausibly allege an anticompetitive conspiracy. But Parler didn\u2019t even allege that Amazon and Twitter ever discussed Parler, let alone that they had an agreement to squelch the right-leaning site.  Amazon provided a declaration (also redacted) from an executive who negotiated the company\u2019s recently announced agreement with Twitter. Amazon had previously been providing web hosting services for ancillary Twitter services, like data backup and Twitter\u2019s new Fleets feature, but not for Twitter\u2019s main feed. Under the new agreement, announced in December, Amazon will begin hosting Twitter\u2019s main feed at an unspecified future date. But according to the executive, the negotiations with Twitter did not touch upon Parler.  \u201cTo my knowledge, (Amazon) and Twitter have never discussed, much less agreed upon, any policy, practice, or act directed at Parler,\u201d the executive said. \u201cTo the contrary, we have an internal policy never to discuss matters involving one customer with another customer. Nobody in my organization would be authorized to discuss Parler with Twitter without my authorization (and) I have not authorized any AWS employee to discuss Parler with Twitter.\u201d  There\u2019s also a very good reason, according to Amazon, why Amazon would not have conspired with Twitter to thwart Parler: Amazon has no motive to pick between them. It\u2019s in the business of providing web services to any customer, regardless of political views, that\u2019s willing to comply with its terms, its executive said in the redacted declaration.  \u201cAWS has no incentive to stop doing business with paying customers,\u201d Davis Wright wrote in Amazon\u2019s brief. It only suspended Parler\u2019s account, the brief said, because Parler violated Amazon\u2019s terms by failing to offer a systemic plan to take down violent and abusive posts.  Stanford law professor Mark Lemley told my Reuters colleague Tom Rowe that Parler\u2019s antitrust theory just doesn\u2019t seem plausible. \u201cIt would be one thing if there were evidence that Amazon, Twitter and Facebook conspired together to target Parler,\u201d Lemley said. \u201cBut Amazon acting alone isn\u2019t an antitrust problem \u2026 Amazon has a general right to refuse to deal with anyone for any reason, or indeed no reason at all.\u201d  Parler\u2019s reply brief, filed Wednesday afternoon, argued that circumstantial evidence backs its claim that Amazon acted in the interest of Twitter, a much bigger and wealthier client than Parler. Amazon only began threatening to shut down Parler web services when users began switching en masse from Twitter to Parler, the brief said. That timing, coupled with Amazon\u2019s tolerance for violent posts by Twitter users, suggests a conspiracy to promote Twitter at Parler\u2019s expense.  Parler also said Amazon and Twitter had \u201ca clear interest in  eliminating an up-and-coming service like Parler,\u201d although the brief did not directly respond to Amazon\u2019s argument that it\u2019s happy to take money from any customer that complies with its terms. Parler said Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct by erasing its site from the microblogging market.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein will preside over a hearing on Parler\u2019s TRO motion tomorrow.  Parler and its users are convinced there\u2019s a double standard. As the company complained in its filings, Twitter users also post violent threats: Just the day before Amazon suspended Parler, #HangMikePence was a trending topic on Twitter. (Amazon\u2019s brief explained that it does not currently provide web hosting services to Twitter\u2019s main feed, so it could not have threatened suspension. It also said that Twitter subsequently blocked the hashtag.)  But Amazon\u2019s apparently unilateral decision to boot Parler does not constitute an antitrust conspiracy. Without additional evidence, Parler\u2019s Sherman Act claim is not going to get the site reinstated through Amazon web services.","293":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, November 5, 2019.

StreetScooter has also installed 60 charging stations at Amazon\u2019s distribution centre outside Munich, Deutsche Post said in a statement.  In recent years, Amazon has been building up its own delivery business in Germany, its second biggest market, in a challenge to major logistics firms like Deutsche Post DHL.  Deutsche Post DHL fully acquired StreetScooter in 2014 and uses about 10,000 of the 12,000 vehicles it has put on the road. The unprofitable subsidiary is seeking new investors and customers to further ramp up production.  DHL will debut StreetScooter\u2019s zero-emission Work L delivery van in two urban U.S. markets, starting in spring 2020, the companies said in November.  Adam Elman, sustainability head for Amazon Europe, said Amazon has already ordered a further 200 electric vehicles from other suppliers which it would start using in Germany this year.  Daimler's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz said it had delivered 10 of its eVito electric transporters to Amazon on Wednesday.

He will not be returning for the upcoming fifth season of the groundbreaking series, Amazon said.  He is the latest celebrity to lose his job in the sexual misconduct scandal that has roiled Hollywood and beyond for the past five months.  The decision comes after an investigation started by Amazon in November into accusations against Tambor by two people on the show. The said Tambor had sexually harassed them and engaged in inappropriate behavior.  In his statement, Tambor said the discussions were never discussed with him directly and that he regretted if any of his actions were misinterpreted. He also called the investigation \u201cdeeply flawed and biased toward the toxic politicized atmosphere that afflicted our set.\u201d  Tambor won two Emmys, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award for his performance on the show, which was the first Amazon TV original series to garner such critical acclaim.

Hopes that the two countries will hammer out a deal to end their protracted trade war have sparked a rally in stocks this year, keeping the main stock indexes at over two-month highs.  Shares of Amazon.com Inc gained 1.4 percent, providing the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.  Walmart jumped 3.9 percent after the world\u2019s largest retailer reported an estimate-beating jump in holiday quarter comparable sales, helped by consumer spending in key categories like groceries and increased e-commerce purchases.  The company\u2019s results helped lift the mood in the sector, especially after a Commerce Department report showed last week that U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest drop in more than nine years for December, stoking fears of an economic slowdown.  Target Corp rose 1.7 percent and Costco Wholesale Corp 1.2 percent.  \u201cWe got really good earnings from Walmart, which was a surprise to investors after the weak retail sales numbers last week,\u201d said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.  \u201cBut investors still seem to be sitting on their hands until we have more information on the trade front.\u201d  The talks in Washington follow a round of negotiations that ended in Beijing last week without a deal but which officials said had generated progress on contentious issues between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Higher-level talks will start on Thursday.  Trade-exposed industrial sector was little changed, with bellwether Boeing Co down 0.4 percent.  The consumer staples sector rose 0.76 percent, the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, helped by Walmart.  JPMorgan Chase & Co fell 1 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc dropped 0.6 percent, capping gains on the financial index, which was flat.  After the Federal Reserve announced its wait-and-see approach on interest rates this year, investors will look for more clues on monetary policy when the central bank releases the minutes from its January meeting on Wednesday.  At 12:42 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 29.63 points, or 0.11 percent, at 25,912.88, the S&P 500 was up 6.18 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,781.78 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 23.57 points, or 0.32 percent, at 7,495.98.  Mattel Inc shares dropped 2.8 percent, after the company issued a disappointing 2019 sales forecast and said demand for its iconic Barbie doll was slowing.  Freeport-McMoRan jumped 7.7 percent, the most on the S&P, after Citi Research upgraded the shares of the copper miner, seeing an upside potential for the red metal and added that weakness in China seemed to be turning.

The world\u2019s largest online retailer notified sellers that its program known as Amazon Lending would pause repayments beginning Thursday until April 30. Interest would not accrue during that period, it said.  The program has offered sums between $1,000 and $750,000 to merchants looking for capital to acquire inventory, expand their product lines and advertise on Amazon.  \u201cLoan repayments will restart on May 1, 2020 ... You will have the same number of remaining payments once repayment resumes,\u201d Amazon said in a seller message obtained by Reuters.  The company\u2019s offer may provide relief to sellers, some of whom could be hard hit by Amazon\u2019s recent decision to restrict its U.S. and European fulfillment services to household, medical and other essential goods in demand during the outbreak.  Merchants of popular items from toys to apparel have worried that the temporary ban on stocking goods in Amazon warehouses, on which they depend for delivery, would mean low sales and difficulty paying back loans.  Jamison Philippi, an Amazon seller of toys and video games in Hackensack, New Jersey, had estimated to Reuters his income could drop by 75% just as he had a roughly $3,500 loan payment due to Amazon on April 1.  \u201cThat\u2019s super awesome. I cheered when I got that email. That relieves a lot of stress right now,\u201d Philippi said.  Amazon\u2019s move came after at least one rival offered sellers relief.  Ricardo Pero, chief executive of lending company SellersFunding, last week told Reuters he was easing terms to help sellers on Amazon and other marketplaces navigate the rapidly changing retail market. SellersFunding offers lines of credit and term loans to new and existing borrowers. Both products offer a 90-day interest-only period.  Amazon, which had won customers by continually making shipping faster over the years, has now slowed delivery to weeks in some cases in order to manage a flood of orders. That could also dampen merchants\u2019 sales as shoppers look elsewhere for goods.  It was unclear what additional relief Amazon might provide to sellers, if any.  More than 20,000 merchants have gotten loans from Amazon, the company said in 2017. The e-commerce giant said at the time it had doled out more than $1 billion to sellers in the preceding 12 months.

The logo of Flipkart is seen on the company's office in Bengaluru, India, May 9, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa  Flipkart and Amazon both began their flagship annual sales in India on Wednesday, and will compete for shoppers during the October-December festive season when most big-ticket purchases are made in the country.  \u201cFlipkart is expecting a big spike in (its) \u2018Big Billion Days\u2019 sales over last year,\u201d its Chief Executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy told reporters at the e-commerce company\u2019s Bengaluru-headquarters late on Wednesday, referring to Flipkart\u2019s annual sale.  Company executives said Flipkart\u2019s deeper push into India\u2019s small towns and cities, its range of cheap, high-quality private label products and the wide assortment of smartphones will boost its sales during this year\u2019s event.  The \u2018Big Billion Days\u2019 sale will go on until Oct. 14, while Amazon\u2019s rival sale dubbed the \u2018Great Indian Festival\u2019 will finish on Oct. 15, according to its website.  Krishnamurthy said Flipkart is not worried about its rival stealing customers.  \u201cDo we worry about them? On a scale of 0 to 10, it is close to 0 today. We don\u2019t see that much of relevance for the Indian user coming from our competition today,\u201d Krishnamurthy said. \u201cWe see them as becoming a global platform for premium Indian books and home goods buyers.\u201d  The two companies have been locked in a pitched battle to gain share in India\u2019s burgeoning e-commerce market, which is tipped to grow to be worth $200 billion a year in a decade, according to Morgan Stanley.  Flipkart launched in India in 2007, while Amazon only made a full foray into the country in 2014. Still, Amazon has gained ground rapidly, winning over tens of millions of Indian customers with its Prime loyalty program, which gives users early access to deals during sales as well free music and video streaming.  The rivalry has intensified this year after Amazon\u2019s U.S. rival Walmart bought a 77 percent stake in Flipkart for $16 billion.  Krishnamurthy said Flipkart is competing by making its range of products more affordable for Indian buyers through financing options, trade-in programs and its own private label brands.  Smartphones will be Flipkart\u2019s biggest selling category this year, but the online marketplace\u2019s dependence on phones to bulk up sales has fallen as sales in other categories have risen, he said.  The online retailer expects to sell half of all smartphones sold in India during the festive season.","299":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen on the door of an Amazon Books retail store in New York City, U.S., February 14, 2019.

The former press secretary to U.S. President Barack Obama, Carney was scheduled to talk with India\u2019s ambassador to the United States in Washington, D.C. In Delhi, the Indian government had just announced foreign direct investment regulations that threatened to disrupt Amazon\u2019s business in the world\u2019s second most populous country.  FILE PHOTO: India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi presents the Global Leadership Award to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos at the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) 41st annual Leadership Summit in Washington, U.S., June 7, 2016. REUTERS\/Yuri Gripas\/File Photo  Before the meeting, Amazon employees prepared a draft note for Carney. The note, reviewed by Reuters, advised Carney what to say \u2013 and what not to say.  He should highlight the fact that Amazon had committed more than $5.5 billion in investment in India and how it provided an online platform for 400,000-plus Indian sellers. But he was cautioned not to divulge that some 33 Amazon sellers accounted for about a third of the value of all goods sold on the company\u2019s website. That information, the note advised, was \u201cSensitive\/not for disclosure.\u201d  Other company documents reveal equally touchy information: Two more sellers on the e-commerce giant\u2019s India platform \u2013 merchants in which Amazon had indirect equity stakes \u2013 accounted for around 35% of the platform\u2019s sales revenue in early 2019. That meant some 35 of Amazon\u2019s more than 400,000 sellers in India at the time accounted for around two-thirds of its online sales.  All this information was indeed politically sensitive. If it got out, it could give fresh ammunition to small Indian retailers who allege that Amazon harms their businesses by flouting federal regulations and favoring a few big sellers. It could have annoyed Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose political base includes millions of these small retailers. And it would have undercut Amazon\u2019s public messaging that it is the friend of small business in India. As the company says in one marketing slogan in India, it is \u201ctransforming lives, one click at a time.\u201d  What Carney wound up telling the ambassador is unclear. A meeting did take place in April 2019, but neither side would comment on the specifics of the gathering.  The briefing note for Carney is contained in hundreds of internal Amazon documents that are reported here for the first time. News of their contents could deepen the risks facing the company as it encounters intensifying government scrutiny in one of its fastest-growing markets. The documents lay bare that for years, Amazon has been giving preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its India platform, publicly misrepresented its ties with the sellers and used them to circumvent increasingly tough regulatory restrictions here.  Indian traders, both brick-and-mortar and smaller online sellers, have long alleged that Amazon\u2019s platform largely benefits a tiny number of big sellers and that the American giant engages in predatory pricing that has crushed legions of retailers. Amazon rejects this: It says it complies with Indian law, which stipulates that an e-commerce platform can only connect sellers to buyers for a fee, unlike in the United States, where Amazon can both act as middleman and sell goods directly to consumers.  The company also says it runs a transparent online marketplace and treats all sellers equally. The internal Amazon documents contradict those claims, revealing how the e-commerce giant has helped a small number of sellers prosper, giving them discounted fees and helping one cut special deals with big tech manufacturers such as Apple Inc. The documents also show that the company has exercised significant control over the inventory of some of the biggest sellers on Amazon.in, even though it says publicly that all sellers operate independently on its platform.  The documents reviewed by Reuters are dated between 2012 and 2019. They include drafts of meeting notes, PowerPoint slides, business reports and emails. One of the notes contains a frank appraisal of Modi\u2019s \u201cstraight forward\u201d style of thinking, sizing him up as \u201cnot an intellectual.\u201d Together, they provide a look inside a cat-and-mouse game Amazon has played with India\u2019s government, adjusting corporate structures each time the government imposed new restrictions on foreign e-commerce firms, amid growing agitation from small retailers.  Amazon \u201cdoes not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace\u201d and \u201chas always complied with the law,\u201d the company said in a written response to questions from Reuters. \u201cThe reporting appears based on unsubstantiated, incomplete, and\/or factually incorrect information, likely supplied (maliciously) with the intention of creating sensation and discrediting Amazon.\u201d The company added that it \u201ctreats all sellers in a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner, with each seller responsible for independently determining prices and managing their inventory.\u201d  Modi\u2019s office and India\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and Industry didn\u2019t respond to questions from Reuters.  Amazon has become one of the two biggest e-commerce platforms in India, with close to $10 billion in sales in 2019, according to Forrester Research. The American giant knows it faces significant regulatory risks here.  In recent years, Amazon has stated in its annual U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision disclosures that its business structures and activities comply with Indian law, but that there are \u201csubstantial uncertainties\u201d regarding their interpretation. It is possible the Indian government \u201cwill ultimately take a view contrary to ours,\u201d the disclosure states. And a violation of any existing or future regulations or a change in their interpretation could result in the business \u201cbeing subject to fines and other financial penalties\u201d or being forced to restructure or \u201cshut down entirely.\u201d  CHARGED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT  In January 2020, India\u2019s antitrust watchdog, the Competition Commission of India, announced it was investigating Amazon and Walmart Inc\u2019s Flipkart following a complaint by an Indian trader group. The commission cited four alleged anti-competitive practices: exclusive launch of mobile phones by the e-commerce firms, promoting preferred sellers on their websites, deep discounting, and prioritizing some seller listings over others.  The probe is currently on hold after a challenge by Amazon and Flipkart, the other major e-commerce platform in the country.  Separately, Amazon is under investigation by India\u2019s Enforcement Directorate, the federal financial crime-fighting agency, which has been investigating the company for possible violation of foreign investment rules. Such probes typically take years in India, and in most cases details aren\u2019t made public.  Asked about the investigations, Amazon said it was confident of its compliance and committed to cooperating with the antitrust watchdog and Enforcement Directorate. Flipkart did not respond to a request for comment.  The Competition Commission and Enforcement Directorate didn\u2019t respond to questions.  Amazon is operating in a charged political environment. The rise to power of Modi, who first won election in 2014 on a groundswell of Hindu nationalism, has made life complicated for multinational companies. Hindu nationalist groups, suspicious of foreign influence and often critical of large multinationals, are seeking policy changes to protect domestic businesses. Companies like Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Facebook Inc and Mastercard Inc have also faced stringent regulation. In the case of e-commerce, the restrictions are aimed at protecting brick-and-mortar retailers.  Despite the regulatory and political obstacles, Amazon has enjoyed explosive growth in India. The expansion has been led by Amit Agarwal, a senior vice president and the country manager for India. Agarwal, 47, who has a master\u2019s degree in computer science from Stanford University, has risen through the ranks since joining the company in 1999.  By his early 30s, he\u2019d become a close adviser to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. One company document, which details his profile, includes these lines: \u201cAmit was chosen to be Jeff\u2019s technical Advisor at a young age of 33. \u2018Technical advisors\u2019 are a chosen few that work side by side with J Bezos and are then selected to take on some of the most critical roles at Amazon.\u201d  Agarwal enjoys playing electric guitar and was a vocalist during his Stanford days in a rock band called Algo-Rhythms, according to a recent version of his profile on the alumni page of the Indian Institute of Technology, where he got a computer science degree. He is also a \u201cdie-hard fan\u201d of comedian Jerry Seinfeld, according to the profile.  Under Agarwal, Amazon has ramped up investment in India. The country is one of Amazon\u2019s most important growth markets \u2013 especially since it announced in 2019 that it would no longer operate its marketplace in the most populous nation, China, where it faced stiff local competition. On a visit here in January last year, Bezos announced Amazon would spend $1 billion to bring small businesses online in India. That would take the company\u2019s total committed India investment to $6.5 billion.  But India also poses unique challenges to the business model that made Amazon the biggest online retailer on the planet. Because foreign investment regulations in India bar e-commerce firms from holding inventories of goods and selling them directly to customers, companies like Amazon can only collect fees from vendors selling products on their marketplace.  Globally, about 58% of Amazon sales of physical goods in 2018 came from third-party merchants; the rest come from direct sales to consumers, the company has disclosed. The ability to sell straight to people in the United States and elsewhere packs big benefits. It means Amazon can deal directly with manufacturers, for one, giving it greater control over its product range.  It is this barrier \u2013 the regulatory wall around the consumer \u2013 that Amazon has been trying to overcome for much of the past decade in India.  When Amazon arrived in 2004, it created a development center aimed at servicing its global operations. Agarwal, who helped set up the operation, recalled on an Amazon blog in 2019 how his team initially rented cubicle space in another company\u2019s office and \u201cused to sit on the ground and write code\u201d because they didn\u2019t have chairs. Today, the company says it has 100,000 employees in India.  Amazon\u2019s main foray began in 2013. It started listing books and DVDs on Amazon.in, its online platform. Since then, Amazon has taken an aggressive approach to government limits on e-commerce.  \u201cTest the Boundaries of what is allowed by law,\u201d said one slide in a 2014 presentation, titled \u201cRisk Analysis.\u201d The slide advised that preparations be made in the event of a visit by an enforcement body: \u201cEstablish a Strong Dawn raid Process.\u201d  Asked about the slide, Amazon said that \u201cdawn raid preparedness\u201d is \u201cstandard worldwide practise\u201d and refers to the training of employees \u201cto handle site visits from officials pertaining to police, fire services, law enforcement and other services personnel on government duty.\u201d  \u2018SPECIAL MERCHANT\u2019  To deal with the restrictions on direct sales, Amazon found an indirect way of reaching consumers and boosting sales quickly. It entered a joint venture with an entity formed by one of India\u2019s most famous tech moguls, N.R. Narayana Murthy, founder of software services giant Infosys Ltd. The venture was used to create a seller named Cloudtail, which began offering goods on Amazon.in after it was set up in August 2014.  Amazon has said that Cloudtail is an independent seller on its marketplace. A year after Cloudtail was created, Amazon told Indian business newspaper Mint that Cloudtail received \u201cthe same privileges as any of the other sellers on our platform.\u201d  But Amazon has been deeply involved in expanding Cloudtail \u2013 often referred to as \u201cSM,\u201d or \u201cSpecial Merchant,\u201d in the documents.  \u201cThe Special Merchant (SM) was launched in Aug-14 and we helped SM quickly ramp up and gain scale through Q4,\u201d stated an Amazon India report, dated Feb. 23, 2015.  \u201cLaunch, stabilize, grow Special Merchant; make it profitable,\u201d the report said.  Amazon had big plans for Cloudtail. The target was to ensure Cloudtail accounted for 40% of Amazon.in sales, \u201cand build this into a $1+B business\u201d in 2015, according to the report. To that end, the report reveals, Amazon helped Cloudtail \u201cacquire key relationships\u201d with major tech companies, including Apple, Microsoft and OnePlus. This included exclusive deals with these companies to sell their products, such as smartphones. The tech companies got a big new sales channel, while Cloudtail got coveted products that it listed on Amazon.in.  Amazon said in its statement that it facilitates \u201cthe introduction of brands to sellers\u201d in accordance with the brands\u2019 requirements.  A spokesperson for Cloudtail and Murthy said they had no comment. Apple and OnePlus didn\u2019t respond to questions. Microsoft had no comment.  The deals Amazon facilitated with smartphone makers, coupled with deep discounts Cloudtail was offering on the Amazon website, hit India\u2019s offline mobile sellers hard, said Arvinder Khurana, president of the All India Mobile Retailers Association.  \u201cThe entire market was disturbed,\u201d said Khurana, whose trade group represents 150,000 mobile retail stores. \u201cThere\u2019s been a year-on-year decline in sales\u201d at brick-and-mortar shops, he added.  Currently, e-commerce accounts for 4% of India\u2019s roughly $900 billion retail market, according to Forrester Research. But it\u2019s growing fast.  While some 10% of smartphones in India were being sold online in 2013, by 2016 that figure had jumped to 30%, according to Forrester. By 2019 it was 44%. And Amazon and Flipkart dominate these sales, accounting for roughly 90% of all online smartphone sales, said Forrester analyst Satish Meena.  Brick-and-mortar retailers told Reuters they\u2019re struggling to compete with the online giants. One mobile phone seller in the city of Ahmedabad said that while he was selling an iPhone 11 for 56,000 rupees ($769), a customer told him it was going for around 47,000 rupees ($645) on Amazon.  \u2018THERE IS NO BUSINESS\u2019  For Mumbai mobile phone merchant Narendra Gada, the competition was ruinous. In 2013, he said, his business was doing well. It enabled the 44-year-old to support his family of three, selling around 20 phones a day at his store in the upmarket Colaba area. His monthly sales, he said, were around 10 million rupees (about $137,000). \u201cMargins were good at that time,\u201d Gada recalled, as high as 25% on some models.  Everything changed in 2015 with the expansion of online sales of smartphones, he said. He couldn\u2019t compete with the exclusive launch of smartphone models online or the discounts being offered, he said.  By 2016, his sales had dropped some 40%. Customers would come to his shop to try smartphones, ask for the WiFi password and then go online to buy the model they\u2019d just sampled, he said. In 2018, Gada began selling at lower margins and on credit to keep sales alive. Late last year, he shut the shop he\u2019d started in 1998. The final straw was the pandemic-induced lockdown. But he said it was the advent of online sales that killed his business.  \u201cThere is no walk-in now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no business.\u201d  In its statement, Amazon said, \u201cFacts communicate a different reality. Small businesses are increasingly embracing technology and finding success online.\u201d  The company said that it now had over 700,000 sellers on its platform, most of them small and medium businesses, and had \u201cno incentive\u201d to keep the number of sellers down. It also said that tens of thousands of Indian manufacturers are using Amazon to sell to consumers abroad, so far generating cumulative sales of $2 billion. And for millions of consumers, of course, the discounts offered on Amazon\u2019s platform are a boon.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  About two months after Cloudtail\u2019s launch in August 2014, Bezos met Modi in New Delhi. A draft document containing talking points was prepared for the Oct. 3 meeting. It makes no mention of Cloudtail or its plans.  One key objective of the meeting, according to the document, was to discuss barriers to foreign investment in the e-commerce sector.  The document also included a brief appraisal of the Indian leader. \u201cPM Modi is not an intellectual or an academic but believes that strong administration and governance is the key to running a successful government,\u201d it said. \u201cHe is known to like simple, logical, straight forward thinking without excessive academic jargon.\u201d  Asked about the description of Modi, Amazon said it was committed to the prime minister\u2019s vision for India\u2019s digital economy and believes it can help by getting 10 million medium and small businesses online, among other steps.  Both in public and in private meetings, Agarwal emphasized that Amazon was helping the little guy. Ahead of a scheduled meeting with India\u2019s ambassador to the United States in January 2016, a document was prepared for Agarwal and other executives. \u201cWe are committed to transforming lives of SMBs,\u201d or small-and-medium businesses, reads a talking point contained in a draft of the document.  In March 2016, Cloudtail\u2019s share of sales on Amazon.in was around 47%, an internal document shows. Amazon does not make such numbers public.  But that month, Amazon got some bad news: The Indian government announced new foreign investment rules. It capped online marketplace sales from a single seller at 25% of total sales, which was seen as an attempt to level the playing field. To comply with the cap, Cloudtail\u2019s share of sales on the Amazon platform had to be brought to 25% or less.  The new rules also required that an e-commerce platform \u201cwill not exercise ownership over the inventory\u201d sold on its site. Internal company documents show that Amazon was effectively treating Cloudtail\u2019s inventory as its own at the time. In a May 2016 document, for instance, the company explains that \u201cwe will need to move a subset of this selection\u201d of smartphones from Cloudtail \u201cto other sellers,\u201d to comply with the 25% limit.  That\u2019s what it did. Amazon moved the procurement of some mobile phone brands Cloudtail was offering to Amazon Wholesale, a wholesale business-to-business operation in India which did not fall under the foreign investment restrictions. Amazon Wholesale then supplied these products to \u201ccertain\u201d sellers, who in turn sold them on Amazon.in, according to a 2016 internal global regulatory update.  \u201cAs government policies have continued to evolve, we have consistently made the necessary changes to ensure compliance at all times,\u201d Amazon said when asked about the documents laying out the maneuver. \u201cThe so-called facts stated here fail to show any non-compliance\u201d with foreign investment rules.  \u2018DISCOUNTED FEES\u2019  Amazon has repeatedly said it has no role in pricing goods sold online in India and that prices are decided by sellers. The new 2016 government rules explicitly stated that \u201ce-commerce entities providing [a] marketplace will not directly or indirectly influence the sale price of goods or services and shall maintain [a] level playing field.\u201d  Following the rule change, however, Amazon lowered the fees it charged some big sellers on its platform to enable them to offer more competitive prices. \u201cWe adjusted our business model by activating a fee incentive program (Platinum Seller Program or PSP) to provide discounted fees to a subset of large managed sellers (Platinum Sellers) to help them match\u201d prices of e-commerce rivals, said the global regulatory update document.  In addressing the 25%-of-sales cap on a single seller, Amazon also proposed having a second special merchant, in addition to Cloudtail. It estimated the two special merchants would together account for about half of the sales on its platform.  In 2017, a new special merchant named Appario \u2013 referred to as \u201cSM2\u201d in an internal document \u2013 was created. This time, Amazon entered into another joint venture, with an entity backed by the family of Ashok Patni, a pioneer in the Indian IT outsourcing sector.  One internal Amazon document from 2019 states that the two special merchants get \u201csubsidized fees\u201d and access to Amazon global retail tools. These tools are used for things like inventory and invoice management.  Amazon said its marketplace fees depend on the category of product and the season of the year, and are \u201cuniformly applicable to all like sellers.\u201d  Appario and a Patni representative did not respond to requests for comment.  Even after India implemented new investment rules in 2016, relations between Bezos and the Modi government seemed good. That June, the Amazon boss received a business leadership award from Modi at a U.S.-India Business Council event in Washington. Bezos told the audience how small sellers were benefiting from Amazon\u2019s India marketplace. He announced he planned to invest a further $3 billion in the country.  In 2016, Amazon launched its Prime Video streaming service in India and introduced its voice-recognition speakers the next year. It has also ventured into food retail and expanded its cloud-computing business.  In late 2018, Amazon\u2019s major annual online sales promotion, the Great Indian Festival, was a smash. During the big sale, India head Agarwal rejoiced in an internal email to employees.  The first 36 hours of the sale \u201csurpassed every event in our history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe had our biggest day ever for Smartphones, with estimated 3 out of every 4 smartphones sold in the entire country (online or offline) purchased on Amazon.in \u2013 this is truly phenomenal.\u201d  NEW RESTRICTIONS  With a national election looming in April 2019, the Modi government struck again. In December 2018, it announced new restrictions that prohibited vendors in which marketplaces such as Amazon have an equity interest from selling products on these marketplaces. The aim, government officials told Reuters at the time, was to deter deep discounting by big online retailers.  The new limits forced Amazon to restructure its relationships with Cloudtail and Appario, the two special merchants in which it held indirect stakes. As company documents showed, the two then accounted for around 35% of Amazon\u2019s online sales.  The regulatory change was widely seen in India as a move by Modi to pacify small traders, a critical part of his party\u2019s electoral base. It was this change to the foreign investment rules that Amazon executive Jay Carney wanted to discuss with the Indian ambassador at the time, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, in Washington. Shringla is now India\u2019s foreign secretary.  Asked about the Carney meeting, Amazon said, \u201cwe cannot comment on specifics of the meeting as those are confidential.\u201d  Shringla\u2019s office said in a statement: \u201cThe meeting in question was at Amazon\u2019s request.\u201d It didn\u2019t provide any detail on what was discussed.  In the early hours of Feb. 1, 2019, thousands of products being sold by Cloudtail and Appario vanished from Amazon\u2019s website in compliance with the deadline for the new rules. But days later, the products were back as Amazon reduced its equity stake in the parent companies of the two sellers. This maneuver, the company believed, made it compliant with the new rules, according to the internal document from 2019.  Amazon\u2019s relationship with the Indian government was growing more contentious.  In June 2019, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal dressed down e-commerce executives, including Amazon\u2019s Agarwal, telling them in a meeting they must comply with the new rules. Goyal was blunt, said one executive who was there.  \u201cWe will not let e-commerce impact small shopkeepers... I know there have been many issues of non-compliance,\u201d the executive said, summarizing Goyal\u2019s remarks. \u201cSo think about it, set it right. If you don\u2019t, we will make things public, it will be put in the public domain and you will be embarrassed.\u201d  Then came the news of the antitrust probe into Amazon and Flipkart in January 2020, the same month Bezos was making another trip to India. Traders staged small street protests, holding up placards with a red \u201cX\u201d emblazoned on a picture of the Amazon CEO\u2019s face and the words, \u201cJeff Bezos Go Back!\u201d  Commerce Minister Goyal diminished the company\u2019s announcement of a further $1 billion of investment. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if they are doing a great favor to India,\u201d he said.  There was another salvo in August: A group of more than 2,000 online sellers filed an antitrust case against Amazon and Cloudtail, alleging Amazon favors some retailers whose online discounts drive other vendors out of business. Amazon and Cloudtail have both said they comply with all laws; the Competition Commission of India has yet to decide whether to order an investigation into the matter.  And there is another threat: Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest man and chairman of Reliance Industries, one of the country\u2019s biggest conglomerates, is expanding his e-commerce business. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.  Despite the challenges, Amazon continues to grow. Last year, it began offering auto insurance and announced it was launching an online pharmacy service.  It also continues to tout itself as a platform for the little guy. For its big annual sale in October, it ran a front-page newspaper ad that read: \u201cCelebrating India\u2019s Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs.\u201d","301":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  MILAN (Reuters) - Poste Italiane can weather competition from Amazon.com in its deliveries business, the chief executive of the former Italian postal services monopoly said on Friday.

In June Poste and Amazon signed a three-year agreement allowing e-commerce products bought through the Amazon platform to be delivered at late hours or over weekends.  \u201cThe market is growing, there is room for everyone, we are not afraid of competition,\u201d Del Fante said.

Amazon.com said it would buy online pharmacy PillPack, sending shares of drug distributors and retailers tumbling as the e-commerce giant moves deeper into the healthcare sector.  Walgreens Boots Alliance, already under pressure after its third-quarter earnings report, tumbled 10.5 percent and along with UnitedHealth\u2019s 2.4-percent drop pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower.  Shares of CVS Health sank 9.3 percent, Rite Aid fell 10.1 percent and Express Scripts was down 3.2 percent.  The S&P health sector dropped 0.73 percent, the most among the 11 S&P sectors, while Amazon gained 0.8 percent.  The U.S. economy slowed more than previously estimated in the first quarter, with Commerce Department data showing gross domestic product increased at a 2 percent annual rate in the period, instead of the 2.2 percent pace reported last month.  The revision came amid the weakest performance in consumer spending in nearly five years and with the United States engaged in tit-for-tat trade tariffs with its major trade partners, including China, Canada and the European Union.  While data shows the U.S. GDP growth appears to have regained momentum in the second quarter on the back of a robust labor market and tax cuts, analysts fear the tariff wars could undermine those benefits.  \u201cInvestors remain fixated on trade disputes which continue to weigh on risk appetite,\u201d said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at online forex broker Oanda.  \u201cWith Trump picking fights on multiple fronts and no sides showing any willingness to back down, we may have to get used to this risk-averse environment in the near-term.\u201d  At 9:59 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 76.70 points, or 0.32 percent, at 24,040.89, the S&P 500 was up 1.76 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,701.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 9.90 points, or 0.13 percent, at 7,454.98.  Amazon\u2019s burgeoning reach was not limited to just the health sector. Its plans to entice entrepreneurs to set up their own package-delivery businesses sent shares of United Parcel Service and FedEx skidding about 2.5 percent each.  Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index gaining 0.19 percent ahead of results from the second round of the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test for banks and lenders.  The technology sector\u2019s 0.43 percent jump gave the biggest boost to the market.  Accenture jumped 5.1 percent after the consulting and outsourcing services provider reported quarterly revenue and profit above estimates.  Marvell Technology jumped 7.9 percent after the chipmaker said China cleared its $6 billion acquisition of rival Cavium, which rose 9.6 percent.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.16-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and 22 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 17 new highs and 67 new lows.

Blue Origin has added hundreds of engineers over the past three years and continues to ramp up in an expansion that one employee described as \u201chyperbolic.\u201d The Kent, Washington-based company is looking to double its current workforce to around 3,000 employees over the next two to three years, a top customer told Reuters.  The urgency centers on a rocket dubbed New Glenn. The heavy-launch vehicle, which Bezos promises will be able to haul satellites and, eventually, people into orbit, is central to the company\u2019s hopes of winning lucrative military and commercial contracts.  New Glenn\u2019s first-stage booster will be reusable, a key piece of Bezos\u2019 strategy to lower costs and increase the frequency of launches. Blue Origin executives have stated publicly that test flights will begin within two years.  But whether Blue Origin can hit that mark remains to be seen.  With the clock ticking on 2020, company engineers are still finalizing details on New Glenn\u2019s design and just beginning to build model components that must be put through extreme testing, people familiar with the project said. They requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.  Blue Origin has privately acknowledged in conversations with French satellite firm Eutelsat SA - its first New Glenn customer - that its 2020 time frame is \u201cvery aggressive,\u201d a person with direct knowledge of talks between the companies said.  The firms have padded their contract, which covers the launch of a geostationary satellite in the period 2021-2022, so that Blue Origin will incur no penalties if it is late, the person added.  Yohann Leroy, Eutelsat\u2019s Deputy Chief Executive Officer, declined to discuss details of his company\u2019s contract with Blue Origin, but said he was optimistic New Glenn will be ready to carry his firm\u2019s satellite by the end of 2022.  \u201cOf course, I cannot guarantee that they will respect their initial timeline, but we are confident that they will not be very far from it,\u201d Leroy said.  A Blue Origin spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment about the company\u2019s hiring practices, strategy or competitive challenges. The private firm has been tight-lipped on New Glenn\u2019s production status and plans for bringing it to market.  Mounting a successful test in 2020 would give Blue Origin its best shot at fending off competing rockets and new ones expected to enter the market in the next few years, analysts said.  Rivals include aerospace stalwarts United Launch Alliance, a partnership between Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin ; and France\u2019s ArianeGroup, a joint venture between Airbus and Safran. Japan and China are likewise designing reusable rockets.  But 18 years after its founding, Blue Origin has found itself lagging a competitor closer to home: SpaceX.  Founded by Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk, the Hawthorne, California-based company has upended the space industry with its relatively low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets. SpaceX has completed more than 50 successful Falcon launches and snagged billions of dollars\u2019 worth of contracts, including deals with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense.  SpaceX in February transfixed a global audience with the successful test launch of its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, the most powerful operational rocket in the world.  Musk had predicted \u201cgame over\u201d for other makers of heavy rockets if his launch succeeded.  The good news for Blue Origin is that demand for satellite launch services is projected to soar.  Around 800 small satellites are expected to launch annually beginning around 2020, more than double the annual average over the past decade, according to Marco Caceres, senior space analyst with Fairfax, Virginia-based Teal Group.  \u201cIf New Glenn can be ready in the next two years (Blue Origin) may be able to seize that window of opportunity,\u201d he said.  ROCKET SCIENCE  Like Musk, Bezos is passionate about the prospect of humans living and working in space.  Now the world\u2019s richest man, thanks to the success of online retailer Amazon, Bezos has been liquidating $1 billion of its stock annually to fund his interplanetary dreams.  He set up Blue Origin in a warehouse some 20 miles (32 km) south of Seattle. The company\u2019s Latin motto means \u201cstep by step ferociously,\u201d a reference to Bezos\u2019 belief that success comes through steady, incremental progress.  But after nearly two decades, and with the private space race heating up, Bezos is intent on moving closer to commercialization, three Blue Origin employees told Reuters.  Part of those efforts include selling sightseeing trips to the edge of space aboard another Blue Origin rocket dubbed the New Shepard, with ticket prices in the $200,000-$300,000 range.  Blue Origin also is vying to supply its BE-4 engine to United Launch Alliance to power its forthcoming Vulcan rocket, ULA said.  The recent hiring binge has focused mainly on throwing talent at the New Glenn, and has included more than 60 engineers who worked previously for SpaceX.  Blue Origin\u2019s workforce of more than 1,500 has more than doubled from its early 2016 levels, three employees said. Its ranks are expected to double again by the time New Glenn is flying, Eutelsat\u2019s Leroy said. By comparison, SpaceX has more than 6,000 employees.  Bezos\u2019 company has also invested more than $200 million in a rocket-making facility near NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.  Still, Leroy said he expects to see a New Glenn prototype no sooner than mid-2019.  In the meantime, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and satellite companies are directing business to SpaceX.  Matt Desch, Chief Executive Officer of McLean, Virginia-based Iridium Communications Inc, SpaceX\u2019s largest commercial customer, told Reuters that Blue Origin \u201chas been a little less clear\u201d about its strategy.  \u201cNobody disputes that with the investment they\u2019re making they won\u2019t eventually be successful, but how and when they become reliable is still uncertain,\u201d Desch said.","308":"* Sarenza had sales of more than 250 mln euros  * Casino looking to build up online presence  * French sector faces challenge from Amazon (Adds share price, fund manager comment)  PARIS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Casino plans to buy shoe retailer Sarenza as the French group develops its Monoprix supermarket chain online to better compete with firms like Amazon.  Casino, whose credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor\u2019s in March 2016, is under pressure to revive profits in France, its biggest market, where it now makes more than 50 percent of its sales, at a time of slower growth in Brazil.  The planned takeover of Sarenza, which had sales of more than 250 million euros ($310 million) in its last fiscal year, follows an e-commerce deal between Casino and Ocado.  Shares in Casino rose 1.3 percent, outperforming a weaker overall Paris market on Monday as investors welcomed the news of the planned Sarenza deal, although the stock remains down by around 9 percent since the start of 2018.  The company\u2019s shares had fallen sharply in January after it reported weak fourth-quarter sales.  \u201cCasino\u2019s plans to strengthen its digital presence are a sound strategy, although we will have to see how the company integrates it all,\u201d said Meriem Mokdad, fund manager at Paris-based Roche Brune Asset Management.

Earlier this month, Amazon announced plans to create 2,000 new jobs in France, a further sign of the U.S. online giant\u2019s ambitions to grow there.  France\u2019s traditional supermarket operators such as Casino, sector leader Carrefour and privately-held firm Leclerc have all taken steps to respond to the Amazon threat.  Leclerc announced the launch of a food delivery service in Paris last month, while Carrefour struck a partnership in China with Tencent and said it would boost its investments in the sector.

Walgreens\u2019 shares fell as much as 11 percent, overshadowing the company\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly results and a $10 billion buyback, amid a broad selloff among drug retailers and wholesalers after Amazon said it would buy online pharmacy PillPack.  \u201cYou see, the pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages,\u201d CEO Stefano Pessina said on a post-earnings call that was dominated by discussions around Amazon\u2019s foray.  \u201cWe are not particularly worried,\u201d Pessina said, but added that the company was not complacent either.  In its first earnings report as a member of the bluechip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, Walgreens posted a 19.3 percent rise in U.S. pharmacies sales due to higher prescription volumes at Rite Aid stores.  Walgreens bought some of Rite Aid Corp's RAD.N U.S. stores last year after scrapping its deal to buy the smaller rival outright.  However, the retail segment continued to be a drag on its results, with same-store sales in the business falling 3.8 percent.  \"CVS CVS.N and Walgreens have become particularly reliant on the pharmacy side to drive their businesses forward,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, calling it a \"folly\" to not invest in retail.  \u201cThis now means that the retail side of the business is largely incapable of driving footfall into stores which could help support the prescription and pharmacy side of the business.\u201d  Walgreens said same-store sales at its U.S. pharmacies were unchanged in the quarter. The average expectation was for a 3.7 percent rise, according to eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.53 per share, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.48.  The company\u2019s total sales rose 14 percent to $34.33 billion, edging past the average analyst estimate of $34.05 billion.  Walgreens also authorized a $10 billion share buyback and increased its quarterly dividend by 10 percent to 44 cents per share.","311":"An Amazon logo is pictured at a logistics centre in Mannheim, Germany, September 17, 2019.

Oil prices rose after their biggest one-day fall in almost a year on Monday, though higher Russian output and Saudi Arabia possibly cutting selling prices dragged on crude trading.  Investors remained cautious after China said Sunday it would raise tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and stoking jitters about the potential impact of the trade standoff on global growth.  U.S. Treasury yields and benchmark German bunds rose as stocks on Wall Street firmed and as investors looked to Friday\u2019s closely watched U.S. employment report for March.  U.S. debt yields had dropped to two-month lows on Monday, boosted by safe-haven buying amid the rout in technology shares.  MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.51 percent. Earlier in Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares closed down 0.45 percent.  After being shut for Easter Monday and feeling that impact a day later, Europe\u2019s main bourses in London, Paris and Frankfurt closed lower.  Tech stocks, following a recent U.S. downdraft, remained a pressure point in Europe after U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of Amazon.  Reports that Apple intended to make more of its own parts slammed European chipmakers such as AMS and STMicroelectronics.  The S&P 500 Information Technology index has tumbled in recent weeks, ending Monday down 9.8 percent from a March 12 closing record. It rose 1 percent on Tuesday. Declines in large-cap tech shares were triggered by Trump\u2019s recent allegations, made via Twitter, about Amazon\u2019s business practices.  Still, the fundamental picture of solid global growth and strong corporate earnings hasn\u2019t changed that much, though a White House that was market friendly in 2017 has turned less so in 2018, adding a new twist to markets, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Management in Zurich.  \u201cIf equities are going to find a solid foundation to recover some of the losses they suffered over the last two months, it\u2019s probably going to be on the basis that companies can still demonstrate earnings and fundamental reasons their earnings story is intact,\u201d Hatheway said, speaking in New York.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 327.78 points, or 1.39 percent, to 23,971.97. The S&P 500 gained 28.67 points, or 1.11 percent, to 2,610.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.65 points, or 1 percent, to 6,938.77.  Spotify shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an opening price of $165.90 per share, nearly 26 percent above the reference price of $132 a share set by the NYSE late on Monday.  Spotify later pared gains but was still up 13.7 percent at $150.11.  The dollar rebounded from an early fall on concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions.  The dollar index, tracking it against a group of major currencies, rose 0.19 percent, with the euro down 0.26 percent to $1.2268. The Japanese yen weakened 0.66 percent versus the greenback at 106.58 per dollar.  Asia\u2019s shares had stumbled overnight, though their moves had been small compared to Wall Street where the S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the European Union.  The slight recovery in risk appetite meant U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds and UK Gilts all saw a bit of selling too in Europe. Yields on 10-year notes were all off two- to three-month lows.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 15\/32 in price to yield 2.7880 percent.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, March 19, 2020. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  Some worker unions have been calling for the complete closure of Amazon\u2019s activities in France, or at the very least a clampdown, after raising concerns over health standards at its shipping sites, arguing they were too crowded.  The U.S. online retailing giant, which has repeatedly said it adheres to health guidelines, said it disagreed with the ruling, adding it was still evaluating the implications for its French logistics centres.  It said it had brought in temperature checks for workers in France like elsewhere and distributed face masks and sanitiser gel.  The court said Amazon had not always done enough to ensure safety distances were respected, based on checks by labour inspectors at various sites.  In the ruling, seen by Reuters, judges added the company had not thoroughly assessed the contagion risk of employees passing packages to each other.  Amazon will now have to work with employee representatives to carry out such checks and revise its protocols.  In the meantime, it has 24 hours to curtail any shipments passing through its warehouses, limiting them to groceries, hygiene products and medical items - and faces a penalty of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) per day of delay in complying.  Representatives of the Sud trade union welcomed the ruling, saying they hoped it would lead to cutbacks in the number of products being shipped by Amazon for the duration of the coronavirus outbreak.  \u201cIf they content themselves with sending what is strictly necessary, workers will be able to respect social distances,\u201d Tatiana Campagne, a Sud representative at Amazon\u2019s Lauwin-Planque site in northern France, told journalists.  Amazon has already restricted the scope of products to be given priority in its warehouses in several countries, including France, though these still included items such as books.  The Amazon website has also been receiving many orders for craft kits and home-improvement goods during France\u2019s broad lockdown to contain the coronavirus. Some employees said that, in recent weeks, they were packing video games and sex toys.  Workers have clashed with Amazon in France and elsewhere over the extent to which protective guidelines are implemented. The company has reported a handful of virus cases among staff.

FILE PHOTO: Amazon workers perform their jobs inside of an Amazon fulfillment center on Cyber Monday in Robbinsville, New Jersey, U.S., December 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The challenge illustrates the power Amazon has over merchants whose businesses are heavily dependent on its marketplace.  A spokesman for Amazon told Reuters on Thursday that the company is working to provide relief to the selling community. He declined to provide specifics.  On Tuesday, Amazon said it would receive only vital supplies at its U.S., UK and other European warehouses until April 5, in an effort to save warehouse space for medical and household goods that are in high demand during the global coronavirus outbreak. Amazon is among the retailers racing to keep food and hygienic items in stock and have employees on hand for warehouse work or delivery.  Some sellers worry that the suspension on non-essential items like apparel, toys and outdoor gear could dampen their sales as they are unable to restock items, and further affect their ability to repay their Amazon loans in time.  For Jamison Philippi, an Amazon seller based in Hackensack, New Jersey, toys and video games represent 95% of his Amazon business. But those products now are considered \u201cnon-essential\u201d so he cannot restock them in Amazon\u2019s warehouses.  As his inventory runs out, Philippi estimates his income could drop by 75% - affecting his ability to make the roughly $3,500 payment due on his Amazon loan on April 1.  \u201cNot being able to ship things in for three weeks - it\u2019s going to sting,\u201d Philippi said. Amazon automatically pulls loan payments from the account where he receives his bi-weekly sales payments. If that balance falls short, it comes out of his bank account.  \u201cI\u2019m hoping they suspend that for a month and offer a grace period,\u201d said Philippi, who believes Amazon is making decisions that it believes are best for the selling community.  \u201cThey control everything, we\u2019re just playing in their sandbox,\u201d Phillippi said.  LOAN PAYMENT DUE  Launched in late 2011, Amazon\u2019s lending program makes loans of $1,000 to over $1 million to qualified sellers, and uses seller\u2019s inventory in Amazon warehouses as collateral. Repayment terms are three to 12 months, and interest rates typically range from 6-19.9%.  The move to suspend shipping non-essential products has left sellers unable to restock some of their bestsellers.  Some sellers are in a panic because borrowers can be in default if sales in any 30-day period are less than 50% of the lowest level during the 12 months prior, according to a loan agreement reviewed by Reuters.  \u201cThe terms of the loan definitely protect Amazon,\u201d said a seller based in New Hampshire, who declined to be named. \u201cAt this time I have all of my eggs in the Amazon basket. I owe them more than I owe on my home.\u201d His loan payment is just shy of $40,000 per month on a 12-month $500,000 loan.  \u201cWe have seen sales fall off a cliff. Shoes and clothing at this time is not what people deem essential,\u201d the seller said. \u201cI understand their business decision. It\u2019s going to upset the supply chain down the road.\u201d  Some sellers have voiced their concerns to Amazon but have not heard back about any relief. In a statement to Reuters, Amazon said it is working to determine the best ways to quickly assist its lending clients during the coronavirus crisis.  \u201cOur selling partners tell us our loans are an ideal way to grow inventory, expand product lines, and reach more customers,\u201d the company said.  In other cases, sellers are seeing loan offers from Amazon disappear from their accounts.  Molson Hart, a toy seller, says he had always been offered a $1 million loan by Amazon, based on his $4.5 million in annual sales. As he worries that his popular products may run out of stock in Amazon warehouses, he also found the loan offer was gone this week. While Hart says his business does not rely on Amazon\u2019s loan to survive, smaller businesses could face a higher chance of bankruptcy during this time of distress.  \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Amazon thinks the risks have skyrocketed,\u201d said Joe Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, which tracks data on e-commerce platforms.  \u201cSellers are worried about their cash flow, and Amazon lending was one of the ways to support that. And now as we\u2019ve seen in some cases, it\u2019s gone,\u201d Kaziukenas said.","323":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  MUMBAI\/NEW DELHI(Reuters) - India's Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) will consult the market regulator and seek clarifications from Future Retail FRTL.NS and Reliance Industries RELI.NS about their $3.4 billion transaction, following Amazon's objection to the deal, an exchange source said.

SEBI and the stock exchanges did not respond to requests for comment. Amazon declined comment, while Future and Reliance did not immediately respond.  The dispute centres around Future\u2019s decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.

In this case, Amazon gains potential insight into how it should tailor marketing and how it could stamp out the retail competition.  \u201cThis data is often used for training machine learning models to do better ad targeting,\u201d said Bennett Cyphers, a technologist at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cBut in the U.S., there aren\u2019t really restrictions on what you can do with this kind of data.\u201d  Amazon already has more than 7 million customers using its assistant via Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, according to data published by those web browsers. Other companies offer similar shopping tools.  While another technology known as tracking pixels shows Amazon information from visitors to roughly 15 percent of the top 10,000 websites, the assistant lets Amazon follow a smaller set of users from page to page, Cyphers said.  Amazon\u2019s combination of tools still pales in comparison to data collection by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which has tracking pixels on most web pages.  Amazon did not discuss how it uses the data it gathers via the assistant for any unrelated purposes, but a job listing for an affiliated team known as Browser Integration Technologies says the group\u2019s influence \u201cspans across advertising and marketing, pricing and selection.\u201d  \u201cCustomer trust is paramount to Amazon, and we take customer privacy very seriously,\u201d a company spokeswoman said, noting compliance with the assistant\u2019s privacy policy, which says data collection is for websites that users visit \u201cwhere we may have relevant product or service recommendations.\u201d  The policy also notes that customers can disable certain features of the assistant, and that Amazon only links browsing data to an individual\u2019s account when the assistant is in active use.  U.S. lawmakers have recently increased their scrutiny of Silicon Valley\u2019s data collection practices. A bill introduced in the Senate last month proposed requiring that big platforms disclose what information they gather from users and how much that is worth.  \u201cWhen a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These \u2018free\u2019 products track everything we do,\u201d said Republican Senator Josh Hawley in a statement announcing the bill.  Amazon\u2019s Prime Day promotion offers a window into what it will pay for browsing data. For Prime Day 2018, it offered $5 off to new Amazon Assistant users who spent at least $25. This year it offered $10 off to those spending at least $50.  Amazon is also fine paying nothing for the data: New customers only get the $10 credit if they install the assistant from a particular landing page, if they are Prime members, and if they make their purchase via the assistant by Aug. 2.","331":"Aug 17 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud computing unit is expanding its partnership with Toyota Motor Corp to support the automaker\u2019s unit that develops services, including passenger safety-related, the companies said on Monday.

REUTERS\/Ivan Alvarado  The Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O unit alleged that Trump, who has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company, exerted undue influence on the decision to deny it the $10 billion contract.  Known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, the contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations.  In the lawsuit, Amazon said it seeks discovery \u201cdemonstrating exactly how President Trump\u2019s order to \u2018screw Amazon\u2019 was carried out during the decision making process.\u201d  Without this, \u201cthe Court cannot objectively and fully evaluate AWS\u2019s credible and well-grounded allegations about bias and bad faith,\u201d the lawsuit said.  Bezos also owns the Washington Post, whose coverage has been critical of Trump.  Along with Trump and Esper, Amazon seeks to depose former Defense Secretary James Mattis, Pentagon chief information officer Dana Deasy and four other procurement officials, court records show.  An Amazon spokesperson said that \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to use his position as President and Commander in Chief to interfere with government functions \u2013 including federal procurements \u2013 to advance his personal agenda.  \u201cThe question is whether the President of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of the DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends,\u201d the spokesperson added.  The lawsuit also says Amazon\u2019s protest against the decision occurs against the background of impeachment, \u201cwhich is grounded in the President\u2019s repeated refusal to separate his personal interests from the national interest.\u201d President Trump has been acquitted on impeachment charges by the Republican-controlled Senate.  The lawsuit also mentions other instances of alleged interference from Trump.  For example, his alleged interference in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 award of a $400 million border wall contract to Fisher Industries in December 2019 and a report that Trump intervened in the General Services Administration\u2019s solicitation of bids to move the FBI\u2019s headquarters to a new campus in the suburbs.  The current FBI offices are near a Washington hotel owned by Trump\u2019s company.  The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.  Last month, Amazon filed a motion in court to delay the Department of Defense deal with Microsoft until a court rules on its protest of the contract award.  The procurement process has been delayed by legal complaints and conflict of interest allegations. Esper has denied there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.","337":"SYDNEY\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc began selling its in-house delivery service to third-party vendors in Australia on Tuesday, taking on a major logistical challenge in the continent that invented the expression \u201ctyranny of distance\u201d.

Its fast-shipping paid subscription club for shoppers, Prime, would follow by the middle of the year.  That means Amazon, not its thousands of Australian vendors, takes responsibility for meeting delivery estimates in a country of 24 million people spread over an island the size of the mainland United States, with little inland transport infrastructure.  Some Amazon shoppers in remote Outback settlements - places where doctors make house calls by airplane - have already complained about slower delivery times than suggested by the company\u2019s website.  Though Amazon takes responsibility for FBA shipping, its main delivery partner is government-run Australia Post.  Australia Post declined to comment. The service has said it had its busiest month in December, when Amazon started in the world\u2019s 12th-largest economy.  Amazon said its FBA service saved businesses time \u201cas they will no longer need to individually purchase shipping materials, individually pack orders, and make multiple trips to the post office\u201d.  So far, Amazon has run its Australian business from a single warehouse outside Melbourne city, on the country\u2019s east coast where most of the population lives.  As with Canada, where it also launched its fulfillment service with only one warehouse, analysts now expect Amazon to open more warehouses to service far-flung Australian communities.  \u201cAustralia is big.

Amazon that the online retail leviathan can be liable for defective products sold on its site, Amazon issued a surprise announcement this weekend: It offered conditional support for a proposed California law that would make it easier for consumers to hold electronic retailers responsible for allowing defective products to reach the marketplace. As long as other online retailers can\u2019t evade the law based on how they earn revenue for selling products from outside vendors, Amazon said in a blog post, it will back the bill.  The logo of Amazon is seen on a building in San Jose, Costa Rica March 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Juan Carlos Ulate  The law, known as AB 3262, has passed the California assembly and been approved by the state senate\u2019s judicial committee. The entire state senate is expected to vote on the proposed law \u2013 which is opposed by Etsy, eBay, the California Chamber of Commerce, the Internet Association, the National Federation of Independent Business and several other business groups \u2013 later this week. Amazon's late-breaking support is considered a boost to the bill's prospects, which were already pretty rosy in California's pro-consumer legislature.  On Monday, presumably in response to Amazon\u2019s blog post, lawmakers amended the proposed law to strike an exemption for websites that merely receive a fee for advertising a vendor\u2019s products and to clarify that online sellers can be liable for \u201cfacilitating\u201d the sale of defective merchandise from outside vendors.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  Amazon, as you know, has spent years warding off product liability suits by consumers who used its website to buy merchandise from third-party vendors \u2013 whose products comprise nearly 60% of Amazon\u2019s sales. The company has mostly managed to convince courts that even though it stores vendors\u2019 products in its warehouses, processes customers\u2019 payments and ships goods to consumers in Amazon trucks, it can\u2019t be liable as a \u201cseller\u201d under state tort laws because it does not actually take title to products offered by third-party vendors. Amazon lost a case at the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2019, but the appeals court subsequently vacated its ruling and asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to weigh in. Ohio\u2019s Supreme Court is also considering the issue.  The California law would resolve any uncertainty in favor of consumers. The bill\u2019s author, Assemblyman Mark Stone, has presented the proposed law as an alignment of liability for brick-and-mortar retailers and online marketplaces, which accounted for more than $600 billion in sales in 2019. Without assuring that online marketplaces face the same responsibility as an actual store, the bill said, more retailers will abandon physical shops and more consumers will be without recourse if they buy a defective product from a third-party vendor. \u201cStrict liability on the manufacturer and the electronic retail marketplace alike affords maximum protection to the injured plaintiff and works no injustice to the electronic retail marketplace,\u201d the bill said.  The law contains carveouts for used or pre-owned merchandise that is clearly labeled as such, for handmade products and for goods sold via auction. But according to the bill\u2019s proponents, the Amazon competitors eBay and Etsy are not otherwise exempt. Those sites, like Amazon, take in revenue from the sale of new products manufactured by third-party vendors, so, according to AB 3262\u2019s supporters, they should be held responsible when products are defective.  Etsy and eBay vehemently oppose the bill, arguing in a joint letter last month to the state senate that the law would stretch liability for online sellers beyond the limits faced by brick-and-mortar stores. Etsy and eBay emphasized the differences between their business model and Amazon's: They don't have warehouses to store products from outside vendors, they don't act as go-betweens for buyers and sellers and they don't ship products. They described themselves as neutral platforms that Simply enable buyers and sellers to connect with one another. According to eBay and Etsy, buyers at their sites, unlike Amazon buyers, should have no reasonable expectation that they are acting as sellers or retailers.  The California senate report on the bill noted the eBay and Etsy arguments but said the bill\u2019s proponents contend the two sites have adopted practices akin to those of retailers, not \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d platforms. Ultimately, the senate report said, every case will turn on particular facts, especially the degree to which the online retailer controlled the sale of the defective product.  But this week\u2019s amendments, apparently driven by Amazon\u2019s blog post, will make it harder for eBay and Etsy - and other websites that derive revenue from facilitating online transactions between buyers and third-party vendors - to avoid liability for defective products. Amazon could even end up benefiting from the law because it\u2019s better positioned than small competitors to weather exposure to liability for defective products.  AB 3262\u2019s opponents are as adamant as ever that the bill is a bad idea. Jaime Huff of the Civil Justice Association of California, who signed a letter against the proposed law for a coalition of business groups, said by email that the bill is a radical departure from established product liability law. \u201cThe bottom line is that this bill would increase barriers to entry for online sales, hurting small businesses, shutting down small online marketplaces, and increasing the cost of goods purchased online by consumers,\u201d Huff said.  EBay said in a statement that AB 3262 goes far beyond the liability California courts imposed on Amazon in the Bolger case. The bill \u201capplies the same standard for Amazon to dozens of third-party marketplaces that simply enable small businesses to reach customers,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is a one-size-fits-all solution that during a critical time would only disadvantage California small and micro businesses who depend on ecommerce to thrive.\u201d  And Etsy CEO Josh Silverman said in a post on Medium that Amazon is using the guise of consumer safety to crush competitors. \u201cThis is an abuse of market power play,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cAmazon is taking bold steps to wipe out its competitors by promoting complex, hard-to-comply-with legislation that only they can afford to absorb. Amazon\u2019s goal is to be the only place to buy stuff online.\u201d  Amazon public policy executive Brian Huseman, who authored the blog post conditionally backing AB 3262, did not respond to my email query. Amazon\u2019s press office also did not respond.  If California passes AB 3262, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see whether Amazon continues to contest its liability outside of California after publicly announcing that liability for online retailers is a boon for consumer safety.  COVID-19, as AB 3262\u2019s drafters pointed out, has only accelerated U.S. consumers\u2019 shift to online buying. It\u2019s a big deal that Amazon now agrees consumer safety will be enhanced by holding websites responsible when they sell defective merchandise.","345":"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said on Thursday he expects there will be commercial robots in the next 10 years that can grasp items as reliably as humans, a development that could lead to the automation of warehouse jobs around the world.

The company has said it views automation as a way to help workers.  Still, Amazon is known for its drive to mechanize as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. It employs hundreds of thousands of people, many of whose primary task is grasping, scanning and placing customer orders.  A variety of companies other than Amazon have also rolled out robotic hands for limited warehouse pilots.  In the on-stage interview, Bezos also discussed Project Kuiper, Amazon\u2019s recent bet to launch thousands of satellites to expand broadband internet access, which he said was \u201cclose to being a fundamental human need.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s also very good business for Amazon because it\u2019s (a) very high capex undertaking; it\u2019s multiple billions of dollars of capex,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon is a large enough company now that we need to do things that if they work can actually move the needle.\u201d  Asked whether people ever say \u201cno\u201d to Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person and a famously scrupulous boss, he joked, \u201cNo!

FILE PHOTO: A web page featuring Amazon's Australian URL is pictured in this photo illustration April 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Jason Reed\/Illustration\/File Photo  But Amazon\u2019s recent move to stop Australians from shopping on its foreign websites, due to a new law that requires it to collect taxes, is turning away once-loyal customers like Boon.  He's considering a switch to eBay Inc EBAY.O, adding that prices for wall mounts were 40 percent higher on Amazon's Australia site if they appeared there at all.  \u201cI\u2019ll be going somewhere else to get that regular stuff,\u201d said Boon by telephone from the northern city of Brisbane, where he runs his business.  Amazon\u2019s launch of an Australian site in December, followed by last month\u2019s introduction of its Prime service for faster delivery, has been heralded as a game changer for the country\u2019s retail industry. But it has gotten off to a choppy start.  For customers like Boon, the retail giant has lost years of goodwill by forcing shoppers onto a local site with a product range roughly one ninth of the U.S. site and which sells some goods at higher prices.  It has also given online marketplace eBay, Amazon\u2019s bigger and more established rival in Australia, the opportunity to swoop in and capture that goodwill, building its first automatic tax collection and payment system and wooing local customers with discounts.  TAXING ISSUES  Australia is the first market where Amazon, the world\u2019s second-most valuable company worth $890 billion, has responded to a sales tax on internet purchases by shutting out customers based on where they live.  An Amazon spokesman said in an email the company would continue to build its range of goods and services through its Australian site, and that it was \u201cthrilled with the reception it has received from Australian customers\u201d since introducing Amazon Prime.  The Australian government extended its 10 percent goods and services tax (GST) to all goods bought online from overseas, effective July 1, requiring online retailers to collect the tax. It was previously applicable only to overseas purchases over A$1,000 ($745).  Amazon also gave Australians just one month\u2019s notice that they would be shut out of its global network - sales are cut off when an Australian delivery address is entered - even though the government\u2019s plans were announced a year ago.  Critics say the decision was an excuse to drive traffic to its new local site and promote its Amazon Prime service.  \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt that Amazon will be successful here in time, but I don\u2019t believe that this strategy is what\u2019s going to catapult them to success,\u201d said Ryan Murtagh, CEO of Neto, a provider of data and logistics support for about 3,000 online retailers in Australia.  \u201cI think actually it potentially could damage them in the long term.\u201d  Amazon has some 550 million products on its U.S. site including those sold by Amazon and third-party sellers, according to Boomerang Commerce, an artificial intelligence technology firm in California. That compares with the 500-600 million offers from third-party sellers on eBay, which includes duplicate products.  EBAY\u2019S EDGE  Ebay said the decision to build the new tax collection and payment system had paid off with early figures suggesting Australian shoppers were not swayed by the new tax.  \u201cIt was a big change and it was a global change that needed to be done,\u201d said eBay\u2019s local managing director, Tim MacKinnon, adding that the effort was led by its California headquarters.  \u201cA lot of people worked on it, a lot of different teams. We\u2019re really proud that we hit the July 1 deadline.\u201d  He added its decision to offer Australian shoppers a 10 percent discount on its local, British and U.S. websites for the first week of July had helped generate business.  \u201cAll of our sites have accelerated,\u201d said MacKinnon.  While neither Amazon nor eBay provide data on visitors to their sites and estimating their share of Australia\u2019s A$26 billion-a-year online retail market is difficult, customer dissatisfaction with Amazon Australia is not hard to find. Its Facebook page is overrun with negative comments.  Amazon\u2019s move has also prompted non-Amazon freight forwarders who buy items from the U.S. store domestically and mail them to Australia to seize new opportunities. One such firm, New York\u2019s Big Apple Buddy, this week set up a new site for Australian shoppers.  Securities analysts argue, however, that Amazon plays a long game and that given its track record in dominating online retail in many countries, whatever missteps it makes can be fixed over time.  \u201cIt is highly likely they will get it right in Australia over the longer term, and prices will be competitive, service will be outstanding, and they will eat eBay\u2019s lunch,\u201d Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research at Los Angeles-based Wedbush Securities, said by email.","351":"(Adds Cade, I Squared, Gorenje, Saudi Basic, Sonatrach, ATON, Cradle Arc; Updates Walmart, Enbridge)  May 9 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Wednesday:  ** Walmart Inc said it will pay $16 billion for a roughly 77 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, an effort to compete with rival Amazon.com Inc in an important growth market.  ** South African Internet and entertainment firm Naspers sold its entire 11.18 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart to Walmart Inc for $2.2 billion, it said.  ** Vodafone has agreed to pay $21.8 billion to buy Liberty Global\u2019s assets in Germany and eastern Europe to take on rivals with a broader range of superfast cable TV, broadband and mobile services.  ** Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), the world\u2019s No.4 petrochemical company, wants to buy about half of the $4.6-billion Indian petchem project backed by Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), two sources familiar with the matter said.  ** Algeria\u2019s state energy firm Sonatrach plans to buy ExxonMobil\u2019s 175,000 barrel-per-day Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy, the companies said, as the North African oil producer seeks to cut its hefty fuel bills.  ** Enbridge Inc, has received higher-than-expected bids for the Canadian midstream assets it is selling as part of its debt-reduction efforts, with initial bids valuing the portfolio as high as C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion), people familiar with the situation told Reuters.  ** HR services provider Recruit Holdings Co has agreed to buy Glassdoor Inc for $1.2 billion, in a deal that will give the Japanese firm access to the U.S. job-website operator\u2019s vast database of company reviews and salary data.  ** Agribusiness company Scales Corp Ltd said it would sell its cold storage business for NZ$151.4 million($105.4 million) to Australian company Emergent Cold.  ** French oil company Total has agreed to sell its retail business in Haiti to Bandari Corporation Ltd, a consortium formed by local and regional players.  ** African gold miner Randgold has ended a joint venture agreement in Mali with junior explorer Cradle Arc , Cradle Arc said, adding it would seek a new partner.  ** Australian digital classifieds company Mitula Group said Japanese real estate portal Lifull Co agreed to buy the company for about A$188.3 million ($140 million) and merge it with Lifull\u2019s online classifieds unit.  ** BNP Paribas announced a secondary offering of shares in First Hawaiian Inc, resulting in the French bank relinquishing its majority ownership of the Hawaiian bank.  ** British investor I Squared Capital said it has agreed to buy TIP Trailer Services, the trailer leasing company formerly owned by General Electric, from China\u2019s HNA Group.  ** Chinese household appliances maker Hisense Electric has offered the best bid of 12 euros ($14.22) per share for Gorenje, the Slovenian appliances producer said after announcing it had received three offers.  ** Xerox Corp\u2019s board said it intended to resume merger discussions with Fujifilm Corp, seeking a superior deal to terms announced at the end of January that have spurred a complex proxy fight over the company.  ** German investor ATON and takeover target Murray & Roberts (M&R) are each seeking to file separate merger notifications to South Africa\u2019s Competition Commission - a procedure typically used in hostile takeover situations.  ** Brazil\u2019s antitrust regulator Cade approved the sale of a Vale SA fertilizer unit to Yara International ASA, sanctioning a deal that will allow the Norwegian giant to produce nitrogen-based fertilizers in Brazil.

The plan is to give patients - especially the elderly, blind and those unable to access the internet through traditional means - access to information verified by the National Health Service (NHS) by using voice commands, the government said.

However, there are concerns that older people, who are used to telephonic or personal interactions, might find it hard to adapt to newer technologies for healthcare services.

Amazon dropped as much as 1.9 percent, before paring losses to trade down 1 percent. Wayfair, Overstock.com, Etsy and Ebay fell between 1.9 percent and 5.2 percent.  \u201cTraders are very reactionary to Supreme Court news that could impact the balance sheet of online retailers,\u201d said Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager with Financial Enhancement Group LLC in Indianapolis, Indiana.  \u201cRight now all online retailers and tech stocks are getting thrown out with the bath water, so to speak, before we truly understand the implications (of the ruling).\u201d  Another big drag was Intel, which retreated 2.4 percent after Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich resigned following a probe that revealed a past consensual relationship with an employee violated company policy.  Big U.S. manufacturers extended their slide after a state-controlled Chinese tabloid said Beijing could target members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average if President Donald Trump kept exacerbating tensions over trade.  Caterpillar and Boeing were both down 1.3 percent, with the S&P industrials\u2019 0.9 percent slide weighing the most on the markets.  The 30-member Dow index gave up its year-to-date gains earlier this week as the trade rhetoric escalated and is on pace to extend a seven-session losing streak.  At 12:43 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 184.53 points, or 0.75 percent, at 24,473.27. The S&P 500 was down 16.01 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,751.31 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 58.37 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,723.14.  Seven of the 11 main S&P sectors were trading lower, with the S&P energy, the best performing sector in the last three months, down 1.7 percent as oil prices slipped after crude producers appeared to be nearing a deal to increase production at an OPEC meeting in Vienna.  The auto sector was hit by Germany\u2019s Daimler cutting its 2018 profit forecast due to the China-U.S. trade dispute.  Ford slipped 1.1 percent, General Motors dropped 2 percent and Tesla declined 2.9 percent. The S&P 500 automobiles and components index was down 1.5 percent.  Earnings were a bright spot, with Darden Restaurants surging 11.8 percent and grocer Kroger jumping 9 percent after issuing strong quarterly results.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.02-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 2.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

[nL2N1RI0U7]  JPMorgan, Amazon and Berkshire announced in January that they would form a venture that would use technology to try to cut healthcare costs for their employees, and potentially open the venture to other companies, but have provided few details since.  Dimon said the company would focus on using big data, virtual technology, better customer engagement and more consumer choice to address critical problems and issues.  \u201cThe effort will start very small, but there is much to do, and we are optimistic,\u201d he wrote in the letter.  The group does not yet have a CEO and has not begun operations, Dimon said during a subsequent interview on Yahoo Finance on Thursday.  While the group\u2019s combined employees are fewer than 1 million people and a small slice of the more than 160 million people in employer-based healthcare plans in the United States, Amazon\u2019s strength in using data and technology to disrupt businesses has healthcare investors watching closely. Shares in healthcare companies that act as middlemen, like insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, fell when the news was first announced that the three companies would work together.  On Thursday, the S&P 500 health index, which includes drug distributors, insurers and pharmacies, was up 0.4 percent.  The letter included six points of focus for the company, including aligning payments with better medical outcomes for patients instead of simply paying for each medical service, which is how the current system is built.  The company will aim to give more control to employees by improving access to their own healthcare data and increasing telemedicine, Dimon wrote. He also pointed to better programs to decrease rates of obesity and smoking, which contribute to chronic disease like cancer, stroke and heart disease.  Dimon said it would also study the money spent on waste, administration and fraud and determine why there is misuse of specialty medicines and pharmaceuticals. It will also look at money spent on end-of-life care.","362":"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon\u2019s purchase of a stake in Deliveroo has been provisionally cleared by Britain\u2019s competition regulator in view of a potentially fatal deterioration in the online food delivery group\u2019s finances because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo last May, making what the two parties called \"a minority investment\" and pitching it against Uber Eats UBER.N and Takeaway.com TKWY.AS in the global race to dominate the market for meal deliveries.  Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a detailed investigation in December, saying the deal could damage competition by discouraging Amazon from re-entering the online restaurant food market and further developing its presence within the online convenience grocery delivery market.  However, the CMA said on Friday it had become clear that the health emergency was having a significant negative impact on Deliveroo\u2019s revenues, given the closure of a large number of the restaurants available through its platform during the lockdown.  The regulator said Deliveroo informed it the impact of the pandemic on its business meant it would fail financially and exit the market without the Amazon investment.  \u201cWithout additional investment, which we currently think is only realistically available from Amazon, it\u2019s clear that Deliveroo would not be able to meet its financial commitments and would have to exit the market,\u201d Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA\u2019s independent inquiry group, said.  He said Deliveroo\u2019s demise could leave some customers cut off from online food delivery and others facing higher prices or a reduction in service quality.  \u201cFaced with that stark outcome, we feel the best course of action is to provisionally clear Amazon\u2019s investment in Deliveroo,\u201d he said.  Deliveroo said it was delighted with the CMA\u2019s decision.  \u201cThis investment will help us to overcome immediate and long-term challenges,\u201d a spokeswoman said.  \u201cWe\u2019re committed to this investment,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cOur investment will benefit both consumers of Deliveroo\u2019s service and its small-business restaurant partners.\u201d  The CMA is seeking views on its provisional findings by May 11.

Amazon has asked the High Court in New Delhi to enforce the decision of a Singapore arbitrator, which both sides had agreed to use in case of disputes, the filing showed. In October, the arbitrator issued an interim order saying the deal should be put on hold.

Gathered in the ministry\u2019s cobbled courtyard, the protesters from three groups - ANV-COP 21, Attac and Amis de la Terre - rolled out a banner on the building\u2019s facade bearing the slogan \u201cchange of owner\u201d and featuring the faces of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos and French President Emmanuel Macron.  \u201cAmazon is destroying jobs and climate in France. It plans to massively expand in France with dozens of warehouses already built and more to come. We demand a freeze (on building more),\u201d Sandy Olivar Calvo, a spokeswoman for ANV-COP21, told Reuters.  The campaigners view the U.S. retail giant as a prime factor in the urbanisation of farmland, a process they say is contributing significantly to climate change and the loss of environmental biodiversity.  Amazon\u2019s global revenues have soared during the pandemic and its ability to keep selling during coronavirus lockdowns has deepened frustration among French opponents, who say it represents a U.S.-style mass consumer culture at odds with a long local tradition of neighborhood stores.  A lengthy battle over safety measures this spring led to the temporary closure of Amazon\u2019s French warehouses.  Last month, under government pressure, it postponed its Black Friday campaign from Nov. 27 to Dec. 4 to help shopkeepers struggling during France\u2019s second national lockdown. They were allowed to re-open on Nov. 28 but restaurants and bars remain closed.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Asked about a possible freeze on new warehouses, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said new house construction was the biggest contributor to the urbanisation of farmland.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The Senate hearing will give the six technology-related companies, which also include Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Charter Communications Inc, \u201can opportunity to explain their approaches to privacy,\u201d said U.S. Senator John Thune, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.  They will also testify on \u201chow they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation,\u201d Thune said.  Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue, fueled by massive breaches that have compromised the personal information of millions of U.S. internet and social media users, as well as breaches involving large retailers and credit reporting agency Equifax Inc.  Separately, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a tweet late on Tuesday that Google \u201cclaims to be fair, but gave a \u2018silent donation\u2019 to a left-wing group to stop Trump\u201d and \u201cworks w\/ China\/Russia to censor the internet, but canceled a contract with our military.\u201d  He noted Google declined to take part in a Senate Intelligence hearing last week that featured Twitter and Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s time for @Google to answer some ?\u2019s An invite will be on its way,\u201d McCarthy wrote.

The witnesses at the Sept. 26 Senate hearing include Google\u2019s chief privacy officer, Twitter\u2019s global data protection officer and Apple\u2019s vice president for software technology.  The White House said in July it was working to develop consumer data privacy policies and officials have held more than 50 meetings with major firms and other groups as the Trump administration seeks to help the policies become enshrined in legislation eventually.  California Governor Jerry Brown signed data privacy legislation in June aimed at giving consumers more control over how companies collect and manage their personal information, although it was not as stringent as new rules in Europe.  Under the law, large companies would be required starting in 2020 to let consumers view the data they have collected on them, request deletion of data, and opt out of having the data sold to third parties.  The European Union General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May, replacing the bloc\u2019s patchwork of rules dating back to 1995. Breaking privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($23.2 million), whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros.","371":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is postponing its major summer shopping event, Prime Day, until at least August and expects a potential $100 million hit from excess devices it might now sell at a discount, according to internal meeting notes seen by Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon packages are pushed onto ramps leading to delivery trucks by a robotic system as they travel on conveyor belts inside of an Amazon fulfillment center on Cyber Monday in Robbinsville, New Jersey, U.S., December 2, 2019. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The company also sees a risk to cloud computing sales in France, while another business - video on demand - is shaping up to post $100 million more in revenue than Amazon had planned for the first quarter, the document said.  Amazon declined to comment.  The notes, in which Amazon\u2019s general counsel wrote critical comments reported by Vice News about an employee it fired on Monday, offer a rare insight into planning inside the world\u2019s largest online retailer.  They reflect how the company is rapidly responding to business risks from the novel coronavirus, which has caused a surge in demand for household staples and led to several demonstrations by some Amazon warehouse workers fearful of contagion.  Prime Day, a marketing event Amazon started in 2015 to drum up sales during the summer shopping lull, has previously occurred in July, though the company never publishes the date far in advance.  The decision to delay it means Amazon will have 5 million extra devices it would have expected to sell sooner, items like its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers that have been popular orders during the event. It also affects third-party merchants who have come to depend on Amazon\u2019s platform for revenue.  \u201cWe probably have to promote sooner, which will be difficult if we\u2019re capacity constrained,\u201d General Counsel David Zapolsky wrote in notes from a daily meeting of Amazon executives. The notes said this would result in a $300 million impact \u201cworst case,\u201d with a $100 million hit being more likely.  It was unclear how solid the estimates were or what the impact to Amazon ultimately would be.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The company does not disclose revenue from the event but has said merchants contributed to $2 billion in sales during Prime Day in 2019, which spanned 48 hours and 18 countries. Promotions for members of Amazon\u2019s loyalty club, Prime, have also proven an effective way for the company to draw more people during the event to subscribe, at $119 per year in the United States.  RISKS TO CLOUD  Amazon and its workers have been at the front line of supplying essential goods to consumers during the coronavirus outbreak, a pandemic that has infected more than a million people globally and led to more than 54,000 deaths.  Unions and some elected officials have said Amazon has not done enough to protect workers; some are risking infection by staffing warehouses where colleagues have fallen ill, while others could be exposed from handling deliveries. A walkout was planned for Friday at a delivery station in Chicago, according to a labor and activist coalition, the latest in several protests by employees in small numbers.  Amazon has largely resisted calls to shut down worksites and on Thursday announced it would make millions of masks available and check temperatures at all its U.S. and European warehouses.  The meeting notes viewed by Reuters show the company plans to enforce guidelines that workers must stay at safe distances to minimize any risk of infection.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking at lower performing sites for social distancing and taking action to hold them accountable,\u201d the notes said. \u201cTwo strikes and you\u2019re out.\u201d  It was unclear if the comment reflected brainstorming or potential policy. The company said earlier this week it will audit whether workers are keeping apart by using machine learning software that analyzes building camera feeds.  The notes illustrate that Amazon is concerned about data centers as well as warehouses.  The company has been working to open additional data centers in Ireland for its cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS). That plan is now at risk, the notes said, and Amazon has floated the idea of offering preventive health measures to those handling construction.  \u201cAWS has certain clusters where we\u2019re worried about government shutting down or employees not being willing to work on scaling efforts,\u201d the document said. \u201cIreland is an issue. Some construction companies are showing reluctance to go forward.\u201d  Cloud sales, which for years have grown at a fast pace, could also take a hit in places hurt by the virus. The notes specified AWS revenue in France as a risk.","372":"QUITO (Reuters) - Canadian miner Lundin Gold Inc expects to produce between 200,000 and 220,000 ounces of gold this year at its Fruta del Norte gold mine in the Ecuadorean Amazon, its head told Reuters, after restarting operations last weekend.

The world\u2019s largest online retailer ordered more than 2,200 heavy-duty Utilimaster \u201cwalk-in\u201d delivery trucks from Shyft Group, a Michigan-based specialty vehicle company, an Amazon spokeswoman told Reuters. The company declined to say how many of the vehicles have been sent to Amazon delivery contractors, or where they would be deployed.  Amazon is under pressure to make good on one- and two-day deliveries promised to customers who subscribe to its $119 annual Prime service. Orders for food, computers, toys and exercise equipment surged after states issued stay-at-home orders to battle the pandemic, overwhelming Amazon\u2019s network and adding days and even weeks to delivery times.  Drivers assigned to the new trucks showed Reuters training materials from Wisconsin-based safety and compliance consultancy J.J. Keller & Associates, which confirmed that Amazon is a client. The Shyft Group did not respond to requests for comment.  One of the new Amazon trucks was seen recently operating in Chicago, according to a Reuters reporter. Training is under way in the Los Angeles area, drivers said.  While Amazon purchased the vehicles last year, the branded trucks have been parked for months in locations around the United States, including in Amazon lots in New Jersey and California dairy country. The company declined to state why it waited so long to roll out the new fleet.  Drivers familiar with the new vehicles said they can carry more and bigger packages than the Mercedes-Benz, Fiat Chrysler, and Ford Motor Co vans Amazon contractors dispatch around the country.  Two drivers, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, opted not to switch to the new vehicles because they are heavier and more difficult to maneuver than Amazon vans.  Amazon came under fire last year for failing to properly train drivers who work for its fast-growing network of delivery partners. ProPublica, BuzzFeed and other news outlets published reports detailing Amazon van accidents that resulted in injuries and deaths.  Amazon suspended its upstart Amazon Shipping program for non-Amazon packages in June to prioritize deliveries to its own customers.

After completing a \u201cPhase 1\u201d probe, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said on Wednesday it would proceed to an in-depth investigation if Amazon and Deliveroo failed to offer legally binding proposals that addressed its concerns.  The CMA\u2019s initial probe found that the investment, in its current form, could harm competition in two ways.  Firstly, the regulator is concerned it could damage competition in online restaurant food delivery by discouraging Amazon from re-entering a market it exited last year.  Secondly, the CMA is concerned the deal could damage competition in the emerging market for online convenience grocery delivery, where Amazon and Deliveroo have already established market-leading positions.  \u201cIf the deal were to proceed in its current form, there\u2019s a real risk that it could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower quality services as these markets develop,\u201d CMA Executive Director Andrea Gomes da Silva said.  FILE PHOTO: A biker, wearing a Deliveroo t-hirt, demonstrates during a call on clients to boycott the brand in Paris, France, August 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  \u201cThis is because the significant competition which could otherwise exist between Amazon and Deliveroo would be reduced.\u201d  \u201cADD TO COMPETITION\u201d  Responding to the CMA, Deliveroo and Amazon both defended the deal.  \u201cWe are confident that we will persuade the CMA of the facts that this minority investment will add to competition, helping restaurants to grow their businesses, creating more work for riders, and increasing choice for customers,\u201d Deliveroo said in a statement.  Amazon said Deliveroo should have broad access to investors and supporters.  \u201cAmazon believes that this investment funding will lead to more pro-consumer innovation,\u201d it added.  The CMA has given the two companies five working days to present their proposals. The regulator would then have five working days to consider whether to accept their offer instead of referring the case to an in-depth probe.  That timetable indicates a decision from the CMA in late December - around the time the takeover battle for Just Eat, involving Takeaway and Prosus, is expected to come to a head.  In June, the CMA served an initial enforcement order (IEO) on Amazon and Deliveroo, signaling possible concerns about the transaction. The order required the two companies to operate independently, effectively putting a brake on the deal.  The CMA then launched a formal \u201cPhase 1\u201d merger inquiry in October.  Since former lawmaker Andrew Tyrie became chairman of the CMA last year, it has increasingly bared its teeth.  In April it blocked supermarket group Sainsbury\u2019s 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) agreed takeover of Walmart owned rival Asda.

FILE PHOTO: A bird flies past a Reliance Industries sign in Ahmedabad, India, January 16, 2017. REUTERS\/Amit Dave\/File Photo  The oil-to-telecoms conglomerate is looking to attract more investors to Reliance Retail as the business expands rapidly online to take on the likes of Walmart Inc's WMT.N Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Indian arm.  Earlier this year, Reliance, controlled by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, sold nearly 33% of its Jio Platforms digital business, netting more than $20 billion from companies including Facebook FB.O, Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google, KKR & Co KKR.N and Silver Lake Partners.  Mumbai-based Reliance has approached some investors from that deal to take stakes in the retail business, although \u201cit is understood not all will participate\u201d, one of the sources told Reuters, asking not to be named as talks are private.  The sources did not specifically name which companies Reliance had approached.  Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Company - both backers of Jio Platforms - are also weighing a potential investment, a third source said.  \u201cIt is a strategic relationship that these funds have with Reliance which goes beyond one deal,\u201d said this source.  PIF and Mubadala declined to comment.  Reliance Retail, which has nearly 12,000 stores and sells everything from groceries to iPhones, acquired rival Future Group\u2019s retail arm last month.  This week, it announced a $1 billion investment from U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake Partners.  \u201cWe\u2019ve received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in Reliance Retail,\u201d Ambani told shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting in July.  AMAZON TALKS  Bloomberg News cited on Thursday an unidentified person with knowledge of the matter as saying Reliance was offering to sell a roughly 40% stake in its retail arm, worth about $20 billion, to Amazon.  Amazon has held talks about investing in Reliance Retail and expressed an interest in negotiating potential deals, but has made no decision, Bloomberg\u2019s report said.  Reuters could not independently verify whether Amazon and Reliance were in fresh discussions.  Last year, Reuters reported that Amazon had been mulling a proposal to purchase an up to a 26% stake in Reliance Retail. Earlier this year, the Economic Times reported that Amazon was in talks to buy a 9.9% stake in Reliance Retail.  Amazon did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Reliance said it did not comment on speculation and rumours, adding it \u201cevaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis.\u201d  SHARES SURGE  Shares in Reliance rose as much as 8.5% on Thursday, making it the first listed Indian firm to achieve a market capitalization of more than $200 billion.  Ambani, the world\u2019s fifth richest man, is shifting his empire\u2019s focus towards retail after successfully building India\u2019s largest telecom network by customers in four years, hoping to take a dominant position as India\u2019s huge consumer market comes of age.  For Reliance, a deal with Amazon could potentially leverage the e-commerce giant\u2019s global experience in technology, supply chain and logistics, as it aims to connect mom-and-pop stores across India digitally through its Jio telecoms network.  For Amazon, a stake in Reliance Retail could give it access to the Jio telecoms platform and its vast retail footprint across India. It could also add more firepower to Amazon\u2019s local lobbying efforts, as the Ambani family is well-connected.  The reported discussions come at a time when Amazon has been facing tighter regulatory scrutiny and anti-trust cases in India, with brick-and-mortar retailers alleging it uses unfair business practices to operate its online marketplace in the country, an allegation Amazon denies.","387":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BRASILIA (Reuters) - Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer, is close to winning a seven-year battle with eight Latin American countries over the .amazon internet domain.

But Amazon basin countries Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname have argued that it refers to their geographic region and should not be the monopoly of one company.

A shipment moves on a conveyor belt at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre on the outskirts of Bengaluru, September 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  Amazon on Sunday won an injunction from a Singapore arbitrator to halt FRL\u2019s deal to sell assets to Reliance. Amazon alleged FRL had breached certain contract provisions it entered into last year in a separate deal with the U.S. firm.  The dispute centres around FRL\u2019s decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.  Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn\u2019t sell its retail assets to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list including any firms from Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani\u2019s group. The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under Singapore International Arbitration Centre rules.  Shares in Reliance and FRL fell on Monday. Both companies reacted to the arbitrator\u2019s decision by saying they want to complete the deal \u201cwithout any delay\u201d, setting the stage for a showdown between Reliance and Amazon - each led by one of the world\u2019s richest men.  A 130-page order by the arbitrator reveals how Jeff Bezos-led Amazon argued that Future breached agreements which barred it from selling retail assets to entities including Reliance, whose boss Ambani is Asia\u2019s richest man. It also shows the level of concern at Future if the deal breaks.  Future\u2019s retail unit - which has more than 1,500 outlets - will need to pack up if the transaction with Reliance doesn\u2019t go through, hitting the livelihoods of thousands of employees and workers at its vendor firms, the Indian group argued before the arbitrator, according to the order which is not public.  LEGAL OBLIGATIONS  \u201cIf the disputed transaction falls through, FRL will go into liquidation. That will mean that the livelihoods of more than 29,000 employees of FRL will be lost,\u201d the Indian group\u2019s representatives told the arbitrator V.K. Rajah, a former attorney general of Singapore.  The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many Indian businesses, especially in the retail sector, and the FRL-Reliance deal was aimed at protecting the interests of all stakeholders through a large infusion of funds and the acquisition of liabilities, Future argued at the tribunal.  But Rajah ruled that \u201ceconomic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations\u201d.  Amazon, FRL and Reliance didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Amazon welcomed the arbitrator\u2019s decision in a previous statement. FRL has said it would take appropriate steps to ensure its deal proceeds unhindered, while Reliance said it will complete the transaction.  Amazon, which counts India as a key growth market where it has invested $6.5 billion, has already been bogged down by antitrust probes and strict foreign investment rules.  The latest tussle puts Amazon at odds not just with FRL but also Ambani and his Reliance group which is fast expanding its e-commerce business, and threatening the dominance of Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart in that space.  Two sources familiar with the matter said the injunction was not automatically enforceable in India and that the order would have to be ratified by an Indian court.  Any subsequent legal order in India to halt the deal would allow Amazon to negotiate with Reliance, Future and banks on the other side, said Murali Neelakantan, a corporate lawyer at Indian law firm Amicus which is not involved in the case.  \u201cIf Amazon doesn\u2019t get an injunction against the deal proceeding in India, they will probably just get damages even if they win the final arbitration,\u201d Neelakantan said.","390":"BRUSSELS, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Online platforms that act as gatekeepers face new rules that will curb their power, EU industry chief Thierry Breton said on Wednesday, a sign of Europe\u2019s tougher line against U.S. tech giants Facebook, Google and Amazon.  \u201cWe see some platforms as gatekeepers, that is not what we want.

Amazon are the kings of logistics, the kings of IT and algorithms,\u201d chief executive Michel-Edouard Leclerc told France Info radio. \u201cBut I have a trust relationship with consumers. I think commercial policy will prevail.\u201d  Leclerc has overtaken Carrefour as the leading food retailer in France by market share, partly because its prices are typically lower than its rivals.  The new service, to be called \u2018Leclerc Chez Moi\u2019 (Leclerc To My Door), will be launched on March 26 in northern Paris and from May 15 in the south of the city.  It will price products at 15-20 percent below those of competitors with a goal of generating revenue equivalent to a hypermarket in the first year.  \u201cThe Leclerc division is coming to Paris and it will free up prices,\u201d Leclerc said in reference to the French 2nd Armored Division, headed by General Philippe Leclerc (not a relative), who liberated Paris during World War Two.  CASINO SEES NO THREAT FROM LECLERC IN PARIS  Questioned about the impact of Leclerc\u2019s plans on the performance of its Franprix and Monoprix convenience stores in Paris, Casino CEO Jean Charles Naouri told analysts last week he was not overly worried.  \u201cThe Paris food market is worth 7 billion euros and Leclerc thinks it can generate a food revenue of 170 million euros. This will have a limited impact of 1 percent on the revenue of Monoprix and Franprix,\u201d he said.  Amazon, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, is steadily building up its presence in France. Privately-held French supermarket operator Systeme U recently disclosed it was in discussions over a grocery supply deal with Amazon.  Faced with the challenge from the U.S. giant, France\u2019s retailers have been looking to improve their online offerings.  In January Carrefour unveiled plans to boost its e-commerce investment and said it would seek a partnership in China with Tencent. In November, Casino said it would use British online retailer Ocado\u2019s e-commerce platform to help expand.","394":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc CEO Jeff Bezos said his company will invest $1 billion to bring small businesses online in India, reaching out to some of his fiercest critics in a goodwill visit that saw him donning traditional Indian attire and fly a kite with children.  Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart have been hit with a barrage of criticism from India\u2019s brick-and-mortar retailers who accuse the U.S. giants of violating Indian law with deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers by promoting select big ones. The companies deny the allegations.  Just this week, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) launched an anti-trust probe to look into those allegations.  Amazon said it will setup digital centers in 100 Indian cities and villages to help businesses get online to sell their goods and will offer support in marketing and logistics.  The investment of $1 billion will help bring more than 10 million Indian businesses online and enable exports of India-made goods worth $10 billion by 2025, it added.  Speaking at a company event at a New Delhi stadium which Amazon described as \u201ca first-of-its-kind mega summit\u201d bringing together more than 3,000 small businesses, Bezos praised India and said Amazon was committed to being its long-term partner.  \u201cThe dynamism, the energy ... the growth. This country has something special,\u201d Bezos, who wore a blue-colored traditional Indian jacket, said to the audience which responded with cheers.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  Other events in India have included Bezos paying his respects to a memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi. Sources say he has sought a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other government officials.  The Confederation of All India Traders, a group representing roughly 70 million brick-and-mortar retailers, has said it will protest in 300 cities during Bezos\u2019 visit.  But protests so far have been small. At one in New Delhi and another in the eastern state of Odisha on Wednesday, there were about 50 demonstrators each.  \u201cWe are not able to compete. There is an unhealthy competition,\u201d said Girish Prasad Ratha, a demonstrator who said he had lost 15% of his sales in the last two years because customers were increasingly going online.  The company maintains it provides opportunities to more than 550,000 sellers on its platform to grow their business in India.  India\u2019s e-commerce market revenues are set to touch $120 billion this year, having grown 51% annually between 2017 and 2020, according to a study by the CCI.  The $1 billion investment announced on Wednesday adds to $5.5 billion of investments in India announced by Amazon since 2014.  Bezos, who arrived on Tuesday, is due to fly out on Saturday.","395":"(The August 21 story, corrects to read \u201cthe market for food ecommerce\u201d in paragraph 1.)

REUTERS\/Noah Berger\/File Photo  BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Post DHL DPWGn.DE will no longer deliver fresh food in Germany for Amazon AMZN.O as the market for food ecommerce has been disappointing, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  Selling food is a key part of the strategy of the world\u2019s top online retailer, especially since it bought the U.S. chain Whole Foods in 2017, but its Fresh service, launched in 2007 in Seattle, has grown much slower than the rest of the business.  A spokeswoman confirmed a report in Germany\u2019s Lebensmittel Zeitung trade publication that DHL was ending its cooperation with Amazon Fresh, launched in Germany in 2017, adding the rest of its business with Amazon was unaffected.  \u201cThe market for online ordered fresh food has been far behind expectations to date. Due to this reason and the complexity of the whole process, we have significantly reduced our activities in this area,\u201d she said.  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment, beyond saying that the Fresh service had received positive feedback in Germany, Amazon\u2019s second biggest market outside of the United States.  Online sales of food have grown slower in Germany than in many developed markets, partly due to the high density of discount stores like Aldi and Lidl. Ecommerce only made up about 1.2% of food sales in Germany in 2018, according to the HDE retail association.  A company source said customers of Amazon Fresh would not be affected by the DHL move.  Amazon is building up its own delivery network in Germany, independent of big logistics players like Deutsche Post DHL.  Earlier this month, FedEx Corp said it would end its contract with Amazon for small-package ground deliveries, as the online retailer becomes more of a threat than a customer by expanding its own delivery network of planes, trucks and vans.","396":"WARSAW, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The Auschwitz Memorial criticised Amazon on Sunday for fictitious depictions of the Holocaust in its Prime series \u201cHunters\u201d and for selling books of Nazi propaganda.  Seventy-five years after the liberation of the Nazi German Auschwitz death camp by Soviet troops, world leaders and activists have called for action against rising anti-Semitism.  \u201cHunters\u201d, released on Friday and starring Al Pacino, features a team of Nazi hunters in 1970s New York who discover that hundreds of escaped Nazis are living in the United States.  However, the series has faced accusations of bad taste, particularly for depicting fictional atrocities in Nazi death camps, such as a game of human chess in which people are killed when a piece is taken.  \u201cInventing a fake game of human chess for @huntersonprime is not only dangerous foolishness & caricature. It also welcomes future deniers,\u201d the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted.  \u201cWe honor the victims by preserving factual accuracy.\u201d  The Auschwitz Memorial is responsible for preserving the Nazi German death camp in southern Poland, where more than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease.  Amazon, also under fire for selling anti-Semitic books, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.  Polish state-run news agency PAP cited Amazon as saying that as a bookseller it was aware of the history of censorship of books and it believed it was important to ensure access to books including those that may arouse reservations.  On Friday, the Memorial retweeted a letter from the Holocaust Educational Trust to Amazon asking that anti-Semitic children\u2019s books by Nazi Julius Streicher, who was executed for crimes against humanity, be removed from sale.  \u201cWhen you decide to make a profit on selling vicious antisemitic Nazi propaganda published without any critical comment or context, you need to remember that those words led not only to the #Holocaust but also many other hate crimes,\u201d the Auschwitz Memorial tweeted on Sunday.  In December, Amazon withdrew from sale products decorated with images of Auschwitz, including Christmas decorations, after the Memorial complained.

Trump has attacked Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos several times, and his latest comment came a day after news website Axios reported he was obsessed with the world\u2019s largest online retailer and wanted to rein in its growing power, possibly with federal antitrust or competition laws.  \u201cI have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\u201d Trump tweeted early on Thursday.  Amazon shares fell as much as 4.5 percent in morning trade, but recovered and closed up just over 1 percent. The stock dropped 5 percent on Wednesday following the Axios report. Amazon declined to comment on the tweet.  The retailer and cloud computing pioneer is the latest company Trump has singled out for praise or condemnation, although the effect on stock prices of his targets is generally short-lived.  Trump\u2019s criticism did not diminish U.S. fund managers\u2019 long-term enthusiasm for Amazon, whose stock has risen more than five-fold in the last five years.  \u201cIf there really was teeth or real concern that something would come out of the government and regulatory oversight, Amazon\u2019s stock drop would be a lot lower than it is today,\u201d said Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager at Monetta Financial Services in Wheaton, Illinois, which holds Amazon shares.  TAX BREAKS  Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon reflect a broader debate about its effect on the U.S. economy. It employs many of its 566,000 full and part-time staff in the United States and has allowed some small vendors to thrive on its service, but it has also been blamed by some for putting brick-and-mortar stores out of business as more people shop online.  The Seattle-based company has promised to create 50,000 new jobs as it invests $5 billion in a second headquarters in North America. Amazon\u2019s choice of location for the new campus, winnowed to 20 candidates in January, has sparked fierce competition between state and local governments offering extensive tax breaks.  Trump does not have any new policies planned that would affect Amazon, a White House official said on Thursday, adding that Trump was prompted to speak out on the subject in reaction to news reports this week.  Amazon has been criticized for attempting to skirt state sales taxes, but since April last year it has voluntarily collected state sales tax on items it sells direct to customers in all 45 states that have one. Amazon does not have to collect taxes on third-party sellers using its Marketplace service.  That issue was the cause of some of Trump\u2019s ire, White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett told Fox Business Network. \u201cAmazon vendors that can run through the Amazon Marketplace ... don\u2019t collect the sales tax. And that\u2019s about half of their sales,\u201d he said.  Washington and Pennsylvania recently enacted laws requiring collection of third-party merchants\u2019 sales taxes, and other states are expected to follow.  The issue is still being disputed at the federal level, with the U.S. Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments on April 17 in a case which could reverse a 1992 decision that only companies with a physical presence in a state are required to collect state sales tax.  Investors largely waved off concerns about that on Thursday.  \u201cIf there is a law that regulates how you tax third-party sellers, it\u2019s going to apply to everyone and Amazon\u2019s position will remain the same,\u201d said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.  The logo of Amazon is seen on a building in San Jose, Costa Rica March 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Juan Carlos Ulate  Amazon has carved out an influential position in Washington through lobbying, campaign contributions and pushing policy issues like job creation, but it could still face problems if Trump takes action against it.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things where the federal government can do real damage to any business, and that\u2019s precisely why we don\u2019t want the president to attack individual companies, certainly not for political reasons,\u201d said Stan Veuger, an expert on politics and finance at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.  POST DISPUTE  It is not clear that Amazon is responsible for the United States Postal Service (USPS) losing money, although Wall Street analysts have estimated it pays USPS roughly half what it would to United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N or FedEx Corp FDX.N to deliver a package.  Details of Amazon\u2019s payments to USPS are not publicly known. USPS declined to comment on Trump\u2019s tweet.  An independent agency of the U.S. federal government, USPS reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for fiscal 2017, largely due to increased costs of retirement benefits.  Deliveries for Amazon and other online retailers are the fastest-growing part of USPS\u2019 business, helping offset a sharp decline in regular first-class mail. Its revenue from shipping and packages in fiscal 2017 was $19.5 billion, up 13 percent from the previous year.  \u201cCommon sense suggests USPS needs Amazon more than Amazon needs USPS,\u201d Stifel analysts wrote in a research report this week.  Amazon has undoubtedly contributed to the closure of many brick-and-mortar stores and the bankruptcy of some chains as more people shop online instead of in malls. But there are other factors, such as high debt, and Amazon is not solely responsible.  \u201cYes, Amazon has put thousands of retailers out of business,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \u201cWalmart has also put thousands of retailers out of business. So has Starbucks, Barnes & Noble, Kroger and any other superstore that took share from small businesses.\u201d  Amazon founder Bezos also privately owns the Washington Post, which won a Pulitzer Prize last year for its investigation of Trump\u2019s donations to charities.  White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah denied on Thursday that Trump\u2019s criticism was a personal grudge.  \u201cA lot of people have made this, with respect to Amazon, about personalities and the CEO at Amazon - we\u2019re talking about Jeff Bezos here,\u201d he said on Thursday on the Fox News channel. \u201cIt\u2019s really about policy.\u201d","401":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s competition regulator on Tuesday cleared Amazon\u2019s purchase of a 16% stake in online delivery group Deliveroo, following a provisional nod in June.

It changed approach to focus on competition after criticism from rivals including Just Eat Takeaway and Domino\u2019s Pizza.  \u201cToday\u2019s final decision is the result of a thorough examination of this deal and the markets in which Amazon and Deliveroo operate,\u201d said Stuart McIntosh, the inquiry chair.

But while browsing social media recently, the 49-year-old Brazilian spotted a bargain-priced sandwich press from local retailer Magazine Luiza SA MGLU3.SA.  Frederico Trajano, Chief Executive Officer of retail Magazine Luiza S.A., poses for Reuters in Sao Paulo, Brazil October 23, 2017. Picture taken October 23, 2017. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker  She swallowed her doubts and hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button. Two days later she picked up her first-ever online purchase at a mall in Sao Paulo.  \u201cI took the risk,\u201d said Oliveira, who cleans offices for a living. \u201cIf I have any trouble with it, at least I know I can come back to the store.\u201d  A reassuring physical presence and fast-growing online sales have vaulted Magazine Luiza into the upper echelons of Brazilian e-commerce, lifting shares over 500 percent last year and 20 percent so far in 2018.  The company is relying on deep roots in its home turf to survive an assault by Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, which is revving up operations in Latin America's largest economy six years after entering the market.  Reuters has reported that Amazon is eyeing a major warehouse outside Sao Paulo, negotiating a nationwide air cargo deal and lining up local suppliers of everything from personal electronics to perfume and home appliances.  But the American giant may struggle to dominate retail in Brazil as it has elsewhere, according to a dozen executives, analysts and investors interviewed by Reuters. They compare the state of Brazilian e-commerce to that of the U.S. market 10 years ago \u2014 only Amazon\u2019s slow rollout here gave rivals a chance to prepare.  Helped by Brazil\u2019s richest man and search giant Google, competitors are copying many of Amazon\u2019s signature moves. Those strategies have sped up delivery, earned customer loyalty and boosted offerings through partnerships with third-party sellers. And unlike Amazon, home-grown players such as Magazine Luiza have decades of experience with the country\u2019s working-class consumers and tangles of red tape \u2014 key survival skills in Brazil\u2019s retail jungle.  \u201cWe see room for several players,\u201d said Eduardo Carlier, a fund manager at AZ Quest Investimentos, a major shareholder in Magazine Luiza. \u201cWe think the winner-take-all model that played out in the United States is going to be tempered in Brazil.\u201d  Amazon declined to comment.  SLOW START  With a population of more than 200 million people, Brazil is key to Amazon\u2019s global expansion plans. But as in China and India, where it ran into strong competition, Amazon is playing catch-up in Brazil.  Amazon entered Brazil quietly in 2012, peddling e-readers, books and then streaming movies in a fast-growing e-commerce market that has since doubled to $20 billion.  Like a predator lurking at the edges of the market, Amazon has kept competitors uneasy, wondering when it would attack their core business.  They got their answer in October, when the world\u2019s largest online retailer opened a Brazilian marketplace for third-party sellers of an array of physical products.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Shares in Magazine Luiza, rival B2W Cia Digital BTOW3.SA, and market-leading MercadoLibre Inc MELI.O, fell nearly 20 percent on the news.  Yet all three rebounded quickly in the following weeks. Their shares have continued to climb this year as Brazil\u2019s economy picks up and the companies employ strategies that could have been ripped from Amazon\u2019s own playbook.  Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann and partners at 3G Capital, the investment firm behind the Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O merger, have invested heavily in B2W through its brick-and-mortar parent Lojas Americanas SA LAME4.SA. Their backing has let B2W spend aggressively on in-house logistics, a third-party marketplace and efforts to integrate operations with Lojas Americanas.  In a cheeky move, B2W uses the name \u201cPrime\u201d for its shopping club offering fast shipping for annual membership fees, the same moniker used by Amazon for a similar service in other markets. Amazon uses \u201cPrime\u201d only for its streaming video offerings in Brazil.  Another online rival, MercadoLibre, was founded in Buenos Aires two decades ago to replicate the eBay Inc EBAY.O marketplace model across Latin America. It has held its own against Amazon in Mexico and leads the Brazilian market in online sales, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Its Brazil unit grew 80 percent last year, providing nearly 60 percent of net revenue.  Last year, MercadoLibre opened a warehouse near Sao Paulo to store and ship third-party goods, accelerating delivery using a model similar to the pioneering \u201cFulfilled by Amazon\u201d service.  Brazilian retailers are also getting an assist from Silicon Valley. Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google briefed its Brazilian advertisers last year on Amazon's forays into markets such as India and Mexico to help them prepare, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Google\u2019s head of retail in Brazil, Claudia Sciama, acknowledged that Brazilian clients had been asking what a ramp-up by Amazon could mean.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is an exploratory study to understand how they might enter different markets,\u201d Sciama said. She declined to provide details.  DIGITAL LEAP  Few Brazilian retailers have done as much to reinvent themselves in recent years as Magazine Luiza.  Founded six decades ago as a gift shop in the shoemaking hub of Franca, in Sao Paulo state, the unpretentious retailer became a national player in the 1990s selling appliances, furniture and electronics on credit to poor families ignored by bigger chains.  Chairwoman Luiza Trajano started on the sales floor as a teenager and in 1991 took over the company founded by her aunt. She steered it to a public listing in 2011, expanding operations to more than 800 locations across the country at present.  Yet Magazine Luiza\u2019s digital leap, with her son at the helm, may be the most dramatic transformation yet. Frederico Trajano launched e-commerce operations in 2000 and has made it the company\u2019s central focus since becoming CEO in January 2016.  Using brick-and-mortar stores as delivery hubs to cut costs and win over wary online shoppers, Trajano is accelerating both internet sales and new store openings. Digital sales channels grew 61 percent last year to make up nearly a third of revenue, while profit more than quadrupled.  Magazine Luiza plans to open about 100 new stores this year, up from nearly 60 in 2017, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company has said it may open more stores in 2018 than last year.  For Trajano, those outlets form the backbone of his digital strategy, putting inventory closer to consumers and cutting the cost of storage and order processing.  Trajano said fulfillment consumes up to 15 percent of Brazilian e-commerce revenue, compared to as little as 8 percent in the United States, due to Brazil\u2019s lousy infrastructure, high borrowing costs and lower levels of automation.  Each new store is \u201ca free distribution center,\u201d Trajano said in an interview at Magazine Luiza\u2019s unassuming headquarters by a highway in Sao Paulo.  \u201cWhy do you think Amazon bought Whole Foods?\u201d he said.  CROWDED BACK ROOMS  To be sure, Trajano\u2019s vision of seamless integration between e-commerce and physical stores is a work in progress.  When shopper Oliveira went to fetch her sandwich press, she joined a line of impatient customers waiting at the Aricanduva shopping mall on the gritty east side of Sao Paulo.  In the back room, Magazine Luiza staff hunted for her order on shelves piled with plates, shampoo, microwaves and tires. On a February analyst call, Trajano acknowledged the company\u2019s stores need to be better retrofitted to handle the flow of online orders.  Magazine Luiza is also sharpening its home delivery operation. The company has around 1,500 dedicated truckers running its own app, updating routes and communicating with sellers, warehouses, stores and customers in real time.  Trajano lauds Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as \u201cthe best CEO in the world,\u201d but said his company will face a steep learning curve in Brazil, given its notoriously tough business climate.  Case in point: Brazilian consumers have long paid sales taxes on online purchases, unlike in the United States, where internet commerce got a break in its early years.  \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing the Brazilian government knows how to do, it\u2019s collect taxes,\u201d Trajano said.","403":"Amazon.com Inc:  * AMAZON AND RING CLOSE ACQUISITION\u2014NOW WORKING TOGETHER TO EMPOWER NEIGHBORS WITH AFFORDABLE WAYS TO MONITOR THEIR HOMES AND REDUCE CRIME IN NEIGHBORHOODS  * AMAZON & RING HAVE DROPPED PRICE OF RING VIDEO DOORBELL TO $99.99 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","404":"June 7 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp said on Friday it \u201chas made the strategic decision to not renew the FedEx Express U.S. domestic contract with Amazon.com Inc\u201d.

The world\u2019s biggest sales event - eclipsing Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States combined - stretches over four main days this year, and so far has brought sellers on Alibaba platforms 16 times as many orders by value than Amazon.com Inc clocked last month in its two-day global Prime Day.  The performance will likely come as a relief to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd a week since it lost about 10% of its market value after regulators pulled the listing of financial technology affiliate Ant Group.  The sale also comes amid an economic rebound with the spread of the novel coronavirus in China under control, while border closures abroad have meant more consumers spending at home. Such is its size that its performance is widely considered indicative of the strength of China\u2019s post-virus recovery.  Alibaba, which launched the shopping event in 2009, began the sale early this year to give lesser-known brands more exposure. It scheduled primary discount days for Nov. 1 through Nov. 3 as well as the usual Nov. 11, and will calculate gross merchandise volume (GMV) over the 11 days, rather than 24 hours.  The event is usually a splashy affair accompanied by live performances, with Katy Perry appearing this year at Alibaba\u2019s gala late on Tuesday, albeit via livestream.  As well as simple percentage discounts from regular prices, Alibaba encourages shoppers across its numerous platforms to play mobile games, combine purchases across shops and place orders in the sale\u2019s first few hours to get the best deals.  As of 12:30 a.m. local time (1630 GMT) on Nov. 11, GMV had surpassed 372.3 billion yuan ($56.3 billion) with orders peaking at a record 583,000 per second, Alibaba said. Over 2 million products featured in the sale for the first time - double last year, when GMV for Nov. 11 reached a record $38.4 billion.  Over 340 firms, including Apple Inc, L\u2019Oreal SA , Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Nike Inc , have exceeded 100 million yuan in sales, and 13 brands have recorded GMV above 1 billion yuan, Alibaba said.  Rivals JD.com Inc and Pinduoduo Inc as well as firms such as Douyin - the Chinese version of Beijing ByteDance Technology Co Ltd\u2019s TikTok - are also holding events for Singles\u2019 Day, which falls on the 11th day of the 11th month.  JD.com, which started Singles\u2019 Day promotions on Nov. 1, said it recorded 200 billion yuan worth of sales within nine minutes of midnight on Wednesday, while electronics retailer Suning.com Co Ltd - part-owned by Alibaba - said it made 5 billion yuan in sales within the first 19 minutes.  BOON FOR LUXURY  Singles\u2019 Day was trending on China\u2019s Twitter-like Weibo, while a poll of Singles\u2019 Day spending by Sina Entertainment found 44% of 174,000 respondents aimed to spend less than 1,000 yuan versus 4% who planned to splurge over 10,000 yuan.  Still, analysts expect this year to be a boon for luxury brands, as Chinese consumers accustomed to going overseas to buy high-end goods are stuck at home due to border closures.  \u201cThe lack of consumer tourism which has hit European and U.S. stalwarts like Harrods, Galeries Lafayette and Nordstroms will likely see bigger spending locally,\u201d retail analyst Andy Halliwell at consultancy Publicis Sapient said in a client note.  Livestreaming with telegenic hosts hawking products in real-time was a common feature of this year\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day, continuing a trend which started about two years ago.  At a building close to Alibaba\u2019s Hangzhou headquarters, where rooms had been converted into filming studios, dozens of livestreamers chatted incessantly to viewers about Singles\u2019 Day promotions and the merits of the goods they were selling.  Luo Lima, who sells diapers and other maternity products, estimated she had been on camera for 24 hours over the course of this year\u2019s sales period, versus six hours on Singles\u2019 Day two years ago.  \u201cWe stream continuously for six hours, with no break,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically we start by eating a full meal, and getting in a good state of mind.

Pre-orders for Versa 2, which is priced at $200, will start later in the day, the company said, adding that the smartwatch would be available in stores on Sept. 15.  Fitbit has struggled to gain a foothold in the smartwatch category as Apple and Samsung 005930.KS have cornered a bigger share of the market with more sophisticated devices, while its dominant share of the fitness tracking sector continues to be chipped away by cheaper offerings from China's Huawei and Xiaomi 1810.HK, among others.  Fitbit last month cut its 2019 revenue forecast, blaming disappointing sales of Versa Lite smartwatches, a cheaper version that lacked features such as the ability to store music.  \u201cWhile Versa Lite received good present consumer reviews, we saw that consumers were willing to pay more for a smartwatch with additional features,\u201d Chief Executive Officer James Park said on an earnings call with analysts earlier this month.  The company separately launched Fitbit Premium, which will give its users personalized coaching including health reports, workouts and sleep features at a cost of $9.99 per month, beginning September.  Versa 2 and Fitbit Premium are steps to upsell to its existing base of 27 million users by adding more features, according to Scott Searle from Roth Capital Partners.  Searle added that Fitbit Premium provides sleep guidance and insights enabled by 10.5 billion nights of sleep data gathered from its previous models that give it an edge over Apple\u2019s watches.  Fitbit provides five days of battery life on an average against Apple\u2019s watches that only have a day of battery life and loses sleep data as it is charged overnight, he added.  The San Francisco-based wearables pioneer, which has seen its shares sink in the past two years, has been looking for new avenues to boost sales.  Last week, it signed a contract with the Singapore government to provide fitness trackers and services in a health program it said could reach up to 1 million users.","408":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc was slapped with a class-action lawsuit on Thursday accusing the e-commerce giant of inflating the prices of ebooks in collusion with some publishers.

The profit warning that came in just ahead of the all-important holiday shopping season for retailers, wiped off the stock\u2019s gains for the year and prompted several brokerages to cut their price targets.  FedEx shares are on course for their biggest one-day percentage drop since 2008.  J.P. Morgan was the most aggressive in slashing its price target by $22, saying growth at the company\u2019s Express business, the largest unit, was taking a hit from delays in integration of TNT Express, a Dutch delivery company it acquired in 2016 for $4.8 billion.  A bellwether of the global economy and the broader logistics sector, FedEx has been battling the costly and lengthy integration that it expects to complete by 2021 at an estimated cost of about $1.7 billion.  Credit Suisse, which cut its price target for the stock to $168 from $175, said barring an outright recession, the numbers are nearly de-risked with the potential for a reacceleration in earnings growth in FY21.  \u201cThis is a transition year... we believe earnings should recover in FY21, and would obviously improve sooner if there were a trade deal between the US and China,\u201d Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a note.

Cutting emissions is a challenging goal for Amazon, which delivers 10 billion items a year and has a massive transportation and data center footprint. \u201cWe know we can do it and we know we have to do it,\u201d Bezos said.  Bezos announced a number of actions at a press conference in Washington ahead of the upcoming Climate Week in New York, a global gathering of world and company leaders seeking ways to fight climate change. Global marches to push for climate action are planned for Friday.  Amazon is the first major corporation to announce such a goal by 2040, according to U.S. non-profit group Ceres, which works with companies on sustainability commitments.  \u201cWhat Amazon has announced today is groundbreaking and potentially game-changing,\u201d said Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy at Ceres. \u201cThis will certainly have ripple effects because Amazon is so intertwined with the entire economy.\u201d  Bezos said Amazon will meet the goals of the Paris climate accord 10 years ahead of the accord\u2019s schedule, and it will use 100% renewable energy by 2030, up from 40% today.

A Rivian spokeswoman said 10,000 of the vehicles for Amazon will be on the road by late 2022.  The company said Amazon currently has 30,000 vehicles delivering customer orders in the United States. That excludes vans from United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and the U.S. Postal Service, which are also carrying non-Amazon parcels.  Amazon will invest $100 million to restore forests and wetlands, said Bezos, adding the company will take a \u201ccareful look\u201d at political campaign contributions it makes that could be going to politicians that deny climate science.  Amazon previously said it would order 20,000 delivery vans from Daimler AG DAIGn.DE.

He vowed to try to convince other company CEOs to sign on to Amazon\u2019s plan, called The Climate Pledge.  Amazon workers who have pushed the company to take action on climate change called the plan a \u201chuge win\u201d but not enough.

The following are other inquiries now under way.  Justice Department on Apple: This probe, revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple\u2019s app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to pre-existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the earlier apps from the store because they compete with Apple\u2019s new product. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest-quality apps in the app store.  Justice Department on Facebook and Amazon: In July 2019, the Justice Department said it was expanding its Big Tech probes to include \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d - an apparent reference to Facebook and Amazon.  Federal Trade Commission on Facebook: FTC officials probing Facebook have asked about past acquisitions, such as those of Instagram and WhatsApp, and how Facebook treats app developers on its platform. The FTC told Facebook in June 2019 it was probing whether the company has engaged in unlawful monopolistic practices.  Federal Trade Commission on Amazon: In its investigation of Amazon, the FTC is likely looking at the inherent conflict of interest of Amazon competing with small sellers on its marketplace platform, including allegations that it used information from sellers on its platform to decide what products it would introduce.

Traders returned from the Christmas break to digest comments from Beijing that it was in close contact with Washington about an initial trade agreement, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump talked up a signing ceremony for the recently struck Phase 1 trade deal.  Cooling U.S.-China trade tensions have fueled the latest leg of Wall Street\u2019s record-setting rally. With just days to go until the year-end, the benchmark S&P 500 is up 29% so far in 2019, which would be its biggest annual percentage gain since 2013.  The Nasdaq posted a record closing high for a 10th straight session, its longest such streak since 1997.  \u201cThe path of least resistance is up right now,\u201d said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer of Abbot Downing in Minneapolis. \u201cYou have had a lot more clarity on certain things that had worried the market all year.\u201d  Shares of Amazon AMZN.O jumped 4.4% after a Mastercard report showed that U.S. shoppers spent more online during the holiday shopping season than in 2018, with e-commerce sales hitting a record high.  \u201cThe important part is that the online sales were much stronger than expected. The brick-and-mortar were less than expected, so the online sales, and principally Amazon, saved the day,\u201d said John Conlon, director, equity strategy at People\u2019s United Advisors.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 105.94 points, or 0.37%, to 28,621.39, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 16.53 points, or 0.51%, to 3,239.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 69.51 points, or 0.78%, to 9,022.39.  Consumer discretionary .SPLRCD was the biggest gainer among the S&P 500 sectors, spurred by Amazon. Healthcare .SPXHC was the lone sector in the red.  A 0.9% decline in shares of Boeing Co BA.N, which has been dealing with fallout from the grounding of its 737 MAX jet, weighed particularly on the Dow.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts as well as better-than-feared economic data and corporate profits have helped lift stocks this year along with trade-relations optimism.  A Labor Department report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell last week in a sign of ongoing labor market strength.  About 4.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.  Trading volumes are expected to remain thin during the holiday-shortened week.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.22-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 120 new highs and 27 new lows.","425":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Amazon\u2019s use of merchants\u2019 data triggered an EU antitrust investigation on Wednesday, as regulatory concerns mount around the world on how tech giants exploit customer information to reinforce their market power.  U.S. tech firms Amazon, Google and Facebook have been in the regulatory spotlight as antitrust enforcers examine how they use data to shut out rivals. Some U.S. politicians and even one of Facebook\u2019s co-founders have called for them to be broken up.  The European Commission has been seeking feedback from retailers and manufacturers since September into Amazon\u2019s dual role as a marketplace for merchants and as a competitor, following complaints from traders about Amazon\u2019s practices.  The Commission said its investigation would look into Amazon\u2019s data agreements with marketplace sellers and how the online retailer uses that data to choose which seller is selected to provide a product once a consumer clicks \u201cbuy.\u201d  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who can fine companies up to 10% of their global turnover and force them to change their business practices, said the issue was crucial as increasing numbers of Europeans shop online.  \u201cE-commerce has boosted retail competition and brought more choice and better prices. We need to ensure that large online platforms don\u2019t eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behavior,\u201d she said.  Amazon said it would cooperate fully with the EU investigation. The company reached a deal with Germany\u2019s antitrust authority on Wednesday to overhaul its terms of service for third-party merchants.  Its shares were 0.6% down versus a 0.1 percent rise in the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Index.  Under Amazon's terms of service for Europe here set out on its website, merchants grant Amazon \"royalty-free\" rights to use their materials, such as technology, trademarks, content and product information.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Commission may take a tougher approach this time to set a precedent for other platforms providing a marketplace whilst competing with their own products, said Ioannis Lianos, professor of global competition law and public policy at University College London.  \u201cI think the Commission will want to give a strong message because it\u2019s one of the first cases to bring this issue,\u201d Lianos said. \u201cMy feeling is that the Commission\u2019s interest is not to settle but to take an infringement decision to lay down the law clearly and set a precedent.\u201d  In Washington, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is contemplating probes of Amazon and Facebook while the Justice Department is looking at Apple and Google.  In Congress on Tuesday, Representative David Cicilline, chair of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee, pressed Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon, about whether the online retailer used data about independent sellers on its platform to develop products to sell, thus competing against its own sellers.  Sutton argued that the data was used solely to know what to offer customers. \u201cThe algorithms are optimized to what customers want to buy regardless of the seller,\u201d he said.  This would not be Amazon\u2019s first run-in with the Commission. Two years ago, it was told to pay back taxes of about 250 million euros ($280 million) to Luxembourg because of illegal tax benefits. That same year it settled with the regulator over its distribution deals with e-book publishers in Europe.","426":"SAN FRANCISCO\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s expanding business of selling space on its site to merchants helped it double profits on Thursday, and some see the move as a step toward taking advertising dollars from Google and Facebook Inc.  With $2 billion or less of advertising revenue, Amazon is dwarfed by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Facebook, often called an internet duopoly, but it is growing fast, may be outselling ads on Twitter Inc and Snapchat, and it has advantages that other contenders lack.  Amazon has users\u2019 purchase data and knows what shoppers need, said Jason Damata, founder of Fabric Media, which advises companies on marketing and business strategy.  Google knows what people are searching for, while Facebook only knows \u201cwhat you want your friends to think you like,\u201d Damata said.  Some of his clients began directing their ad budgets to get customers to buy their products on Amazon, Damata said, and saw sales jump as a result.  Amazon does not break out ad sales alone. It says advertising sales are the majority of its \u201cother\u201d section, which hit $2.0 billion in the first quarter. After adjusting for accounting changes, that is a 72 percent increase from a year earlier, Amazon said.  Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky called the ad sales business \u201ca multibillion dollar program and growing very quickly.\u201d Advertisers of all sizes were interested in sponsored product ads \u201cto drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully, purchase,\u201d he said.  Internet research firm eMarketer last October forecast Amazon would hit $3.19 billion in net U.S. digital ad revenues by 2019, or 3.0 percent of digital ad spending.  Established advertising firms also have taken notice. Martin Sorrell, the founder of the world\u2019s largest advertising company WPP, who stepped down in mid-April, last month saw Amazon in \u201chead-to-head\u201d competition with Google and Facebook. Sorrell added that WPP had directed $200 million of its clients\u2019 ad budgets to Amazon in 2017 and predicted that number would rise to $300 million this year.  \u201cAmazon is coming over the hill. Amazon certainly poses a big threat on search and advertising,\u201d he said, adding that its voice assistant, Alexa, would make it an even stronger competitor.","427":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O 20 percent hike in the cost of Prime membership should deliver more than $1 billion in extra revenue this year and cover any \"rational\" hike in United States Postal Service delivery fees, Wall Street analysts said on Friday.  President Donald Trump has been laying into the Seattle-based online shopping firm in recent weeks for what he says is a deal with publicly-owned USPS which effectively lumps much of the cost of thousands of daily deliveries onto U.S. taxpayers.  Trump has said that if USPS raised parcel rates, Amazon would face $2.6 billion in extra cost, although equity analysts who follow billionaire Jeff Bezos\u2019 company estimate a much lower number and say the deal may actually be keeping USPS afloat.  Several said that Thursday\u2019s move by the company to raise Prime fees to $119 a year from $99 starting June 16 would not faze many of Prime\u2019s estimated 60-65 million U.S. members.  \u201cThe incremental $20 membership fee could result in an incremental $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of revenue which should more than offset any rational USPS price increase,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said.  Shares of the company were up 7.4 percent to a record high of $1630 in premarket trading on Friday as investors lauded another blockbuster quarter that delivered profits of $1.6 billion and revenue of $51 billion.  \u201cAmazon delivered a humongous quarter, with faster growth and higher profitability than Street projections and followed up with a one-two punch by announcing it was raising annual Prime membership fee,\u201d Deutsche Bank Lloyd Walmsley said.  The 20 percent hike was the second time Amazon had increased its Prime subscription fee since the launch of the service in 2005.  The service, crucial in driving purchases of both goods and digital media on Amazon, gives members free delivery, access to movies and original series through Prime Video, on-demand music streaming and free books on Prime Reading.  That appears to put it on a collision course with Netflix and Apple in the streaming market - but analysts say Bezos is more interested in how the appeal of the service props up his retail empire.  Amazon disclosed last week it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally and commentators said it would likely raise prices outside of the United States as well.  \u201cSo far there is no word on international price hikes but with the expansion of shipping services and content worldwide, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to see them,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.","428":"April 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc:  * AMAZON.COM SAYS ON APRIL 12, ACQUIRED RING FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF ABOUT $900 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED - SEC FILING Source text: [bit.ly\/2r5jBm3] Further company coverage:","429":"WARSAW, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Online shopping platform Amazon is preparing to set up a Polish based website so local shoppers will no longer have to order via its German site, it said on Wednesday, sending shares in top local rival Allegro down by over 7%.

In a regulatory filing late on Thursday, Future Retail said Amazon has agreed to acquire a 49% stake in Future Coupons Ltd. That entity in turn owns a 7.3% interest in Future Retail, according to prior regulatory filings.  The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which gives Amazon a 3.58% stake in the brick-and-mortar retailer, whose stores sell everything from clothes to fresh produce.  A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the transaction valued Future Retail at a \u201csubstantial premium\u201d to its existing market price.  Future Retail\u2019s market capitalization currently stands at $2.91 billion, pegging the value of a 3.58% stake in the company at more than $104 million.  Amazon and Future Retail declined to comment on the value of the transaction that remains subject to regulatory approval.  The regulatory filing said the deal gives Amazon the right of first refusal should Future Retail\u2019s founder, Kishore Biyani, or his family decide to further trim the 47.02% stake they own in company, both directly and via entities like Future Coupons that they control.  The online retailer announced plans on Thursday to launch its Amazon Fresh service to select areas in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru, the e-commerce company\u2019s first such foray into delivering fresh produce in India, seen its last major growth market.  The Future Retail transaction marks Amazon\u2019s second such move to acquire a stake in an Indian supermarket store operator. Last year, Amazon and Indian private equity firm Samara Capital announced a joint investment in an entity that would give Amazon a stake in Indian supermarket chain More. Amazon also owns a stake in Indian department store chain Shopper\u2019s Stop.  Early this year, India revised its e-commerce rules, creating hurdles for Amazon and rival Walmart Inc\u2019s e-commerce subsidiary, Flipkart. One revised rule bars an entity in which a foreign e-commerce company or its group companies have a stake from selling on their online platform.  These and other restrictions forced Amazon to alter how it structures some of its equity holdings in the country.  India\u2019s revised e-commerce regulations, along with its push to compel multinationals to store data locally, have irked the U.S. government and heightened trade tensions. India has argued the rules are aimed at protecting interests of its small traders and privacy of its citizens.  Ahead of the launch of Amazon\u2019s biggest campus in the world in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad on Wednesday, Amazon\u2019s India head Amit Agarwal said India should encourage e-commerce and not try to \u201cdefine every single guard rail under which it should operate.\u201d (Reporting by Euan Rocha in MUMBAI and Nivedita Bhattacharjee in BENGALURU; Editing by David Gregorio)","431":"PARIS (Reuters) -France\u2019s data privacy watchdog has handed out its biggest ever fine of 100 million euros ($121 million) to Alphabet\u2019s Google for breaching the country\u2019s rules on online advertising trackers (cookies).

Google and Amazon also failed to provide clear information to internet users about how the firms intended to make use of such online trackers and how visitors to their French websites could refuse any use of the cookies, the watchdog said.  The CNIL rejected the companies\u2019 arguments that it had no right to impose the sanctions because their respective European headquarters are in Ireland and Luxembourg - two countries perceived by some data privacy advocacy groups as being lenient toward Silicon Valley companies.  The CNIL said Google\u2019s fine had to be paid for the most part by its U.S. entity Google LLC (60 million euros) and the rest by EU-based Google Ireland Limited (40 million).  Amazon\u2019s fine has to be paid by its Luxembourg-based entity.  The CNIL said the companies had three months to change the information banners. If they fail to do so, they will face an additional fine of 100,000 euros per day until they comply.  The financial penalty against Google is the biggest ever issued by the CNIL, a spokesman for the watchdog said.

To ensure the e-commerce giant\u2019s future, Bezos\u2019s best weapons aren\u2019t sales growth, but sprawl and usefulness.  Amazon has received less scrutiny from U.S. politicians than other Silicon Valley giants. Presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have both bashed the company for anti-competitive and worker-pay concerns but Bezos has yet to be called before Congress in a public hearing, unlike the heads of Facebook, Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Twitter. He even avoided that spotlight when Amazon agreed to buy retailer Whole Foods in 2017.  One reason is that Amazon is a platform for selling goods, not a social network, so user content isn\u2019t such an issue. Three members of Congress told Breakingviews that while Amazon is big, at least it has its act together. But Amazon can\u2019t avoid the spotlight forever. While revenue grew 17 percent in the latest quarter, year-on-year, sales of services to other companies that sell on Amazon\u2019s platform, and of its cloud business, grew at least twice as fast. These two areas have drawn the most fire from critics.  There are two things Bezos will need to keep doing to appease detractors, and both are likely to change the company\u2019s earnings profile over time. First, spread Amazon\u2019s operations so that more communities and politicians have an interest in helping to fight its corner. Amazon already has warehouses and fulfillment centers in more than half of U.S. states, but that means there are many where it doesn\u2019t. It pays a minimum of $15 per hour, which is good, but it could do better: Bank of America is about to raise its minimum level to $20.  Amazon will also need to divert more funds to projects that help answer social problems, even if they don\u2019t obviously help shareholders. Telecom AT&T avoided a forced breakup for decades partly by coming up with inventions like transistors, data networking and cellphones. Bezos has already warned shareholders that if the size of Amazon\u2019s failures isn\u2019t growing, it isn\u2019t trying hard enough. He\u2019s also planning for the company to launch over 3,000 satellites for a worldwide broadband network.

The committee does not have authority to punish the companies, and any effort to change antitrust laws affecting tech firms would face hurdles in the Republican-controlled Senate. So the questioning served largely to convey the panel\u2019s displeasure over many of the companies\u2019 business practices.  Representative David Cicilline, chair of the antitrust committee, pressed Nate Sutton, an associate general counsel at Amazon, about allegations that the online retailer used data about independent sellers on its platform to develop products to sell, thus competing against its own sellers.  \u201cYou said we do not consult data to compete with other sellers online. You do collect enormous data about prices, (and) what\u2019s popular,\u201d Cicilline said skeptically. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that you don\u2019t use that in any way to promote Amazon products? I remind you, sir, you\u2019re under oath.\u201d  Sutton argued that the data was used solely to predict what customers wanted, and to offer it to them. \u201cThe algorithms are optimized to what customers want to buy regardless of the seller,\u201d he said.  Matt Perault, head of global policy development at Facebook, faced skepticism from Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia when Perault stressed Facebook\u2019s many social media competitors. \u201cI\u2019d like to know who this competition is,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not readily apparent.\u201d  Lawmakers did not ask about antitrust probes of the four companies under way at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.  Nor did they press Facebook about a proposed $5 billion settlement between with the FTC to resolve allegations that the company violated a 2011 consent agreement by inappropriately sharing information on 87 million users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.  Other congressional panels Tuesday focused on Facebook\u2019s plans to bring out a cryptocurrency, the Libra, and allegations that Google is biased against conservatives in search results.  While the tech companies appear to have few friends on Capitol Hill, there has been some pushback from Republicans against a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, that Amazon, Facebook and Google be forced to divest companies that they purchased previously.

The company started adding technology to a handful of warehouses in recent years, which scans goods coming down a conveyor belt and envelops them seconds later in boxes custom-built for each item, two people who worked on the project told Reuters.  Amazon has considered installing two machines at dozens more warehouses, removing at least 24 roles at each one, these people said. These facilities typically employ more than 2,000 people.  That would amount to more than 1,300 cuts across 55 U.S. fulfillment centers for standard-sized inventory. Amazon would expect to recover the costs in under two years, at $1 million per machine plus operational expenses, they said.  The plan, previously unreported, shows how Amazon is pushing to reduce labor and boost profits as automation of the most common warehouse task \u2013 picking up an item \u2013 is still beyond its reach. The changes are not finalized because vetting technology before a major deployment can take a long time.  Amazon is famous for its drive to automate as many parts of its business as possible, whether pricing goods or transporting items in its warehouses. But the company is in a precarious position as it considers replacing jobs that have won it subsidies and public goodwill.  \u201cWe are piloting this new technology with the goal of increasing safety, speeding up delivery times and adding efficiency across our network,\u201d an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cWe expect the efficiency savings will be re-invested in new services for customers, where new jobs will continue to be created.\u201d  (Dave Clark is Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide operations)  Amazon last month downplayed its automation efforts to press visiting its Baltimore fulfillment center, saying a fully robotic future was far off. Its employee base has grown to become one of the largest in the United States, as the company opened new warehouses and raised wages to attract staff in a tight labor market.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  A key to its goal of a leaner workforce is attrition, one of the sources said. Rather than lay off workers, the person said, the world\u2019s largest online retailer will one day refrain from refilling packing roles. Those have high turnover because boxing multiple orders per minute over 10 hours is taxing work. At the same time, employees that stay with the company can be trained to take up more technical roles.  The new machines, known as the CartonWrap from Italian firm CMC Srl, pack much faster than humans. They crank out 600 to 700 boxes per hour, or four to five times the rate of a human packer, the sources said. The machines require one person to load customer orders, another to stock cardboard and glue and a technician to fix jams on occasion.  CMC declined to comment.  Though Amazon has announced it intends to speed up shipping across its Prime loyalty program, this latest round of automation is not focused on speed. \u201cIt\u2019s truly about efficiency and savings,\u201d one of the people said.  Including other machines known as the \u201cSmartPac,\u201d which the company rolled out recently to mail items in patented envelopes, Amazon\u2019s technology suite will be able to automate a majority of its human packers. Five rows of workers at a facility can turn into two, supplemented by two CMC machines and one SmartPac, the person said.  The company describes this as an effort to \u201cre-purpose\u201d workers, the person said.  It could not be learned where roles might disappear first and what incentives, if any, are tied to those specific jobs.  But the hiring deals that Amazon has with governments are often generous. For the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last year in Alabama, for instance, the state promised the company $48.7 million over 10 years, its department of commerce said.  PICKING CHALLENGE  Amazon is not alone in testing CMC\u2019s packing technology. JD.com Inc and Shutterfly Inc have used the machines as well, the companies said, as has Walmart Inc, according to a person familiar with its pilot.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Walmart started 3.5 years ago and has since installed the machines in several U.S. locations, the person said. The company declined to comment.  Interest in boxing technology sheds light on how the e-commerce behemoths are approaching one of the major problems in the logistics industry today: finding a robotic hand that can grasp diverse items without breaking them.  Amazon employs countless workers at each fulfillment center who do variations of this same task. Some stow inventory, while others pick customer orders and still others grab those orders, placing them in the right size box and taping them up.  Many venture-backed companies and university researchers are racing to automate this work. While advances in artificial intelligence are improving machines\u2019 accuracy, there is still no guarantee that robotic hands can prevent a marmalade jar from slipping and breaking, or switch seamlessly from picking up an eraser to grabbing a vacuum cleaner.  Amazon has tested different vendors\u2019 technology that it may one day use for picking, including from Soft Robotics, a Boston-area startup that drew inspiration from octopus tentacles to make grippers more versatile, one person familiar with Amazon\u2019s experimentation said. Soft Robotics declined to comment on its work with Amazon but said it has handled a wide and ever-changing variety of products for multiple large retailers.  Believing that grasping technology is not ready for prime time, Amazon is automating around that problem when packing customer orders. Humans still place items on a conveyor, but machines then build boxes around them and take care of the sealing and labeling. This saves money not just by reducing labor but by reducing wasted packing materials as well.  These machines are not without flaws. CMC can only produce so many per year. They need a technician on site who can fix problems as they arise, a requirement Amazon would rather do without, the two sources said. The super-hot glue closing the boxes can pile up and halt a machine.  Still other types of automation, like the robotic grocery assembly system of Ocado Group PLC, are the focus of much industry interest.  But the boxing machines are already proving helpful to Amazon. The company has installed them in busy warehouses that are driving distance from Seattle, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Manchester and elsewhere, the people said.  The machines have the potential to automate far more than 24 jobs per facility, one of the sources said. The company is also setting up nearly two dozen more U.S. fulfillment centers for small and non-specialty inventory, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which could be ripe for the machines.  This is just a harbinger of automation to come.  \u201cA \u2018lights out\u2019 warehouse is ultimately the goal,\u201d one of the people said.","447":"(Reuters) - Amazon Inc AMZN.O's video game live-streaming platform Twitch is forming an advisory council of experienced users, online safety experts and anti-bullying advocates to help improve safety on the site, Twitch said in a blog post on Thursday.

The company said it also uses a combination of human moderators and automation to handle the moderation reports it receives.  Twitch, which says it has 15 million daily users, is primarily a site where video gamers can livestream their games and chat to other users, though it also has channels focused on sports, music and politics. Last year, U.S. President Donald Trump joined the platform.

REUTERS\/Mark Makela\/File Photo  Yet the company\u2019s use of airplanes - the most climate-damaging mode of transportation - is on the rise, according to data provided to Reuters.  Amazon Air's U.S. volume has risen steadily since its 2016 launch, according to an analysis of Department of Transportation data by Cargo Facts Consulting www.cargofactsconsulting.com, a Luxembourg-based advisory firm with a global staff and more than four decades of history.  It crunched data from Air Transport Services Group Inc ATSG.O and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW.O. Both supply planes and pilots for Amazon Air.  In July, Amazon Air flew 136 million lbs of goods in the United States, according to the data. That was up 29% from the year earlier and just 9 million lbs short of December 2018, when the peak holiday shipping season was in full swing.  For a graphic on fast delivery fuels more Amazon Air flights, click  Bezos has said Amazon will cut its use of airplanes as it builds more local warehouses and fills them with goods that it can deliver to customer doorsteps in one day, or even one hour.  But for the time being, Amazon's air shipments are climbing as it speeds up deliveries to lure customers and pressure rivals like Walmart Inc WMT.N and Target Corp TGT.N.  In April, Amazon started offering no-minimum purchase, one-day free shipping to members of its Prime subscription service.  In the latest quarter, it saw delivery costs soar, and warned the holiday quarter would see costs for one-day shipping alone spike to $1.5 billion.  The Seattle e-retailer, which sends 10 billion packages a year, declined to say what percentage of its shipments travel by plane or give specific examples of how the latest drive to shave time off its standard two-day shipping affected air transport.  Last month, Amazon said its CO2 emissions in 2018 were 44.4 million metric tons and set a goal to be net carbon neutral by 2040.  \u201cWe expect the percent of total shipments to customers utilizing air transportation to reduce from year to year as we significantly increase one and same day shipments,\u201d Amazon spokesman Sam Kennedy said, when asked about Cargo Facts\u2019 data.  DELIVERY WARS  A standard package flown on a plane in the United States creates an estimated 6-10 times more CO2 emissions than one traveling by truck, said Jacques Leonardi, a senior research fellow in freight, logistics and sustainable distribution at the University of Westminster in London.  Amazon Air leases 47 planes and is expected have 50 by the end of the year. It operates roughly 110 daily flights in the United States and around 20 per day in Europe, according to Cargo Facts.  In June, shortly after FedEx Corp FDX.N said its planes would stop shuttling packages for the online retailer, Amazon Air announced plans to have 70 planes on lease by 2021.  But Amazon says it is getting closer to customers with an expanding network of well-stocked warehouses. Those local fulfillment centers underpin the company\u2019s one-day and same-day delivery services.  In a news release issued Monday, Amazon said those options were \u201cbetter for the planet\u201d because there aren\u2019t many miles in the trip to customer doorsteps.  Because those time windows are so tight, \u201cyou are eliminating the possibility of air transportation,\u201d Amazon\u2019s Bezos said in September. \u201cEven though it\u2019s counterintuitive, the fact of the matter is that shorter delivery times end up being less carbon-intensive than longer delivery times.\u201d  Products from most of Amazon\u2019s 158 U.S. distribution centers can be shipped to 65% of the population in one day, said Marc Wulfraat, president of supply chain consultancy MWPVL International.  Items like footwear, jewelry, auto parts and niche electronics come from 23 distribution centers that span the country - and will likely need to be moved by air for next-day delivery, Wulfraat said.  Amazon also depends on United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N for air shipments. The Atlanta-based delivery company has seen a bump in that business since Amazon began expanding free one-day delivery this spring, UPS executives and analysts said.  Domestic next day air volume at UPS surged more than 30% in the second quarter and was up nearly 24% in the third quarter - fueled by faster e-commerce shipping speeds and rival FedEx\u2019s breakup with Amazon this summer.  \u201cIt\u2019s not all from FedEx,\u201d said Satish Jindel, the founder of logistics advisory firm ShipMatrix, noting that express and deferred air services revenue at UPS surged $852 million in the second and third quarters.  Amazon\u2019s business was worth about $900 million to FedEx prior to their split, Jindel said. Express, which includes air shipments, accounted for roughly $540 million of that, he said.","450":"July 24 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday said the executive in charge of its film studio, Jason Ropell, plans to leave the company, in what could signal a bigger shift from independent films to commercial projects.

The world\u2019s largest online retailer said it recorded the largest daily sales for Amazon\u2019s Echo range of speakers, helped by heavy discounts. Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and Echo Dot were the best-selling devices.  This year Prime Day, Amazon\u2019s summer marketing event, started on July 16 and lasted 36 hours.  The technical glitches lasted for at least two hours and was likely exacerbated by excessive demand and traffic volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.  The retailer likely got between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in revenue from Prime Day and gross merchandise value topped $3.5 billion, Mahaney said.  Amazon said it sold over a million smart home devices in the United States.

The comments by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager came as the world\u2019s largest online retailer faces calls for more regulatory intervention and even its potential break-up because of its sheer size.

Chief Operating Officer Mitch Betses will manage day-to-day operations, while Haven looks for a new CEO, the company said.  Besides Gawande, Haven\u2019s board of directors include JPMorgan\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon, Todd Combs, an investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway, and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon.  Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan formed Haven in 2018 to address the rising healthcare costs in the United States. The companies had said they would use high-tech tools such as data analysis to improve care and reduce costs for employees and their family members.  Haven has not made any other public announcements since unveiling its name in 2019. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on May 8 that Gawande was planning to step down, said the company has launched pilot projects to test health-benefit approaches.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  What\u2019s becoming clear to the people who track the company is the ambitions of the world\u2019s largest online retailer\u2019s go far beyond replacing your phone service.  Amazon is interested in acquiring Boost Mobile, which will be sold by U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp as part of plans to win regulatory approval of their proposed $26.5 billion merger, primarily because a purchase would include a six-year contract that allows access to the combined company\u2019s wireless network, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter.  The ambition signaled that Amazon is looking to dive deeper into the wireless industry, strengthen its cloud services and ultimately take advantage of the next-generation 5G networks that are expected to transform major facets of technology, according to analysts.  That means the tech giant, which has evolved from a mere bookseller to a superstore of physical and digital products, could be setting its sights on taking on carriers such as AT&T Inc and strengthening itself against rival cloud providers like Microsoft.  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T both closed down more than 4% on Friday.  The market assumes Amazon wants to become a wireless carrier itself, \u201cbut that thinking is too small,\u201d said Colby Synesael, an analyst with Cowen. Amazon\u2019s larger motivation could be that it expects 5G to be integral to cloud services in the future for industries like healthcare and autos, which will use 5G-enabled devices, he said.  These devices will connect to Amazon\u2019s cloud, which will store the data. If Amazon can control both the wireless network and the cloud, it can sell the full suite of products for customers who want to build 5G services, which would give it an advantage over competing cloud providers, he said.  Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar also saw a wide opportunity for Amazon. \u201cIn a 5G world, the opportunity from wireless for Amazon could include everything from managing warehouses \u2026 to reducing churn at Prime,\u201d he said in a research note to clients on Friday. Prime is Amazon\u2019s paid subscription service that includes free delivery and access to streaming music and video.  Amazon has dabbled in this arena before. A 2014 attempt to take on Apple\u2019s iPhone with the Fire Phone failed just a year later. In 2007 Amazon launched its free Whispernet 3G wireless service with the first Kindle reading device that let readers download books over the air. Last month, Amazon announced plans to launch over 3,000 satellites to provide internet access to rural areas around the world.  WIRELESS BUSINESS  If Amazon decides to compete as a more traditional wireless provider, \u201cthe impact for the wireless carriers, and particularly Verizon and AT&T, would be bleak,\u201d said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research. \u201cThey are happy to accept losses for years in order to eventually own a market,\u201d he said.  Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, the analyst who called the idea of Amazon\u2019s wanting to enter wireless \u201cbatshit crazy,\u201d said the prospect of Amazon wanting \u201cto operate their own proprietary network for such purposes is economically insane.\u201d  The sheer cost of attempting to build a national network would be an obstacle, he said, noting that Verizon and AT&T have each spent some $120 billion on their networks in the last decade alone.  T-Mobile and Sprint offered a series of concessions last week, including to sell Boost, in order to gain approval for the merger. The Federal Communications Commission has given the green light, the deal still needs approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.","460":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin attends a session during the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2020.

The increase pushes Amazon\u2019s lowest wage above that at Walmart Inc and Target Corp. It is almost $3 shy of the average for a non-management worker in warehousing in the United States.  The online retailer also said it would now lobby in Washington D.C. for an increase in the federal minimum wage and urged its competitors to follow its lead as the union-led \u201cFight for Fifteen\u201d movement pushes for higher remuneration.  Amazon\u2019s move comes when U.S. unemployment is at a near two-decade low as retailers and shippers compete for hundreds of thousands of workers for the all-important holiday shopping season.  Several companies, including United Parcel Service and Macy\u2019s, have announced hiring to staff stores and handle holiday sales and delivery.  \u201cWe listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,\u201d founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement.  The pay increase, effective from next month, will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees in the United States as well as over 100,000 seasonal employees who will be hired across the country this holiday season, the company said.  Christine Owens, executive director at advocacy group National Employment Law Project, said Amazon\u2019s call for changes at the federal level was a \u201csignificant\u201d move.  \u201cAt $7.25, the federal minimum wage is a poverty wage. Having major, profitable employers like Amazon join the fight could help finally unstick it,\u201d she said.  Amazon, which became the second company after Apple to cross $1 trillion in market value last month, currently pays around $11 per hour. Analysts said the raise would cost it $1 billion or less annually but would be offset by a recent $20 increase in the cost of its Prime memberships.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got a company that can\u2019t attract and keep labor because their wage rates are at the bottom of the pay scale, generally speaking,\u201d said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL International, which closely tracks Amazon\u2019s fulfillment operation.  \u201cThis is Amazon waking up and smelling the coffee.\u201d  Amazon also said it was ending some restricted stock unit grants as it raised wages for hourly warehouse and customer service employees.

WORKER STRESS  U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders credited Amazon on Tuesday for doing the \u201cright thing\u201d and called on other corporations in fast food, airlines and retail industries to follow the retailer in raising wages.  Amazon has long been criticized for tough conditions in its fulfillment centers and for its demanding work culture.  That has included several fatalities, including one in 2013 when a conveyer system crushed a temporary worker in a New Jersey warehouse, according to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  A separate OSHA investigation found that Amazon exposed some workers to stress from repeated exertions, bending and standing for up to 10 hours at a time.  Like several of the big U.S. tech firms, Amazon is also facing increased official scrutiny over how much tax it pays.  \u201cWith the Trump administration having previously taken aim at Bezos and Amazon, they need to be proactive to position themselves positively in the court of public opinion,\u201d said Tom Gimble, CEO of recruiting firm LaSalle Network.  \u201cWith many municipalities raising minimum wage over the next few years to approaching $15 per hour, this was not really a stretch for them to do that.\u201d  Target Corp raised its minimum hourly wage last year to $11 and promised to raise it to $15 an hour by the end of 2020, while the world\u2019s largest retailer Walmart raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour earlier this year, even as both struggled with high transportation and raw material costs.  Amazon said it would increase its minimum wage for all full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees.  Amazon also raised its minimum wage in Britain to 10.50 pounds ($13.59) an hour for all employees in the London area and 9.50 pounds an hour for staff in all other parts of the country, effective from Nov. 1.","462":"Oct 26 (Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com Inc fell 10 percent in trading before the bell on Friday after its sales outlook missed Wall Street targets, fanning concerns that the online retailer\u2019s expansion may finally be losing steam.  The third quarter results late on Thursday was the second time running that billionaire Jeff Bezos\u2019 firm had fallen short of Wall Street\u2019s lofty sales targets, and the numbers sent a shockwave reverberating through global stock markets.  The fall in shares, if replicated when U.S. stock markets open officially, would knock nearly $90 billion off Amazon\u2019s market value and relegate it behind Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc in terms of market value.  There were no rating downgrades, however, from the Wall Street analysts who have almost universally backed the company\u2019s long-term prospects.  Only three brokerages cut their price targets on the stock and four others raised their targets, saying Amazon\u2019s long-term growth story remained intact.  \u201cShares are up 52 percent YTD, hence this kind of \u2018growth scare\u2019 is likely to weigh on sentiment in the near term, but ultimately will work itself out (likely by 1Q19),\u201d Barclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a client note.  The world\u2019s largest retailer is facing hurdles to boost sales in international markets as well as increased competition at home from the likes of Best Buy, Target Corp and Walmart Inc, who are stepping up digital investments.  Revenue from Amazon\u2019s international business, which brings in 27.5 percent of total sales, rose 13.4 percent in the third quarter, missing estimates, and decelerating from a 27 percent year-on-year expansion in the previous quarter.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see any real structural issue with Amazon but nearly every line in the business is decelerating a tad, and we typically see another deceleration in retail in 4Q, hence are struggling to identify a catalyst,\u201d Sandler said.  Amazon expected sales in the holiday quarter leading up to Christmas to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, or up to $72.5 billion, while analysts were expecting $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates.  Several analysts called the company\u2019s outlook conservative and said any outright dip in profit seems highly unlikely.  \u201cOverall, Amazon\u2019s growth trajectory remains solid, including advertising, grocery, pharmacy, and specialty retail, as well as Amazon Business ($10 billion in sales in eight countries) and Amazon Web Services,\u201d Telsey Advisory Group analysts said.

Amazon\u2019s private label brands - that include everything from dry fruits to backpacks - sold 10 times more than during the e-tailer\u2019s festive sale last year.  Almost 80 percent of Amazon\u2019s new customers and half its new Prime members are from smaller towns too, Agarwal said.  Prime, Amazon\u2019s loyalty program that offers faster delivery, and free music and video streaming services, has helped Amazon attract tens of millions in India, making it Amazon\u2019s fastest-growing Prime market globally.  Sales of new sellers participating in Amazon\u2019s festive event also grew, with over 7,000 sellers clocking upward of a million rupees each, Agarwal said.  \u201cFor us we are seeing very broad based success across all our sellers,\u201d he said.

REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon is widening its girth. Jeff Bezos\u2019s firm reported first-quarter revenue grew 43 percent year-over-year. Sales have more than doubled in five years, but it\u2019s taking more fixed assets to get there. Amazon now uses property and such with less efficiency than Walmart.  Amazon said on Thursday that revenue hit $51 billion thanks to online-sales growth in North America and its fast-growing cloud-services division. Earnings of $1.6 billion caught Wall Street analysts, who expected less than half that, by surprise.  But rapid sales growth comes with baggage, of the balance-sheet variety. While revenue increased more than 40 percent, the company\u2019s property and equipment grew by 60 percent. Five years ago, Amazon got nearly $7 of revenue for each $1 of those fixed assets. By the end of 2017, that had fallen to around $3.60.  The $14 billion acquisition of Whole Foods is one factor. The upscale grocery chain operates more than 470 stores. But the trend started before that. As well as getting deeper into logistics, the e-commerce firm is opening more retail outlets \u2013 a book store in Manhattan\u2019s Columbus Circle for example.  Compare that with old-school superstore operator Walmart. It got around $4.40 of revenue for each $1 of property and equipment it held on its books at the end of 2017 \u2013 up from roughly $4 back in 2013. The retailer has about 11,700 stores worldwide but it\u2019s attempting to shrink its footprint while better managing its brick and mortar to serve its e-commerce efforts. In January, Walmart planned to close more than 60 Sam\u2019s Club stores and turn 10 of them into distribution centers.  Investors are mostly focused on Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, and its potential to destroy every industry in its path. The shares rose some 6 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday, taking its theoretical market capitalization past $780 billion.

(Writing by Susan Heavey Editing by Nick Zieminski)","478":"WASHINGTON, May 21 (Reuters) - Warehouse employees last month staged a walkout in Michigan to demand safer working conditions at their facility. So did workers in New York, Illinois and Minnesota.  These and other Amazon.com Inc employees across the country are seizing on the coronavirus to demand the world\u2019s largest online retailer offer more paid sick time and temporarily shut warehouses with infections for deep cleaning.  Employees in at least 11 states this year have voiced their concerns and staged actions to highlight a variety of purported workplace deficiencies, allegations the company has denied.  Supporting these Amazon workers are labor groups and unions eager to penetrate the Seattle-based behemoth after years of failed attempts to unionize its operations.  Reuters spoke with 16 unions and labor groups targeting Amazon. They included established organizations such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), as well as newer worker advocacy groups like Warehouse Workers for Justice and Athena, a coalition of labor and social justice groups that have criticized Amazon\u2019s business practices.  Most unions acknowledged their long odds at organizing Amazon using traditional tactics such as holding meetings and gauging interest. Legal hurdles to unionizing the company\u2019s workplaces and mounting elections are steep. For now, many groups said, they are showing workers how to harness public opinion to shame Amazon into granting concessions.  The strategy proved effective in the national \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign to raise the minimum wage. Labor organizations in recent years helped retail and fast-food workers stage highly publicized protests and social media campaigns to draw attention to their modest pay at a time when the economy was booming.  Cities and states including Seattle, San Francisco, California, Arkansas and Missouri raised their minimum wages as did some large U.S. employers, including Amazon, which attributed its pay hikes to a tight labor market as well as pressure from lawmakers and labor groups.  In labor\u2019s latest efforts targeting Amazon, organizations are helping workers create online petitions, connect with elected officials, contact media and file labor complaints with the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The initiative puts public pressure on Amazon to respond, several groups said, while laying the groundwork for unions to recruit card-carrying members in the future.  \u201cWe expect that there will be more push for unionization when we get to the other side of this,\u201d said Stuart Applebaum, president of RWDSU.  Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said Amazon already offers what these groups are requesting: $15 per hour or more to start, health benefits and opportunities for career growth.  \u201cWe encourage anyone interested in the facts to compare our overall pay and benefits, as well as our speed in managing this crisis, to other retailers and major employers across the country,\u201d she said.  Central to the organizing effort, union officials said, is fear among some frontline Amazon workers over the spread of coronavirus in the company\u2019s warehouses.  At least 800 workers in Amazon\u2019s 519 U.S. distribution facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, based on internal company figures compiled by Jana Jumpp, an Amazon warehouse employee in Indiana, who shared the numbers with Reuters. Amazon sends text messages and automated calls to employees alerting them to positive cases in their facilities. Jumpp aggregates cases mentioned in messages sent to her by Amazon workers around the country.  Jumpp said the informal process she has developed likely misses cases. She and other employees said Amazon does not share a running tally of cases at each facility or provide a nationwide count.  \u201cWe have no idea how many people are actually sick, not tested or out on quarantine,\u201d Jumpp said on a recent media call organized by Athena, the labor coalition.  At least six Amazon workers have died of COVID-19, which the company confirmed publicly after each incident.  Amazon\u2019s Lighty would not disclose to Reuters the total number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States. She said the company\u2019s efforts to quarantine infected workers are helping to slow the spread, and rates of infection \u201care at or below the communities we\u2019re operating in at almost all of our facilities.\u201d Lighty did not provide data to support that claim.  A majority of Amazon employees are showing up at work and the company \u201cobjects to the irresponsible actions of labor groups and others in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon,\u201d she said.  Lighty said employee health and safety is the company\u2019s top priority. Amazon will spend more than $800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, she said.  Amazon over the past decade has eviscerated brick-and-mortar retail competitors, some of them unionized, while successfully fending off several attempts by its own employees to organize. With shutdowns now battering Main Street, Amazon is poised to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger than ever.  The company reported record first-quarter sales of $75.5 billion, up 26% from the same period a year ago, as customers sheltering in place have relied on its services and its stock price has risen 35% since the start of the year.  Amazon had nearly 600,000 U.S. employees in 2019, according to its latest annual report, making it one of the largest employers in the country.  In 2019, 10.3% of U.S. workers were union members, down from 20.1% in 1983, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Over 33 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, strengthening the hand of employers at a time of mass unemployment. Still, some labor experts said coronavirus presents unions with their best shot in decades to make inroads at Amazon.  \u201cJustice issues and safety at work tend to be the most powerful arguments in organizing,\u201d said Alex Colvin, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. \u201cThey\u2019re the strongest reason for workers to want representation.\u201d  He said unions have resorted to public relations as a tool to pressure companies as worker protections such as \u201ccollective bargaining and employment rights enforcement have weakened.\u201d  FIGHTING UNIONS  Amazon has resisted unionization within its workforce since its founding in 1994. It defeated unionizing efforts in Seattle in 2000 and in Delaware in 2014 by a wide margin.  In recent weeks it has fired at least four workers in three states who had publicly criticized the company and were involved in organizing.  Lighty said Amazon has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for retaliation. These workers were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but for violating policies such as physical distancing, she said.  Among those sacked was Emily Cunningham, a Seattle-based activist with Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more to fight global warming. She had recently circulated a petition calling for measures such as improved sick leave and urged all employees to agree on a day in April to call in sick to protest warehouse working conditions.  \u201cThere is a lot of frustration on how Amazon is handling the issue of workplace safety,\u201d Cunningham said. She said she has been in touch with the AFL-CIO about the sickout, and a local affiliate of the union called MLK Labor has offered support to continue the fight on working conditions. MLK Labor confirmed it is working with employees that Amazon fired in Seattle.  The AFL-CIO\u2019s secretary treasurer, Elizabeth Shuler, said the union is using the pandemic to galvanize Amazon workers at company headquarters and enlist support from elected officials. Amazon had over 53,000 employees in Seattle in 2019.  \u201cAmazon\u2019s backyard is Seattle, and that\u2019s a major focus for us in terms of how to take the energy, the courage, the activism that we are already seeing there and build that into a real movement,\u201d she said.  Amazon\u2019s Lighty said the company has listened to complaints and implemented over 150 measures to keep workers safe. The company is also running television advertisements thanking warehouse workers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in April showed up at a Texas distribution center and met workers to show his support.  NEW APPROACH  But a steady rise in the number of infections at warehouses has spurred more protests.  Amazon worker Mario Crippen led an April 1 walkout at a Michigan warehouse to protest what he said was a lack of transparency from the company about the number of infections. He said about 40 workers participated in that action at the facility in Romulus, about 24 miles southwest of Detroit.  Amazon disputed that figure, saying fewer than 15 people participated.  Helping Crippen was labor nonprofit United for Respect, which coached him on how to gain media attention without getting fired and use social media to gather more supporters. The group also offered legal help from attorneys if he was terminated.  Crippen, 26, whose job is to stow products at the warehouse, told Reuters he felt as if \u201csomebody had my back.\u201d  He said at least 25 workers at the Romulus warehouse have tested positive, according to figures compiled by employees at the site. Crippen said some workers want the facility shut down for cleaning, and plan to continue protesting working conditions while exploring the idea of working closely with labor groups and unions in the future.  Amazon spokeswoman Lighty did not comment about the Romulus protest, the number of cases at the site or the company\u2019s decision to not shut down the facility. She said Amazon\u2019s decision to handle the closure of a building for deep cleaning depends on several factors, including consulting with health authorities and medical experts.  A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Labor said the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA), received employee complaints about the Romulus site and sent a letter to Amazon listing steps the company \u201ccould take to correct the hazards.\u201d She and MIOSHA would not provide more information.  Lighty did not comment on the details in the letter.  Some labor organizers are instructing workers on how to file such safety complaints. They are also using Facebook Live, Instagram posts, Telegram chats and WhatsApp messages to share other tactics with Amazon employees.  At Whole Foods, an upscale supermarket chain owned by Amazon, several current and former employees have been using Telegram to rally coworkers across the country to agitate for expanded paid sick leave and temporary shutdown of stores with confirmed COVID-19 cases.  \u201cFirst step is to ask what will you do if our store is tested positive? Then form a committee. Plan actions. Document. Call the government,\u201d wrote one of the workers, who confirmed sending the message and discussed the strategy with Reuters on condition of anonymity. The employee said the group has doubled to 400 members since the pandemic began. Reuters could not independently confirm the growth in membership.  This worker and fellow organizers are collaborating with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and are working under the name \u201cWhole Worker\u2019s National Organizing Committee.\u201d  UFCW President Marc Perrone said the union is currently not focusing on the traditional playbook of getting employees to sign cards and become members.  \u201cRight now ...it is about showing workers value and what we can do for them,\u201d he said.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  (Reuters) - Amazon Inc's AMZN.O Australia unit has signed up Zip Co Ltd Z1P.AX to offer its buy now, pay later (BNPL) service on the U.S. giant's local retail website, sending shares in Zip soaring by more than 20%.  The deal with the world\u2019s biggest retailer is a massive boost for Sydney-based Zip, a relatively small player in the crowded and fast-growing BNPL sector. Its payment system went live on the Amazon Australia site on Thursday.  As part of the deal, Zip will issue warrants to an affiliate of Amazon for it to buy as much as 14.6 million of its shares, representing around 4.2% of outstanding shares. The warrants may be exercised for seven years from the issue date.  Zip shares jumped as much as 24.1% shortly after the market open to A$4.27, their biggest intraday jump in nearly two years.  Installment-based payment options have become very popular, especially with Millennial and Gen Z shoppers, because they bypass the interest rates and many regulations associated with taking out a credit card. BNPL companies make money from vendor payments and penalty payments when shoppers are late paying back a loan.  Jun Bei Liu, a portfolio manager at Sydney-based Tribeca Investment Partners, said the deal was a win for both Zip and Amazon. BNPL services serve a \u201cvery strong purpose, particularly in a slower retail environment\u201d by attracting customers to particular retail sites, she said.  However, the success of the BNPL sector has also brought greater regulatory scrutiny. Last month, the Reserve Bank of Australia said it planned to dig deeper into the sector next year.  Those concerns helped end a steady rise in BNPL company shares. Zip had leaped in value from around A$1 at the start of 2019, peaking at $5.86 last month.  Financial crime watchdog AUSTRAC earlier this year demanded an external auditor report of Afterpay Touch Group APT.AX, which is seen as a bellwether of the sector, for suspected non-compliance with money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.","480":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Femsa's Oxxo convenience store is pictured at one of its stores in Monterrey, Mexico August 26, 2018.

Oxxo, owned by Mexican conglomerate Femsa, has nearly 18,000 stores across Mexico, where nearly 60 percent of the population lack bank accounts, posing an obstacle for online shopping.  Amazon in Mexico began accepting cash payments in 2017 at several convenience store chains, including 7-Eleven. The partnership with Oxxo, which already accepts cash for a number of online merchants including Amazon competitor MercadoLibre, will vastly expand the company\u2019s reach.  Under the service, called Amazon Cash, shoppers can deposit between 100 pesos and 5,000 pesos ($5 and $260) per transaction to their Amazon accounts online, with a daily limit of 10,000 pesos. Amazon will reimburse a 12-peso commission charged by Oxxo per transaction, the companies said.  The chain already partners with Amazon on a package pick-up program in some 3,000 Oxxo stores, aimed at serving shoppers who live in areas where home delivery is complicated.","481":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday launched an artificial intelligence-based tracking system to enforce social distancing at its offices and warehouses to help reduce any risk of contracting the new coronavirus among its workers.

Monitors set up in the company\u2019s warehouses will highlight workers keeping a safe distance in green circles, while workers who are closer will be highlighted in red circles, Amazon said.  The system, called Distance Assistant, uses camera footage in Amazon\u2019s buildings to also help identify high-traffic areas.  Amazon is also testing a wearable device that lights up and makes an audio alert when workers are too close to each other, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The device is to be piloted from Wednesday at a warehouse outside Seattle.  The company has also been hiring for roles like social distancing ambassadors and guardians, according to internal job postings reviewed by Reuters. Responsibilities of such hires range from frequent audits at warehouses to verifying that headcount does not exceed seating limits in break rooms.  Amazon did not immediately comment on the memo and postings.  AI CAMERA  Amazon, which will open source the technology behind its Distance Assistant system, is not the first company to turn to AI to track compliance with social distancing.  Several firms have told Reuters that AI camera-based software will be crucial to staying open, as it will allow them to show not only workers and customers, but also insurers and regulators, that they are monitoring and enforcing safe practices.  However, privacy activists have raised concerns about increasingly detailed tracking of people and have urged businesses to limit use of AI to the pandemic.  Amazon said on Tuesday that its tracking system is live at a handful of buildings, adding that it has plans to deploy hundreds of such units over the next few weeks.","482":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 32 U.S. states have a message for the nation\u2019s leading online platforms: You are not doing enough to stop price gouging amid the coronavirus crisis.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  In a letter sent on Wednesday to Amazon.com Inc, Walmart Inc, Facebook Inc and eBay Inc a bipartisan group of U.S. attorneys general outlined specific steps it wants the online platforms to take to end this practice.  Pennsylvania\u2019s Josh Shapiro is leading the effort along with attorneys general from the states of Connecticut, Vermont and New Mexico.  The steps include triggering price-gouging protections prior to emergency declarations in a state, being proactive in setting policies and restrictions on sellers instead of playing catch up and creating a \u201cfair pricing\u201d page where consumers can report incidents.  \u201cThey should use their data and analytics tools to stop price spikes, not play whack-a-mole when they find something on their platform...We are seeing them handle this on a case-by-case basis, which is really not practical,\u201d Shapiro told Reuters in an interview.  EBay said it is taking significant measures to block or remove items that make false health claims and is making efforts to ensure sellers on its platform follow local laws and company policies.  A Facebook spokesman said the company has removed ads and commercial listings for items like masks and hand sanitizers.  \u201cWhile enforcement is not perfect, we have put several automated detection mechanisms in place to block or remove this material from our platform,\u201d the spokesman said.  Walmart said it has implemented a \u201cprice freeze\u201d on critical items and that merchandising teams cannot change prices for items sold in stores. Similarly, it is monitoring prices online to make sure they remain reasonable.  Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.  Shapiro said his office has received approximately 2,900 tips of price gouging on online platforms and brick-and-mortar stores in the past eight to nine days and issued 90 cease-and-desist orders to sellers engaged in the activity. He said if these orders fail to deter merchants, his office can fine them up to $10,000 per violation.  The issue of price-gouging on online platforms has become a hot topic among law enforcement agencies, officials and lawmakers as panicked consumers look to stock up on essential items during the outbreak.  It also reflects the intense pressure online platforms are under to protect consumers while delivering goods during a pandemic.  Earlier this week, Amazon said it had removed 3,900 seller accounts involved in this activity. In early March, the company said it is working with state attorneys general to identify and prosecute third-party sellers.  A report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group released March 11, found nearly 1 in 6 of the products sold directly by Amazon had prices spike 50% higher than the 90-day average.  \u201cEven new protections by your company including heightened monitoring, bans on certain advertisements, and bans on selling certain items, have failed to remove unconscionably priced critical supplies,\u201d the letter said.","483":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is set to buy privately held Ring for more than $1 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, as the tech giant looks to expand into the home security space.

In a global coronavirus pandemic that has infected about 420,000 people and killed nearly 19,000, delivery drivers like Alvarado have become as essential as first responders, providing food and other basics for millions of people who are isolating themselves under government stay-home directives. But unlike traditional emergency workers, today\u2019s delivery drivers typically have little or no health insurance, sick pay or job security - and many say they lack even the basics needed to stay safe on the job.  Alvarado said the van he drove wasn\u2019t cleaned before or after his 10-hour shift, nor were the bins holding packages handled by warehouse workers and delivery drivers. Yet his company offered no gloves or masks, and only sporadically provided hand sanitizer. Under pressure to meet targets for delivery speed and volume, Alvarado and other drivers say they have little or no time to stop and wash their hands.  \u201cI\u2019m being exposed,\u201d said Alvarado, 38, who has delivered Amazon packages for three years. \u201cI would think that a company like Amazon that is filthy rich, doing great, not going anywhere anytime soon, would want to take care of its employees.\u201d  Alvarado doesn\u2019t actually work for Amazon. He works instead for Pacific Keys Logistics LLC, one of hundreds of companies that compete for coveted delivery contracts with the world\u2019s largest online retailer. The logistics company could not be reached for comment.  To keep the work, such contractors must meet Amazon\u2019s stringent performance standards under compensation schemes that effectively require the delivery companies to keep a tight rein on costs. Often, delivering Amazon packages constitutes their entire business.  Such arm\u2019s-length employment arrangements have insulated Amazon and other companies from liability and the costs of health insurance and other benefits. The business model - also employed by upstart app-based delivery firms such as Instacart, Shipt Inc and Postmates - has proven popular with investors by allowing the companies to avoid nitty-gritty costs like vehicle repair and crash liabilities.  The coronavirus pandemic has revealed the precarious environment that has been a daily reality for these workers as they now take on much greater risks in delivering essential goods, said David Weil, dean of Brandeis University\u2019s school of social policy and management and a former top Labor Department official in the Obama administration.  \u201cIt\u2019s totally laid bare how vulnerable they are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing there are millions of workers, who have no social safety net protections, who are now on the front lines of delivering food and delivering packages.\u201d  Contract drivers who deliver for Amazon in the United States are paid an hourly rate starting at $15, according to the company. In written responses to questions from Reuters, Amazon said it requires its delivery contractors to offer healthcare coverage, but didn\u2019t specify how much of the cost, if any, the firms cover.  Some drivers say they opt out of the health coverage because they can\u2019t afford the high out-of-pocket costs. Amazon said it required its contractors to offer drivers an unspecified amount of paid time off, but didn\u2019t say whether they were guaranteed sick pay. The company also has a program known as Amazon Flex, where independent contractors sign up for time slots to take groceries or packages to customers\u2019 doorsteps in their own cars.  Slideshow ( 15 images )  Amazon said it is taking \u201cextreme measures\u201d to protect all workers, including contracted drivers. Such efforts include \u201ctripling down on deep cleaning, procuring safety supplies that are available, and changing processes to ensure those in our buildings are keeping safe distances.\u201d  Amazon said it is giving its contracted delivery companies hand sanitizer and wipes to allow drivers to clean their vehicles. Asked about drivers\u2019 accounts that such supplies were unavailable, the company said some delivery sites \u201cmay on occasion see brief shortages.\u201d  App-based delivery firms have partnered with major retailers such as Walmart Inc WMT.N, Kroger Co KR.N and Target Corp TGT.N, which owns Shipt. Instacart and Shipt don\u2019t provide sick pay to drivers but both have said they will offer two weeks of financial assistance for those who test positive for COVID-19 or are placed into quarantine by health authorities.  Reuters interviewed more than a dozen delivery drivers for Amazon, Instacart, Postmates, Uber Eats, a food delivery service from ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N, and others, many of whom said they believe the companies did not provide proper protection or support given the risks they are taking.  The lack of sick pay and supplies can also pose a risk to consumers, especially if drivers show up to work sick or can\u2019t frequently wash their hands, said Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham\u2019s school of public health.  \u201cTouching gates, touching door knobs, those are all going to be potential points of exposure,\u201d she said. \u201cHand sanitizer itself is not enough.\u201d  Despite the risks, many drivers can\u2019t quit as the economy crashes amid relentless daily reports of rising death totals, business closures and government stay-home directives. As the crisis deepened last week, Amazon announced plans for 100,000 new workers to handle surging demand. But those openings will likely be easily filled with the masses of workers laid off from other hard-hit sectors such as restaurants because Amazon is among the few companies that is hiring. The company has temporarily boosted the pay for warehouse workers and contract drivers by $2 an hour in response to the pandemic, but the raises expire at the end of April.  \u201cIt\u2019s very sad because three weeks ago we were in a historically tight labor market,\u201d said Matthew Bidwell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School who focuses on short-term working arrangements. \u201cIt was forcing employers for the first time in a long time to offer more perks and more benefits. They no longer have that pressure.\u201d  Danny Gonzalez also delivers for Amazon in Orange County.

TREATED \u2018LIKE A LEPER\u2019  After the pandemic hit, Amazon announced it would set aside $25 million for contracted delivery drivers to apply for up to two weeks paid leave if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon. Other companies such as Uber, Postmates, Instacart and DoorDash have made similar pledges to help workers.  But the criteria make getting that paid time difficult, drivers said. Jonathan Perales, 25, a driver for Uber and Postmates in Texas, started coughing and feeling feverish earlier this month after picking up an ill passenger. The hospital he visited said he had symptoms of COVID-19, but declined to test him amid a national shortage of kits.  When he sought sick pay from Uber, the company told him he needed a positive coronavirus test or documentation from a medical professional ordering him to self-quarantine. No one at the hospital or the state health department was willing to submit such documentation to Uber on his behalf - which he said the company required - and another clinic refused to examine him when he showed up reporting coronavirus symptoms.  \u201cI was stuck in an impossible situation,\u201d Perales said. \u201cI was trying to get tested, and I was trying to seek financial aid. I was being treated like a leper.\u201d  Despite the illness, he needed the income to avoid an eviction, so he continued to work for Postmates for another two days. Uber shut down his account after he reported the symptoms, he said, which left him unable to pay his bill at the extended-stay motel where he had been living. He now lives in his car. Uber declined to comment on Perales\u2019 case but said in a statement that drivers\u2019 safety is \u201calways our priority.\u201d Postmates declined to comment.  DRIVING 45 MILES FOR HAND SANITIZER  Ron Spigelman delivers for Instacart. The company hasn\u2019t provided training or offered sanitation supplies or protective gear to wear in crowded stores, he said. He recently drove 45 miles to find hand sanitizer at a Dollar General in the countryside near Tulsa, Oklahoma.  He thinks drivers should have access to hand-washing stations. \u201cThat way we feel more protected,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think the customers would feel more protected as well.\u201d  In a statement, Instacart said it would soon distribute hand sanitizer and provide access to cleaning supplies in some stores. The company plans to add an additional 300,000 independent delivery contractors to handle skyrocketing demand.  Some drivers have stopped delivering as the crisis worsened.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The petition, filed with the Sacramento County Superior Court, accused Amazon of failing to adequately follow the state\u2019s information requests as part of an investigation into the company\u2019s coronavirus protocols and status of COVID-19 cases at its California facilities.  \u201cAmazon has delayed responding adequately to our investigative requests long enough,\u201d Becerra, President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s pick to serve as U.S. secretary of health and human services, said in the petition.  The subpoenas seek information about Amazon\u2019s sick-leave policies, sanitation measures and data about the spread of the virus at the company\u2019s California warehouses, the petition said.  Jodi Seth, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement the company has been cooperating with Becerra\u2019s office for months.  \u201cWe\u2019re puzzled by the attorney general\u2019s sudden rush to court. ... Their claims of noncompliance with their demands don\u2019t line up with the facts,\u201d Seth said.  Seth said the company has invested heavily in on-site testing for employees and personal protective equipment during the pandemic.  The attorney general\u2019s investigation into Amazon dates to the spring of this year, when news about working conditions at Amazon\u2019s in-state facilities raised concern, according to the petition.  The Guardian reported in May that Amazon had denied some requests for paid sick leave that worker activists alleged violated a California law giving two weeks\u2019 time to staff at facilities where food is stored, like Amazon\u2019s. The pro-worker group IE Amazonians Unite said it contacted state officials on the matter and that ultimately Amazon notified personnel about the paid leave opportunity.  Amazon has said it complied with state law. More than 19,000 of its U.S. staff have contracted COVID-19, Amazon said in October.","486":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O said on Monday it would hold its annual shopping event, Prime Day, on Oct. 13 and 14 as the e-commerce giant aims for an early kickstart to the holiday season.

Called Amazon Pharmacy, the new store lets customers price-compare as they buy drugs on the company\u2019s website or app. Shoppers can toggle at checkout between their co-pay and a non-insurance option, heavily discounted for members of its loyalty club Prime.  The move builds on the web retailer\u2019s 2018 acquisition of PillPack, which Amazon said will remain separate for customers needing pre-sorted doses of multiple drugs.  Over the past two years, Amazon has worked to secure more state licenses for shipping prescriptions across the country, which had been an obstacle to its expansion into the drug supply chain, according to analyst notes from Jefferies Equity Research.  The company founded as an online bookseller has disrupted industries including retail, computing and now potentially pharmaceuticals, drawing criticism of its size and power from labor groups and lawmakers along the way.  TJ Parker, PillPack\u2019s CEO and vice president of Amazon Pharmacy, said in a statement the retailer aimed to bring \u201ccustomer obsession to an industry that can be inconvenient and confusing.\u201d  Amazon faces entrenched competition from Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, CVS Health Corp, Walmart Inc, Rite Aid Corp , Kroger Co and others. Take-up of online ordering of drugs has been low, according to market research from J.D. Power.  Should Prime members prefer buying in person, Amazon said its discounts on non-insurance purchases apply at more than 50,000 brick-and-mortar pharmacies - including those run by rivals. Inside Rx, a subsidiary of Cigna Corp\u2019s Evernorth, administers that benefit, Amazon said.  Still, the pandemic may help bring drug orders online. E-commerce has surged this year as governments told people to stay home to stave off infections of COVID-19, and Prime members - more than 150 million globally - may be receptive to buying medication online now that it\u2019s from Amazon.  The company said Prime subscribers get up to 80% off generic and up to 40% off brand drugs when they pay without insurance, as well as two-day delivery.  Amazon\u2019s online pharmacy is not yet available in Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Hawaii, a spokeswoman said.

The purchase marks a U-turn for Berkshire, where Buffett has long praised the leadership of Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.  \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been a fan, and I\u2019ve been an idiot for not buying,\u201d Buffett told CNBC.  Buffett\u2019s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a similar request.  Shares of companies often rise when Berkshire reveals its support through new stakes, even when the purchases are believed or known to have been made by Combs or Weschler, who together invest about $26 billion.  The initial impetus of the portfolio managers has in the past heralded Buffett\u2019s eventual forays into some of their investments, often in big ways.  It was Combs who in 2012 began investing in industrial and aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Four years later, Berkshire completed its purchase of that company for $32 billion, in what remains Buffett\u2019s largest acquisition.  More recently, it was either Combs or Weschler who in 2016 began investing in iPhone maker Apple Inc.  But it was Buffett who ramped up that stake into Berkshire\u2019s largest common stock investment, more than 255 million shares, now worth roughly $53 billion.  The Amazon purchase adds an additional bond between Buffett and Bezos, whose companies teamed up last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co to form a new venture, Haven, to reduce employee healthcare costs.  Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and often buys stocks when buying whole companies appears too expensive.

The news the world\u2019s biggest online retailer had bought into one of Europe\u2019s fastest growing tech companies sent shockwaves through the sector, hitting shares in European rivals Just Eat, Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero.  The online giants are betting the takeaway market will expand as it branches out from fast, unhealthy meals to nutritious dishes, and that they have the scale to beat smaller rivals which are still largely sacrificing profits to grow.  Deliveroo founder and CEO Will Shu said the fundraising would enable the loss-making group to increase its reach, develop technology and pursue innovations such as expanding its own kitchens that can be rented to restaurants to meet demand.  Deliveroo did not give a figure for Amazon\u2019s contribution. It has now raised $1.53 billion to date, helped by existing investors T.

Shu said: \u201cAmazon has been an inspiration to me personally and to the company, and we look forward to working with such a customer-obsessed organization.\u201d  The former Morgan Stanley banker launched Deliveroo after moving to London from the United States and finding a lack of delivery options when working late. He says he still delivers meals once a week to understand the job of the rider.  Headquartered in London, Deliveroo uses 60,000 riders dressed in black and teal jackets to deliver meals from more than 80,000 restaurants and takeaway outlets in 14 countries including France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuwait.  Its \u201cFrank\u201d algorithm links the restaurants and riders with the customer, based on location, to cut the time of delivery.

It also competes with the loss-making Takeaway.com platform which is in 10 European countries and Israel, and Germany\u2019s Delivery Hero.

REUTERS\/Simon Dawson  Showing the fight underway in each market, Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero recently settled a costly struggle for supremacy in Germany, with Takeaway agreeing to buy its larger rival\u2019s businesses there for almost 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion).  In Britain, Deliveroo is locked in a battle with Uber Eats and the online platform Just Eat, and its riders are a common sight carrying delivery boxes emblazoned with its kangaroo logo.  Just Eat, which originally connected customers with local takeaway restaurants that provided their own delivery service, has grown rapidly since it launched in 2001 and listed in 2014.  But it has spooked investors this year with its need to constantly ramp up spending to meet demand. Just Eat had a market valuation of 4.6 billion pounds ($5.9 billion) prior to Friday, when its shares fell 10 percent in early trading.  Just Eat investor Cat Rock Capital said it was surprised Amazon had decided to partner with \u201ccash-burning\u201d Deliveroo, but that the deal showed the strategic interest in the sector and should spur the Just Eat board to find its own partner.  \u201cWe are confident that Just Eat\u2019s significant strategic value will be unlocked if the Board engages with the many potential strategic partners available to the Company.\u201d  Just Eat lags chart: tmsnrt.rs\/2LOtjqz  Other challenges facing the sector include the push by riders to have workers\u2019 rights, an issue that is facing all parts of the gig economy, where people work for multiple employers without fixed contracts.  Analysts said Amazon\u2019s firepower and distribution capabilities could have a huge impact on the market, and suggested the U.S. group might take over Deliveroo completely.  \u201cAmazon is known for its tolerance for losses, and its willingness to price-gouge in search of market share,\u201d Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.  Doug Gurr, Amazon UK country manager, said Deliveroo was an innovative company and the U.S group was excited to see what it did next.  Amazon currently sells food in Britain through its Amazon Fresh, Amazon Pantry and Amazon Prime Now services and has a wholesale deal with supermarket Morrisons. But, according to market researchers Kantar Worldpanel, its UK grocery market share is still less than 1 percent.  It has previously tried and failed to run a restaurant delivery service in Britain.","503":"FILE PHOTO: Staff chat at the front desk of the Amazon office in the Manhattan borough of New York, New York, U.S., May 1, 2019.

It is undercutting Amazon sellers\u2019 fees to attract vendors but has had mixed results, six sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The logo of AliExpress is seen at Alibaba Expansion office at the Alibaba company's headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, November 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  A flood of small businesses have joined its European platform, AliExpress, in recent months but some larger brands are holding back, according to the sources.  AliExpress has approached well-known brands including Mango, Benetton and Spanish fashion group Tendam, owner of Cortefiel, to appear on the site with limited success, according to five sources involved in the approaches who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential.  Some of the brands did not feel the site, whose fashion offerings include an imitation leather miniskirt for about $18 and an acrylic batwing sweater for $14, was the right showcase for their products, sources said.  A senior executive at one large fashion company, which turned down AliExpress\u2019s approaches in Europe, said its brand needed to be in an \u201caspirational environment\u201d. Another described the AliExpress platform as \u201ca work in progress\u201d.  However the head of AliExpress, Wang Mingqiang, told Reuters in an interview at Alibaba\u2019s headquarters in Hangzhou, that foreign brands needed time to understand the platform.  With space to design their own stores within the platform, brands can build their own homepage, with pictures and video, to create the feel they want, he added.  Both Benetton and Tendam declined to comment officially on whether they were approached. Neither brand sells on AliExpress but they do sell on Amazon. Mango said it did not sell on AliExpress with no further comment. It does not sell on Amazon AMZN.O.  An AliExpress spokeswoman did not comment on whether the company had approached these brands or others.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cWe are continuously exploring opportunities to work with different partners and committed to acting as a trusted partner for both consumers and sellers,\u201d the company said.  Alibaba has hitherto focused on selling inexpensive Chinese products overseas through its AliExpress platform, such as $3 USB cables and $2 crystal earrings, curbing its appeal to a wider audience.  But in the past six months it has started a drive to open up the platform to local vendors and brands as its seeks to replicate a highly profitable model of virtual malls that has seen it swallow more than half of online sales in China.  \u201cOverseas sellers have a better understanding of local users, their products have better designs as they are closer to local users,\u201d said Wang.  MONTHLY FEES WAIVED  The company is initially targeting Spain and Italy, plus the Europe-Asia gateway nations of Russia and Turkey, among its top markets under the previous, first-phase business model launched in 2010.  Spain, a big Western country with strong local brands, is the kind of market Alibaba needs to win over if it is to meet CEO Daniel Zhang\u2019s target to more than double its customer base to 2 billion by 2036 despite a stuttering Chinese economy.  Its progress there illustrates its strategy, and the obstacles it could encounter, as it plots global expansion.  AliExpress has waived monthly rates for sellers in Spain to attract their business while commissions for goods sold are set at 5% to 8%, according to a senior source close to the company.  By comparison, it costs 39 euros per month plus sales tax to sell on Amazon, plus a commission for every object sold of 7% to 15%, with some items like jewelry and Amazon device accessories commanding higher rates, an Amazon spokeswoman said.  Amazon declined to comment on AliExpress\u2019s move to open its platform to local sellers. The U.S. company is the largest online shopping marketplace in its five main European markets: Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, according to e-commerce analyst Marketplace Pulse.  Thousands of small businesses have signed up to register on AliExpress in Spain since it was opened up to local sellers in 2019, an AliExpress spokeswoman said.  She declined to be more specific, but that would compare favorably with established Amazon, which said more than 8,000 small Spanish businesses sold on its platform in 2018.  In one of AliExpress\u2019s most high-profile signings so far, Spanish department store El Corte Ingles said in June it would boost its presence on the platform to seven fashion lines.

The company sells around 12 times more in volume on Amazon than AliExpress, said Managing Director Alvaro Dominguez.  \u201cI think that AliExpress has been associated for a long time with Chinese products - it\u2019s a question of time but I think they are doing all that is possible to get traffic and visibility.\u201d","508":"Slideshow ( 6 images )  MADRID (Reuters) - Amazon on Wednesday opened its first pop-up store in Spain in an old building in one of Madrid\u2019s prime shopping districts styled as a house with everything for sale, from electronic goods to video games to clothing.

The team had been building computer programs since 2014 to review job applicants\u2019 resumes with the aim of mechanizing the search for top talent, five people familiar with the effort told Reuters.  Automation has been key to Amazon\u2019s e-commerce dominance, be it inside warehouses or driving pricing decisions. The company\u2019s experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said.  \u201cEveryone wanted this holy grail,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cThey literally wanted it to be an engine where I\u2019m going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we\u2019ll hire those.\u201d  But by 2015, the company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way.  That is because Amazon\u2019s computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.  In effect, Amazon\u2019s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word \u201cwomen\u2019s,\u201d as in \u201cwomen\u2019s chess club captain.\u201d And it downgraded graduates of two all-women\u2019s colleges, according to people familiar with the matter. They did not specify the names of the schools.  Amazon edited the programs to make them neutral to these particular terms. But that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory, the people said.  The Seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amazon\u2019s recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires, but never relied solely on those rankings, they said.  Amazon declined to comment on the technology\u2019s challenges, but said the tool \u201cwas never used by Amazon recruiters to evaluate candidates.\u201d The company did not elaborate further. It did not dispute that recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the recruiting engine.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  The company's experiment, which Reuters is first to report, offers a case study in the limitations of machine learning. It also serves as a lesson to the growing list of large companies including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N that are looking to automate portions of the hiring process.  Some 55 percent of U.S. human resources managers said artificial intelligence, or AI, would be a regular part of their work within the next five years, according to a 2017 survey by talent software firm CareerBuilder.  Employers have long dreamed of harnessing technology to widen the hiring net and reduce reliance on subjective opinions of human recruiters. But computer scientists such as Nihar Shah, who teaches machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, say there is still much work to do.  \u201cHow to ensure that the algorithm is fair, how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable - that\u2019s still quite far off,\u201d he said.  MASCULINE LANGUAGE  Amazon\u2019s experiment began at a pivotal moment for the world\u2019s largest online retailer. Machine learning was gaining traction in the technology world, thanks to a surge in low-cost computing power. And Amazon\u2019s Human Resources department was about to embark on a hiring spree: Since June 2015, the company\u2019s global headcount has more than tripled to 575,700 workers, regulatory filings show.  So it set up a team in Amazon\u2019s Edinburgh engineering hub that grew to around a dozen people. Their goal was to develop AI that could rapidly crawl the web and spot candidates worth recruiting, the people familiar with the matter said.  The group created 500 computer models focused on specific job functions and locations. They taught each to recognize some 50,000 terms that showed up on past candidates\u2019 resumes. The algorithms learned to assign little significance to skills that were common across IT applicants, such as the ability to write various computer codes, the people said.  Instead, the technology favored candidates who described themselves using verbs more commonly found on male engineers\u2019 resumes, such as \u201cexecuted\u201d and \u201ccaptured,\u201d one person said.  Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models\u2019 judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said. With the technology returning results almost at random, Amazon shut down the project, they said.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  THE PROBLEM, OR THE CURE?  Other companies are forging ahead, underscoring the eagerness of employers to harness AI for hiring.  Kevin Parker, chief executive of HireVue, a startup near Salt Lake City, said automation is helping firms look beyond the same recruiting networks upon which they have long relied. His firm analyzes candidates\u2019 speech and facial expressions in video interviews to reduce reliance on resumes.  \"You weren\u2019t going back to the same old places; you weren\u2019t going back to just Ivy League schools,\" Parker said.

The 10,600 permanent and temporary staff employed at the warehouses will progressively return to work by June 2, according to an agreement signed by five French unions last week and seen by Reuters.  During a first phase, starting on Tuesday and ending next Monday, a maximum of 50% of staff will be allowed to work, on a voluntary basis. As of Monday afternoon, about 30% of workers had volunteered to resume work on Tuesday, the three union officials said.  A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment on the number of employees set to return to work on Tuesday.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re interested in is that we can start over on a sound and sustainable basis,\u201d she said.  Under the deal, voluntary workers will get a bonus of 2 euros per hour until June 2. During that same period, employees who stay at home will still receive their full salary.  Amazon also agreed to reduce the working day by 15 minutes. That will create a delay of about 30 minutes between the morning and night shifts, reducing numbers in changing rooms and at entrance gates.  The agreement also lifts restrictions on what kind of products Amazon can send to clients across France.  The court had ruled Amazon should restrict deliveries to IT products, health items, food and pet food while the company reviewed its coronavirus-related health policies.  An external firm, Progexa, has been hired to review the health measures implemented by Amazon, the agreement said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve buried the hatchet,\u201d said SUD union leader Laurent Degous\u00e9e, who led the lawsuit against Amazon.

The threat pulled attention back to the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies that has kept global financial markets on tenterhooks for nearly two years.  Also weighing on sentiment was a 2.6% fall in Apple Inc shares in premarket trading after the company said it was impossible to forecast overall results for the current quarter, even as it reported upbeat quarterly results.  Amazon.com Inc shares tumbled 5% after the company said it could post its first quarterly loss in five years as it was spending at least $4 billion in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The deal would give Amazon and GM minority stakes in Rivian, the sources said. It would be a major boost for the Plymouth, Michigan-based startup, which aspires to be the first carmaker to the U.S. consumer market with an electric pickup.  If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as this month, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is always a chance that deal talks fall through, the sources cautioned.  \u201cWe admire Rivian\u2019s contribution to a future of zero emissions and an all-electric future,\u201d GM said in an emailed statement, declining to specifically comment on any talks with Rivian.  Amazon and Rivian declined comment.  The Rivian deal would come as its much larger electric car manufacturing rival, Tesla Inc, struggles to stabilize production and deliver consistent profits as it rolls out its flagship Model 3 sedan.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors last August that an electric pickup is \u201cprobably my personal favorite for the next product\u201d from the company, though he has spoken only in general about a potential launch, saying that it would happen \u201cright after\u201d Tesla\u2019s Model Y, which the company has targeted to start production in 2020.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u2018SKATEBOARD\u2019 PLATFORM  Rivian intends to begin selling its R1T, the pickup it debuted in November, in the fall of 2020. The company was founded in 2009 by CEO R.J. Scaringe.  Scaringe has described the Rivian vehicle\u2019s platform as a \u201cskateboard\u201d that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower center of gravity.  He has also said the company plans to partner with outside firms to develop advanced self-driving technology, rather than try to do so on its own.  Big automakers, including GM, have not jumped into the market for electric pickups thus far. GM CEO Mary Barra has said it has given a \u201ctiny bit\u201d of thought to developing all-electric pickups.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker is counting on profit from sales of conventional large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America to fund its electrification push. GM said last November it was doubling resources allocated to developing electric and self-driving vehicles, as part of a significant restructuring that included ending production at five North American plants.  GM last month announced a strategy to make its luxury Cadillac its lead electric vehicle brand, revealing it would be the first vehicle built on the Detroit automaker\u2019s \u201cBEV3\u201d platform to challenge Tesla. GM has said one of the first fully electric Cadillac models using the new platform would hit the market around 2022.  Amazon has also invested in self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation Inc, in a $530 million funding round announced last week. The world\u2019s largest online retailer has steadily increased its logistics footprint, building warehouses around the world and inking deals with Mercedes as well as cargo airlines to help with delivery.  Rivian\u2019s existing financial backers include Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co (ALJ), Sumitomo Corp of Americas and Standard Chartered Bank.

FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  A court in New Delhi blocked Future Group\u2019s sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the deal.  The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world\u2019s richest men: Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Reliance\u2019s Mukesh Ambani.  Amazon had argued that Future breached contracts by selling retail assets to Reliance. The court sided with the U.S. firm, saying an earlier order from an arbitrator that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold was valid.  Future - which had argued the arbitrator\u2019s order was not binding - on Wednesday filed a challenge against the court\u2019s ruling, saying the company\u2019s creditors would be at \u201csignificant risk\u201d if the Reliance deal fails.  Other than an estimated 300 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) hit to bank loans and debentures, the deal\u2019s failure would also impact livelihoods of 50,000 employees and 6,000 small- and medium-sized vendors, it said.  \u201cIt is inevitable that FRL (Future Retail) will go into liquidation ... The magnitude of damage that may be caused to the public at large is unimaginable,\u201d Future said the court filing, seen by Reuters.  The appeal is set to be heard on Thursday before a bigger two-judge bench in New Delhi.  Future, India\u2019s second-largest retailer with more than 1,700 stores, and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Future Retail dropped 5% in early trading on Wednesday. Reliance Industries fell as much as 1.2%, but recovered later.  The Delhi court on Tuesday asked Indian authorities to maintain status quo on the transaction, effectively putting the Future-Reliance deal on hold.  Indian stock exchanges and the country\u2019s antitrust watchdog had already cleared the deal, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.  Future in its appeal said Tuesday\u2019s Delhi court order \u201crendered stillborn\u201d the approvals.  \u201cThe sole and sheer intent\u201d of Amazon was to prevent Reliance - which is also venturing into e-commerce - from acquiring Future\u2019s assets, the Indian firm argued in the filing.  Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of Future\u2019s retail assets itself, has argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list, including Reliance.","531":"FILE PHOTO: An outside view of an Amazon logistics centre in Mannheim, Germany, September 17, 2019.

The industry\u2019s coziness with the Democratic Party, which dates back through several elections, has critics of their market dominance worried.  Sally Hubbard, who has worked with Democratic lawmakers in the past and currently focuses on monopoly power of tech companies at Washington-based Open Markets Institute, does not want a Biden victory to translate into a repeat of what was widely viewed as President Barack Obama\u2019s hands off approach to tech.  \u201cAre we going to see the same thing with a Biden administration?\u201d she asked, adding there will be a significant amount of pressure from anti-monopoly groups and the progressive wing of the Democratic party to hold the companies accountable.

Biden, for his part, has criticized large internet companies during interviews and campaign events. He has urged the revocation of a key legal shield protecting internet companies from liability over user-generated content. He has also expressed concern over market concentration and privacy issues in the technology industry; criticized Amazon for not paying taxes; and expressed displeasure with Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg.

He was Vice President Biden\u2019s communications director for the first two years of the Obama administration.  Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky is a top fundraiser for Biden, also known as a bundler who as individuals have raised more than $25,000. Bundlers are sometimes rewarded with plum positions in their beneficiary\u2019s administration, such as key jobs in federal agencies and influential advisory commissions. Zapolsky has also directly contributed a little over $250,000 to different funds supporting Biden\u2019s presidency, according to campaign finance records. Zapolsky did not comment.  Meanwhile the Biden campaign\u2019s transition team and working groups have added at least eight people who worked for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple and others with ties to these companies.  A senior policy counsel for a progressive Senate Democrat, who did not wish to be named, said Big Tech\u2019s closeness with the Biden campaign is worrying. The battle for the left wing of the Democratic party on this issue will be on whether they can get crucial appointments in the administration and less about moving Biden toward progressive options, the aide added.  Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a close ally of Trump and a vocal critic of large tech companies, said the progressives may get a \u201crhetorical nod in their direction now and then,\u201d but the Biden campaign\u2019s fundraising shows the progressives will struggle. \u201cFor Amazon in particular to be featured at a political convention is really, really worrisome,\u201d Hawley told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s taking their lobbying to a whole new level.\u201d  To be sure, many large technology companies - their employees, PAC\u2019s or PAC members - have been top contributors to Democratic presidential campaigns in the past three election cycles, with one notable exception: Amazon. However, contributions from the Seattle-based retailer\u2019s employees have now made Amazon the fifth largest contributor to the Democratic nominee\u2019s candidate campaign committee, according to data from OpenSecrets and campaign finance records. Large technology companies are entirely missing from the Trump campaign committee\u2019s top 20 contributors list.  Donations from senior Amazon executives to the Biden campaign during the primaries were second only to Microsoft, according to data from the Revolving Door Project, which is part of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.  \u201cI think all the fundraising we are seeing is probably going to buy them (Amazon) access, but in terms of policy results, I think it\u2019s going to buy them very little,\u201d said an advisor on tech policy to the Biden campaign, who did not wish to be named. \u201cThere is a lot of collective outrage against tech in Washington these days, and they simply cannot fly under the radar.\u201d","538":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India ordered an investigation of Amazon.com Inc and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart on Monday over alleged violations of competition law in the latest setback for U.S. e-commerce giants operating in the country.

The complaint against the two companies was filed by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, a group representing small- and medium-sized businesses. They alleged that several of Amazon and Flipkart\u2019s preferred sellers were affiliated with, or controlled by, the companies themselves, either directly or indirectly.  In its 11-page order, the CCI noted four alleged anti-competitive practices: exclusive launch of mobile phones by the e-commerce firms, promoting preferred sellers on their websites, deep discounting practices and prioritising some seller listings over others.  \u201cExclusive launch (of mobile phones) coupled with preferential treatment to a few sellers and the discounting practices create an ecosystem that may lead to an appreciable adverse effect on competition,\u201d the order said.  The CCI said its investigation unit should complete the probe within 60 days, but typically such cases have taken far longer.  Walmart in 2018 invested $16 billion to buy a majority stake in India\u2019s Flipkart, its biggest ever deal.  The CCI probe will be the latest setback for the U.S. companies that were last year hit with more stringent foreign investment rules.  Some of the allegations reviewed by the CCI have been long levelled against both companies.  Indian brick-and-mortar traders allege Amazon and Flipkart violate the country\u2019s foreign investment rules and burn billions of dollars to offer steep discounts that hurt smaller traders. The two companies say they are in compliance with all rules.

In the United States, Amazon moved into online grocery sales through a $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market last year. It offers two-hour delivery and lets shoppers pick up Amazon products from Whole Foods stores.  Walmart, meanwhile, aims to deliver groceries to over 40 percent of U.S. households by year\u2019s end.  The company plans to accelerate its online grocery business in Mexico as well, Walmart International\u2019s Chief Executive Judith McKenna said earlier this year.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Amazon, which is aggressively expanding into self-driving technology, announced June 26 it had agreed to acquire the Silicon Valley company, which was founded on an ambitious effort to design a fully autonomous vehicle from scratch rather than retrofitting existing cars for self-driving.  Amazon will pay $1.3 billion in cash for the takeover, which the parties hope to close by September, according to deal documents seen by Reuters.  Zoox had been valued at $3.2 billion in 2018, according to data from PitchBook. The Amazon deal documents show Zoox was burning more than $30 million each month in early 2020 and projected it would run out of cash by July. Amazon had the option to lend Zoox $30 million on signing the agreement in June, with the option for further loans before the deal closes.  Amazon and Zoox did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Attempts to wrest Zoox or its talent away from Amazon started before the two even reached a definitive agreement.  After Zoox signed an exclusive agreement to negotiate with Amazon but before they reached a deal, a third party stepped in to offer $1.05 billion, according to the deal documents.  The offer came from Cruise, the self-driving company backed in part by General Motors Co GM.N, Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Zoox did not respond to the offer. Reuters reported June 4 that the founder of Cruise approached Zoox engineers with job offers.  Technology news publication The Information reported June 30 that two senior Zoox engineers, James Philbin and Marc Wimmershoff, joined Waymo, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O self-driving unit. Philbin and Wimmershoff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Amazon-Zoox deal documents describe two lists of \u201ckey employees.\u201d All on the first list must take Amazon jobs for the deal to close, and at least 19 from the second list must stay. Amazon plans to offer jobs to three schedules of other Zoox employees, requiring that 90% of the first two and 88% of the third accept jobs to close the deal.  Reuters could not determine which employees were specified.  Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson will receive 40% of his deal compensation over three years rather than at the closing. Levinson owns 49 million of the 131.4 million common shares of Zoox, a roughly 37% stake. Zoox Chief Executive Aicha Evans got a $3.4 million cash bonus, according to the documents.  The deal rewards Zoox \u201ccompany service providers\u201d who had joined by May 18 with a $125 million cash \u201ctransaction bonus pool\u201d paid out in proportion to their shares. Amazon provided 30% of the funding for the pool, on top of the $100 million pool of Amazon restricted stock units it will create for Zoox employees who stay with Amazon after the deal, the documents show.  The rewards for current Zoox employees who stay on - even those who joined recently - far outstrip those of longtime former employees with only common shares or those employees who leave before the close.

Jeff Bezos, widely viewed as a management guru whose long-term focus has been essential to Amazon\u2019s meteoric stock rise, will retain company control.

Amazon\u2019s third-quarter sales lagged estimates as well. Analysts said international results were disappointing and online competition was increasing. The company blamed accounting changes and cautioned that it was being conservative with its outlook.  For years, Amazon has made expensive bets on new technology and programs, like its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 to storm the U.S. grocery industry. That has resulted in rollercoaster profits in the past, but revenue has largely grown at a breakneck pace as consumers shifted shopping online and away from brick-and-mortar stores.  \u201cWeak revenue growth stuck out like a sore thumb,\u201d said George Salmon, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re trading on 70 times expected earnings, it doesn\u2019t take much to jolt the share price.\u201d  Amazon\u2019s more subdued expectations for this year\u2019s holiday shopping season, which runs from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday in late November through New Year\u2019s, was a particular surprise. It forecast that fourth-quarter sales will rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, or up to $72.5 billion, while analysts were expecting $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  That would be Amazon\u2019s lowest quarterly sales growth since at least the start of 2016. In the last four quarters, sales increased between 29 percent and 43 percent.  Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said no fundamentals had changed, just some holiday timing in India and accounting differences.  \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a strong holiday season, so there\u2019s no message in our forward guidance against that,\u201d he said on a conference call with media. \u201cWe have everything ready to roll.\u201d  The company moved the recording of $300 million in Prime subscription revenue from the fourth quarter to earlier periods in the year, he said. In addition, Amazon faces a tougher year-over-year comparison because the Whole Foods deal closed in the third quarter of 2017, and the different timing of the holiday Diwali affected sales patterns, he said.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cAmazon saw a meaningful slowdown in their international division. They had been hitting on all cylinders so this is something investors weren\u2019t ready for,\u201d Chaim Siegel, analyst at Elazar Advisors, said.  Amazon forecast fourth-quarter operating income between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion, below the $3.87 billion expected by analysts, according to FactSet.  Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said the results reflected a shifting landscape with retailers holding their own against Amazon.  \"Others are now getting better at nibbling away at its dominance,\" he said, citing Walmart WMT.N, Target TFT.N and Macy's M.N.  PROFITS AND THIRD-PARTY GOODS  Despite slower sales growth, Amazon has steadily become more profitable.  Third-quarter net income rose to $2.88 billion, or $5.75 per share, from $256 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier.  Up to 53 percent of goods sold on Amazon now come from third-party merchants, the company said on Thursday, marking a steady shift away from traditional retail where Amazon is the seller of a product.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  That means the company is collecting less revenue but taking in a lucrative cut of others\u2019 sales - all the more profitable when merchants pay Amazon to handle their shipping. Seller services grew 31 percent to $10.4 billion in the third quarter.  \u201cThey\u2019re indifferent if they sell us their own merchandise or third-party merchandise, so they shouldn\u2019t be punished for the latter,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.  More sellers are looking to Amazon to market their products, too - another highly profitable business. Amazon appeals to advertisers because individuals generally are using the site to shop, unlike users browsing Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, the ads sales leader, to find general information or rival Facebook Inc FB.O to see updates from their friends.  Amazon said revenue from the category and some other items grew 122 percent to $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Analysts were expecting $2.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Olsavsky, the CFO, also said the company is operating more efficiently, hiring less than in the past and adding less warehousing space.  \u201cWe\u2019ve really been able to cut back in a number of key areas,\u201d Olsavsky told reporters, citing cost improvements for cloud unit Amazon Web Services as well.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The letter, addressed to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, adds to public scrutiny Amazon is facing over the dismissal, at a time when the company is racing to update safety protocols, keep warehouses open and ship essential goods to shoppers who are shut indoors.  Amazon employee Christian Smalls came to the company\u2019s Staten Island, New York, warehouse on March 30 for a small protest he helped organize, which in part called for the site\u2019s closure. Workers feared infection after a colleague had fallen ill to the novel coronavirus, cases of which have now been reported among staff at more than 50 Amazon warehouses, according to the New York Times.  The virus has infected more than 1.4 million people globally.  Amazon said it fired Smalls, who had contact with the virus patient, after he violated a paid quarantine to join the protest. The dismissal prompted New York City\u2019s mayor to announce a probe and the state\u2019s attorney general to demand a U.S. labor board investigation.  In Wednesday\u2019s letter, senators led by Cory Booker of New Jersey questioned the order of events. They cited a media report suggesting that Smalls\u2019 two-week quarantine may have come after Smalls \u201chad begun organizing their colleagues to demand more workplace transparency and stronger workplace protections.\u201d The quarantine should have ended five days before the protest based on a possible March 11 exposure, the letter said, citing the media report.  \u201cThe right to organize is a bedrock of our economy, responsible for many of the greatest advances achieved by workers over generations,\u201d the letter said.  Amazon said Smalls\u2019 contact with the diagnosed worker was well after the 11th and that on March 28 he was told to go into quarantine.  The company said it fired Smalls because he put others\u2019 health at risk, not because he organized a protest.  Amazon said it is taking \u201cextreme\u201d measures to keep staff safe while shipping goods to U.S. households, the vast majority of which are under a stay-at-home order. On top of site cleaning, it is requiring temperature checks and social distancing, and is making masks available at all U.S. and European warehouses, the company said.  Leaked notes from an Amazon executive meeting have added to blowback over the firing. In the notes, Amazon\u2019s general counsel described Smalls as \u201cnot smart, or articulate.\u201d  He later issued a statement saying frustration over the health risks created by Smalls had clouded his judgment.  The other signatories to the senators\u2019 letter, which referenced the leaked notes, were Robert Menendez, Sherrod Brown, Richard Blumenthal and Kirsten Gillibrand.","556":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com's AMZN.O stock market value reached $900 billion on Wednesday for the first time, marking a major milestone in its 21-year trajectory as a publicly listed company and threatening to dislodge Apple AAPL.O as Wall Street's most valuable jewel.  After Jeff Bezos founded the online book-selling company in his garage in 1994, Amazon survived the dot-com crisis and then expanded across the retail industry, altering how consumers buy products and setting off a Darwinian struggle among brick-and-mortar stores.  After announcing on Wednesday that it sold more than $100 million products during its annual Prime Day sale, the Seattle, Washington company\u2019s stock briefly touched $1,858.88, giving Amazon a stock market value of $902 billion. It later reversed, trading down 0.16 percent for the session.  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged more than 57 percent in 2018, bringing its increase to over 123,000 percent since it listed on the Nasdaq in 1997. An investor who bought 1 share of Amazon for $18 in the IPO would now have an investment worth more than $22,200, including three stock splits in the 1990s.  Amazon, video streaming service Netflix NFLX.O and a handful of heavyweight technology companies have fueled Wall Street's rally in recent years and they remain key parts of portfolio managers' portfolios.  Apple replaced Exxon Mobil XOM.N in late 2011 as the U.S. company with the largest stock market value. The Silicon Valley company's shares have risen 12 percent in 2018, bringing its stock market value to $935 billion.  To view a graphic on Amazon catching up with Apple, click: reut.rs\/2Jz2SyR  The calculations for Apple and Amazon\u2019s market capitalizations are based on the number of shares outstanding in their March-quarter reports. Amazon has increased its share count by over 1 million shares per quarter in recent years, and if it continued that in the June quarter, its stock market value may already have exceeded $900 billion.  Amazon reports its results on July 26 and Apple, which has been reducing its share count through buybacks, reports its June-quarter results on July 31.  As Amazon expands into grocery retail through its acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, and as more businesses move their IT departments onto the cloud, its stock price has been red hot, recently trading at 111 times expected earnings, compared to more-profitable - but slower growing - Apple\u2019s valuation of 15 times earnings.

The panel, which is investigating potential breaches of antitrust law by big technology companies, also made public the responses from Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Apple Inc.  Data on individual sellers is not used to improve Amazon\u2019s business, the company said, and its teams do not use seller data to launch, source or price private label products, which number about 158,000.  Amazon\u2019s response offers a glimpse into how data from sellers, who compete with Amazon\u2019s retail business, informs the Seattle-based company\u2019s decisions. Merchants on Amazon\u2019s platform have long worried that the world\u2019s largest online retailer would use information at its disposal to undercut them.  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

In October, the committee said it expected a final report on its probe by the \u201cfirst part\u201d of next year.  Amazon also said it may ask third-party merchants to lower prices on Amazon.com when it finds the sellers asking for less on a competing website.  Asked how it ranks shopping results on its website, Amazon said its algorithm does not consider factors such as whether it has a competing private label brand, if a competing third-party seller has purchased ads, or if the seller is enrolled in Amazon\u2019s logistics program.  It instead considers a product\u2019s availability, price and how frequently it was purchased.  Amazon did not offer details on several items requested by the subcommittee. These include how many of its private label products are sold at cost or below cost, how much revenue and profit Amazon makes from selling private brands, and its pricing rationale for third-party marketplace services.","558":"The 5th Circuit Court of Appeal on Thursday heard arguments over whether Amazon.com Inc can be held liable under Texas law for a defective product listed by a third-party seller on its website, the latest in a line of similar cases that have yielded mixed results for the e-commerce giant.

Amazon\u2019s French warehouses, which employ about 10,000 people on permanent and interim contracts, have been shut since April 16 after court rulings ordered the company to limit deliveries to a list of essential goods during the coronavirus pandemic or face fines.  The Seattle-based group said it would keep paying its French employees their full salary during the temporary warehouse closures, but it also filed a formal request last week to benefit from the state scheme under which the government pledges to pay 70% of the gross salary of workers placed on furlough during the pandemic.  \u201cThe request... has been rejected because the closure of the sites is the consequence of a court ruling and not of a drop in activity,\u201d the French labour ministry said on Monday.

Jay Carney, the company\u2019s top policy executive, told New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that the world\u2019s biggest online retailer would not go ahead with plans to invest $2.5 billion to build a second head office in the New York City borough of Queens.  Carney, a former press secretary for President Barack Obama, told New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio the same shortly after.  Abruptly scuttling its Big Apple plans blindsided Amazon\u2019s allies and opponents alike. The company said the decision came together only in the last 48 hours, made by its senior leadership team and Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, chief executive and the richest person in the world.  Yet by some measures the decision was months in the making, as community opposition signaled to the company that it was not entirely welcome.  Seattle-based Amazon captivated elected officials across North America in September 2017 when it announced it would create more than 50,000 jobs in a second headquarters dubbed HQ2. Cities and states vied desperately for the economic stimulus, with New Jersey offering $7 billion in potential credits and the mayor of an Atlanta suburb promising to make Bezos mayor for life of a new city called \u201cAmazon.\u201d  A backlash began in earnest when Amazon announced two winners to split the offices last November: Arlington, Virginia, and New York\u2019s Long Island City neighborhood, with New York offering incentives worth $1.53 billion to Amazon. The company could apply for $900 million more, too.  New York State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said that day that it was \u201cunfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check\u201d to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies considering the city\u2019s crumbling subways and overcrowded schools.  City Council meetings in December and January showed Amazon executives who showed up the stern opposition they could expect from some elected officials and labor organizers.  Protesters interrupted the meetings. A television report showed people unfurling signs saying, \u201cAmazon delivers lies,\u201d and \u201cAmazon fuels ICE deportations\u201d - a reference to the company\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. Department in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Amazon felt that a small number of local and state officials had no desire to collaborate on a path forward, the company later said, despite what it said was strong popular support for its project.  RELATIVELY PAINLESS EXIT  Tension ratcheted up earlier this month, when Gianaris was nominated to a state panel set to vote in 2020 on whether to approve the financial terms for Amazon.  Days later, Amazon executives weighed the pros and cons of whether to follow through with its New York headquarters, two people briefed on talks inside the company said. Concerned that Amazon could be in limbo for more than a year ahead of the state panel\u2019s vote, the growing consensus within the company was that it did not make sense to move ahead in the face of persistent opposition with a headquarters in New York City, where it already has 5,000 employees.  Amazon had no binding legal contracts to acquire or lease the land for the project. It could exit with relatively little pain, the people said.  Company officials also concluded Amazon could shift the jobs that would have been created in New York to other corporate centers it has across the United States, from the San Francisco Bay Area to Boston. Reopening talks with former HQ2 contestants did not make sense, the people said.  Gianaris blamed Amazon for the reversal.  \u201cAmazon never showed willingness to look seriously at the concerns that were raised,\u201d he said.  Still, up to the moment of the announcement, there were signs that the parties could work together.  One union leader said he and other labor organizers met on Wednesday with Cuomo and four Amazon officials, including Brian Huseman, its vice president of public policy.  \u201cWe had such a productive meeting yesterday. Everyone left happy,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, head of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.  The group is trying to organize workers at an Amazon facility in Staten Island, another New York City borough, despite the company\u2019s past opposition to unionization.  \u201cIt was a complete surprise that they would say they look forward to working with us, and we talked about next steps, and then they call it all off the next morning,\u201d said Appelbaum.","574":"Jan 31 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Thursday forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, as it faces new regulatory hurdles in India and a slowdown in e-commerce sales in Europe.

Jackson and other celebrities will voice speech for the company's virtual assistant Alexa, while the voice aid will also be built into a new wearable line of earbuds, eyeglasses and a ring.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The news, along with announcements of a new range of voice-controlled Echo speakers, a multilingual mode for Alexa and an additional privacy feature for deleting voice recordings regularly, underscores the investment the world's largest online retailer is putting into voice-controlled computing, a new area of technology in which it is competing against Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Assistant and Apple Inc's AAPL.O Siri.  Amazon\u2019s celebrity voice feature will cost $0.99, Senior Vice President David Limp said at an event in Seattle. Jackson\u2019s is the only celebrity voice Amazon has disclosed so far.  In a new push, the company introduced a lineup of wearables, including the Echo Frames, eyeglasses that allow customers to communicate with Alexa as they walk around.  Limp said the frames are designed so that only those wearing them can hear Alexa talk. They do not include a visual display, distinguishing them from Google Glass, which is marketed toward enterprise customers.  The new \u201cEcho Buds\u201d come with noise reduction technology from Bose, Limp said.  Since Amazon announced its first Echo speaker in 2014, shoppers have purchased more than 100 million devices that come with Alexa, including microwaves, vacuum cleaners and even cars.  That has given the company the biggest market share for voice speakers among its rivals, according to research firm eMarketer.  Yet customers have been slow to adopt the growing range of tasks that Alexa can perform, often sticking to basic hands-free functions like directing the assistant to play music, set cooking timers or report the weather.  That may have underscored Amazon\u2019s calculus for courting celebrities to encourage users to turn to Alexa for a wider range of interactions.  The company on Wednesday also announced a deal with the Food Network television channel under which users of its Echo Show device, which includes a screen display, can tune in to celebrity chef Bobby Flay for inspiration on what to cook.  \u201cI can get to be in basically any kitchen in the world, anywhere in the world,\u201d Flay said in a live promotional demo for the partnership.  Amazon announced an update to its Echo Show, as well as new devices like the Echo Studio, Echo Glow and the Echo Flex.","577":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Amazon drops as sales forecast misses estimates  * Cigna\u2019s outlook, proposed rebate rule hit healthcare stocks  * January payrolls rise more than expected  * Indexes: Dow up 0.26 pct, S&P flat, Nasdaq off 0.33 pct (Updates to open)  Feb 1 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 held near an eight-week high on Friday as stronger-than-expected U.S. job growth in January allayed concerns about a slowdown, although disappointing outlook from e-commerce giant Amazon capped gains.  The Labor Department data showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018, handily beating an estimated rise of 165,000, according to economists polled by Reuters.  The report also showed no \u201cdiscernible\u201d impact on job growth from a 35-day partial government shutdown. However, the longest shutdown in history, which ended a week ago, pushed up the unemployment rate to a seven-month high of 4 percent.  The data came two days after the Federal Reserve signaled that its three-year interest rate hike campaign might be ending because of rising headwinds to the economy.  \u201cThe payroll number was significantly stronger than what was expected, so a lot more people are finding jobs,\u201d said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.  \u201cThere is a huge concern about the growth rates in China and this certainly eases some amount of concern domestically.\u201d  Data from China showed that the manufacturing sector shrank for the second straight month in January, pointing to further strains on the economy that could heighten risks for global growth.  January ended on a high-note for U.S. markets, with the S&P 500 posting its best month since 2015, boosted by the Fed\u2019s dovish remarks and as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal improved.  President Donald Trump said he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try and seal a comprehensive trade deal.

Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, dragged down by a 1.4 percent loss for the S&P consumer discretionary index .  Amazon.com Inc fell 4.1 percent after its quarterly sales forecast fell short of Wall Street estimates, overshadowing its record sales and profit during the holiday season.  Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp jumped 2.4 percent after the oil majors reported better-than-expected quarterly profits, boosting the Dow Jones industrial index.  The S&P energy index rose 1.1 percent, led by higher oil prices and upbeat earnings in the sector.  Cigna Corp fell 3.7 percent after the health insurer forecast 2019 revenue and earnings below estimates.  The insurer\u2019s shares, along with other pharmacy benefit managers, took a hit after the U.S. government proposed a rule to end the industry-wide system of rebates, which they get from drugmakers, in efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs for consumers.  CVS Health Corp fell 1.9 percent and UnitedHealth Group Inc slipped 1.4 percent, dragging the S&P healthcare index down 0.3 percent.

Walmart clarified to Reuters that the retailer sent Wadlin a signed version of her separation agreement on May 15, but she never signed it.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, said Wadlin\u2019s knowledge of its strategic plans \u201cwould be of immense benefit to Amazon,\u201d according to the lawsuit, which was filed late on Wednesday in Delaware\u2019s Court of Chancery.  Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said senior executives at Walmart agree to forgo working for competitors with revenue in excess of $7 billion for two years after leaving the company.  \u201cWe believe Ms. Wadlin\u2019s acceptance of a job with Amazon will violate her non-compete clause,\u201d Hargrove said.  Wadlin and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.  Walmart has been plowing money into its online business to try to keep pace with Amazon, which has muscled its way into the brick-and-mortar grocery business with its acquisition of Whole Foods.  Wadlin was hired by Seattle-based Amazon as a vice president of tax and tax policy, according to the lawsuit.  She brings with her non-public information including insight into Walmart\u2019s potential merger targets, according to the lawsuit. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said Amazon could use that information to thwart Walmart\u2019s deals, or force it to pay more.  Walmart is seeking a court order to enforce the non-compete agreement, according to the lawsuit. It also wants the court to bar her from using or sharing confidential company information.","579":"WASHINGTON, April 3 (Reuters) - Shares of online retail giant Amazon.com pared some gains after U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his attack on the company over the cost of its deliveries sent through the United States Postal Service.  \u201cI am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy.

FILE PHOTO: A shipment moves on a conveyor belt at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS\/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  The decision is a setback for Future, the country\u2019s second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year. It has said it could face liquidation if the deal falls through.  U.S. online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list including Reliance.  The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world\u2019s richest men - Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Reliance\u2019s Mukesh Ambani.  It could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.  After Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator\u2019s order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the High Court in New Delhi to enforce it.  Justice J. R. Midha said on Tuesday that an immediate order was necessary to protect the U.S. company\u2019s rights, adding that the arbitrator had \u201crightly proceeded\u201d against Future.  \u201cThis court is of the clear view that the (arbitration) order ... is enforceable,\u201d Midha added. \u201cAll the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo.\u201d  Amazon said it welcomed the order. Future said it would explore all legal remedies to pursue the deal.  Reliance did not respond to requests for comment.  LEGAL BRAINS  Future\u2019s planned deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt, had already been cleared by Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.  Justice Midha directed a federal government counsel to relay the court\u2019s decision to all authorities who were involved in reviewing the Future-Reliance deal. Future had acted \u201cin violation\u201d of the arbitrator\u2019s order, he added.  Both Future and Amazon hired some of the country\u2019s best legal brains to argue the matter, with the U.S. company engaging law firms P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.  Future, in sometimes acrimonious court arguments, accused Amazon of blocking its deal in an attempt to thwart any competition from Reliance, which has plans to expand into e-commerce.  Amazon said at some point it wanted to become a single largest shareholder of Future Retail, which it says \u201chas an irreplaceable and widespread network\u201d of outlets across India.","582":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc abruptly scrapped plans to build a major outpost in New York that could have created 25,000 jobs, blaming opposition from local leaders upset by the nearly $3 billion in incentives promised by state and city politicians.  The company said on Thursday it did not see consistently \u201cpositive, collaborative\u201d relationships with state and local officials. Opponents of the project feared congestion and higher rents in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, and objected to handing billions in incentives to a company run by Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest man.  State Senator Michael Gianaris, who represents Queens and was a vocal critic of the deal, told a news conference on Thursday that the Amazon subsidies were unnecessary.  \u201cThis was a shakedown, pure and simple,\u201d he said.  Amazon\u2019s sudden pullout from New York City prompted finger pointing by Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo, the politicians who crafted the deal. Cuomo angrily blamed the loss on local politicians while de Blasio blamed Amazon.  Cuomo said in a statement that a small group of politicians had \u201cput their own narrow political interests\u201d above those of New Yorkers.  The year-long search for its so-called HQ2 culminated in Amazon picking Northern Virginia and New York after hundreds of municipalities, from Newark, N.J. to Indianapolis competed for the coveted tax-dollars and high-wage jobs the project promised.  Amazon said it would not conduct a new headquarters search and would focus on growing at other existing and planned offices. The company already has more than 5,000 employees in New York City and plans to continue to hire there, Amazon said on Thursday.  A Siena College Poll conducted earlier this month found 56 percent of registered voters in New York supported the Amazon deal, while 36 percent opposed it.  CITY SHAKEDOWN?  Some New Yorkers mounted protests after the deal was announced, angered by the $2.8 billion in incentives promised to Amazon and fearing further gentrification in a neighborhood once favored by artists looking for cheap studio space.  U.S. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a critic of the project and a self-described democratic socialist whose district spans parts of Queens and the Bronx, cheered the reversal by the world\u2019s third most valuable public company.  \u201cAnything is possible: today was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers & their neighbors defeated Amazon\u2019s corporate greed, its worker exploitation, and the power of the richest man in the world,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.  People briefed on the decision said Amazon had made the decision early on Thursday amid rising concerns about the small vocal minority. The people said Amazon will not shift any of the planned jobs to Tennessee where an operations hub is planned or Virginia, but plans to grow its existing network of locations.  Amazon had not acquired land for the project, making it easy to scrap its plans, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.  LOST OPPORTUNITY?  In a statement, de Blasio blamed Amazon for failing to address local criticism.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  \u201cWe gave Amazon the opportunity to be a good neighbor and do business in the greatest city in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of working with the community, Amazon threw away that opportunity.\u201d  Some long-time residents in Long Island City, which sits across the East River from midtown Manhattan\u2019s skyscrapers, feared being forced out by rising rents and untenable pressure on already overburdened subway and sewage systems. High-rise towers have sprouted across the neighborhood in recent years.  \u201cThis is a stunning development, with Amazon essentially giving in to vocal critics,\u201d said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. The about-turn could spook other companies thinking about expanding in New York, he added.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google has avoided competitions between cities for offices, and its growing presence in lower Manhattan has met with little serious blowback.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  Google said in December it plans to invest more than $1 billion on a new campus in New York to double its current headcount of more than 7,000 people.  \u201cI think the (Amazon) PR event turned out to be a mistake,\u201d said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at the Roosevelt Investment Group, who owns Amazon shares.  Shares of Amazon fell 1 percent.  \u2018REALLY GOOD POKER PLAYERS\u2019  Hours before the announcement, Amazon officials in New York betrayed no knowledge of the deal\u2019s cancellation when they met with local community members on Thursday morning, said Kenny Greenberg, a neon artist and member of Long Island City\u2019s community board.  \u201cEither they are really good poker players or they were not aware,\u201d Greenberg said of the Amazon representatives. \u201cThere was no hint of this at all.\u201d  The meeting with Amazon officials had been held to answer concerns from the community about labor conditions for Amazon\u2019s warehouse and delivery workers and the company\u2019s opposition to labor unions.  U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat whose district includes the proposed site, lamented the loss of jobs and new revenues.  \u201cThis is not the Valentine that NY needed,\u201d she wrote, adding that she had been ready to push for changes to the deal to address local concerns.","583":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Walmart\u2019s Mexico unit has penalized food companies supplying groceries to rival Amazon, pressure that has forced some to pull their products from the world\u2019s largest online retailer, four people familiar with the matter said.  The tough tactics come as the two giants battle for supremacy in one of their most important foreign markets, one that Walmart currently dominates.  Walmart last year demanded discounts from food businesses whose products it found priced lower on the Mexican website of Amazon.com Inc, the people said, even though suppliers had no say in the Seattle retailer\u2019s decision to undercut Walmart on price.  Two suppliers told Reuters they moved swiftly to pull their brands from Amazon, wary of jeopardizing their relationship with Walmart de Mexico. The companies, both of which sell common pantry goods, said Walmart accounts for more than half their supermarket sales in Mexico.  Walmart would not discuss its competition with Amazon in Mexico or the allegations made by suppliers. It told Reuters it does not dictate with whom vendors can do business. But it acknowledged it always presses for the lowest prices, particularly if competitors are giving shoppers a better deal.  \u201cWe could never tell anybody that they can\u2019t sell to someone else,\u201d Ignacio Caride, Walmart Mexico\u2019s e-commerce head, told Reuters.  \u201cIf we think there\u2019s an opportunity to lower our prices, because we see better prices at other retailers, we\u2019re going to negotiate for that access,\u201d he said.  The company said in a statement that it aims to offer the lowest possible prices to benefit consumers, and doesn\u2019t subsidize losses for some products with revenues from others.  Amazon declined to comment.  Walmart is Mexico\u2019s largest retailer, commanding nearly 60 percent of the country\u2019s supermarket sales through more than 2,400 Walmart, Superama, Sam\u2019s Club and Bodega Aurrera stores. Its online business in Mexico is growing fast, but it represented just 1.4 percent of revenue last year.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  Amazon launched its Mexican website in 2015 and is now one of the country\u2019s biggest online retailers. It began selling groceries here in August.  Supermarket analyst Bill Bishop said Walmart wants to avoid a repeat of its experience in the United States, where Amazon quickly took the lead in online grocery sales. Walmart Inc\u2019s Mexico unit is its second-largest overseas market by sales after the United Kingdom, on par with Canada.  \u201cThey\u2019re worried that Amazon will grow in Mexico,\u201d said Bishop, co-founder of retail advisory firm Brick Meets Click in Barrington, Illinois.  \u201cThey\u2019re saying: Be aware of the fact that we\u2019re not going to make it easy for you to grow here,\u201d he said.  The two Mexican suppliers who spoke to Reuters said they were caught in the crossfire. They said their wholesale prices were the same for both retailers, but that Amazon chose to sell their products to consumers more cheaply than Walmart did.  Instead of lowering its retail prices to match those of Amazon, Walmart took it out on them, the vendors said. Walmart docked their payments by the retail price difference, multiplied by the amount of stock in its inventory, a move that cost them tens of thousands of dollars collectively, the people said.  Both said they entered into talks with Amazon shortly afterward to drop their products. They said they could not afford continued financial clawbacks from Walmart. Nor could they risk losing their biggest customer, despite the huge sales potential offered by Amazon\u2019s platform.  \u201cIt\u2019s a threat, and it\u2019s coercion,\u201d one of the people said of Walmart\u2019s strategy.  Emails between Amazon and one of the food companies, seen by Reuters, support the version of events described by suppliers. Two other people familiar with the matter who have expertise in e-commerce in Mexico gave similar accounts.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  A cellphone message sent by another supplier to one of the e-commerce professionals discussing its woes with Walmart, reviewed by Reuters, likewise confirmed the situation.  PLAYING HARDBALL  Experts say Walmart\u2019s pressure on its suppliers in Mexico is unlikely to have legal repercussions. Miguel Flores, a former member of Mexico\u2019s competition commission, said a government investigation into abuse of dominant market power would be complex, lengthy and hard to prove.  Mexico\u2019s competition regulator declined to comment.  Walmart, the world\u2019s largest bricks-and-mortar retailer, and Amazon, the No. 1 online seller, are vying for consumer loyalty worldwide.  Both companies have been pressuring suppliers for the lowest prices on goods from t-shirts to bicycles. And Walmart has spent big to build up its shopping website, delivery network and cloud computing infrastructure to compete with Amazon online.  Still, Amazon has raced ahead in online food shopping. It notched $3.4 billion in U.S. grocery sales last year compared with Walmart\u2019s $2 billion in U.S. online food sales, according to Boston-based research firm Edge by Ascential.  Amazon\u2019s grocery selection in Mexico currently is limited to non-perishables, such as coffee, beer, pasta and canned vegetables. Walmart offers a wider selection, including fresh foods such as lettuce and chicken.  Walmart brought its concerns about Amazon\u2019s lower prices to a number of food suppliers in Mexico, including multinational firms, around the time that Amazon launched its food and drinks web page, said two of the people in Mexico\u2019s e-commerce industry who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of business relationships.  They said some of the biggest firms figured out ways to appease Walmart, such as packaging their products for Amazon in sizes different from those sold at Walmart, they said.  But many of the smaller companies lacked the know-how to negotiate, they said.  Bishop, the supermarket analyst, said Mexican suppliers feel enormous pressure to stick with Walmart, at least for now.  \u201cThe dilemma is that Amazon is a very rapidly growing channel,\u201d he said.","584":"BENGALURU, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc-owned Flipkart and rival Amazon Inc said on Monday they made record sales in the opening day of their annual festive season sales in India that kicked off over the weekend.  Flipkart and Amazon began their flagship annual sales on Saturday, with both vying for customers during the October-December festive season when Indians make most of their big-ticket purchases.  This comes as growth slows in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy, denting sales of everything from cars to cookies, and prompting the government to step in with tax cuts and a raft of other measures to revive growth.  Amazon reported record sales of about 7.5 billion rupees ($7.07 million) in 36 hours in the premium smartphone brands category, while Flipkart said all major categories, including beauty, baby care, private labels and furniture, saw double-digit sales growth from a year ago in the first day.  Both, the \u201cBig Billion Days\u201d sale and Amazon\u2019s \u201cGreat Indian Festival\u201d, will finish on Oct. 4, according to their websites.  Amazon has successfully grabbed a large chunk of the Indian e-commerce space even though it entered seven years after Flipkart in 2014, winning over millions of customers with its Prime loyalty programme, which gives users early access to deals during sales, free music and video streaming services.  Earlier this month, a leading trader body asked the government to ban the festive sales, citing that the deep discounts they offered was violating the country\u2019s foreign investment rules for online retail.  Both Amazon and Flipkart offer deep discounts on everything from clothes, smartphones to home appliances ahead of important Hindu festivals Dussehra and Diwali.","585":"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished sharply higher for a second straight day on Tuesday, helped by gains in Amazon.com and Google-parent Alphabet ahead of their results and by optimism over progress on a U.S. pandemic relief package.

The stock was flat in after-hours trading, even as Amazon.com beat estimates for holiday-quarter sales.  Alphabet shares shot up more than 6% after the bell following its earnings report. The stock ended the regular session up 1.4%.  During the session, the market\u2019s rally was broad-based. All of the S&P 500 sectors ended higher, with the S&P 500 financials sector rising 2.5%.  More than 80% of reports from S&P 500 companies so far have surpassed analysts\u2019 earnings expectations, with 97% of reports from technology companies beating, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Exxon Mobil Corp posted its first annual loss as a public company. However, its shares ended up 1.6% as its quarterly adjusted profit topped estimates.  Shares of United Parcel Service Inc climbed 2.6% after it beat quarterly profit estimates on a surge in home delivery volume due to pandemic-fueled online purchases of holiday gifts and staples.  Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.72 billion shares, compared with the 15.6 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Hotstar reported 300 million monthly active users last year. Most of these are users of the free, advertising-supported service and Disney has said it is aiming to convert many of these users into paying subscribers.  Disney could use the help as the streaming video war is waged on the global stage this year against rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc. India is widely viewed as one of the biggest source of new subscribers.  Hotstar\u2019s paid service includes shows from a spectrum of international programmers including AT&T Inc\u2019s HBO, whose offerings include \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cChernobyl\u201d as well as popular live sports content like Premier League soccer.

India\u2019s nearly half a billion internet users, according to research firm Nielsen, have attracted the interest of big American streaming video companies Netflix and Amazon Prime. Both have invested in creating local programming to lure subscribers.  To better compete in this market, Netflix launched a lower cost mobile plan to lure subscribers, the first time it has done so in any market.  \u201cIndia is a key market for Disney & Iger internationally given the hunger for streaming content and the demand potential. That said, Netflix and Amazon have built strong local content. ... We believe 10 million to 15 million subs in 2 years would be an initial success story,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.

Amazon Prime costs about $1.80 per month.","587":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com has steadily added options for customers to receive their packages including in car trunks, inside home garages and potentially by drone.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Thursday, Amazon added another alternative for U.S. customers: Walk into a nearby retailer and pick up an Amazon package over the counter.  The new option, called Counter, will launch with pharmacy Rite Aid Corp offering the service in 100 stores, with an expansion to 1,500 stores by year\u2019s end, the companies said. Amazon is also looking to get other retailers, including small businesses, to join the program as it expands.  The new option builds on Amazon\u2019s previous efforts to put lockers inside retail stores where customers can pick up packages. Patrick Supanc, world director of Amazon Hub, told Reuters the locker has spread to thousands of stores but some retailers do not have the space to accommodate a locker.  \u201cOverall, we want to give every Amazon customer the option of an alternative delivery location,\u201d Supanc said. \u201cThis will become an extensive network.\u201d  Amazon said the service will not cost extra and will work with existing shipping options such as same-day service. When a package arrives at a store, the customer will get an email notification. Once in the store, the customer shows an employee a barcode, and the employee scans it, finds the package and hands it over.  The service was originally launched in the United Kingdom and Italy with retailers NEXT, Giunti Al Punto Librerie, Fermopoint and SisalPay. Amazon\u2019s Supanc would not comment on the financial details of the deals or whether Amazon is paying the retailers to participate.  Supanc said early data from the European launch has shown \u201cvery clear evidence\u201d that the increased foot traffic from Amazon customers coming into partner stores increases sales there.  \u201cThey\u2019re being introduced to Amazon customers, and Amazon customers are getting to know that store. That additional footfall into their stores translates into additional sales for those partners,\u201d he said.  In a statement, Jocelyn Konrad, executive vide president of pharmacy and retail operations at Rite Aid, said the program, along with Amazon\u2019s lockers in Rite Aid stores, \u201ccreates a stronger in-store experience for existing customers and new customers that come in to pick up their packages.\u201d  Supanc said that the two companies were \"not sharing any retail data with each other\" and that the effort was focused on delivery experiences and not connected to Amazon's other efforts to get into pharmacy retailing, such as its purchase of startup here PillPack last year.","588":"* Amazon in spat over Future\u2019s sale of retail assets to Reliance  * Has asked market regulator to investigate Future Retail  * Amazon alleges Future Retail told Reliance of injunction details  * Future Retail says it is denying the allegations  NEW DELHI, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has asked India\u2019s market regulator to investigate Future Retail Ltd for insider trading, a letter seen by Reuters showed, as it seeks to prevent its business partner from becoming part of rival Reliance\u2019s empire.  The U.S. giant has been pressing the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to review Reliance\u2019s August deal to buy retail, logistics and other assets from Future Group for $3.4 billion including debt.  Amazon argues it had a 2019 agreement with Future which prevented the Indian group\u2019s retail assets from being sold to certain parties including Reliance Industries Ltd, which is led by Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani.  The Nov. 8 letter to SEBI alleges Future Retail disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of an injunction granted by a Singapore arbitrator to block the deal.  The spat is being closely watched as a key test of whether Indian firms, courts and regulators will respect arbitration decisions made in accordance with overseas arbitration rules, and adds to headaches for Amazon in India which is also dealing with antitrust challenges.  The injunction was granted on Sunday Oct. 25 and was reported by media with Amazon issuing a short statement saying it welcomed the decision.  Reliance later that evening said in a stock exchange filing that it had been informed of the arbitration order and would enforce its rights to complete the deal with Future without delay.  It is this Oct. 25 filing which Amazon argues in its 20-page letter that indicates Ambani\u2019s group was privy to \u201cprice sensitive\u201d details of the injunction.  Ambani\u2019s group \u201cwas not a party to the arbitration proceedings ... and could have received details related thereto only from FRL (Future Retail) or its Promoters,\u201d said the letter.  A spokesman for Future Group said in a statement to Reuters it denies the allegations made in the letter and that news of the injunction was in the public domain from Sunday.  Reliance and SEBI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment on the letter\u2019s contents.  Future Retail, which has argued that Amazon\u2019s agreement last year was only with a separate Future Group unit, issued a statement to the stock exchange on the morning of Oct. 26 saying it was examining the arbitration order and that it believed the order would have to be tested by Indian law.  Future Group, which operates supermarkets and high-end food stores and has more than 1,500 outlets across India, has argued it entered into the deal to sell retail assets to Reliance because its business was severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and it was critical to protect all its stakeholders.  It remains to be seen whether Indian courts and regulators will side with Amazon or Future Retail. Future Retail has asked a New Delhi court for an order to restrain Amazon from approaching Indian regulators to block its deal with Reliance. Hearings on the case began on Tuesday.

Spotify, which wants to trade as SPOT on the New York Stock Exchange, is taking an unusual path to the U.S. public markets, with a direct listing that will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering.  Because the company will not issue any new shares, it did not specify a listing price. Based on private transactions, it is valued at roughly $19 billion, according to Reuters calculations.  Spotify, launched in 2008 and available in more than 60 countries, is the biggest music streaming company in the world and counts services from Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Alphabet Inc's< GOOGL.O> Google as its main rivals.  RISING SALES, COSTS IN CHECK  In the filing, Spotify laid out detailed financial data for the first time, showing rising revenue and relatively steady operating costs, which analysts took as a positive.  Revenue rose 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($4.99 billion) in 2017, from 2.95 billion euros a year earlier. Its operating loss widened to 378 million euros in 2017 from 349 million euros.  Its net loss ballooned 129 percent in 2017, driven mostly by financing costs related to a 2016 deal in which Sweden-based Spotify raised $1 billion in debt that would convert to shares upon an initial public offering.  \u201cThe revenue continues to grow but in particular their costs are growing slower than revenue, which is exactly what you expect in a business like this,\u201d said Jay Ritter, an expert in initial public offerings and professor at the University of Florida.  Spotify compared its aspirations to the reach of Facebook FB.O and YouTube. \"We believe the universality of music gives us the opportunity to reach many of the over 3.6 billion internet users globally,\" it said.  With 71 million premium subscribers globally, Spotify has about twice as many paying customers as music streaming runner up Apple, with 36 million. Including those who listen to advertising-supported streams, Spotify has about 159 million monthly average users.  Amazon Music Unlimited has 16 million paying subscribers, and Pandora Media Inc P.N has 5.48 million total subscribers.  Google has not said how many subscribers it has to Google Play, its music streaming service.  Spotify\u2019s premium subscription costs $9.99 a month, but it said it saw great potential in its ad-supported service, which Apple does not offer.  \u201cWith our ad-supported service, we believe there is a large opportunity to grow users and gain market share from traditional terrestrial radio,\u201d Spotify said.  The net proportion of subscribers who left Spotify\u2019s paid-for service, or churn, fell to 5.1 percent of paying customers at the end of 2017, from 6.9 percent at the start of 2016, the company said.  FILE PHOTO: Headphones are seen in front of a logo of online music streaming service Spotify in this February 18, 2014 illustration picture. REUTERS\/Christian Hartmann\/File Photo  \u201cThis has been a question we\u2019ve been wondering for a long time: how sustainable is Spotify\u2019s model? This is the very first time we\u2019re seeing public disclosure about churn, and the news there is really good,\u201d said Larry Miller, head of the music business program at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School.  Spotify calculated that customers brought in 3.6 times more revenue over their life as a user than the company spent on marketing to attract them, as of the end of 2017, helping boost free cash flow to 109 million euros by the end of last year.  Still, in going head to head against Apple, Amazon and others, Spotify is \u201ccompeting against companies that never need to make a dime on music as a standalone business and that in fact use it to drive other aspects of their business,\u201d Miller said.  Apple and Alphabet also control the two main operating systems used by smartphones, iOS and Android. They and Amazon are all developing computer assistants, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri, that could give the bigger companies advantages.  \u201cMany of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, legacy operating histories, and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical, human, and other resources,\u201d Spotify said in its filing.  Apple has launched massive marketing campaigns around its service and added subscribers rapidly in the last three years. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that the pace of competition this year has quickened,\u201d Miller said.  Spotify has a powerful ally, in the music arm of China's Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK. The companies in December said they would buy minority stakes in each other, helping increase exposure to each other's core markets.  STOCK COULD BE VOLATILE  A direct listing does not dilute ownership, as would happen with a conventional initial public offering, and saves hundreds of millions of dollars in underwriting fees. But it also frees existing owners from any lockup period restricting them from selling their shares following the listing.  Underwriters that provide price stability for new listings are not used in a direct listing, which could mean a volatile start for Spotify shares in public.  Shares trade privately in a wide band. Spotify is valued between $16.8 billion and $22.6 billion, based on recent ordinary share prices between $95 and $127.50 in the private markets in February and 177 million shares estimated outstanding by the end of February, according to its filing.  Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan described Spotify as \u201cinteresting,\u201d but questioned how quickly it might become profitable.  \u201cHow can Spotify monetize its user base beyond a $5-$15 monthly subscription fee?,\u201d Morgan asked.","592":"FILE PHOTO: An employee of Amazon walks through a turnstile gate inside an Amazon Fulfillment Centre on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018.

A push for strict enforcement of the rule has come amid tensions between India and China following a border skirmish which began in June, and is part of India\u2019s efforts to cut down on Chinese-made imports.  The two e-commerce firms have been given 15 days to explain the lapses or action will be taken against them, according to an Oct. 16 letter addressed to the companies from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs and seen by Reuters.  It did not specify what action may be taken, referring only to a legal act that has provisions for fines.  Representatives for Amazon and Flipkart did not immediately respond to Reuters requests seeking comment outside regular business hours.  In addition to enforcing the country of origin rule, New Delhi has also banned 177 Chinese mobile applications since June while Chinese goods in ports have faced extra scrutiny and delays.  Amazon has often faced regulatory challenges in India. Last year, the government enforced strict rules for foreign investment in e-commerce which forced the U.S. retail giant to rework its business structures and strained ties between New Delhi and Washington.  In January, the Competition Commission of India ordered an investigation into Amazon and Flipkart over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices, which Amazon is challenging, according to court filings.","593":"RIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Brazil\u2019s government has been told that development projects, including hydropower dams, in protected areas can no longer go ahead without the prior approval of lawmakers.  Last week\u2019s ruling by the supreme court followed the use by the government in recent years of the controversial \u201cprovisional measure\u201d, a legal instrument that allowed the president to approve projects by reducing the size of protected areas.  Campaigners said the decision should ensure the country\u2019s forests and reserves, including the Amazon rainforest, were better protected.  \u201cThis decision puts an end to a spree of provisional measures in the name of environmental de-protection,\u201d said Mauricio Guetta, a lawyer at Instituto Socioambiental (ISA), an advocacy group.  In recent years, the government has used the measure to open up protected areas for controversial projects, including building two of Brazil\u2019s largest hydropower dams - the Jirau and Santo Antonio - in the Amazon.  The use of the measure to shrink protected areas with immediate effect had brought \u201cirreversible consequences, irreversible damage to the environment,\u201d Guetta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  The eight-judge bench ruled unanimously that using the provisional measure to reduce the size of protected areas for any reason was unconstitutional.  It followed a lawsuit in which the court heard the measure had been used in 2012 to allow trees in six protected areas of the Amazon to be felled to make way for five hydropower dams.  \u201cThe (provisional measure), later converted into law, reduced the level of environmental protection by deactivating large areas in a protected territorial space without respecting due legislative process,\u201d supreme court justice Alexandre de Moraes said in a statement.  The court said the ruling would not affect the five hydropower plants in question because the provisional measure had already been enacted in law, and some are operating.  Guetta said the ruling meant any changes to protected areas must be first approved by law, and local communities should be properly consulted about projects planned on their land.  \u201cThe government has been trying to reduce by more than 1 million hectares the area under conservation in the southern part of Amazonas state. Now this initiative is officially vetoed because of the supreme court\u2019s decision,\u201d he said.  Environmentalists say increasing swathes of land, including the Amazon forest, are being felled for grazing and cropland, and for development projects.  Deforestation in the Amazon fell in the August 2016 to July 2017 monitoring period for the first time in three years, although the 6,624 square kilometres (2,557 square miles) cleared of forest remains well above the low recorded in 2012 and targets for slowing climate change.","594":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, November 5, 2019.

The company, which has reported virus cases among warehouse staff and faced several demonstrations, said it would start testing hundreds of thousands of employees a day for fevers. It told Reuters it would use no-contact forehead thermometers at site entrances and send anyone registering more than 100.4 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) home.  All locations will have surgical masks available by early next week, after millions were ordered weeks ago, according to Amazon. Particle-blocking N95 masks it has ordered will instead be donated to medical workers or sold at cost to government and healthcare organizations, it said.  The company will also use machine-learning software to monitor building cameras and determine whether employees are staying at safe distances during their shifts, or whether they are often huddled too close together.  The plans, previously unreported, show how the world\u2019s largest online retailer is aiming to mitigate the major health risks facing its staff.  Like first responders, workers are bringing food and essential goods to millions of people whom governments have told to stay at home. But doing so puts staff into proximity with countless others at warehouses, at grocery stores and at shoppers\u2019 doorsteps, increasing the likelihood they will contract the COVID-19 disease.  Walmart Inc WMT.N, the largest U.S. employer, said earlier this week it would take employees' temperature and provide them with masks.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon said the mask rollout was underway. Temperature scans have begun at facilities near its Seattle headquarters and in New York. The company has already ramped up to more than 100,000 employee checks daily, with more sites to come.  Workers with high temperatures will have to stay home until they pass three days without a fever, the company said.  The retailer has more than 700 facilities in its U.S. and European distribution network, according to logistics consultancy MWPVL International Inc. Amazon-owned Whole Foods has 508 stores, according to the grocer\u2019s website.  80,000 WORKERS HIRED  Some unions and elected officials have criticized Amazon\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, a pandemic that has infected more than 935,000 people globally and led to about 47,000 deaths. Some officials have called on the company to shut down its facilities.  In the United States, workers from at least 19 warehouses have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to reports, leading to walkouts by a small number of staff in New York and near Detroit this week. Delivery drivers contracted for Amazon and other companies have said they lacked hand sanitizer, sick pay and health insurance.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Facing a shortage of labor to address a spike in customer orders, Amazon has largely avoided warehouse closures and last month said it would hire 100,000 people. It reported a full and part-time workforce of 798,000 as of Dec. 31.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  In an interview with Reuters, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager also signaled that Google and Amazon would remain very much on her radar until the end of her mandate late next year.  Google has been fined a total of 6.8 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in the last 18 months for breaching EU rules.  Apple\u2019s mobile payment service Apple Pay, launched in October 2014, is available in 10 EU countries including France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Denmark.  Critics say that an NFC chip embedded in the Apple iPhone means that Apple Pay is automatically selected when an iPhone user pays for goods and services, barring rival payment methods. The Danish Competition Authority is investigating the issue, which was brought to its attention by the Danish Consumer Council.  Vestager, who has earned a reputation for taking a tough line against companies that breach EU rules and can impose fines of up to 10 percent of a company\u2019s global turnover, said she did a preliminary review some time back.  \u201cWhen we were looking at it ... (at) first glance, we couldn\u2019t see Apple being dominant. That doesn\u2019t exclude in the future that we will have a second look. But when we looked some time ago, we didn\u2019t find ... the necessary (evidence) to start a case,\u201d she said.  \u201cObviously if we had official complaints, we would take that seriously because the entire payment market is a very important payment market.\u201d  A spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.  Separately Vestager is reviewing whether Amazon is using merchants\u2019 data illegally to make its own brand products similar to retailers\u2019. She said she has been inundated with data, key to building a case against the U.S. online retailer.  \u201cNow we have received not piles, but mountains of data and for us it is a priority to go through that, both from Amazon themselves but also coming in from some of the businesses that they actually host,\u201d she said.  \u201cFor us, of course it is important to get the starting point right because, if we open a case, in order to be able to proceed with some speed, well then of course we need to get some of the basics right and we are in the process of doing that.\u201d  Vestager recently asked Google\u2019s rivals if the internet search engine unfairly demotes local search competitors, raising the possibility of a fourth antitrust case against the company.  \u201cNow we ask questions when it comes to local search. This means a lot to many people because you use your phone or your table, you are looking for a place to eat, opening hours, where to go, museums, doctors, all kinds of stuff, and therefore of course it is a very important area, a very important service,\u201d she said.  \u201cIt could be (a fourth case against Google) but of course we start asking questions without prejudice.\u201d","597":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O made two preliminary approaches for British online food delivery company Deliveroo, the latest one about nine months ago, the Telegraph reported on Monday.

FILE PHOTO: An employee of Amazon walks through a turnstile gate inside an Amazon Fulfillment Centre (BLR7) on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS\/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa  The case presents a new regulatory challenge for Amazon in India, where it has committed $6.5 billion in investment but is battling a complex regulatory environment.  In January, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had ordered an investigation of Amazon and rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart, over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices, which Amazon is challenging, according to court filings.  In the latest case, the All India Online Vendors Association, members of which sell goods on Amazon and Flipkart, allege Amazon engages in unfair business practices. Reuters was first to report the case filing on Wednesday.  The group alleges that Amazon India\u2019s wholesale arm buys goods in bulk from manufacturers and sells them at a loss to sellers such as Cloudtail. Such sellers then offer goods on Amazon.in at big discounts.  \u201cThis anti-competitive arrangement ... is causing foreclosure of competition by driving independent sellers out of the market,\u201d the group alleged in its Aug. 10 filing at CCI, seen by Reuters.  Amazon said in a statement it complies with all laws and its India website is a pure third-party marketplace where sellers have discretion to decide product prices. Amazon\u2019s statement also said its wholesale unit allows businesses to buy products and anyone can register on it.  A Cloudtail spokeswoman said it was in \u201ccompliance with all applicable laws in its operations.\u201d  Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the CCI are not made public. In the coming weeks, the CCI will review the case and could decide to launch a wider investigation or dismiss it.  The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.  Chanakya Basa, a lawyer for the sellers group, confirmed the case filing with the CCI but declined to elaborate.  India\u2019s regulations allow Amazon to operate an e-commerce marketplace where sellers can list goods for a fee.  India tightened regulations last year to deter steep discounts, but small sellers still say Amazon uses complex business structures to bypass restrictions, an allegation the company denies.  The latest case filing, running to more than 700 pages, includes screenshots of product listings on Amazon\u2019s website that showed some products, including groceries and detergents, discounted by between 8% to 45% compared with retail prices visible on the e-commerce website.  The seller group also alleges that Amazon charges lower fees to selected sellers, which effectively makes it difficult for independent online retailers to compete on its website.  Cloudtail, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest India sellers, pays a fee to Amazon of 6.3% for electronic products, while independent sellers pay roughly 28.1%, the group alleged in its filing.  Amazon says it provides an e-commerce platform in India to more than 650,000 sellers.","603":"(Reuters) - Shares of Walmart, Target and other U.S. retailers fell on Friday as Amazon.com Inc unveiled a one-day delivery plan for its Prime members in a move to further disrupt the fiercely competitive retail landscape.

In the case to be argued on April 17, South Dakota is asking the nine justices to overturn a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that only companies with a physical presence in a state are required to collect the state\u2019s sales tax on purchases. The Justice Department filed a brief in support of South Dakota, which lost in lower courts.  Amazon is not involved in the case but the eventual ruling could have consequences for the online retailing behemoth and other e-commerce businesses. Amazon has already agreed to collect sales taxes in all 45 states that impose them on items it sells directly.  South Dakota\u2019s legal fight is with smaller e-commerce companies Wayfair Inc, Overstock.com Inc and Newegg Inc.  Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Fox Business Network\u2019s Stuart Varney that Trump favors a \u201clevel playing field between internet venders and mom-and-pop stores,\u201d a statement that echoes some of the rhetoric in the upcoming case.  South Dakota argues that brick-and-mortar retailers suffer because they have to collect the taxes and therefore have a pricing disadvantage.  Hassett focused on the fact that Amazon does not collect the taxes on sales made by third-party vendors, which is estimated to be about half of its total sales.  \u201cSo for Amazon there really is a big advantage on the state sales tax because of current policy,\u201d Hassett said.  \u201cNow we expect that what\u2019s going to happen this year is it\u2019s going to become more and more of a news story as we go into the summer, because the Supreme Court is hearing a case that might really fundamentally change the interstate tax structure on the internet,\u201d he added.  Trump has repeatedly attacked Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, which the Republican president also has disparaged.  Trump on Thursday accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, exploiting the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but did not present evidence to back up claims or suggest any specific actions.  Pennsylvania and Washington state have recently passed laws requiring Amazon to collect sales on items sold by third-party vendors.  A Supreme Court ruling favoring South Dakota could funnel up to $13 billion annually of new tax revenues into the coffers of affected U.S. states, according to a 2017 federal government report.  Such a ruling would pave the way for states to expand tax collection for online sales across the board. Hassett indicated that federal legislation would be needed after the Supreme Court rules but offered no details.  A ruling is due by the end of June.","608":"(This is a repeat of an item issued on Monday)  SEATTLE, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Seattle voters, in a rebuke to heavy corporate campaign spending by Amazon.com, have kept progressives firmly in control of their city council, reviving chances for a tax on big businesses that the tech giant helped fend off last year.  Amazon poured a record $1.5 million into a Super PAC run by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to back a slate of candidates in the Nov. 5 council elections viewed as pro-business, or at least more corporate friendly than the incumbent council majority.  Amazon, the world\u2019s leading online retailer whose chief executive is billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, accounted for more than half of nearly $2.7 million raised by the Super PAC, a group allowed to accept unlimited sums from wealthy donors in support of their favorite candidates. Four years ago, Amazon donated $25,000.  By comparison, labor unions spent more than $1 million on the council race.  The unprecedented level of spending in a Seattle municipal race drew national attention, with Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders accusing Amazon of trying to buy the council.  The outcome for most of the seven council seats at stake in Tuesday\u2019s election was too close to call until Friday night, when a tally of 97 percent of votes cast showed that progressive candidates had won five of the seats, including two incumbents.  One of them was Kshama Sawant, a self-described socialist and Amazon\u2019s fiercest critic on the council, whose re-election bid was seen as the bellwether contest.  Just two of the seven candidates endorsed by Amazon and other companies through the chamber\u2019s Super Pac emerged winners, one of them an incumbent.  The overall progressive balance of the nine-seat council was little changed. Two other seats come up for re-election in 2021.  HOUSING CRISIS  \u201cThe election results are a repudiation of the billionaire class, corporate real estate, and the establishment,\u201d Sawant said at a press conference on Saturday, flanked by supporters holding a \u201cTax Amazon\u201d banner.  Sawant led the council in May 2018 in approving a new per-employee \u201chead tax\u201d on 500 of the city\u2019s largest companies, aimed at combating a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs.  The tax was designed to raise at least $45 million a year to build more affordable housing and help support a homeless population that is the third-largest of any U.S. metropolitan area.  The measure passed the council unanimously, despite threats from Amazon, Seattle\u2019s largest employer, to freeze planned expansions in the city.  But just four weeks later, the council repealed the tax altogether in the face of a well-financed campaign by Amazon and other businesses to mount a referendum drive against the measure.  On Saturday, Sawant characterized the latest election as a referendum on the head tax and pledged to pursue the policy with the new council.  Its backers argue that Seattle\u2019s biggest businesses should contribute to easing a shortage of low-cost housing they helped create through an over-heated real estate market that left many working poor and middle-class families unable to afford to live in the city.  Opponents have branded the measure a \u201ctax on jobs\u201d that would spark an economic backlash.  Corporate reaction to the election outcome was muted.  \u201cThe business community stands ready to work with the new Seattle City Council,\u201d the PAC\u2019s director, Markham McIntyre, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cHow our local government chooses to partner \u2013 or create division \u2013 matters.\u201d  On Wednesday, before the outcome was known, Amazon said it was \u201cpleased with the direction\u201d of the election and looked forward \u201cto working with the new city council, which we believe will be considerably more open to constructive dialogue.\u201d  Amazon has since not responded to further requests for comment.","609":"March 29 (Reuters) - Australian shares are likely to open flat on Thursday, after a see-saw session on Wall Street in which online retailer Amazon.com led the major U.S. stock indexes lower.

Unlisted supermarket operator Leclerc has a 21 percent share of the French market, Carrefour has 20.7 percent and Systeme-U 10.2 percent, according to industry data from Kantar.  Analysts said the deal with Systeme-U would therefore give Carrefour an advantage in purchasing power over Leclerc.  Carrefour and Systeme-U said they would aim to offer \u201cfair compensation\u201d to French farmers, a powerful voice in the country\u2019s political system who have lobbied President Emmanuel Macron to do more to help them.  Macron has promised 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in agricultural investment as well as minimum farm prices to prevent producers selling at a loss.  Nevertheless, French farmers and their FNSEA lobby group remain concerned about issues ranging from trade talks with South America\u2019s Mercosur bloc to a land-buying spree by Chinese investors.

Amazon is running \u201cShipping with Amazon\u201d in Los Angeles and possibly other locations, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  News of the test sparked investor concern that the world's largest online retailer would upend the shipping market. FedEx Corp FDX.N and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N shares were down more than 4 percent in afternoon trading.  FedEx, UPS and analysts played down the idea that a trial poses a near-term threat to the couriers\u2019 businesses.  Cowen and Co analyst Helane Becker estimated Amazon would have to invest $100 billion to build a global network of facilities, planes and trucks to compete with FedEx and UPS.  See a graphic unpacking Amazon and the 'Prime economy' here: reut.rs\/2EfyCqy  The program, while still at an early stage, aims to reduce hurdles that some sellers face getting their inventory to Amazon\u2019s facilities.  Under the new process being tested, Amazon sends a truck to pick up sellers\u2019 products, which then takes inventory either directly to an Amazon fulfillment center or to the U.S. Postal Service or to couriers like FedEx, depending on what\u2019s most cost-effective, said the person who spoke to Reuters.  Amazon has run a number of experiments in Los Angeles because the city is spread out and is a big market for deliveries. \u201cShipping with Amazon\u201d is currently intended for select third-party sellers in the test, not for businesses in general, and still it is not yet ready to roll out widely to sellers on Amazon, said the person.  FedEx and UPS customers should not expect to shift their business to Amazon any time soon. The Seattle-based company has considered taking work from the couriers on a conceptual level but does not have initiatives currently planned to ramp up competition, the person said.  Amazon said on Friday it was \u201calways innovating and experimenting on behalf of customers and the businesses that sell and grow on Amazon to create faster lower-cost delivery choices.\u201d  UPS and FedEx have both spent billions of dollars in recent years to upgrade and expand their networks to handle soaring e-commerce volumes. UPS said last week it plans to spend $7 billion on upgrading its network this year alone.  UPS and FedEx also consider Amazon an important customer. Amazon accounts for less than 10 percent of total revenue for UPS and 4 percent of revenue for FedEx, according to Wolfe Research analyst Scott Group.  UPS and FedEx declined to comment on Amazon\u2019s specific strategies or decisions regarding the utilization of their services.  \u201cThere is tremendous opportunity in the business-to-customer market and more growth coming to the sector and UPS, irrespective of how other companies shift strategies,\u201d UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said.  An earlier report on Amazon\u2019s plan \u201cdemonstrates a lack of basic understanding of the full scale of the global transportation industry,\u201d FedEx spokesman Patrick Fitzgerald said.","617":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, April 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Online retailer Amazon.com, criticized for not acting quickly enough to curb sellers who charged hundreds of dollars for high-demand hand sanitizer during the early phase of the new coronavirus pandemic, urged Congress on Wednesday to pass a law against price gouging during times of national emergency.  Price-gouging is not usually illegal but can be in certain states if there is an emergency, like during a hurricane or the current pandemic.  In a blog post, Brian Huseman, a vice president of public policy at Amazon, noted that different states had different definitions of gouging and that some fight gouging using consumer-protection statutes.  \u201cThe disparate standards among states present a significant challenge for retailers working to assist law enforcement, protect consumers, and comply with the law,\u201d Huseman wrote.  A group of 32 U.S. state attorneys general wrote to Amazon in March, and to Walmart Inc, Facebook Inc and eBay Inc, urging that they did more to stop gouging. In March, some sellers on Amazon notoriously charged $400, or more, for a box of small bottles of Purell hand sanitizer.  In response to the price-gouging criticism, Huseman said Amazon had removed more than a half million items from stores, suspended nearly 4,000 selling accounts in the U.S. store, and given information to federal prosecutors and state attorneys about sellers that Amazon suspects put excessively high prices on products in high demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Huseman argued for a law that would come into force if a national emergency is declared, be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and the states, and which would define gouging.","618":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, November 5, 2019.

Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, said it isn\u2019t anticipating any impacts to operations or deliveries due to this shutdown.  It did not specify the number of workers who contracted the disease at its PNE5 facility, which is a sorting center.  The company, however said, that its employees will be paid for the shifts that they miss because of the shutdown of the facility.  In October, Amazon said more than 19,000 of its U.S. frontline workers contracted the coronavirus this year, or 1.44% of the total, a disclosure sought by labor advocates who have criticized the COVID-19 response of the company.  Some staff, elected officials and unions in recent months have said Amazon put its employees\u2019 health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic.  The company had said it would expand virus testing to 50,000 U.S. employees per day by November through internally built capacity.","619":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com deferred all non-essential travel, within the U.S. and beyond, and Google set new restrictions for travel to South Korea and other places, as corporations moved to protect employees from the spread of coronavirus.

Google is banning travel to Iran and two Italian regions, Lombardy and the Veneto, where the virus is spreading. The company will also ban travel to South Korea and Japan, from March 2, a spokesman for the company confirmed.  Canada\u2019s TD Bank Group told Reuters it was suspending all non-essential business travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Its peer Bank of Nova Scotia has also reportedly halted non-essential travel.  JetBlue which flies in the United States, the Caribbean and Latin America, became the first U.S. airline to offer waivers for all travel on Wednesday, announcing it would suspend change and cancellation fees for new flight bookings between Feb. 27 and March 11 this year.  Facebook Inc also said it would cancel its annual developer conference in May because of the virus.  Wall Street has plunged on fears of a likely pandemic.  New reported infections around the world now exceed those from mainland China, where the flu-like disease arose two months ago.  Amazon\u2019s decision affects one of the largest U.S. workforces. As of Dec. 31, the company employed 798,000 full and part-time workers globally.  Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide operations, notified members of his team Thursday ahead of a wider communication by the company on Friday, a spokeswoman said.  Previously Amazon had said it was putting travel restrictions to China in place. With this broader halt of employee work trips, it was not immediately clear how the company distinguished essential from non-essential travel.  Other companies including London Stock Exchange Group, and U.S. grains trader Cargill Inc have also placed curbs on non-essential travel.  Chipmaker Microchip Technology said it would not be attending any investor conferences in the rest of the current quarter, due to travel restrictions over the outbreak.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Future Retail said in a regulatory filing late on Thursday that Amazon has agreed to acquire a 49% stake in Future Coupons Ltd. That entity in turn owns a 7.3% interest in Future Retail, according to prior filings.  The companies did not disclose the value of the deal, which gives Amazon a stake in one of India\u2019s biggest retail chains, whose stores sell everything from clothes to fresh produce.  The transaction valued Future Retail at a \u201csubstantial premium\u201d to its existing market price, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The Economic Times reported that the deal pegged the Mumbai-based company\u2019s value at about 430 billion rupees ($5.98 billion), more than double its current market capitalization of $2.91 billion.  Amazon and Future Retail declined to comment on the value of the transaction that remains subject to regulatory approval.  Future Retail\u2019s shares were down 5% at 393 rupees in morning trade in Mumbai, as many investors had expected Amazon to purchase a 10% stake based on previous media reports. The two sides have reportedly been in talks for more than a year.  \u201cThe earlier expectation was Amazon would invest via a fresh issue, but now the money\u2019s going to the promoter and the company is not benefiting,\u201d said Deepak Jasani, senior vice president at HDFC Securities. \u201cPeople had bought on expectation, and now are selling on the news.\u201d  The regulatory filing said the deal gives Amazon the right of first refusal should Future Retail\u2019s founder, Kishore Biyani, or his family decide to further trim the 47.02% stake they own in the company, both directly and via entities like Future Coupons that they control.  The online retailer announced plans on Thursday to launch its Amazon Fresh service to select areas in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru, the e-commerce company\u2019s first such foray into delivering fresh produce in India, seen its last major growth market.  In addition to over 290 Big Bazaar outlets, Future Retail also operates a dozen up-market grocery stores under the banner, Foodhall. Convenience store chain 7-Eleven Inc has also tied up with Future Retail to operate its stores in the country.  The Future Retail transaction marks Amazon\u2019s second such move to acquire a stake in an Indian supermarket store operator. Last year, Amazon and Indian private equity firm Samara Capital announced a joint investment in an entity that would give Amazon a stake in Indian supermarket chain More. Amazon also owns a stake in Indian department store chain Shopper\u2019s Stop.  Early this year, India revised its e-commerce rules, creating hurdles for Amazon and rival Walmart Inc\u2019s e-commerce subsidiary, Flipkart. One revised rule bars an entity in which a foreign e-commerce company or its group companies have a stake from selling on their online platform.  These and other restrictions forced Amazon to alter how it structures some of its equity holdings in the country.  India\u2019s revised e-commerce regulations, along with its push to compel multinationals to store data locally, have irked the U.S. government and heightened trade tensions. India has argued the rules are aimed at protecting interests of its small traders and privacy of its citizens.

The COVID-19 pandemic brought air travel to a virtual halt earlier in the year, hurting aero parts makers such as Honeywell, but a surge in online shopping has boosted sales at its warehouse automation equipment unit, which counts Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O among its customers.  Honeywell, which has furloughed workers, axed merit increases and cut board and executive pay, said it expects to return to growth and margin expansion in 2021. It raised its cost savings target for 2020 to a range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion earlier.  \u201cHoneywell retains one of the toughest end-market exposures among multi-industry companies. Therefore, we view the solid sequential revenue, operating improvement and sequential guidance as encouraging,\u201d Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said in a note.  Sales in the aerospace business, which makes parts for Boeing BA.N and Airbus AIR.PA planes, fell about 25% to $2.66 billion, improving from a 28% plunge in the second quarter as strong demand from the defense sector helped it beat analysts' expectation for a 29% fall.  Honeywell said sales from its safety and productivity solutions unit, which houses the automation equipment business, rose 8% to $1.58 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30.  The health crisis has also boosted demand for personal protection equipment for industrial workers, Honeywell said.  The company expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share between $1.97 and $2.02, above analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.88.  Excluding items, Honeywell earned $1.56 per share, beating estimates of $1.49 per share, even as its net income plunged 53% to $758 million and sales fell 14% to $7.80 billion.","623":"FILE PHOTO: An outside view of an Amazon logistics centre in Mannheim, Germany, September 17, 2019.

Jung Yeon-je\/Pool via REUTERS  \u201cI am confident it was conducted freely and fairly, without any type of outside influence,\u201d Esper told a news conference in Seoul, even as he noted that he had recused himself from the cloud competition.  Amazon says that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process. President Donald Trump has long criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos.  In a company-wide meeting on Thursday, Amazon Web Services\u2019 chief executive Andy Jassy said it would be challenging for a U.S. agency to award a contract objectively when the president is disparaging one of the contestants, according to an Amazon spokesman.  Amazon was considered a favorite for the contract, part of a broader digital modernization process of the Pentagon, before Microsoft emerged as the surprise winner.  In October, Esper removed himself from reviewing the deal due to his son\u2019s employment with one of the original contract applicants, IBM Corp. IBM had previously bid for the contract but had already been eliminated from the competition.  Esper said he was unaware of Amazon\u2019s specific accusations. His remarks followed a question about whether Trump asked the Pentagon to \u201cbypass Amazon\u201d for the contract.  A challenge to the Defense Department\u2019s award announced last month was widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after Trump publicly derided Amazon\u2019s bid for the high-stakes contract.  Trump had said in August that Amazon\u2019s bid for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, known as JEDI, contract was under review by his administration after complaints from other companies.  In a new book, retired Navy commander Guy Snodgrass, who served as a speech writer to former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said Trump called Mattis and directed him to \u201cscrew Amazon\u201d by preventing it from bidding on the JEDI contract.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that,\u201d Mattis later told other Pentagon officials, according to the book.  \u201cThis will be done by the book, both legally and ethically.\u201d","625":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, January 19, 2019.

Amazon group books most of its $11.4 billion of UK revenues via a UK branch of Luxembourg-based Amazon EU Sarl, Amazon\u2019s main European operating unit. This subsidiary had a tax bill of 54.9 million euros ($63.7 million)last year, despite booking a 876 million euro loss that was partly driven by large inter-group royalty payments, its accounts show.  Amazon EU Sarl\u2019s UK branch doesn\u2019t publish accounts so it\u2019s unclear how much UK tax Amazon pays in total, but it\u2019s likely that bill was above the reported charge of 1.7 million pounds last year.  If Amazon UK Services Ltd had paid the prevailing rate of tax of around 19 percent on its profits, its total bill would have been 14 million pounds.  Unlike some European countries, Britain allows companies to take generous deductions for stock options and share awards and many companies, especially in the technology sector, use the rules to reduce their tax bills significantly.  \u201cWe pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  \u201cCorporation tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given retail is a highly-competitive, low margin business,\u201d it added.

Amazon has reduced its tax bill by having Amazon EU Sarl pay large royalty fees to a tax exempt partnership, also based in Luxembourg., an arrangement that was challenged, unsuccessfully, by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  Lawmakers in the UK and other countries have proposed new forms of taxes including additional taxes on revenues to tackle the tech giants\u2019 tax planning strategies. Such a measure could have more impact on Amazon because it operates on low or negative profit margins in Europe, unlike rivals whose margins can top 30 percent of revenues.","629":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is planning to expand its Whole Foods Market portfolio by adding more stores to put more customers within its two-hour delivery service range, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing sources.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon Web Services (AWS) is seen during the 4th annual America Digital Latin American Congress of Business and Technology in Santiago, Chile, September 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Ivan Alvarado  The new Amazon Web Services chip uses technology from Softbank Group Corp-owned 9984.T Arm Holdings, the sources said. One of the sources familiar with the matter said it will be at least 20% faster than Amazon's first Arm-based chip, named Graviton, which was released last year as a low-cost option for easier computing tasks.  If Amazon Web Services' chip efforts are successful, it could lessen the unit's reliance on Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O for server chips.  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on future products or services. Arm declined to comment.  In cloud computing, businesses rent out servers from Amazon instead of running their own data centers. Analysts expect Amazon\u2019s cloud unit to generate $34.9 billion in sales in 2019, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Cloud computing has become big business for data center chip makers. Intel controls more than 90% of the server processor market, with AMD controlling most of the remainder. Intel\u2019s data center group generated almost of half of the company\u2019s overall operating profit last year.  And most server chips go to the cloud. In 2018, almost 65% of Intel\u2019s data center chip sales were from cloud and communications service providers, its executives have said.  COST OF OWNERSHIP  Chip designers using Arm technology want to challenge Intel's dominance. Arm chips power mobile phones today. But several companies aim to make them suitable for data centers, including startups run by former executives from Intel and Apple Inc AAPL.O.  Amazon\u2019s first Arm chip did not appear to have an impact on Intel\u2019s data center business, which continued to grow over the past year, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. But he said major technology companies, who spend billions each year with Intel and AMD with few alternatives, have the resources to make more powerful Arm chips.  \u201cArm by itself I\u2019m not worried about, but Arm in the hands of an Amazon or a Google who could potentially invest in it, that becomes potentially more problematic\u201d for Intel, Rasgon said.  Amazon\u2019s Arm effort appears to be making progress, one of the sources said. The new chip\u2019s speed gain \u201csends a message to the market\u201d that Amazon is serious about investing in Arm-based chips, the person said.  Both sources familiar with the matter said the new chip is not expected to be as powerful as Intel\u2019s \u201cCascade Lake\u201d or AMD\u2019s \u201cRome\u201d chips.  Though less powerful, Arm chips are cheaper and consume less electricity than Intel\u2019s top-end chips. Intel\u2019s most powerful chips can cost several thousand dollars, while barebones Arm-based server chips can cost less than $1,000.  In a data center that houses tens of thousands of servers, chip buyers often focus on a mix of factors - speed, chip size, power consumption and cooling costs - called the \u201ctotal cost of ownership.\u201d That is where Arm-based offerings hope to one day compete with Intel.  NEW ARM TECHNOLOGY  Amazon\u2019s first Graviton chip used Arm\u2019s older Cortex A72 technology. The forthcoming Amazon chip is expected to use newer Arm technology, most likely Arm\u2019s Neoverse N1 technology, one of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Foley\u2019s home insurer, State Farm, paid Foley more than $400,000 for repairs and related expenses. The insurer contends the fire was caused by a defective LG battery in Foley\u2019s vaping device. Last month, State Farm lawyers at Pillemer & Pillemer filed a complaint in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking to recoup the money it paid on Foley\u2019s claim.  The suit, which was removed earlier this month to federal district court in Los Angeles, names not just LG as a defendant, though. State Farm is also suing Amazon, which it blames for selling Foley the allegedly defective batteries in his vaping device. Amazon, represented by Friedenthal, Heffernan & Brown, said in an answer filed last week that it neither designed, manufactured nor sold the batteries. The online retailer also said it\u2019s shielded by the Communications Decency Act, which protects online publishers from claims based on content provided by someone else.  Obviously, if State Farm were to manage to pin liability on Amazon, the consequences would huge. But don\u2019t go selling your Amazon shares just yet. At least four previous plaintiffs have attempted to hold Amazon responsible for selling a defective product. So far, none has won.  Three of those cases are now before federal appellate courts in the 3rd, 4th and 6th Circuits. The next several months, in other words, are a bit of an appellate crucible for Amazon. If all three federal circuits uphold lower-court rulings that the company is not liable for selling defective products, Amazon will have pretty well squelched the threat of an onslaught of product liability suits. But if even one of circuits goes the other way, it\u2019s a good bet that consumers and insurers like State Farm will sit up and take notice.  The 3rd Circuit will hear oral arguments on Oct. 5 in Oberdorf v. Amazon, in which U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, granted summary judgment to Amazon last December. The litigation stems from a horrible accident. Heather Oberdorf was walking her dog in 2015 when the dog\u2019s retractable leash snapped back and hit her in the face, causing permanent damage to her eyesight. Oberdorf had purchased the leash through Amazon, but Judge Brann held the company isn\u2019t liable as a seller under Pennsylvania law because it has no role in the manufacture or selection of goods sold by vendors on the site.  \u201cThe Amazon Marketplace serves as a sort of newspaper classified ad section, connecting potential consumers with eager sellers in an efficient, modern, streamlined manner,\u201d the judge wrote. He also agreed with Amazon that the Communications Decency Act\u2019s safe harbor for online publishers protects the retailer from liability.  At the 4th Circuit, appellate briefing is complete in Erie v. Amazon, which stems from Erie Insurance\u2019s coverage for a house fire blamed on a faulty headlamp. U.S. District Judge Roger Titus of Greenbelt, Maryland, ruled in January that Amazon\u2019s online marketplace functions differently than, for instance, Home Depot. If Erie\u2019s policyholder were to have purchased the headlamp at Home Depot, the judge acknowledged, Home Depot could be held liable for selling it. But Amazon said clearly on its website that headlamp maker \u2013 and not Amazon itself \u2013 was selling the product. Amazon simply facilitated the sale, Judge Titus said, by storing and delivering the product and remitting payment to the seller.  \u201cThe vast majority of cases, both inside this circuit and outside of it, have concluded that under the circumstances of this case, Amazon cannot and must not be viewed as a seller of the head light,\u201d the judge said. \u201cAmazon did not manufacture, sell, deliver or offer this for sale product and the information about the product including price was created and uploaded by the seller. And, therefore, Amazon was not the seller.\u201d  The 6th Circuit appeal was just filed in late June, after U.S. District Judge William Campbell of Nashville concluded Amazon was not responsible for selling a hoverboard that allegedly triggered the fire that burned down the home of Charles and Megan Fox. Judge Campbell held Amazon does not fit Tennessee\u2019s definition of a seller. \u201cAmazon did not hold title to the product sold here, did not set the price of the product, and did not create the text describing or making representations about the product,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAmazon\u2019s role in the transaction was to provide a mechanism to facilitate the interchange between the entity seeking to sell the product and the individual who sought to buy it.\u201d (The judge also rejected the Foxes\u2019 theory that Amazon failed to warn buyers about problems with hoverboard batteries even after the company conducted its own extensive safety review.  Broadly speaking, the plaintiffs who want to hold Amazon responsible for providing the allegedly defective products are arguing that courts should not allow the company to evade liability through the technical loophole of its relationship with its vendors. For all practical purposes, they contend, Amazon is a seller, just like any retailer that distributes products made by other manufacturers. Amazon, represented in all three appeals by Perkins Coie, counters that its business model is fundamentally different from that of traditional retailers: It provides an online storefront and back-end services to more than a million vendors, but it does not sell their products itself so cannot be held responsible when those products are defective.  So far, Amazon\u2019s position has carried the day. We\u2019ll see if the company fares as well in the circuits as it has in trial courts.","632":"The Amazon logo is seen at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018.

Privately held French supermarket operator Systeme U said last week that it was discussing a possible grocery supply deal with Amazon, though a major deal between Amazon and a French retailer has yet to materialize.  Amazon has made small forays in that direction and has steadily been building its presence in France, where it has run its Amazon Prime Now express delivery service in Paris since 2016.  Last month Amazon said it would create 2,000 new jobs in France and it has also settled a long-running dispute with French tax authorities that had been seeking nearly 200 million euros from the company.  In a separate interview with Journal du Dimanche, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said: \u201c Amazon is welcomed in France because my absolute priority is to create jobs, and Amazon represents thousands of jobs.\u201d  Le Maire also said that \u201cpartnerships are under discussions between Amazon and some French groups, notably in the food products sector\u201d and that the government would ensure fair competition.","633":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has agreed not to sell foie gras in California from birds that have been force fed and pay $100,000 in penalties and costs as part of a lawsuit settlement, a prosecutor said Friday.  The lawsuit filed by prosecutors in Los Angeles, Monterey and Santa Clara counties accused the world\u2019s largest online retailer of violating a 2004 state law banning sales of the fatty duck and goose liver if it was produced by force-feeding poultry.  A judge approved the settlement on Thursday between Amazon and the three prosecutors, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.  Amazon declined comment.  To produce foie gras, ducks and geese are force-fed over a period of days by having metal pipes pushed down their throats so grain and fat can be pumped into their stomachs. Prosecutors said the process was cruel and painful.  Prosecutors contacted Amazon several years ago regarding their concerns and the company took step to stop foie gras sales. As the parties were in negotiations, the foie gras industry launched a lawsuit against California\u2019s ban and a U.S. court blocked it in 2015.  A federal appeals court overturned that ruling in 2017 and said the state was free to enforce it. North American foie gras producers have now asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up their case.","634":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O has won the U.S. Pentagon's $10 billion cloud-computing contract, the Defense Department said on Friday, beating out favorite Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.

Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award:  JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals from competitors, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. It said the deal\u2019s initial two-year period would provide time to ensure JEDI was up to standards, noting that new contractors would be needed for other cloud computing demands in the future. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September.  AUGUST 6, 2018: Oracle Corp ORCL.N filed a protest with the DOD over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more. DOD's Government Accountability Office had until November to respond.  OCTOBER 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google said it was no longer vying for the $10 billion cloud computing contract with the DOD, in part because the company's new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.  OCTOBER 9, 2018: Microsoft said its expanded Azure cloud service to help government clients save data on their own servers would be available by the end of the first quarter of 2019, as it battled Amazon.com for the contract.  NOVEMBER 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \u201creasonably\u201d determined that the single-award approach was in the government\u2019s best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.  APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected to continue competing for Pentagon cloud-computing services as part of a contract that could be worth some $10 billion.  The selection left Oracle and IBM Corp IBM.N out of the competition for the contract, which is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  JULY 18, 2019: U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was looking closely at Amazon.com\u2019s bid on a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD after getting complaints from other technology companies.  JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD.  AUGUST 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon.com Inc\u2019s bid following complaints from other technology companies.  AUGUST 5, 2019: Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper if \u201coutside\u201d influence caused him to delay awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract, after Trump suggested Amazon.com Inc should not win it.

The lawmakers, led by Cory Booker and including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, pointed to a news report that said disinfectant wipes and sanitizers were in low supply at Amazon facilities. The letter said workers risked poor performance ratings if they took sufficient time to wash their hands after coughing or sneezing on the job, also citing a news report.  \u201cAny failure of Amazon to keep its workers safe does not just put their employees at risk, it puts the entire country at risk,\u201d the letter said, noting the virus could survive up to 24 hours on cardboard such as Amazon packaging, according to media.  The senators\u2019 letter reflects the intense pressure Amazon is under to keep warehouses, workers and the public safe while it delivers goods to consumers around the world, some of whom are under lockdown. It also reflects ongoing tensions between a company whose chief is the world\u2019s richest person and Democrats who have long criticized its working conditions and pay.  The other signatories were Senators Robert Menendez and Sherrod Brown.  Seattle-based Amazon has seen a rush of business as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier this week it said it would receive only vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, in order to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand.  Amazon has said it increased cleaning of stair rails, door handles and other surfaces at its buildings. It has staggered work times, ended stand-up meetings during shifts and required hand-washing after someone sneezes or coughs.  \u201cWe have worked closely with local authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve customers while taking care of our associates,\u201d Amazon has said.  The letter asked that Amazon answer several questions in writing by March 26, including whether it would agree to cover employees\u2019 COVID-19 test costs and whether it would offer paid sick leave to workers who are not diagnosed with the virus.  The company has announced other benefits for employees fearful of contagion, such as unlimited unpaid time off for hourly workers through the end of March.  The coronavirus has led to at least 11,147 deaths globally, largely in Italy and China. There have been employees at Amazon\u2019s headquarters who have contracted the disease, as well as employees in Europe, where more than 200 workers staged a strike on Wednesday calling for the closure of a shipping center in Saran, south of Paris.  Amazon said this week it was closing a New York City delivery station for a period of cleaning after a worker there tested positive for the virus. The senators asked if Amazon would pledge similar temporary shutdowns should the same circumstance arise at facilities in the future.  One of the biggest U.S. employers, Amazon has opened more than 500,000 full- and part-time jobs in the country, many of them for fulfillment and delivery roles. It said this week it would hire 100,000 more U.S. warehouse and delivery workers to deal with the surge in online orders during the outbreak.

REUTERS\/ Yves Herman  Amazon led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May last year making what the two parties called \"a minority investment\" and pitching it against Uber Eats UBER.N and Just Eat Takeaway.com TKWY.AS in the global race to dominate the market for meal deliveries.  Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched a detailed investigation in December, saying the deal could damage competition by discouraging Amazon from re-entering the online restaurant food market and further developing its presence within the online convenience grocery delivery market.  The CMA provisionally cleared the deal in April, saying it had become clear that the coronavirus crisis was damaging Deliveroo\u2019s revenues, given the closure of a large number of the restaurants available through its platform during the lockdown. It said Deliveroo could go out of business without Amazon\u2019s investment.  That provisional clearance was criticised in submissions by companies including Just Eat Takeaway and Dominos Pizza DOM.L.  The regulator was due to make its final ruling by June 11 but has now extended the deadline to August 6.  \u201cIn taking this decision, the (CMA) had regard to the need to take full account of representations received from the parties and third parties in response to the provisional findings and to reflect the impact of coronavirus ... in its assessment,\u201d it said on Wednesday.  Deliveroo said it was disappointed by the delay.  \u201cDeliveroo has repeatedly provided evidence to show that Deliveroo and Amazon offer completely different services, will remain distinct entities, and this investment will in fact clearly strengthen competition,\u201d a spokeswoman said.  Amazon said it was committed to the Deliveroo investment.","648":"LIMA (Reuters) - Canadian energy company PetroTal Corp has resumed operations at its oil block in the Peruvian Amazon after residents of a nearby town seized its installations and halted production for 30 hours, an industry group said on Wednesday.

Amazon Prime Now provides free delivery, with some restrictions, for subscribers of Amazon\u2019s $99 Prime service that also offers free video streaming and other perks. Instacart users in Los Angeles pay a delivery fee of $5.99 to $7.99 at Sprouts, or can choose to pay a $149 membership fee.  Sprouts also cut its full-year sales forecasts.  Its new net sales forecast calls for growth in the range of 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent versus 11.5 percent to 12.5 percent previously.

The service, Amazon Pharmacy, has begun and will soon offer deliveries across the city, Amazon said. It offers both over-the-counter and prescription-based drugs as well as basic health devices and traditional Indian herbal medicines.

The story gave no indication about the value of the bids. Sources had earlier told here Reuters that these networks could be worth as much as $20 billion.  An unnamed sovereign wealth fund and the New York Yankees are also bidding for the New York network, CNBC said.  If Amazon clinches the deal, it would pay a higher price than the $13.7 billion the retail giant paid to buy Whole Foods Co last year.  Amazon has moved aggressively into TV to bolster its Prime membership service, which offers free delivery and content for a flat monthly fee. Its bid for the sports assets underlines its ambition to take on traditional pay-TV broadcasters in one of their most reliable sources of revenue.  \u201cI\u2019ve always viewed Amazon\u2019s video strategy as having three elements to it \u2013 Prime Instant Video, the Channels business and live ad-supported TV,\u201d Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.  \u201cThe latter is the least built-out, but the RSNs (regional sports networks) would fit well in terms of establishing this part of the offering.\u201d  Amazon already has rights to air 20 English Premier League soccer matches, giving its Prime Video online streaming service a foothold in the most-watched sports league in the world. It also has rights to America\u2019s National Football League and National Hockey League.  Sports leagues are anticipating that the big tech companies will bid aggressively when rights come up for renewal in the next few years.  Facebook and Twitter Inc already stream live sports events.  Fox Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch had hinted earlier this month that it could buy back the regional sports networks it sold to Disney.

The services are designed to work for titles played on any device - including those with operating systems from Microsoft\u2019s onetime rivals like Apple and Google.  Microsoft competes against Amazon Web Services division to sell those cloud services. But it has been in the console gaming business with its Xbox device since 2001 and had 64 million users for its XBox Live online gaming service. Microsoft also owns titles such as the \u201cHalo,\u201d the sci-fi action franchise for the Xbox and Windows, as well as \u201cMinecraft,\u201d a game that is popular on mobile devices with operating systems from Apple Inc and Google Inc.

REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso\/File Photo  During the Tuesday and Wednesday annual shopping event that spans 19 countries, the company will again showcase the discounts and free shipping that come along with a paid Prime membership \u2013 a strategy that has helped Amazon reel in repeat shoppers around the world.  Even so, analysts say Amazon faces an uphill battle in Latin America\u2019s top two economies, where success or failure will set the bar for whether it can take on the rest of the region.  \u201cAmazon in Latin America is not the monster that it is in the United States,\u201d said Marcos Pueyrredon, president of Buenos Aires-based eCommerce Institute.  Amazon does not release country-specific sales data, yet website traffic statistics suggest Amazon is struggling to keep up with Argentina\u2019s MercadoLibre.  In Mexico, where Amazon launched its marketplace in 2015, it trailed second behind MercadoLibre for most unique visitors in August, according to the media analytics firm ComScore.  In Brazil, a more fragmented market that Amazon joined in 2017, it sat in fifth place after MercadoLibre and local e-commerce powerhouses like B2W, Via Varejo and Magazine Luiza.  Gloria Canales, head of marketing for Amazon in Mexico, said the company has been pleased with growth there, and will keep investing.  \u201cWe strive everyday to add selection, to improve shipping rates, to improve our payment methods. We\u2019re confident that that\u2019s what makes us successful.\u201d  It is not like Amazon, which in July posted the biggest profit in its 26-year history, cannot afford to play the long game.  Prime, which in Mexico charges users 99 pesos ($4.67) a month or 899 pesos ($42.38) a year and offers a slew of music, games and original television along with free shipping, \u201chas been one of the biggest engines of growth that we\u2019ve had in the country,\u201d she said.  Just in time for Prime Day, Amazon recently opened its first so-called fulfillment centers outside the Mexico City area, one in Guadalajara and another in Monterrey.  These massive warehouses boasting inventories of key products will help to speed up shipping to more regions.  In Brazil, where Prime costs 9.90 reais ($1.79) a month or 89 reais ($16.09) a year, Amazon began offering memberships just a year ago. Since then, it has seen the fastest subscription growth of any Prime market, with members now in 95% of municipalities, Amazon said in a statement.  Yet, Prime alone may not be enough to boost Amazon\u2019s fortunes, said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, pointing out inventory and distribution as two key areas where Amazon needs to improve.  \u201cUndoubtedly it\u2019s growing,\u201d he said of the Prime program. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a question about growing, it\u2019s about trying to keep pace with MercadoLibre.\u201d  That can be a challenge despite the fact that the local champion lacks a membership perks program on par with Prime. Adding to MercadoLibre\u2019s headstart since its 1999 founding, the company has a broad base of sellers and understands the local terrain.  Lyana Kahn, founder of Mexican jewelry company LuckyLy, said her sales on Amazon have benefited from Prime\u2019s shipping and discount perks for customers.  \u201cIt\u2019s a great platform that gives you the push to reach more customers without a huge investment,\u201d Kahn said. Even so, LuckyLy also sells its sparkly earrings and gold-plated necklaces on several other sites, including MercadoLibre.  \u201cEvery platform has something different to offer,\u201d Kahn said. \u201cThere\u2019s space for everything.\u201d  ($1 = 21.2110 Mexican pesos; 5.5316 reais)","661":"The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018.

Witzig is in the process of acquiring Aditya Birla Retail, which runs over 540 More stores across India, according to a stock exchange filing.  The U.S. tech company would effectively own a stake in More's supermarkets and hypermarkets, intensifying competition with rival Walmart WMT.N, which acquired Indian online marketplace Flipkart this year.  Amazon and Samara Capital have agreed to co-invest in Witzig, a spokeswoman for Amazon said in an emailed statement.  \u201cThrough this investment, Amazon looks to enhance its services portfolio and meaningfully invest in and create opportunities for skill development and job creation.\u201d  Amazon, which entered India in 2013, expects groceries and household products to account for more than half of its business in India in the next five years, its country head told Reuters in an interview earlier this year.

Local media pegged More\u2019s enterprise value at roughly $580 million and that Samara would own a majority stake in Witzig because of Indian restrictions on foreign ownership of multi-brand retail stores.

Shopping bags from Asda and Sainsbury's are seen in Manchester, Britain April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Phil Noble\/illustration  The Sainsbury deal to buy Asda, announced on Monday, comes as retailers on both sides of the Atlantic grapple with heightened competition from the discounters such as Germany\u2019s Aldi and Lidl and e-commerce giant Amazon.  The marriage of Britain\u2019s second- and third-largest grocers will not immediately impact Amazon\u2019s food offering which remains small in Britain. The biggest impact will come away from the grocery aisle, in the area of general merchandise, where Amazon and Sainsbury\u2019s already go head-to-head.  Britons are among the world\u2019s most comfortable online shoppers. About 22 percent of non-food purchases are already done online, the highest percentage for any country aside from South Korea, according to Shore Capital analyst Clive Black. He estimates that Amazon has about 40 percent of that market.  \u201cThe UK is a very important market in terms of Amazon\u2019s international ambitions ... and will remain an important market,\u201d Black said. \u201cThis proposed merger makes it a little bit more competitive, but I don\u2019t think Jeff Bezos will be losing sleep over it.\u201d  Amazon is Britain's largest online retailer overall, with 30 percent of the market, according to Euromonitor, followed by eBay EBAY.O with 11 percent and Sainsbury's with 7 percent.  ADDING SCALE, REDUCING PRICES  Sainbury\u2019s significantly boosted its online presence with the 2016 acquisition of general merchandise chain Argos, which expanded Sainsbury\u2019s product line to over 90,000 non-food products from computers to garden furniture to wedding rings.  Argos will get a big boost from the combination with Asda, as Sainsbury\u2019s plans to install branches of the chain inside Asda stores.  The deal will also add scale to Sainsbury\u2019s non-food offerings, especially in clothing. Asda\u2019s George brand and Sainsbury\u2019s Tu brand will together become a larger No. 2 player, by volume.  The merged Sainsbury and Asda chains will also seek to bolster their online business, using its enlarged footprint of stores and warehouses to deliver products faster and over a wider area.  Aside from the pricing pressure on suppliers that would come in any retail consolidation, Sainsbury\u2019s said it aimed to reduce prices by around 10 percent on everyday items, easing the burden on Britain\u2019s shoppers.  Sainsbury\u2019s said about 350 million pounds of the 500 million pounds of synergies it has identified will come from eliminating pricing discrepancies between the two chains.  AMAZON\u2019S AMBITIONS  Amazon sent shockwaves through the retail industry when it agreed in June 2017 to buy U.S. upscale grocer Whole Foods Market in a $13.7 billion deal. Since the merger closed in August, Amazon has cut grocery prices, added lockers for picking up online orders in stores and started selling its suite of Echo gadgets in stores, too.  But in Britain, the food market is about 60 percent controlled by the top five players Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrison's MRW.L and Aldi [ALDIEI.UL].  Amazon is testing AmazonFresh, which offers same-day delivery but its overall share of the market however, remains tiny.  \u201cSainsbury\u2019s and Asda are very aware of a potential Amazon acquisition in the UK supermarket industry, which is why they are looking for scale in order to safeguard their future,\u201d said Philip Benton, a consultant at Euromonitor.  Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said the combination of Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, and the pricing pressure that comes from it, could make the UK slightly less attractive for Amazon, but didn\u2019t think it would be a deal-breaker.  \u201cIt raises a question mark probably for anyone who is thinking of entering the market,\u201d Khalaf said. \u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure to what extent Amazon is committed to the UK grocery market, but this may give it pause for thought.\u201d  He noted however that Amazon\u2019s size, scale and profitability allow Amazon to often forego immediate concerns around profitability.  \u201cThey\u2019re usually willing to take a hit if they think there\u2019s a long-term game they can win,\u201d he said.  The deal perhaps \u201cwill amp up the potential of a store strategy\u201d for Amazon, said Tom Furphy, former vice president of consumables and AmazonFresh, and now chief executive of Consumer Equity Partners. \u201cBut they tend to not be reactive to competition in favor of focusing on their own innovation.\u201d  Investec analysts said the UK was already one of the most consolidated grocery markets in the world, pointing to Tesco's TSCO.L acquisition of wholesaler Booker, which closed in March, Co-op's proposed takeover of wholesaler Nisa, and last year's collapse of wholesaler Palmer & Harvey.  If Amazon wanted to buy another UK grocery retailer, the only one it probably could not buy, according to Shore Capital\u2019s\u2019 Black, would be Sainsbury\u2019s, because of the non-food overlap. Tesco would fit well, he said.  However not everyone predicts Amazon will buy another brick-and-mortar retailer, given its business model revolves predominantly around e-commerce and they will have learned some important lessons already from the purchase of Whole Foods.  \u201cThey got something out of the Whole Foods deal, which gave them a brand, credibility in the food space and knowledge of the food supply chain,\u201d said investment banker Shaun Browne of Houlihan Lokey. \u201cI think they will feel that\u2019s what they need, and after buying Whole Foods they don\u2019t really need the purchase of a Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s.\u201d  Amazon declined to comment, and Walmart did not immediately return a request for comment.","666":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Wednesday said it temporarily would not require sellers in its marketplace to repay loans it had made to them, as merchants confront the prospect of declining sales during the coronavirus pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon logo is seen in front of diplayed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in this illustration taken March 19, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The world\u2019s largest online retailer notified sellers that its program known as Amazon Lending would pause repayments beginning Thursday until April 30. Interest would not accrue during that period, it said.  The program has offered sums between $1,000 and $750,000 to merchants looking for capital to acquire inventory, expand their product lines and advertise on Amazon.  \u201cLoan repayments will restart on May 1, 2020 ... You will have the same number of remaining payments once repayment resumes,\u201d Amazon said in a seller message obtained by Reuters.  More than 20,000 merchants have gotten loans from Amazon, the company said in 2017. By the end of 2019, Amazon stood to receive $863 million from sellers to whom it provided financing through the lending program, according to a company filing. The loans\u2019 terms range from three to 12 months, carrying interest rates from 6% to 19.9%.  As Americans turn to online shopping while quarantined, many online sellers, who are small and medium-sized businesses, are facing cash flow constraints amid supply chain and logistics issues caused by the outbreak. EBay Inc EBAY.O, another major online marketplace, said on Wednesday it will defer most selling fees for merchants for 30 days.  Amazon\u2019s offer may provide relief to sellers, some of whom could be hard hit by Amazon\u2019s recent decision to restrict its U.S. and European fulfillment services to household, medical and other essential goods during the outbreak.  Merchants of popular items from toys to apparel have worried that the temporary ban on stocking goods in Amazon warehouses, on which they depend for delivery, would mean low sales and difficulty paying back loans.  Jamison Philippi, an Amazon seller of toys and video games in Hackensack, New Jersey, had estimated to Reuters his income could drop by 75% just as he had a roughly $3,500 loan payment due to Amazon on April 1.  \u201cThat\u2019s super awesome. I cheered when I got that email. That relieves a lot of stress right now,\u201d Philippi said.  Amazon\u2019s move came after at least one rival offered sellers relief.  Ricardo Pero, chief executive of lending company SellersFunding, last week told Reuters he was easing terms to help sellers on Amazon and other marketplaces navigate the rapidly changing retail market. SellersFunding offers lines of credit and term loans to new and existing borrowers. Both products offer a 90-day interest-only period.  Amazon, which had won customers by continually making shipping faster over the years, has now slowed delivery to weeks in some cases in order to manage a flood of orders. That could also dampen merchants\u2019 sales as shoppers look elsewhere for goods.","667":"FILE PHOTO: Jeff Bezos, president and CEO of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post, speaks at the Economic Club of Washington DC's \"Milestone Celebration Dinner\" in Washington, U.S., September 13, 2018.

The demonstration, which came after a worker there tested positive for the virus, has not impacted fulfillment of customer orders, Amazon said.  The news reflects the operational risks facing the world\u2019s largest online retailer if more workers contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and if their peers quit in protest.  Earlier this week, 15 employees at an Amazon fulfillment center in Staten Island, New York joined a walkout, and dozens more went on strike at a company facility near Florence, Italy.  Amazon fired the organizer of the New York walkout after he allegedly put others at risk by violating a company request to stay at home for two weeks, a dismissal that prompted the city to open an investigation. The organizer had had close contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19.  In response, the AFL-CIO, several other unions and New York elected officials on Wednesday sent a letter to Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, calling for the worker\u2019s reinstatement and for warehouse closures with full pay for staff.

Online grocery shopping has yet to take off in Japan, where consumers are accustomed to shopping daily for fresh foods such as fish. But growing numbers of working women and improved technology and logistics networks are expected to change that.  Aeon\u2019s rival Seiyu, operated by Walmart Inc, launched an online grocery venture with e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc in 2018, aiming to compete with the likes of Amazon Fresh.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon\u2019s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips.  Amazon\u2019s so-called \u201cInferentia\u201d chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests.  The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia\u2019s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer.  Intel\u2019s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel.  In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton. That chip is powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Arm-based chips currently power mobile phones, but multiple companies are trying to make them suitable for data centers. [nL2N1W402B] The use of Arm chips in data centers potentially represents a major challenge to Intel\u2019s dominance in that market.  Amazon is not alone among cloud computing vendors in designing its own chips. Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u2019s cloud unit in 2016 unveiled an artificial intelligence chip designed to take on chips from Nvidia.  Custom chips can be expensive to design and produce, and analysts have pointed to such investment driving up research and capital expenses for big tech companies.  Google Cloud executives have said customer demand for Google\u2019s custom chip, the TPU, has been strong. But the chips can be costly to use and require software customization.  Google Cloud charges $8 per hour of access to its TPU chips and as much as $2.48 per hour in the United States for access to Nvidia\u2019s chips, according to Google\u2019s website.","681":"FILE PHOTO - Products are moved on conveyer belts inside Amazon's main fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, near Madrid, Spain, November 10, 2015.

They compare the state of Brazilian e-commerce to that of the U.S. market 10 years ago \u2014 only Amazon\u2019s slow rollout here gave rivals a chance to prepare.  Helped by Brazil\u2019s richest man and search giant Google, competitors are copying many of Amazon\u2019s signature moves. Those strategies have sped up delivery, earned customer loyalty and boosted offerings through partnerships with third-party sellers. And unlike Amazon, home-grown players such as Magazine Luiza have decades of experience with the country\u2019s working-class consumers and tangles of red tape \u2014 key survival skills in Brazil\u2019s retail jungle.  \u201cWe see room for several players,\u201d said Eduardo Carlier, a fund manager at AZ Quest Investimentos, a major shareholder in Magazine Luiza. \u201cWe think the winner-take-all model that played out in the United States is going to be tempered in Brazil.\u201d  Amazon declined to comment.  SLOW START  With a population of more than 200 million people, Brazil is key to Amazon\u2019s global expansion plans. But as in China and India, where it ran into strong competition, Amazon is playing catch-up in Brazil.  Amazon entered Brazil quietly in 2012, peddling e-readers, books and then streaming movies in a fast-growing e-commerce market that has since doubled to $20 billion.  Like a predator lurking at the edges of the market, Amazon has kept competitors uneasy, wondering when it would attack their core business.  They got their answer in October, when the world\u2019s largest online retailer opened a Brazilian marketplace for third-party sellers of an array of physical products.  Shares in Magazine Luiza, rival B2W Cia Digital, and market-leading MercadoLibre Inc, fell nearly 20 percent on the news.  Yet all three rebounded quickly in the following weeks. Their shares have continued to climb this year as Brazil\u2019s economy picks up and the companies employ strategies that could have been ripped from Amazon\u2019s own playbook.  Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann and partners at 3G Capital, the investment firm behind the Kraft Heinz Co merger, have invested heavily in B2W through its brick-and-mortar parent Lojas Americanas SA. Their backing has let B2W spend aggressively on in-house logistics, a third-party marketplace and efforts to integrate operations with Lojas Americanas.  In a cheeky move, B2W uses the name \u201cPrime\u201d for its shopping club offering fast shipping for annual membership fees, the same moniker used by Amazon for a similar service in other markets. Amazon uses \u201cPrime\u201d only for its streaming video offerings in Brazil.  Another online rival, MercadoLibre, was founded in Buenos Aires two decades ago to replicate the eBay Inc marketplace model across Latin America. It has held its own against Amazon in Mexico and leads the Brazilian market in online sales, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Its Brazil unit grew 80 percent last year, providing nearly 60 percent of net revenue.  Last year, MercadoLibre opened a warehouse near Sao Paulo to store and ship third-party goods, accelerating delivery using a model similar to the pioneering \u201cFulfilled by Amazon\u201d service.  Brazilian retailers are also getting an assist from Silicon Valley. Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google briefed its Brazilian advertisers last year on Amazon\u2019s forays into markets such as India and Mexico to help them prepare, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Google\u2019s head of retail in Brazil, Claudia Sciama, acknowledged that Brazilian clients had been asking what a ramp-up by Amazon could mean.  \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is an exploratory study to understand how they might enter different markets,\u201d Sciama said. She declined to provide details.  DIGITAL LEAP  Few Brazilian retailers have done as much to reinvent themselves in recent years as Magazine Luiza.  Founded six decades ago as a gift shop in the shoemaking hub of Franca, in Sao Paulo state, the unpretentious retailer became a national player in the 1990s selling appliances, furniture and electronics on credit to poor families ignored by bigger chains.  Chairwoman Luiza Trajano started on the sales floor as a teenager and in 1991 took over the company founded by her aunt. She steered it to a public listing in 2011, expanding operations to more than 800 locations across the country at present.  Yet Magazine Luiza\u2019s digital leap, with her son at the helm, may be the most dramatic transformation yet. Frederico Trajano launched e-commerce operations in 2000 and has made it the company\u2019s central focus since becoming CEO in January 2016.  Using brick-and-mortar stores as delivery hubs to cut costs and win over wary online shoppers, Trajano is accelerating both internet sales and new store openings. Digital sales channels grew 61 percent last year to make up nearly a third of revenue, while profit more than quadrupled.  Magazine Luiza plans to open about 100 new stores this year, up from nearly 60 in 2017, according to two people familiar with the matter. The company has said it may open more stores in 2018 than last year.  For Trajano, those outlets form the backbone of his digital strategy, putting inventory closer to consumers and cutting the cost of storage and order processing.  Trajano said fulfillment consumes up to 15 percent of Brazilian e-commerce revenue, compared to as little as 8 percent in the United States, due to Brazil\u2019s lousy infrastructure, high borrowing costs and lower levels of automation.  Each new store is \u201ca free distribution center,\u201d Trajano said in an interview at Magazine Luiza\u2019s unassuming headquarters by a highway in Sao Paulo.  \u201cWhy do you think Amazon bought Whole Foods?\u201d he said.  CROWDED BACK ROOMS  To be sure, Trajano\u2019s vision of seamless integration between e-commerce and physical stores is a work in progress.  When shopper Oliveira went to fetch her sandwich press, she joined a line of impatient customers waiting at the Aricanduva shopping mall on the gritty east side of Sao Paulo.  In the back room, Magazine Luiza staff hunted for her order on shelves piled with plates, shampoo, microwaves and tires. On a February analyst call, Trajano acknowledged the company\u2019s stores need to be better retrofitted to handle the flow of online orders.  Magazine Luiza is also sharpening its home delivery operation. The company has around 1,500 dedicated truckers running its own app, updating routes and communicating with sellers, warehouses, stores and customers in real time.  Trajano lauds Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as \u201cthe best CEO in the world,\u201d but said his company will face a steep learning curve in Brazil, given its notoriously tough business climate.  Case in point: Brazilian consumers have long paid sales taxes on online purchases, unlike in the United States, where internet commerce got a break in its early years.  \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing the Brazilian government knows how to do, it\u2019s collect taxes,\u201d Trajano said.","683":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc would consider teaming up with Amazon.com Inc and other tech giants to offer live sports, its chief told Reuters, fresh from announcing a $9.6 billion deal to buy Disney\u2019s regional sports networks.  On Friday, Sinclair announced a deal to buy Walt Disney Co\u2019s collection of 21 regional sports networks (RSNs), turning the largest U.S. broadcast station owner into one of the biggest live news and sports companies this side of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corp.  With Walt Disney Co, Amazon, Netflix Inc and AT&T Inc just some of the combatants now in the video streaming wars, \u201cThere is only going to be more competition and more interest for key assets like this in the future,\u201d President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley said, in response to a question about licensing sports to big tech companies. \u201cWe have an interest in as broad a distribution as possible.\u201d  The deal is a capstone to Sinclair\u2019s expansion from a stodgy TV station owner to a conservative-leaning media company stitching together 190 local TV stations across the country.  In January, it launched an advertising-supported streaming TV service called STIRR. It is also modernizing its broadcast technology to the new ATSC 3.0 standard, which will let it act more like an online TV company by offering interactivity and ads targeted to viewers.  In an interview on Sunday, Ripley said the deal was a bargain because Disney needed to sell the assets to gain approval for its $71.3 billion deal to buy the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox from Murdoch.  The sports networks are valued at five and a half times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, after tax benefits, compared to MSG Networks which trades at around eight times.  Disney is selling the YES Network separately for $3.5 billion to the New York Yankees and Amazon, according to a person familiar with the deal. Sinclair also reportedly has a stake in that deal. Amazon and the Yankees did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  But Sinclair\u2019s doubling down on traditional TV appears to run counter to the shift in consumers away from traditional television, broadcast and pay TV to digital services owned by Netflix and Google.  Ripley said battling the tech giants head-on, as Disney and AT&T are preparing to do with upcoming digital video services, made no sense for the much smaller Sinclair.  \u201cWe\u2019re a local media company with a strong focus in local news and we continue to see that as an area that will have strong relevancy if we took it multiplatform and not be an area flooded by cheap cash by big tech,\u201d he said.  The company views live sports as a long term profitable business because of its scarcity.  \u201cThere are only 160 or so baseball games a year,\u201d Ripley said. \u201cNo matter how much money that Amazon or Google or Apple throws at the MLB (Major League Baseball), they can\u2019t really change that dynamic very easily.\u201d  Profits could be hurt as the sports network\u2019s contracts with pay television providers are up for renewal in the next two year, according to BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield.  Ripley said those contracts expire over as long as a few years to 15 years.  Sinclair already distributes content to multiple cable, satellite and streaming companies, including YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google. Adding more digital clients like Amazon would be just another distributor relationship, he said.  BETTING THE FUTURE  The acquisition will see Sinclair capitalizing on the new U.S. sports betting market.  In addition to increased fan engagement and viewership, he expects $1.5 billion to $2 billion of new ad revenue industry-wide \u201cin short order,\u201d from sportsbook operators and other companies marketing in the space.  Ripley also plans to eventually allow viewers to place bets right from their screens during live games, similar to how fans can wager in Europe now.  \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in gaming, we\u2019re going to add on extra stats, the ability to do prop bets in the game, pitch by pitch, play by play,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can play along and wager while you watch.\u201d  The in-game, on-screen wagers, which it is currently exploring with its Tennis Channel, would be done in partnership with sportsbook operators, but Sinclair would not want to become a bookie itself.","684":"PARIS, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Casino\u2019s upmarket Monoprix supermarket chain said the start of its partnership with Amazon Prime\u2019s delivery service for Paris had been better than expected - an alliance that could prove crucial for debt-ridden Casino\u2019s fortunes.  Monoprix Chief Executive Regis Schultz told Reuters that orders had been beating expectations, and that he hoped the delivery service could be extended elsewhere in France, although the decision was in the hands of e-commerce giant Amazon.  Nearly a month after the launch, the number of orders was exceeding by 2-3 times the expectations of the two partners, he said.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, April 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Amazon and Morrisons have had a tie-up since 2016 and have been steadily expanding their links, leading to speculation that the U.S. group could even emerge as a possible bidder for Britain\u2019s No. 4 supermarket chain. Both sides habitually decline comment on such market talk.  The coronavirus pandemic has seen a marked rise in demand for online groceries. Market researcher Nielsen said on Tuesday online grocery participation had grown to 14% of the UK grocery market in the 12 weeks to Aug. 8, double its pre-crisis rate.  Amazon and Morrisons said on Wednesday that Prime members would as part of their subscription be able to receive same-day delivery on orders of more than 40 pounds ($53) for no extra cost directly on the Amazon.co.uk website.  For orders worth less than 40 pounds there will be a 3.99 pound delivery charge.  They said \u201cMorrisons on Amazon\u201d launched in Leeds, northern England, and will be expanded to millions of Prime members across the United Kingdom in the coming weeks.  It will offer thousands of grocery products including meat, seafood, dairy and baked goods, fruit and vegetables. Prices will be the same as at Morrisons\u2019 stores.  Orders will be picked from local Morrisons stores by Morrisons staff and delivered to customers by Amazon partners.  Prime is Amazon\u2019s core retail proposition, costing an annual membership fee of 79 pounds. Membership provides access to unlimited one-day delivery as well as services such as TV, movies and music.  The Morrisons deal builds on Amazon\u2019s move last month to begin free delivery of its own grocery service to Prime members.  Morrisons, which has a 10.2% market share, trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Walmart\u2019s Asda in annual sales.  Earlier this week Tesco CEO Dave Lewis told The Sunday Telegraph it planned to add free delivery to its Clubcard Plus loyalty scheme.

FILE PHOTO: The headquarter of the European Central Bank (ECB) is photographed during sunset, as the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in Frankfurt, Germany, April 28, 2020. REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach  The blueprint, devised by top European Central Bank (ECB) officials, is part of efforts by the 19-state euro zone to tackle a growing pile of unpaid loans and aims to prevent \u201cdistressed debt\u201d funds from buying them at rock bottom prices.  \u201cThe idea is to open up the market to buyers of smaller portfolios, with an Amazon or eBay-style marketplace, where you can browse ... That can get the market moving,\u201d Edward O\u2019Brien, a senior ECB official involved in the plan, told Reuters.  Large funds bought billions of euros of loans in the aftermath of the last financial crisis, in the process acquiring swathes of property some of which has since risen in value.  \u201cThe market for bad loans has been dominated by a few very large buyers. In a typical scenario, one of these firms may buy a very large portfolio at steep discounts,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.  A study by Deloitte found that of the more than 450 billion euros ($529 billion) of loans sold in Europe between 2014 and 2019, roughly half were bought by Cerberus, Blackstone, Lone Star and Goldman Sachs.  Blackstone and Cerberus did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs and Lone Star both declined to comment.  Banks offload bad debts, normally at a fraction of their face value, to free up their balance sheets to make new loans and keep both their own business and economies going.  The ECB scheme, which has yet to be signed off and will be discussed with European Union officials on Friday, is inspired by Italian website BlinkS, which links buyers and sellers of loans, as well as debt auctions by a U.S. federal agency.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  If EU states agree, the new marketplace could come under the Single Resolution Board (SRB), a European Union agency in Brussels that winds up failing banks.  \u201cWhy is it that every public contract has to be put out to tender in an open competition and bad loans can be sold off behind closed doors?\u201d Bostjan Jazbec, an SRB director, said.  \u201cSuccess in buying and selling bad loans involves a lot of insider information. COVID means more bad loans ahead. Any sale must be transparent,\u201d Jazbec added.  Debt in the euro zone considered unlikely to ever be fully repaid stands at more than half a trillion euros, including credit cards, car loans and mortgages, and is set to rise.  John Fell, a second senior ECB official involved, said these bad loans presented a wider challenge.  \u201cThe problem is bad loans is too often understood to be one that is limited to banks. But it is far wider, it affects the whole economy,\u201d Fell said.  BALANCING ACT  It is usual for banks to sell old loans to investors, with individual packages sometimes topping 10 billion euros, but the ECB is concerned that this is skewed in favour of big buyers.  \u201cThere are only about half a dozen buyers who can write a cheque for hundreds of millions of euros,\u201d said Gifford West of DebtX, which runs a similar platform in the U.S., adding that packaging the loans into smaller bundles could widen the pool of buyers up to 1,000.  Under the new platform contemplated by the ECB, which could be up and running early next year, the packet size could be cut to 10 million euros, attracting smaller buyers who may pay more.  As well as an economic angle to the ECB\u2019s blueprint, there is also a strong political dimension to challenging such big investors.  Supporters say they played a critical role, for example, in buoying the flagging Irish property market, after its crash.  But critics have dubbed them \u201cvulture funds\u201d and their power was a lightning rod in elections in Ireland this year when Sinn Fein secured more votes than the establishment parties for the first time.  The left-wing party\u2019s popularity was lifted by a housing crisis it partly blamed on fund investors crowding out the property market.  And in Spain, the rising cost of housing, also attributed in part to the role of big investors, was an issue in elections last year, prompting Madrid to tighten tenant protection.

REUTERS\/Nandita Bose  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com and New York City have shot themselves and each other in the foot. The $800 billion e-commerce giant on Thursday decided to ditch its plans to open a second headquarters, known as HQ2, in the Big Apple after local opposition to the $3 billion in state and city incentives it would receive. It makes Amazon look short-term greedy and not interested in community concerns. Politicians, meanwhile, have cost New York both tax revenue and up to 40,000 jobs.  The deal Amazon struck with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was not the only issue. In two meetings with New York City Council, executives expressed a lack of support for unions. Amazon\u2019s facial-recognition service, which is used by the U.S. government, didn\u2019t help, either.  Amazon, though, doesn\u2019t need New York. Its business is hardly dependent on having a big presence in the city, where the corporate tax rate is a not insignificant 9 percent. Executives can shift resources, if they so choose, to Virginia, where the company is building its other HQ2.  Likewise, New York City doesn\u2019t need Amazon. It can attract big hitters without offering them tax breaks: Alphabet unit Google, for example, announced in December that it would invest $1 billion and double its workforce of more than 7,000. The top three nongovernmental companies in NYC by employees, Northwell Health, JPMorgan and Mount Sinai Health System, increased their workforce 8 percent, 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, between 2016 and 2017, according to Crain\u2019s New York Business. And the Big Apple has a better score for starting a business than the United States as a whole, according to The World Bank.  The whole process shines a spotlight on corporate tax subsidies that cities feel they have to offer. Amazon, Cuomo and de Blasio touted big gains for the region. But in the short term at least, Amazon looked set to get more back in incentives than it would pay in taxes, reckoned New York\u2019s Independent Budget Office. Canning such opaque and incendiary practices entirely \u2013 or making incentives applicable to all businesses - would be a smart move.  None of the players emerges from this fracas looking good. The only saving grace is that they have suffered little more than a flesh wound.","688":"LOS ANGELES, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc van drivers\u2019 on-time delivery rate fell to 93.7% for the Cyber Monday week from 98.2% during the Thanksgiving week, consulting firm ShipMatrix said on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan announced the joint venture in January, saying U.S. healthcare costs were rising too fast and holding back economic growth. The three companies said they would use big-data analysis and other high-tech tools to improve care and cut waste.  The choice of Gawande reflects the company\u2019s plans to focus on the entire healthcare system, rather than just looking to curb prescription drug costs, as some investors had first thought, analysts said on Wednesday.  Gawande practices general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and is a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, both located in Boston, where the new company will be headquartered. He is set to start in the new role on July 9.  \u201cThe choice suggests that the ... coalition is looking not at the drug value chain in isolation, but more broadly at the overall healthcare system across payers and providers of care delivery,\u201d Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a note.  KPMG principal Ash Shehata, who is focused on healthcare, said Gawande\u2019s expertise would enable him to take a high-level view of how payers, providers and government agencies could do a better job to improve care and reduce costs.  When the joint venture was first announced, shares of companies in the healthcare supply chain, including CVS Health Corp and Express Scripts, fell on expectations that they and other \u201cmiddlemen\u201d could lose business. Amazon\u2019s record of disrupting other industries, like retail, was a key concern.  The three companies have said they will focus first on new options for their own employees and dependents, which represent more than 1 million people, and then could open the venture up to outside companies.  Over the past few months, JP Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who is working with Berkshire head Warren Buffett and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, has laid out areas of particular concern.  In an investor meeting on June 1, Dimon pointed to fraud, administrative costs, and chronic care costs related to smoking and obesity. He also singled out end of life costs as being very expensive.  This is an area of expertise for Gawande. In his 2014 book \u201cBeing Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,\u201d Gawande argued against prolonging a poor quality of life for the elderly and terminally ill.  The group will look at some of the existing corporate efforts to cut healthcare costs, Reuters reported recently, including models introduced by Cisco Systems Inc and Intel Corp that more closely manage workers\u2019 health instead of looking to insurers to do it.  Buffett has described U.S. healthcare costs as a \u201ctapeworm\u201d on American businesses, hurting their ability to compete with rivals in other countries. Last month, he said the goal is to challenge the entire healthcare industry, not individual segments.  \u201cThe resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried,\u201d Buffett said last month.","690":"Jan 20 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday offered to help with the United States\u2019 efforts involving the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a letter addressed to President Joe Biden, seen by Reuters.

Slideshow ( 7 images )  It is part of a global effort by the online retailer to build an air, sea and land transport network to help it offer faster deliveries and try to contain shipping costs, which have steadily increased as a percentage of sales.  \u201cIf we have last-mile in our own hands we can offer more services like same-day delivery,\u201d Bernd Gschaider, Germany director for Amazon Logistics, told Reuters at a distribution center outside the southern city of Mannheim.  Gschaider said its move was designed to help it cover increased volumes but it poses a challenge to major logistics firms like Deutsche Post DHL, Hermes and DPD, which rely on the ecommerce giant for a large chunk of their parcel business.  It also comes at a time when the delivery business in Germany is under fire over the practices of subcontractors. Most big delivery firms, including Amazon, employ their drivers via small and medium-sized subcontracted firms.  German police raids in February found a third of subcontractors it targeted were not paying drivers the minimum wage or making proper social security deductions.  The German cabinet is expected on Wednesday to approve proposed legislation to make logistics firms liable for the behavior of their contractors, imposing fines if they are caught breaking strict labor laws.  Gschaider said the legislation would not have any impact on Amazon\u2019s business as it already demands that subcontractors make sure their drivers do not work for too many hours, with its auditors performing spot checks to make sure they are complying.  Amazon launched its logistics business in Germany in 2015 and now operates four sorting centers and 13 distribution centers which prepare shipments for delivery.  Along with the extra 11 distribution centers, it plans to add two sorting centers this year, helping to manage the Christmas rush as it expands its area of deliveries beyond just the main cities.  It is starting driver recruitment in Munich, aiming for up to 200 initially in the city where logistics experts say it has become difficult to find staff for delivery jobs due to the strong economy and low unemployment.  \u201cWe want to support drivers delivering Amazon shipments better. Employing drivers ourselves will help us to better understand their needs and allows us to further improve the experience of all drivers,\u201d Gschaider said.  He declined to comment on whether Amazon would extend direct recruitment to other parts of Germany.  Amazon will pay its drivers 12.80 euros ($14.16) per hour, well above the minimum wage in Germany, but still less than most DHL drivers. It will also invest in a new fleet of 50 electric vans.","692":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru, India, April 20, 2018.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  The latest example of this is Rihanna, who is set to stage her designer lingerie show for New York Fashion Week on Tuesday to an audience where phones and cameras have been banned.  That is because the highly anticipated \u201cSavage X Fenty\u201d fashion show unveiling her fall\/winter 2019 latest looks will stream exclusively on Amazon Prime Video to more than 200 countries beginning Sept. 20, ten days later.  Known for her daring, colorful looks on the red carpet, the Barbadian singer has become an increasingly influential force in the fashion world, and especially so since pairing up with luxury group LVMH to launch a beauty line.  That venture, called Fenty Beauty, had reached nearly 500 million euros ($550 million) in sales by the end of 2018 after only a year and a half.  The range catered to a more diverse clientele than many other brands, with a wide variety of skin tones in its foundation products for example, helping it succeed beyond its association with the singer.  LVMH followed up on the partnership with the launch of a new luxury brand with Rihanna in June - the first time in over 30 years the acquisitive group, home to major names like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, had started a label from scratch.

Amazon is also exploring a strategy of strengthening its new supermarket brand by purchasing regional grocery chains that operate at least a dozen stores, according to the report.  Shares of grocers such as Walmart were down 0.99 percent while Costco traded up 0.21 percent up. Kroger traded down over 4 percent. Amazon was up 1.68 percent.  Amazon, which bought the upscale Whole Foods chain for $13.7 billion in 2017, is now in talks to open grocery stores in shopping centers in San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, the WSJ report said.  The online retail giant plans to open its first store in Los Angeles as early as the end of the year, and has already signed leases for at least two other grocery locations with openings planned for early next year, the Journal reported.  The new stores were not intended to compete directly with Whole Foods, according to the report.

He added that a new grocer would validate the need for physical stores, a business that has been hit hard by e-commerce, whose surge Amazon has led.

The world\u2019s largest online retailer is rolling the program out in 37 U.S. cities for customers with newer compatible vehicles and plans to expand the service. All that is required to have packages delivered to a car is downloading an app from Amazon and linking it to the vehicle\u2019s so-called connected car service, such as General Motors Co\u2019s OnStar system or Volvo Car Group\u2019s On Call service. (Details: www.amazon.com\/keyincar)  The in-car delivery effort is part of Amazon\u2019s drive to leave packages where they cannot be easily stolen. Since 2011, Amazon has offered secure lockers for urban customers.  The in-car service builds on an effort Amazon launched last fall called Amazon Key. That system uses a $220 combination of an internet-connected door lock and camera to allow Amazon delivery drivers to place packages inside the homes of members of Amazon Prime. By contrast, the in-car delivery service is free for Prime members. It will be offered in San Francisco, Seattle, Atlanta, Nashville, Milwaukee, Salt Lake City, Washington, D.C. and other areas.  The in-home delivery option put Amazon in direct competition with so-called smart home security companies such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Nest Labs and presaged Amazon\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of connected doorbell maker Ring.  But the new in-car delivery service may have broader reach because it works with many compatible cars from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Cadillac and Volvo, with plans to deliver to more makes and models in the future.  In a statement, GM said there are at least 7 million owners of compatible GM models. Amazon has not disclosed how many customers have tried its Amazon Key in-home service.

The deal valued Ring at more than $1 billion, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Amazon declined to discuss the terms.  Ring is set to be one of Amazon\u2019s most expensive takeovers, after its $13.7 billion deal last year for Whole Foods Market.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer believes that selling internet-connected gadgets from Kindle e-readers to its new Cloud Cam will spark more shopping on Amazon.com. Ring offers the company a popular consumer electronics brand that it might not have replicated internally.  More importantly, Ring\u2019s security devices could work well with Amazon Key, a smart lock and camera system that lets delivery personnel put packages inside a home to avoid theft or, in the case of fresh food, spoiling.  \u201cAs Amazon moves more aggressively into the grocery delivery space... we believe smart security devices will be an important factor in driving user adoption,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note.  Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund, which offers venture capital to companies working on voice technology, invested in the Santa Monica, California-based Ring.  Currently, Ring devices can integrate with Amazon\u2019s voice-controlled assistant Alexa. Users of Amazon\u2019s Echo Show device can say, \u201cAlexa, show my front door\u201d to receive a live feed of activity around their home via Ring cameras.  The deal creates potential for much more, analysts said.  \u201cAmazon more than Ring can revolutionize home security,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.  U.S. security and alarm company ADT could be the biggest loser, he added. Ring\u2019s \u201ccamera technology is far superior to physical security ... With Amazon having roughly 100 million Prime members, that\u2019s a big addressable market for them to start selling this into.\u201d  Shares of ADT Inc ADT.N fell more than 2 percent after the news to close at $11.60. Amazon stock closed down 0.7 percent.  Amazon was working on a competing smart lock with camera prior to the deal, according to a separate person familiar with the matter.

Amazon, America\u2019s second-biggest private employer behind Walmart Inc, does not have any union labor in the United States, and workers at its fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, would be the first to join if they vote in favour.  The last attempt by Amazon workers to unionize was in 2014.  A White House spokeswoman, who declined to comment directly on the Alabama effort, said President Biden supports union organizing and collective bargaining and has urged employers not to run anti-union campaigns or interfere with organizing and bargaining. He has also called for holding employers accountable and increasing penalties when they do, she added.  RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum told Reuters the conversation with a top advisor to President Joe Biden took place after the inauguration and focused on their efforts to organize the facility in Alabama.  \u201cWe wanted to inform the White House that this campaign was taking place and that they would be hearing about it... we did not make any specific request,\u201d Appelbaum said, adding that the Biden advisor was interested in learning more about the situation in Alabama.  Appelbaum said labor leaders \u201cconnected to the RWDSU\u201d spoke to the White House, but he declined to name who they spoke with. He also said another senior advisor to Biden has been tracking the Alabama effort.  \u201cThe larger labor movement has indicated to the White House that this is an important campaign, that this is a priority,\u201d Appelbaum said.  On Feb. 8, the National Labor Relations Board will mail ballots to 5,805 workers at the facility near Birmingham, who will then have seven weeks to decide whether they want the RWDSU to represent them.  The effort to secure White House support by labor leaders underscores the high stakes involved, as Amazon fights its biggest labor battle yet in the United States. A victory for the union could encourage workers attempting to organize at other Amazon facilities.  Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said the company does not \u201cbelieve the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees\u2019 views.\u201d The company\u2019s employees choose to work at Amazon because \u201cwe offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs,\u201d she added.  Amazon has long avoided unionization, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. A website advocating Amazon workers shun unions, doitwithoutdues.com, warned the Bessemer employees, \u201cwhy pay almost $500 in dues? We\u2019ve got you covered* with high wages, health care, vision, and dental benefits.\u201d  The COVID pandemic spurred labor organizing in different parts of the company and the world\u2019s largest online retailer has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of a coronavirus outbreak at its warehouses and other facilities.  Amazon, reporting more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases as of September, has said it increased cleaning, implemented virus tests and temperature checks, and added other measures to protect associates.","703":"FILE PHOTO: An Amazon Prime van during a press conference announcing Amazon.com's new program to help entrepreneurs build businesses delivering Amazon packages, including $1 million to fund startup costs for military veterans, at an event space in Seattle, Washington, U.S., June 27, 2018.

These facilities, which cost Walmart millions of dollars and took nearly five years to build, are starting to pay off. The retailer\u2019s online sales have been on a tear for the last three consecutive quarters, far outpacing wider industry growth levels.  Powering that rise are thousands of proprietary servers that enable the company to crunch almost limitless swathes of customer data in-house.  Most retailers rent the computing capacity they need to store and manage such information. But Walmart\u2019s decision to build its own internal cloud network shows its determination to grab a bigger slice of online shopping, in part by imitating Amazon\u2019s use of cloud-powered big data to drive digital sales.  The effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory. And it is allowing the company to target shoppers with more customized offers and improved services, two top executives told Reuters in interviews at Walmart\u2019s San Bruno and Sunnyvale campuses in California.  \u201cIt has made a big difference to how fast we can grow our e-commerce business,\u201d said Tim Kimmet, head of cloud operations for Walmart.  He said Walmart, for example, is using cloud data to stock items frequently ordered by customers via voice shopping devices such as Google Home.  The network is helping the retailer improve its in-store operations as well. Using data gleaned from millions of transactions, the company sped up the process by which customers can return online purchases to their local stores by 60 percent. And Walmart can adjust prices at its physical locations almost instantly across entire regions.  \u201cWe are now able to execute change faster,\u201d Jeremy King, Walmart\u2019s chief technology officer, told Reuters. He added that Walmart can now make over 170,000 monthly changes to software that supports its website, compared to less than 100 changes previously.  To be sure, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, holds just a 3.6 percent share of the U.S. e-commerce market compared to Amazon\u2019s 43.5 percent, according to digital research firm eMarketer.  Still, Walmart\u2019s cloud effort is significant at a time when U.S. retail is undergoing immense disruption, and data-based decision making has become more important than ever to understand how shoppers make purchases.  Walmart\u2019s online revenue climbed 50 percent year-over-year during the third quarter, helping it post its strongest-ever quarterly growth since 2009.  \u201cThe battle between Walmart and Amazon has been playing out on all fronts and the cloud is the latest frontier,\u201d said Kerry Liu, chief executive of Rubikloud Technologies, which offers artificial intelligence technology services to retailers.  EXCESS CAPACITY  The cloud initiative is but one of several steps Wal-Mart is taking to boost its e-commerce business. The company has expanded its online selection and acquired smaller e-commerce retailers. Walmart is offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, and it recently asked vendors to supply it with merchandise priced at $10 and up to help it turn a profit online.  Walmart has stored information in smaller internal data centers for years. And it uses public cloud storage for non-critical data. Most retailers rent server capacity offered by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google , Microsoft Corp and IBM.  (For a graphic on big players in the cloud market, see tmsnrt.rs\/2EYe9Ii)  But Walmart\u2019s decision to build a network that is not reliant on a single third-party cloud technology provider has transformed its ability to understand shoppers, who now move between store, desktop, mobile and app to make purchases. About 80 percent of Walmart\u2019s cloud network is now in-house.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said security was another big factor behind the effort, enabling the retailer to better protect customer data. That secrecy extends to the locations of its six \u201cmega clouds\u201d or giant server farms, and 75 \u201cmicro clouds\u201d whose locations the company declined to disclose publicly.  Walmart shareholders so far appear supportive of its cloud strategy. The company\u2019s shares have risen 49 percent in the last 12 months, defying the broader retail sector downturn and outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which has risen 14 percent over the same period.  Still, some investors have expressed concerns that Walmart\u2019s approach will make it harder for the retailer to downsize if market conditions change significantly. A few of them told Reuters they would like to see Walmart commercialize its excess capacity, much as its rival Amazon has done.  Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $18.34 billion in revenue in 2017 and has garnered 26 percent of the cloud market, according to estimates from Jefferies Group LLC.  \u201cWalmart is very good at following Amazon\u2019s innovations. Now they must find a way to monetize the cloud business they are building the way AWS did,\u201d said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said the retailer has no immediate plans to provide cloud services for other companies. But he did not rule it out as a future revenue driver.","709":"(The Factbox updated on Nov. 15 corrects to fix total New York City incentive figure to $2.81 billion from $1.525 billion.)

Known as Prime Originals, the shows account for as much as a quarter of what analysts estimate to be total Prime sign-ups from late 2014 to early 2017, the period covered by the documents.  Core to Amazon\u2019s strategy is the use of video to convert viewers into shoppers. Fans access Amazon\u2019s lineup by joining Prime, a club that includes two-day package delivery and other perks, for an annual fee.  The company declined to comment on the documents seen by Reuters. But Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has been upfront about the company\u2019s use of entertainment to drive merchandise sales. The world\u2019s biggest online retailer launched Amazon Studios in 2010 to develop original programs that have since grabbed awards and Hollywood buzz.  \u201cWhen we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes,\u201d Bezos said at a 2016 technology conference near Los Angeles. He said film and TV customers renew their subscriptions \u201cat higher rates, and they convert from free trials at higher rates\u201d than members who do not stream videos on Prime.  Video has grown to be one of Amazon\u2019s biggest expenditures at $5 billion per year for original and licensed content, two people familiar with the matter said. The company has never disclosed how many subscribers it won as a result, making it hard for investors to evaluate its programming decisions.  The internal documents show what Amazon considers to be the financial logic of its strategy, and why the company is now making more commercial projects in addition to high-brow shows aimed at winning awards, the people said.  For example, the first season of the popular drama \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d an alternate history depicting Germany as the victor of World War Two, had 8 million U.S. viewers as of early 2017, according to the documents. The program cost $72 million in production and marketing and attracted 1.15 million new subscribers worldwide based on Amazon\u2019s accounting, the documents showed.  Amazon calculated that the show drew new Prime members at an average cost of $63 per subscriber.  That is far less than the $99 that subscribers pay in the United States for Prime; the company charges similar fees abroad. Prime members also buy more goods from Amazon than non-members, Bezos has said, further boosting profit.

REUTERS\/Kevork Djansezian  AMAZON\u2019S SECRET MATH  Precisely how Amazon determines a customer\u2019s motivation for joining its Prime club is not clear from the documents viewed by Reuters.  (See an interactive version of the above graphic)  But a person familiar with its strategy said the company credits a specific show for luring someone to start or extend a Prime subscription if that program is the first one a customer streams after signing up. That metric, referenced throughout the documents, is known as a \u201cfirst stream.\u201d  The company then calculates how expensive the viewer was to acquire by dividing the show\u2019s costs by the number of first streams it had. The lower that figure, the better.  The internal documents do not show how long subscribers stayed with Prime, nor do they indicate how much shopping they do on Amazon. The company reviews other metrics for its programs as well. Consequently, the documents do not provide enough information to determine the overall profitability of Amazon\u2019s Hollywood endeavor.  Still, the numbers indicate that broad-interest shows can lure Prime members cheaply by Amazon\u2019s calculations. One big winner was the motoring series \u201cThe Grand Tour,\u201d which stars the former presenters of BBC\u2019s \u201cTop Gear.\u201d The show had more than 1.5 million first streams from Prime members worldwide, at a cost of $49 per subscriber in its first season.  The documents seen by Reuters reflect Prime subscribers in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Japan, where Amazon\u2019s programs were available before Prime Video rolled out globally in December 2016.  Analysts estimate that 75 million or more customers have Prime subscriptions worldwide, including about half of all households in the United States.  BIGGER BETS  About 26 million U.S. Prime members watched television and movies on Amazon as of early 2017. Reuters calculated this number from the documents, which showed how many viewers a TV series had as a percentage of total Prime Video customers.  Rival Netflix Inc had twice that many U.S. subscribers in the first quarter of last year. It does not disclose how many were active viewers.  For years, Amazon Studios aimed to win credibility in Hollywood with sophisticated shows beloved by critics. Its marquee series \u201cTransparent,\u201d about a transgender father and his family, won eight Primetime Emmy Awards and created the buzz Amazon wanted to attract top producers and actors.  Yet \u201cTransparent\u201d lagged Amazon\u2019s top shows in viewership. Its first season drew a U.S. audience half as large as that of \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d and it fell to 1.3 million viewers for its third season, according to the documents.  Similarly, \u201cGood Girls Revolt,\u201d a critically-acclaimed show about gender inequality in a New York newsroom, had total U.S. viewership of 1.6 million but cost $81 million, with only 52,000 first streams worldwide by Prime members.  The program\u2019s cost per new customer was about $1560, according to the documents. Amazon canceled it after one season.  Amazon is now working on more commercial dramas and spin-offs with appeal outside the United States, where Prime membership has far more room to grow, people familiar with the matter said.  The effort to broaden Amazon\u2019s lineup, long in the works, will be in the hands of Jennifer Salke, NBC Entertainment\u2019s president whom Amazon hired last month as its studio chief. Amazon\u2019s Bezos has wanted a drama to rival HBO\u2019s global hit \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d according to the people.  In November, Amazon announced it will make a prequel to the fantasy hit \u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\u201d The company had offered $250 million for the rights alone; production and marketing could raise costs to $500 million or more for two seasons, one of the people said.  At half a billion dollars, the prequel would cost triple what Amazon paid for \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d seasons one and two, the documents show. That means it would need to draw three times the number of Prime members as \u201cThe Man in the High Castle\u201d for an equal payoff.","711":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India\u2019s Future Retail has approached a tribunal to seek a key approval for its $3.4 billion asset sale to Reliance Industries, its lawyer told a court on Thursday, even as partner Amazon tries to block the transaction.  FILE PHOTO: People shop at the Big Bazaar retail store in Mumbai, India, November 25, 2020. REUTERS\/Niharika Kulkarni\/File Photo  Amazon is locked in bitter legal disputes with Future and alleges the Indian firm violated some of their pre-existing contracts by selling its retail assets to Reliance last year. Future denies any wrongdoing.  Indian stock exchanges last week cleared Future\u2019s deal with Reliance but another key approval is needed from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), as per Indian law. The approval is key for Future to seal the deal, without which the country\u2019s second largest retailer could face liquidation.  The outcome of the dispute embroiling Future, Reliance and Amazon is seen shaping India\u2019s retail landscape, especially in deciding who will take the top spot in the fast-growing groceries market all are competing in.  Future has filed a petition with the NCLT on Jan. 26, Darius Khambata, the lawyer for Future, told the Delhi High Court during a hearing in a separate ongoing legal fight over the deal.  In the court, Amazon and Future are currently arguing over the applicability of an October injunction by a Singapore arbitrator, which both sides agreed to use in case of disputes. The arbitrator had said Future-Reliance deal should be put on hold.  Future has maintained the arbitration order is not binding on it, while Amazon says it is.  Lawyers for Amazon on Thursday criticized Future during the hearing for approaching the NCLT for approval, while the Delhi court was hearing a matter over the deal.  The judge will continue to hear the arguments on Friday.  The dispute centres around Future\u2019s decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.  Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn\u2019t sell its retail assets to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list, including Reliance.","712":"BERLIN\/MADRID (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O has pulled out of this month's Mobile World Congress because of the coronavirus outbreak, in another blow to one of the telecom industry's biggest gatherings which attracts over 100,000 visitors to Barcelona.

Amazon had planned a significant presence through its cloud computing arm AWS, which was due to host a full-day conference track on the first day of the event.  The online retailer is the fourth company to pull out of the annual gathering this week, following South Korea's LG Electronics 066570.KS, Swedish equipment maker Ericsson ERICb.ST and U.S. chipmaker Nvidia NVDA.O.  The Feb. 24-27 event will go ahead as planned, the GSMA telecoms industry association, which runs the Congress, confirmed in a statement on Sunday before Amazon said it was pulling out, adding that they would tighten health precautions to guard against the coronavirus outbreak.  No visitors will be allowed to attend from China\u2019s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak started, while visitors from China must prove they have been outside the country for two weeks prior to the event, GSMA said.  Some 5,000-6,000 visitors typically come from China to the world\u2019s premier telecoms industry gathering, where companies spend millions on stands and hospitality to fill their order books for the year ahead.  Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ have said they will attend, ordering China-based staff to self-isolate ahead of the event to ensure they are free of the illness, and drafting in European staff to cover for those stranded.  China raised the death toll from the outbreak to 811 on Sunday, passing the number killed globally by the SARS epidemic, while total confirmed cases of the illness reached 37,198.  The virus has spread to at least 27 countries and territories, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people outside China. Two deaths have been reported outside mainland China - both of Chinese nationals.  More then two dozen large trade fairs and industry conferences in China and overseas have been postponed or hit by travel curbs and concerns about the spread of the virus, potentially disrupting billions of dollars worth of deals.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Tesla short interest in dollars, calculated using the number of shares sold short and the share price, stood at $9.93 billion, on Thursday, just shy of $9.95 billion for Amazon, S3 Partners data showed.  Analysts said investors were still shorting Tesla shares, or taking positions that amounted to bets the stock would keep declining. Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.  \u201cWhile there was some short covering the week after the tweet, there has still not been any significant net Tesla short covering on the Street,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 in New York.  \u201cAny traders who have closed down their positions to realize some profits have been replaced by new ones looking for continued price weakness,\u201d he said.  Tesla shares whipsawed this month after Chief Executive Elon Musk on Aug. 7 tweeted he planned to take the company private, only to abandon the idea by Aug. 24.  Tesla closed down 0.6 percent at $303.15, on Thursday. The stock drifted as low as $288.20 in intra-day trade as recently as Aug. 20, but it has not closed below $300 since July 31. Tesla rose as high as $387.46 following Musk\u2019s initial tweet about the going-private plan.

FILE PICTURE - The logo of the web service Amazon is pictured in this June 8, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso\/Illustration\/File Photo  The news underscores how Amazon is focused on winning India\u2019s fledgling e-commerce market, and the offer could be a ploy to block Walmart from bringing its expertise in logistics and supply chain management to Flipkart, people familiar with the matter said.  Reuters reported last month that Walmart was close to buying a majority stake in Flipkart, Amazon\u2019s biggest rival in India, for $10 billion to $12 billion.  The talks with Walmart for what could be its largest acquisition to date are still ongoing, and a deal is expected to be clinched soon, two people told Reuters on Wednesday. However, Amazon was indeed interested in buying Flipkart, said two sources, asking not to be named. They declined to give further details.  A spokesman for Walmart declined to comment. Amazon said it does not offer comments on rumors and speculation, and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amazon\u2019s offer could kickstart a new battle between it and Walmart, already fierce retail rivals in the United States. The bid emphasizes the importance of gaining a greater foothold in online sales in India, a market expected to be worth $200 billion a year within a decade.  Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, touted in a letter to shareholders last month that Amazon was India\u2019s fastest growing online marketplace.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer has been pouring billions of dollars into India to ship goods to shoppers faster, contributing to growing losses internationally. A Walmart-Flipkart deal could lead to more intense price competition, retail consultants said.  On Wednesday, Indian broadcaster CNBC-TV18 reported bit.ly\/2jo03py that Amazon had offered Flipkart a breakup fee of $2 billion to convince it to discuss an offer, which analysts say would bring with it substantial antitrust challenges. Flipkart and Amazon dominate the online shopping space in Asia's third-largest economy.  Flipkart had vetoed an approach from Amazon for a 51 to 55 percent stake in the company two years ago, a source told Reuters, judging its offered price as far too low at the time.  \u201cNow with Walmart in the mix things are different,\u201d the source said. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge no decision has been made yet. There is no deadline per se.\u201d  CNBC-TV18, citing unnamed sources, said Amazon\u2019s new bid was likely to be on a par with Walmart\u2019s, but that Flipkart\u2019s investors and founders continue to favor the deal with Walmart, with founder Sachin Bansal overseeing final negotiations.  WORLDWIDE MOVES  Walmart and Amazon\u2019s interest in gaining share in India comes after both retailers have struggled to grow in China, ultimately losing ground to Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  A successful move by Amazon to grab Flipkart would likely send Walmart back to the drawing board when it comes to India, retail consultants and analysts said.  \u201cThe stakes are really high for Walmart,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, senior research analyst with Edward Jones. \u201cIt will be very hard for them to win India back if they miss this opportunity.\u201d  Investors expect faster returns from Walmart\u2019s investments compared to Amazon, said Yarbrough, a move that limits the brick-and-mortar retailer\u2019s ability to spend big on acquisitions in growth markets.  Sales from Walmart International, which runs about 6,300 stores globally, stood at $118 billion in the fiscal year ended 2018, down nearly 14 percent from 2014.  In an effort to fix its international performance, Walmart in January appointed Chief Operating Officer Judith McKenna to run its international unit and has indicated it will focus on its core North American markets and growth markets like China and India.  Its urgency to stem market share losses has seen it launch talks to merge its British arm Asda with Sainsbury\u2019s.  In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, McKenna downplayed analyst criticism that the company has been slow to move in India.  \u201cWe have been deliberate and thoughtful, we were not slow to respond,\u201d she said.  Walmart\u2019s shares ended 1.22 percent lower at $86.34 on Wednesday.","719":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is testing the use of disinfectant fog at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York starting on Tuesday, the company told Reuters, following worker protests over the risk of coronavirus infection at the site.

New York is currently the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with by far the most confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths.  The company has said it is requiring staff to keep safe distances from each other.  The Staten Island warehouse drew particular attention after Amazon fired an employee on paid quarantine for participating in a protest last week that he helped organize.

FILE PHOTO: People move past a hoarding of Amazon India outside a metro rail station in New Delhi, India, October 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Anushree Fadnavis\/File Photo  The government discussions coincide with a growing number of complaints from India\u2019s bricks-and-mortar retailers, which have for years accused Amazon and Walmart Inc-controlled Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass federal rules, allegations the U.S. companies deny.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers. It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.  Amazon and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart were last hit in Dec. 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  Now, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.  The changes could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect equity stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India.  Amazon said e-commerce created \u201chuge job opportunities\u201d and is a significant contributor to economic growth. \u201cAny major alterations\u201d to the policy will adversely impact small- and medium-sized busineses, it said in an emailed statement.  Walmart and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Yogesh Baweja, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which is working on the issue, confirmed to Reuters any changes will be announced through a so-called \u201cpress note,\u201d which contains foreign direct investment rules. He did not give details.  \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Baweja said, adding an internal meeting on the subject last took place about a month ago.  \u201cOf course Amazon\u2019s a big player so whatever advice, whatever suggestions, whatever recommendations they make, they are also given due consideration.\u201d  FRAYED TIES  The 2018 rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to rework their business structures and soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy change favoured local e-tailers over U.S. ones.  India\u2019s e-commerce retail market is seen growing to $200 billion a year by 2026, from $30 billion in 2019, the country\u2019s investment promotion agency Invest India estimates.  Domestic traders have been unhappy about the growth. They see foreign e-commerce businesses as a threat to their livelihoods and accuse them of unfair business practices that use steep discounts to target rapid growth. The companies deny they are acting unfairly.  \u201cThe way the government is thinking is that marketplaces are not doing what they are supposed to do. The government wants to tinker with the nuts and bolts of the policy,\u201d said one of the sources who is familiar with the talks on the policy changes.  LIMITING WHOLESALE TIES  India\u2019s trade minister Piyush Goyal has been critical of e-commerce companies in private meetings and told them to follow all laws in letter and spirit, Reuters has previously reported.  In the face of growing trader complaints and an antitrust investigation, Goyal last year said Amazon was not doing \u201ca great favour to India\u201d by making fresh investments.  Among other changes, the government is considering changes that would effectively prohibit online sales by a seller who purchases goods from the e-commerce entity or its group firm, and then sells them on the entity\u2019s websites, two of the sources said.  Under existing rules, a seller is free to buy up to 25% of its inventory from the e-commerce entity\u2019s wholesale or another unit and then sell them on the e-commerce website.  A boom in e-commerce in India accelerated last year when the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online. Flipkart, in which Walmart invested $16 billion in 2018, and Amazon are among the top two players.  \u201cE-commerce has already made its mark for itself in the country, particularly during COVID-19,\u201d Commerce Ministry\u2019s Baweja said. \u201cThey are bound to grow and a conducive environment should be there, which is good for the brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce.\u201d","721":"FILE PHOTO: A customer leaves a new Amazon pop-up store for Christmas at Berlin's main shopping street Kurfurstendamm boulevard in Berlin, Germany, November 22, 2018.

FedEx forecast a mid-single-digit percentage point decline in adjusted earnings for fiscal 2020.  \u201cIf we see these tariffs rise to say 25% as the Trump administration has talked about ... one of the biggest losers in the American economy would be FedEx,\u201d said Matthew White, a transportation and package delivery industry specialist.  \u201cTrade weakness is very hard to predict, as it can be caused by both policy and sentiment. Unfortunately, FedEx is seeing negative effects of both.\u201d  The shipping giant, which gets about a third of its revenue from outside the United States, has drawn Chinese ire over shipping mistakes involving several packages. Most recently, a package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an \u201coperational error.\u201d  Telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in May was added to a blacklist of people and companies the U.S. government said posed a security risk, barring it from buying, without special approval, U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant.  FedEx on Monday sued the U.S. government, saying it should not be held liable if it inadvertently shipped products that violated the Trump administration ban.  E-COMMERCE  Earlier this month, FedEx decided not to renew its contract with Amazon, which represented less than 1.3% of its total revenue in the last calendar year, for U.S. cargo delivery through FedEx Express, the unit that delivers packages on planes.  FedEx described the decision as a strategic move that would allow it to focus on the broader e-commerce market, a group that would include rivals of Amazon scaling up one- and two-day delivery.  \u201cThe big emphasis going forward is going to be on e-commerce, which FedEx says will pressure yield,\u201d said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. \u201cThey\u2019re right, especially for Express, and since they will be doing more residential deliveries, that will cost more as well.\u201d  FedEx also said the cost of integrating Dutch delivery company TNT Express into the company was now expected to be about $1.7 billion through fiscal 2021. Fedex had said in March the cost would be more than $1.5 billion. It bought TNT Express in 2016 for $4.8 billion and has struggled to integrate it into its own network.  Adjusted net income fell to $1.32 billion, or $5.01 per share, for the fourth-quarter ended May 31, from $1.60 billion, or $5.91 per share, a year earlier.  Revenue rose to $17.8 billion from $17.3 billion a year earlier, largely due to growth in U.S. volume and higher revenue per shipment at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.85 per share and revenue of $17.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","724":"(Repeats story filed earlier on Wednesday)  * New antitrust case is Amazon\u2019s latest India challenge  * Indian online seller group alleges discrimination  * Amazon has said it complies with all laws  * Amazon has invested $6.5 bln in India, its key market  NEW DELHI, Aug 26 (Reuters) - A group of more than 2,000 online sellers has filed an antitrust case against Amazon in India, alleging the U.S. company favours some retailers whose online discounts drive independent vendors out of business, a legal filing seen by Reuters showed.  The case presents a new regulatory challenge for Amazon in India, where it has committed $6.5 billion in investment but is battling a complex regulatory environment.  In January, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had ordered an investigation of Amazon and rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart, over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices, which Amazon is challenging, according to court filings.  In the latest case, the All India Online Vendors Association, members of which sell goods on Amazon and Flipkart, allege Amazon engages in unfair business practices. Reuters was first to report the case filing on Wednesday.  The group alleges that Amazon India\u2019s wholesale arm buys goods in bulk from manufacturers and sells them at a loss to sellers such as Cloudtail. Such sellers then offer goods on Amazon.in at big discounts.  \u201cThis anti-competitive arrangement ... is causing foreclosure of competition by driving independent sellers out of the market,\u201d the group alleged in its Aug. 10 filing at CCI, seen by Reuters.  Amazon said in a statement it complies with all laws and its India website is a pure third-party marketplace where sellers have discretion to decide product prices. Amazon\u2019s statement also said its wholesale unit allows businesses to buy products and anyone can register on it.  A Cloudtail spokeswoman said it was in \u201ccompliance with all applicable laws in its operations.\u201d  Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the CCI are not made public. In the coming weeks, the CCI will review the case and could decide to launch a wider investigation or dismiss it.  The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.  Chanakya Basa, a lawyer for the sellers group, confirmed the case filing with the CCI but declined to elaborate.  India\u2019s regulations allow Amazon to operate an e-commerce marketplace where sellers can list goods for a fee.  India tightened regulations last year to deter steep discounts, but small sellers still say Amazon uses complex business structures to bypass restrictions, an allegation the company denies.  The latest case filing, running to more than 700 pages, includes screenshots of product listings on Amazon\u2019s website that showed some products, including groceries and detergents, discounted by between 8% to 45% compared with retail prices visible on the e-commerce website.  The seller group also alleges that Amazon charges lower fees to selected sellers, which effectively makes it difficult for independent online retailers to compete on its website.  Cloudtail, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest India sellers, pays a fee to Amazon of 6.3% for electronic products, while independent sellers pay roughly 28.1%, the group alleged in its filing.  Amazon says it provides an e-commerce platform in India to more than 650,000 sellers.

FILE PHOTO: A web page featuring Amazon's Australian URL is pictured in this photo illustration April 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Jason Reed\/Illustration\/File Photo  The retail giant said it would subject Australians to the process known as \u201cgeoblocking\u201d from July 1, when a 10 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies to imported online goods worth less than A$1,000 ($756).  \u201cWhile we regret any inconvenience this may cause customers, we have had to assess the workability of the legislation as a global business with multiple international sites,\u201d an Amazon spokesman said, adding that the firm was taking the measure to comply with the legislation and not to avoid paying tax.  The move will likely drive traffic to Amazon\u2019s Australian website, testing the patience of shoppers who have complained about its thin product range - a tenth the range of its U.S. site - and uncompetitive prices since it began taking orders in December.  It may also benefit Amazon\u2019s main rivals, from California-headquartered online market eBay to smaller Australian merchants which had campaigned to have the GST apply to all goods shipped from overseas.  National Retail Association CEO Dominique Lamb said Amazon\u2019s move was a surprise.  \u201cYou have to wonder if they are trying to funnel more traffic to its Australan website,\u201d she said.  An eBay spokesman said the U.S. company was working on a way to collect the Australian tax from sellers around the world without cutting access for Australians.  \u201ceBay\u2019s GST solution ... allows imports to Australia to continue without any structural barriers, redirects or blocks to the buyer experience,\u201d he said.  FAIR SHARE  Until now, GST has applied only to most goods sold in Australia and imported goods worth over A$1,000, making relatively low-cost imported items cheaper than their equivalents in local stores.  Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison announced the change in April 2017, eight months before Amazon opened its Australian unit.  \u201cThe second-biggest company in the world, run by the richest man in the world, shouldn\u2019t get a leave pass from paying tax in Australia,\u201d Morrison said in an email statement on Thursday.  \u201cIf multinationals aren\u2019t forced to pay their fair share of tax, they will have a competitive advantage over retailers here in Australia, on our own main streets and in our shopping centers.\u201d  Shares of local e-commerce site Kogan.com Ltd closed up 0.8 percent while shares of electronics retailers JB Hi-Fi Ltd and Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd, seen as direct Amazon competitors, closed up 2.2 percent and 1.4 percent respectively.

Under a deal to be announced on Thursday, Sirius XM is working with Amazon to give three-month trials to some of its subscription packages when customers buy Amazon\u2019s Echo Dot smart speaker on the e-commerce retailer\u2019s website.  In turn, Sirius will give away Amazon Echo Dots to customers who sign up for its subscriptions through Sirius\u2019 website. Sirius XM subscriptions include talk shows, music, news and sports programs.  The company\u2019s satellite radios are installed in 110 million vehicles, and the bulk of its 33.5 million paid subscribers come from deals with automakers who install the radios and often provide a prepaid subscription plan with the cost of a vehicle.  But consumers are increasingly listening to streaming music services such as Spotify Technology SA or Apple Inc\u2019s Apple Music on devices such as smart speakers while home. To combat that trend, Sirius started offering a streaming subscription for smart speakers from Sonos Inc and Amazon, as well as on mobile phones and laptops.  What music streaming services offer that Sirius does not is so-called on-demand radio, allowing users to select which songs to listen to. To get into that business, Sirius earlier this month made a $3.5 billion all-stock offer to buy Pandora Media Inc, in which it already owned a stake. If the deal closes, combined service could rival Spotify in terms of market capitalization.  The Amazon deal could give Sirius, founded in 2002 and controlled by John Malone\u2019s Liberty Media Corp, a boost in visibility because Amazon will promote the service on its website. Amazon has sold 21.5 million Echo devices over the past year, research firm Canalys said.  In a statement, Sirius and Amazon said that more initiatives around combining the satellite radio company\u2019s service with Amazon\u2019s Echo devices and Alexa voice assistant are expected later this year.","729":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018.

Shares of Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, rose 5% in after-hours trade.  While rival brick-and-mortar retailers have had to shut stores during government-imposed lockdowns, Amazon hired 175,000 people in recent months and saw demand for its services soar. The company said revenue jumped 40% from a year earlier to $88.9 billion.  Amazon had forecast it might lose money in the just-ended second quarter because it expected to spend some $4 billion on protective equipment for staff and other expenses related to COVID-19. It did just that - and still earned $5.2 billion - double its net income from a year prior.  Jeff Bezos, who founded the company in July 1994 and is the world\u2019s richest person, said in a statement, \u201cThis was another highly unusual quarter.\u201d  Amazon\u2019s shares have risen by more than 60% this year, adding to the wealth of Bezos, its biggest stockholder. The S&P 500 is virtually flat.  Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said Amazon\u2019s business model sets it up \u201cto expand its e-commerce dominance even more broadly as the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to flare.\u201d  Online store sales jumped 48% to $45.9 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile, merchants paid Amazon more to fulfill and sponsor their products in order to reach the company\u2019s loyal customers. That resulted in a 52% and 41% jump in seller services revenue and other revenue such as from ads, respectively.  Amazon\u2019s cloud services also saw higher demand as companies switched to virtual offices in the pandemic. Revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which sells data storage and computing power in the cloud, rose nearly 29% to $10.81 billion.  FILE PHOTO: An Amazon sign stands in a parking lot outside of an Amazon warehouse as the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in the Staten Island borough of New York U.S., May 1, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Still, that fell just short of analysts' estimates of $10.95 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The cloud business of rival Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google meanwhile was up over 43% year over year.  Technology analyst Patrick Moorhead said, \u201cAWS continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate than last quarter.\u201d  \u2018EVERYONE WAS BUYING GROCERIES\u2019  Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, told reporters that the outsized profit surprised the company because at the time it issued its forecast last quarter, shoppers were buying lower-margin products.  \u201cEveryone was looking for masks; everyone was looking for gloves; everyone was buying groceries online. That mix is not super profitable,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we saw in Q2 was not only did the mix start to shift back to a more normal mix\u201d but that \u201cwe also were able to ship a lot more than we had originally thought.\u201d  Online grocery sales tripled year over year, and worldwide streaming video hours doubled, Olsavsky said on a call with analysts. Delivery and video services bundled with the company\u2019s loyalty club Prime are a key reason why customers subscribe to that program and do more of their shopping on Amazon.  Amazon also posted a rare operating profit in its international business, which Olsavsky attributed to a step up in customer spending in Europe and Japan during the pandemic.  The company forecast net sales of $87 billion to $93 billion for the third quarter, ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations of $86.34 billion, according to IBES data.  Olsavsky said that Prime Day, the company\u2019s lucrative summer marketing blitz, would be pushed back to the fourth quarter, excluding its business in India. He also said that per usual the current quarter would see higher costs as the company gears up for the holiday season, even more pronounced now due to higher-than-usual sales.  It would spend more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses during the third quarter as well, he said on the analyst call.  Still, Amazon anticipates operating profit between $2 billion and $5 billion for the quarter, the midpoint of which is higher than analysts were expecting, according to research firm FactSet.","733":"FILE PHOTO - The Amazon TV button on a remote control is shown in this photo illustration.

The start of Amazon Prime, which involves charging a monthly fee for free delivery, streaming content and other benefits, follows a timetable the world\u2019s biggest retailer laid out soon after opening for business in Australia in December.  However, the company has faced criticism from shoppers for a relatively thin product range and uncompetitive prices. Last month, it said it would stop Australians buying goods on its overseas websites, a maneuver known as \u201cgeoblocking\u201d, to avoid collecting Australian sales tax.  The Prime launch may help direct more shoppers to the Australian site, which offers a fraction of the range of Amazon\u2019s U.S. site.  Amazon\u2019s vice-president of Prime International, Jamil Ghani, said in a statement that Prime in Australia would offer free international delivery on products sold on Amazon\u2019s U.S. website, which shoppers could order on the Australian site, circumventing the geoblocking.  \u201cIt\u2019s as though Amazon are about to tell disappointed consumers \u2018don\u2019t worry about being geoblocked ... because our Australian website is now just as good as the U.S. and U.K. with the launch of Prime,\u201d said Daniel Mueller, an analyst at Vertium Asset Management, which holds Australian retail shares.

The plan proposed by the EU executive on Monday is part of a digital market policy shake-up that also includes steps to rein in the data controlling powers of companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.  Having lagged the first wave of digital innovation, particularly in consumer markets such as social media, online shopping and smartphones, the EU is keen to make up lost ground and avoid its firms relying on data from U.S and Asian rivals.  It is hoping that tapping into the trove of industrial data held by companies such as Germany\u2019s Siemens and France\u2019s Alstom could push Europe to the forefront of the next wave of innovation as machines and industrial processes are connected up via the so-called \u201cinternet of things\u201d.  \u201cThe battle for industrial data starts now and Europe will be the main battlefield. Europe has the largest industrial base. The winners of today will not be the winners of tomorrow,\u201d EU industry chief Thierry Breton told a news conference.  He said a key element of the plan would be the creation of an EU cloud platform alliance, with the EU hoping to mobilize up to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for this. He did not give details of how the platform would work.  Alongside the single European data market, the Commission plans to create smaller data markets centered on key industries, it said. A final draft of its proposals, following feedback from interested parties, is expected by the end of the year.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  The plans come alongside moves by some EU countries to introduce digital taxes on major U.S. tech companies, steps condemned by Washington as tantamount to protectionism.  TOUGHER RULES COMING  Other elements in the Commission\u2019s proposals include new rules covering cross-border data use, data interoperability and standards for manufacturing, climate change, the auto industry, healthcare, financial services, agriculture and energy.  One possibly controversial proposal calls for doing away with EU rules against anti-competitive data sharing.  There is also a goal for data centers to be climate neutral by 2030.  In response to complaints about the power wielded by large online platforms, the Commission is also considering introducing rules to stop these companies from unilaterally imposing conditions for access and use of data or benefiting from this in a disproportionate way.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  \u201cWe see some platforms as gatekeepers, that is not what we want for our internal market,\u201d Breton said.  European digital and antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager said she was looking into opening a wide-ranging inquiry into sectors using new technologies. Such inquiries have in the past triggered investigation into individual companies, leading to fines and other sanctions.  A discussion paper on artificial intelligence also aims to set up a framework to govern the use of the technology used by a growing number of companies, with the rules applying to high-risk sectors such as healthcare, transport and policing.  Vestager said she wanted a debate on the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces. The Commission has previously mulled a ban, but dropped the idea.  Telecoms lobbying groups ETNO and GSMA and the Association of Commercial Television in Europe (ACT), which have pushed for tech rivals to be subjected to the same stringent rules as they are, welcomed the Commission\u2019s proposals.  Tech umbrella group CCIA urged the Commission to assess its ideas with care and engage with stakeholders to ensure they boost investments and innovation.

Scott Anderson, director of Amazon Robotics Fulfillment, said current technology is at least 10 years away from fully automating the processing of a single order picked by a worker inside a warehouse.  \u201cThere is a fallacy in the initial understanding of \u2018Are we going to be a lights-out fulfillment network in the next few years?\u2019\u201d Anderson said during a tour of Amazon\u2019s Baltimore warehouse for journalists on Tuesday.  For example, he said, the technology for a robot to pick a single product from a bin without damaging other products or picking multiple products at the same time in a way that could benefit the e-commerce retailer is years away.  Anderson said Amazon is exploring a variety of technologies to automate the process of packing merchandise into boxes but it could take a decade or more for the company to do that.  \u201cIn the current form, the technology is very limited. The technology is very far from the fully automated workstation that we would need,\u201d Anderson said.  The tour came at a time when the company has come under fire from labor groups and other Amazon critics for allegedly poor working conditions in its warehouses and for increasingly automating jobs and reducing its dependence on human labor.  The company said it is not changing the level of productivity inside its warehouses to catch up with its recent one-day shipping announcement. It is instead making changes to the transportation and delivery process.  Last month, Amazon said it plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club, Prime, in just one day instead of two.  Anderson said Amazon\u2019s current target is 4 hours from the time a product is ordered to the time it leaves the warehouse and the company is sticking with that.

Many shoppers recently seeking to purchase groceries from the Seattle-based e-commerce company found they could not place orders due to a lack of available delivery slots. Amazon said it would have to relegate all new online grocery customers to a wait list starting Monday while working on adding capacity each week.  In recent weeks, it increased the number of Whole Foods stores offering grocery pickup to more than 150 locations, up from 80 previously.  Amazon also plans to shorten some Whole Foods stores\u2019 hours for the public so its employees can more quickly fulfill online grocery orders, the company said.  The moves illustrates how the world\u2019s largest online retailer, which showed its ambition to enter the grocery industry by acquiring Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017, is now leveraging its presence both online and in physical stores to handle high demand from consumers who are stuck eating at home, with many restaurant dining rooms closed to the public.  Amazon offers grocery delivery services Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime Now from its own warehouses and Whole Foods stores. It typically touts ultra-fast delivery within hours, with shoppers able to choose a delivery window. Last month, Amazon temporarily suspended the Prime Pantry delivery service, which sells non-perishable groceries.  Amazon said its online grocery order capacity has increased by more than 60% during the outbreak. Some netizens who said they used Amazon Prime, its $119-a-year subscription service for U.S. shoppers, have nevertheless complained on social media about the scarcity of delivery windows.  The company said it is hiring more workers to expand capacity and that it plans to launch a new feature that will help customers secure a virtual \u201cplace in line\u201d to distribute the delivery windows on a first come, first served basis. It also offered higher pay to encourage its warehouse workers to work for its grocery delivery service.  Currently, Amazon runs 487 Whole Foods stores in the United States. These stores have been limiting the number of customers allowed at once, and Amazon has said it conducts daily employee temperature checks and sends masks and gloves to protect workers.  The first store of Amazon\u2019s much-anticipated new grocery chain, which is scheduled to open this year in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, has been temporarily transitioned into a warehouse for online orders, the company said.  Still, some employees at Whole Foods and Amazon warehouses have protested the company is not doing enough to protect them, in demonstrations that gained attention from lawmakers and unions. Over 50 Amazon fulfillment centers and several Whole Foods stores had confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to multiple reports.  \u201cWe still expect the combination of restricted capacity due to social distancing and customer demand will continue to make finding available delivery windows challenging for customers,\u201d Stephenie Landry, vice president of Grocery at Amazon, wrote in a blogpost. \u201cIf you are able to do so safely, we kindly encourage our customers who can to shop in-person.\u201d","744":"A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Wednesday said Amazon.com Inc delivery drivers are exempt from arbitrating wage claims against the company, a month after a different appeals court came to the same conclusion.

Labor groups and unions involved include the United Food and Commercial Workers and Workers United. Workers across the United States were invited to join by calling in sick.  May 1, known as International Workers\u2019 Day or May Day, is a worldwide holiday to celebrate working classes.  The protests were the latest by workers deemed essential in the pandemic who risk their lives working in warehouses and grocery stores. They argue that employers have fallen short in providing for their safety while making record sales.  Their demands include hazard pay and the shuttering of facilities with confirmed coronavirus cases. Workers at Target and Instacart are also requesting protective equipment like masks.  The number of workers that took part in the protests was unclear. Organizers said they were collecting signatures through Google Docs for a tally.  Amazon responded in a statement that while it respects the right of expression, it objects to \u201cthe irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon.\u201d The e-commerce company said it did not see a measurable impact on operations as a result of Friday\u2019s protest.  A Target representative said the company was aware of fewer than 10 workers who participated in the protests, compared with more than 340,000 workers it employs. Instacart, a grocery delivery platform, said it was moving quickly to obtain tens of thousands of personal protective equipment items for its shoppers.  One Whole Foods Market employee in Massachusetts, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, said he joined the sick-out because he believed the Amazon-owned grocer should expand its two-week paid sick policy to cover symptomatic workers who may still be seeking a COVID-19 diagnosis.  \u201cWe\u2019re acting in solidarity, because we all have similar demands for better safety practices, for protecting the workers and fairly compensating us for the risk we\u2019re taking,\u201d the employee said.  Amazon said it has prioritized workers\u2019 safety, spending nearly $700 million on higher pay and more than 150 measures such as providing masks and performing temperature checks.  Union leaders say such protests are meant to raise concerns to the companies, and to urge regulators to exercise more scrutiny on working conditions during the pandemic.  \u201cThe emphasis now is on putting pressure on our governments to take action against employers who are not doing enough to protect workers,\u201d said Patricia Campos-Medina, co-director at union federation AFL-CIO\u2019s New York arm, who helped coordinate the protests.","746":"March 23 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is partnering with a research program funded by Bill Gates to pick up and deliver coronavirus test kits in Seattle, the e-commerce giant said on Monday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Amazon's massive online presence could help bolster Reliance's consumer and private labels business. More importantly, a partnership would help the duo counter Walmart WMT.N, which last year invested $16 billion in India's Flipkart, in the battle for a bigger share of India's fast-growing e-commerce market.  In late December, India modified rules around foreign direct investment (FDI) in e-commerce, creating additional hurdles for companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, and giving companies such as Reliance an edge.  Amazon had made the proposal to Reliance - controlled by Mukesh Ambani, India\u2019s richest man - for the partnership, but it was not clear whether a deal would materialize, said one of the sources.  The second source said Amazon had been pondering a proposal to purchase an up to 26% stake in the Reliance unit since at least February.  \u201cFor Amazon, it is about neutralizing a major rival and allowing itself to grow,\u201d said the second source, who added the company envisions helping Reliance\u2019s roughly 40 brands and grocery products go online.  Further details of the possible deal, first reported by India\u2019s Economic Times newspaper on Thursday, were not immediately clear.  Amazon, which declined to comment on Thursday, did not immediately respond to request for comment on Friday. Reliance on Friday pointed to its Thursday statement, which said it would make any disclosures to stock exchanges as and when necessary.  Reliance could potentially leverage Amazon\u2019s global experience in technology, supply chain and logistics as it aims to connect grocery stores across the country digitally through its Jio telecoms network - the biggest in India by subscribers.  For Amazon, picking up a stake in a Reliance unit could mean getting access to the Jio telecoms platform and its vast retail footprint of more than 10,600 stores across India. It might also add more firepower to their lobbying efforts, as the Ambani family is viewed as being well-connected politically.  Seattle-based Amazon is keen to get a bigger share of India\u2019s e-commerce market, which Deloitte expects to more than treble to $84 billion between 2017 and 2021.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Decisions including one on Wednesday by officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) followed an unusual appeal by Amazon to block the non-binding proposals from being voted on at the company\u2019s upcoming annual meeting.  One proposal would require Amazon to cease offering facial recognition to governments unless the company\u2019s board determined sales did not violate civil liberties. A second would call for an audit to examine the harm to rights and privacy, if any, that might result from the service, known as Rekognition.  Both proposals face uphill battles to receive a majority of support from investors in the world\u2019s largest online retailer and cloud computing company. Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos will retain voting rights over about 16 percent of shares after he and MacKenzie Bezos divorce, she said on Thursday. [nL1N21M1JB]  Amazon declined to comment on the SEC decisions. The company is one of many marketers of facial recognition technology and has disclosed sales to law enforcement and to private customers using the service for purposes such as identifying celebrities.  Civil liberties groups have raised concerns including findings by researchers that Amazon\u2019s technology struggles more than some peers\u2019 to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, prompting fears of unjust arrests. Amazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law.  Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC, an advocacy group working with shareholders, including a religious order, who brought the resolutions, said the SEC decisions show the developing rules around facial recognition are \u201creally a critical issue for a company like Amazon and how it handles the business risk associated with the technology.\u201d  According to correspondence posted on the SEC website, Amazon had sought the regulator\u2019s permission to skip the proposals as being insignificant to its business, among other things, but was turned down on March 28.  Amazon then took the unusual step of asking for a reconsideration of that decision, but was again rebuffed in a April 3 letter from the agency.  Other letters show the SEC gave Amazon permission to skip proposals for things like a risk oversight committee, and that Amazon resolved climate concerns raised by other investors.","762":"(Reuters) - FedEx Corp confirmed on Wednesday it would terminate its contract with Amazon.com Inc for small-package ground deliveries, as the online retailer focuses on building out its own delivery network.  The move by the U.S. package delivery company comes two months after it decided not to renew its contract with Amazon for U.S. cargo delivery through its plane-based express service.  \u201cThis change is consistent with our strategy to focus on the broader e-commerce market,\u201d FedEx said in a statement as it looks to expand and serve companies that would include rivals of Amazon.  Amazon in a statement said it is \u201cconstantly innovating to improve the carrier experience and sometimes that means reevaluating our carrier relationships.\u201d  Shares of FedEx were down 2% at $157.91 and Amazon shares were down 1% at $1,769.25 at midday on Wednesday.  Amazon has been expanding its own delivery network of planes, trucks and vans and is regarded as a potential long-term threat to FedEx and rival United Parcel Service Inc, both of which have long counted the e-commerce company as a customer.  \u201cWhat was a frenemy, they\u2019ve now figured out is their competitor,\u201d said Trip Miller, managing partner at Memphis-based Gullane Capital, referring to the FedEx relationship with Amazon.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Analysts have said Amazon has secured a better rate with UPS for package deliveries on planes, so it makes little sense for the company to partner with FedEx.  Amazon accounted for less than 1.3% of FedEx\u2019s revenue last year. UPS, which derives a relatively larger share of revenue from the online retailer, is widely expected to benefit from higher volumes following the latest move, according to analysts.  FedEx already warned in June that U.S.-China trade tensions and the termination of its contract with Amazon would hurt its fiscal 2020 performance.  Meanwhile, FedEx Ground is working to wring out more residential profit by shifting the delivery of nearly 2 million SmartPost packages from U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to its own drivers. That should lower costs by increasing the number of parcels dropped at every stop.  The news about FedEx terminating the Amazon ground delivery contract was first reported by Bloomberg.","763":"Amazon.com Inc is urging a federal appeals court to reconsider an \u201cunprecedented\u201d decision that would allow customers in Pennsylvania to hold the online marketplace liable as the seller of defective products sold by third-parties.

(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)","765":"PARIS, May 23 (Reuters) - Online retail sales in France rose by 11.9% to 24.9 billion euros ($27.7 billion) in the first quarter, said the French E-Commerce Federation (Fevad), reflecting growth in a sector that has seen Amazon put pressure on traditional retailers such as Carrefour.  As the French economy stages a gradual recovery, online sales growth has been boosted by a growing number of online vendors and people using the Internet to shop more often.  The Fevad federation said an additional 1.358 million people made online purchases in the quarter, up 4% from a year ago.  Sales generated via tablets and smartphones rose 22% and Fevad predicted orders made on smartphones could outpace those made via computers by 2021.  The average value of the basket fell 6% to 61 euros in the first quarter, although there was an increase in the frequency of purchases, added Fevad.  There were, on average, 12.7 online transactions per buyer in the first quarter, up from 10.7 a year ago.  In 2018, E-commerce represented 9.7% of overall French retail sales, up from 8.7% in 2017.  In February, Fevad said online retail sales in France could exceed 100 billion euros for 2019.  CLICK-AND-COLLECT ON THE RISE IN FRANCE  A separate statement by Fevad and research firm Nielsen showed that E-commerce made 7.1% of the sales of so-called \u2018fast moving consumer goods\u2019 (FMCG) in France, ahead of 6.3% in Britain, the United States\u2019 5.6% and Germany\u2019s 1.4% but behind 20% for South Korea and 18% for China.  One reason for France\u2019s advance was that click and collect had become a key part of shoppers\u2019 routines, while drive-through services - where consumers order online but collect the shopping by car or on foot or by home delivery - were also increasing in prominence.  Drive-through services were on the rise with the opening of new pedestrian outlets in city centers where people order online and pick up their purchase on foot, with over 5,100 selling points and sales up 7% on a year-on-year basis in 2018.  Amazon has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its global ambitions to expand into food retail.  Last month Amazon and French retailer Casino expanded their partnership, with Amazon installing pick-up lockers in Casino stores and making more of the French company\u2019s products available on Amazon.","766":"The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/Illustration  Flipkart and Amazon\u2019s interest in delivering alcohol in India marks a bold move to make inroads into an alcohol market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.  The local governments of eastern West Bengal and Odisha states have said that Flipkart can be associated as a technology service provider of Diageo DGE.L-backed HipBar, an Indian alcohol home delivery mobile application.  Flipkart\u2019s customers will be allowed to access HipBar\u2019s application on the e-commerce giant\u2019s platforms, according to the letters, which have not previously been reported.  Under the arrangement, Flipkart customers will be able to place orders for their favourite tipple, which HipBar will then deliver after collecting products from retail outlets, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  HipBar, 26% owned by Diageo India, and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In June, Reuters reported that Amazon had secured clearance to deliver alcohol in West Bengal, signalling the U.S. e-commerce giant\u2019s foray into the sector.  \u201cFlipkart wants to make sure that whatever consumers want, they get it. The margins (on liquor deliveries) maybe low, but for Flipkart it is about stickiness so consumer don\u2019t have to anywhere else,\u201d said a source close to Flipkart.  West Bengal is India\u2019s fourth most populous state, with a population of more than 90 million people, while Odisha\u2019s population is more than 41 million. Some states in India, like Gujarat in the west, prohibit alcohol retail.  India\u2019s top two food-delivery startups, Swiggy and Zomato, have also started delivering alcohol in some cities, as companies look to cash in on the high demand for booze from people staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Amazon on Friday also said it will launch an online pharmacy in India that will serve the southern city of Bengaluru.  Shoppers in India are increasingly going online to buy everything from groceries to electronics during the pandemic.","768":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google said on Tuesday it would stop charging merchants to place products on its Google Shopping search page as it looks to win e-commerce advertising business from Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers, just as they are struggling to supply customers with some items due to the coronavirus pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Google is seen in Davos, Switzerland Januar 20, 2020. Picture taken January 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The move is the latest effort by Google to reinvigorate its Shopping service, which has been largely eclipsed by Amazon.com, where most online shoppers now start searches for products and merchants pay to feature prominently.  Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has up to now charged merchants whose products appear when users click on the Shopping tab on Google\u2019s search engine. Amazon, which charges merchants only to promote items high on searches but takes a cut of their sales, is increasingly eating into that business.  By adopting a system akin to Amazon\u2019s, Google is hoping more merchants will put their products on its service, which will attract more shoppers and ultimately increase ad revenue as merchants vie to be featured.  \u201cIf you work with the ecosystem, there will be monetization opportunities that come on top of that,\u201d Google\u2019s president of commerce Bill Ready told Reuters in an interview.  The new policy had been in the works for some time, Ready said, but was brought forward as some stores struggle to find buyers because of the virus. Some merchants said they lost sales during the outbreak when Amazon.com stopped offering fast shipping on some products so it could prioritize what it called essential items.  Google\u2019s plan will take effect next week in the United States and by the end of the year globally.  The move is a gamble for Google, as it may lead to a short-term loss of advertising revenue and does not guarantee an influx of new customers.  \u2018AMAZON COMPETE\u2019  Google executives have debated for months how best to push back against Amazon.com, rejecting the idea of spending billions of dollars to revamp the Google Shopping service, according to previously unreported accounts from 12 current and former high-ranking staff.  Staffers last year explored partnerships with delivery companies to match Amazon\u2019s speedy shipping, but did not get the go-ahead from top executives to strike a deal, one source said.  Amazon has invested heavily in stocking warehouses and delivery drivers at the expense of its gross profit margins, which stand at about 40 cents on every dollar of revenue, according to Refinitiv data.  Google, which has no experience of such a physically intensive delivery operation, balked at a similar type of investment, which would cut its profit margins of about 60 cents per dollar of revenue, three sources said.  \u201cIt\u2019s daunting the amount of capital and expertise it would take to run such a business, and even if you\u2019re successful, are you just going to be No. 2?\u201d said Jon Venverloh, who left Google last summer after 18 years, including some time as a director on Shopping.  Google declined to comment beyond Tuesday\u2019s announcement.  Amazon\u2019s tenfold surge in online ad sales over the last five years to 4% of the global market compared to Google\u2019s 32% has created what some financial analysts call Google\u2019s greatest-ever threat.  As Google leadership planned 2020 budgets last summer, some managers who oversee ad buying and selling software called for a coordinated plan to beat back Amazon on several fronts.  They used presentations entitled \u2018Amazon Compete\u2019 from Google sales chief Philipp Schindler\u2019s strategy team that tracked the online retailer\u2019s growing power, including consumers\u2019 preference for its shopping search tools, three sources said.  The name recalled an effort dubbed \u2018Facebook Compete\u2019 that led to big investments when Facebook Inc\u2019s mobile ads business surpassed Google\u2019s several years ago, five sources said. The project succeeded, with new ad formats and algorithms for mobile putting Google back on top.  But Google executives did not feel the same pressure to invest heavily to beat back Amazon, said Sreekant Lanka, a Google ads executive until a year ago, despite Amazon\u2019s aggressive hiring, acquisitions and sales efforts.  In 2019, Google had its worst sales growth in four years, but still added $18 billion in ad revenue, compared with an estimated $4 billion bump for Amazon.com to about $12 billion.  Google\u2019s steady ad sales growth as more spending moves online has enabled top executives to justify limited investments in shopping, sources said.  BUY ON GOOGLE  Google also gets a cut of the purchase price when customers use the Buy on Google feature available on some products on Google Shopping, which lets people buy items using a credit card on file with Google without leaving the search engine.  Merchants benefit because shoppers are more likely to buy the fewer clicks they have to make. Google gets a cut of sales and details on consumer purchases for ad targeting, while still avoiding fulfillment.  But some stores are not sold. Jeff Cayley, CEO of bicycle retailer Worldwide Cyclery, said he pays Google on average 11 percent of sales for search ads taking shoppers to his website, compared with 15 percent when they purchase through Buy on Google.  \u201cIt seems like a way (for Google) to dabble in marketplaces, but it\u2019s an uphill battle and a confusing experience for consumers,\u201d Cayley said.  Google signed up about 4,000 merchants for Buy on Google by the end of the last year, behind its targets despite temporarily discounting its cut on product purchases by about 20%, according to two of the sources.  While top executives last year initially prioritized big subsidies to attract shoppers, they later backtracked and even froze hiring in some areas to cut costs, according to three sources.  Last month, Google again suspended promotions and marketing plans because of concerns related to the new coronavirus.  Ben Frederick said he listed his Dr. Frederick\u2019s Original foot-health products through Buy on Google in mid-March when Amazon\u2019s delivery times lengthened. But he said just three Google orders had trickled in by last week.","769":"FILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is pictured outside the company's JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island, New York, U.S. November 25, 2020.

If the online retailer\u2019s shares keep up their recent pace, it would be a matter of when, not if, Amazon\u2019s stock market valuation eclipses that of iPhone maker Apple, which reached $1 trillion on Aug. 2.  Apple took almost 38 years as a public company to achieve the trillion dollar milestone, while Amazon got there in 21 years. While Apple\u2019s iPhone and other devices remain popular and its revenues are growing, it is not keeping up with Amazon\u2019s blistering sales growth.

Apple started trading in December 1980 but its stock did not truly start to take flight for another 25 years, spurred by the iPhone, the breakthrough device that left competitors in the dust.  Amazon - founded as an online book-retailer in Chief Executive Jeff Bezos\u2019 garage in 1994 - started trading on May 15, 1997 at $1.50 on a split-adjusted basis.  By October 2009 it had risen to $100 and the stock hit $1,000 for the first time on May 30, 2017. It has held above that level since Oct. 27, 2017.

GeoPark said in a statement late on Thursday that it wanted to incorporate more information into its environmental plan for tapping Block 64 in the remote jungle region of Loreto, and planned to coordinate with authorities to resubmit it at a later date.  GeoPark needs Peruvian government approval of its environmental plan before it can start operating Block 64, which it says holds 160 million barrels of crude in probable and possible reserves.  State-run oil company Petroperu holds a 25% stake in the project.  The announcement came a day before leaders of the indigenous Achuar planned to meet with environmental authorities in the capital Lima to discuss their opposition to GeoPark\u2019s plans.  Some Achuar communities have filed a lawsuit to halt GeoPark\u2019s plans in Block 64, which overlaps with native land. They say they do not want any oil drilling nearby, and point to pollution from spills that has plagued other indigenous communities in Loreto.

Jassy acknowledged that the issue around facial recognition technology was a \u201creal one\u201d, but said \u201cjust because technology could be misused, doesn\u2019t mean you should ban or condemn it.\u201d  Law enforcement in Oregon and Florida have used Amazon\u2019s face and image ID service, known as Rekognition.  Amazon\u2019s approach has differed somewhat from Microsoft\u2019s.

Shares rose as much as 2 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday as Amazon said faster shipping will come to customers around the world and said its profit more than doubled in the first quarter, trouncing estimates thanks to soaring demand for its cloud and ad services.  The news marks a costly challenge for competitors that will have to pour money into a logistics problem that even the king of e-commerce has yet to solve.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  MORE PROFIT TO SPEND  Shifts in the nature of Amazon\u2019s business have afforded the company windfalls that it now can apply toward its ambitious delivery program.  The company\u2019s loyal customer base has drawn merchants to sell and increasingly advertise through its site in exchange for fees. In the first quarter, revenue from seller services jumped 20 percent to $11.1 billion, while ad and other sales surged 34 percent to $2.7 billion, the company said.  Meanwhile, Amazon\u2019s cash cow, its cloud unit known as AWS that sells data storage and computing services to enterprises, saw operating income grow 59 percent to $2.2 billion.  The numbers reflect Amazon\u2019s transformation from a low-margin retail business to a more lucrative marketplace and technology behemoth. While revenue growth slowed, profit surged to $3.6 billion in the first quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company forecast net sales of between $59.5 billion and $63.5 billion for the second quarter, the midpoint of which was below analysts\u2019 average estimate of $62.4 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cAmazon delivered slower growth in all key segments \u2013 AWS, advertising and e-commerce \u2013 but margins skyrocketed, seemingly driven by less aggressive investment,\u201d said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.  Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s CFO, said the company was still reaping rewards from prior years of hiring and investments in warehouses and other infrastructure. The company had managed and complied with regulatory changes in India, which only months earlier had caused Amazon some uncertainty. But investment would soon ramp up, he said.  Amazon estimated that second-quarter operating income would be as much as $3.6 billion, short of the $4.2 billion analysts were expecting, according to FactSet.  The company plans to spend more to roll out benefits to international Prime members. Hiring would also pick up from the 12 percent increase Amazon posted in the past 12 months, according to Olsavsky.  The company is delving into even less familiar terrain, too. It recently announced investments in self-driving and electric car companies, teasing how it thinks these high-tech, capital-intensive businesses could pay dividends potentially in the form of autonomous deliveries in the long run. Amazon has not described in detail its thinking behind the bets.  The initiatives reflect how the world\u2019s largest online retailer has long invested in still-untested technology and programs, like its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market to bolster home grocery deliveries.  The marches into new industries has been lucrative to shareholders, including its founder Jeff Bezos, who is the richest man in the world.","774":"April 17 (Reuters) - Online e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc is preparing to launch an ultra-fast grocery delivery service in the United Kingdom, trade magazine The Grocer reported on Friday, citing suppliers.

Amazon was not immediately available to comment.  The move comes as UK\u2019s dominant online grocer, Ocado , has been struggling to open up grocery delivery slots for consumers due to unprecedented demand caused by COVID-19 related lockdowns.  Amazon\u2019s new service is aimed at bringing rapid grocery delivery to almost 40% of UK households by the end of the year, the suppliers briefed on the program told The Grocer.

An expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday may not have a strong effect on technology companies, which generally rely less than other kinds of companies on debt.  The S&P 500 information technology index .SPLRCT dipped by an average of 0.3 percent in the five-session period following the Fed's four most recent rate hikes, in line with S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Investors nervous about how much longer a nine-year bull market can last have favored big tech names as among the most reliable on the stock market because their business models are often viewed as disruptive and less susceptible to economic downturns, at least over the long run.  The popularity of Amazon, which is pushing beyond online retail and cloud computing into supermarkets and even healthcare, has left it trading at 167 times expected earnings, up from around 100 a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. By comparison, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings.  \u201cIf you ask anyone right now, if it\u2019s a business owner they\u2019ll say they\u2019re afraid of Amazon. If they\u2019re an investor, they\u2019ll tell you Amazon is going up forever,\u201d said Andrew Bodner, president of Double Diamond Investment Group in Parsippany, New Jersey.  \u201cOverall, it creates more volatility for the market because everyone owns Amazon, and if Amazon goes down you\u2019ll see that reflected,\u201d Bodner said.  Investors\u2019 increased reliance on passively managed index funds has also contributed to the rally in technology shares because the companies\u2019 inclusion in the S&P 500 and other indexes means money will be poured into them even if they have expensive earnings multiples, O\u2019Rourke said.  Momentum for some major technology stocks is already showing signs of moderation. Facebook has fallen 5 percent after hitting a record high at the start of February, with some investors worried that people are spending less time on the social media platform.  Posing a potential threat to the rally, the S&P 500 technology index is trading at a relatively expensive 18.8 times expected earnings, 12 percent above its 15-year average, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  (Graphic: Tech earnings multiples far above average - reut.rs\/2FL29JL)  While S&P 500 information technology earnings per share are expected to grow by a healthy 17.5 percent this year, that\u2019s less than last year\u2019s 20.8 percent surge and lower than the 19.5 percent earnings expansion expected for the entire S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Technology companies may be benefiting more modestly than others from corporate tax cuts enacted this year, according to CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.

The talks concerning Casino\u2019s Via Varejo SA unit, which includes Brazil\u2019s third-largest e-commerce operation and more than 900 stores in the country, would accelerate Amazon\u2019s previously tepid advances into Latin America\u2019s largest market.  The negotiation comes as the U.S. e-commerce leader and Casino have struck an agreement to sell groceries from the French group\u2019s upmarket Monoprix through Amazon.  The Brazil deal, a more complex negotiation that has been discussed alongside the French partnership since January, could be structured using the same model or as an outright sale of Via Varejo, the source said.  News of the talks sent shares of GPA SA, Casino\u2019s Brazilian supermarket chain that owns Via Varejo, as much as 5.5 percent higher in Sao Paulo trading. Units of Via Varejo, which blend preferred and common stock, also rose up to 5.5 percent.  Via Varejo and Amazon representatives in Brazil declined to comment. Casino and GPA reiterated that they put a controlling stake in Via Varejo up for sale in October 2016, adding that the sale process is underway and there is no news to report at the moment. Casino also denied any partnership involving Via Varejo.  Via Varejo attracted little initial interest in 2016 as its then-traditional infrastructure kept costs high and hurt its bottom line. It has since expanded its e-commerce operations and turned a profit in four of the last five quarters.  Amazon has waded slowly into Brazil\u2019s complex and highly competitive online retail market, starting with e-book sales in 2012, adding physical books two years later and offering third-party sales of electronics in October.  Reuters reported in recent months that the world\u2019s largest online retailer has been preparing to ramp up its Brazilian presence, courting local suppliers of appliances and electronics and eyeing a large warehouse outside of Sao Paulo.  JPMorgan analysts told clients that a Via Varejo deal could be \u201ca potential shortcut for Amazon expansion in Brazil, particularly by providing fulfillment capabilities that have been a key issue.\u201d Via Varejo has some 26 distribution centers throughout Brazil.  Shares of Brazilian e-commerce rivals B2W Cia Digital and Magazine Luiza SA both fell around 3 percent on news of Amazon\u2019s talks with Casino.  GPA and Via Varejo have sharpened their focus on e-commerce in recent weeks, replacing the chief executives of both companies in a move that will take effect in April.  In February, GPA said it would replace its CEO with Peter Paul Estermann, the current head of Via Varejo, who is credited with the electronics retailer\u2019s digitally focused turnaround.  The top job at Via Varejo will go to Flavio Dias, who leads the company\u2019s online division and has been described by the company as an e-commerce pioneer in Brazil.

The world\u2019s largest e-commerce firm said the cameras, which are developed by transportation technology company Netradyne, would improve safety of both drivers and the communities in which they deliver.  But employees like Henry Search, a 22-year-old delivery driver in Washington state, said they saw cameras capturing their work day as an \u201cinvasion of privacy\u201d.  \u201cWe are out here working all day, trying our best already,\u201d Search told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. \u201cThe cameras are just another way to control us.\u201d  Privacy advocates warned that equipping Amazon\u2019s fleet of about 30,000 delivery vehicles with AI cameras could set a dangerous precedent for privacy.  \u201cThis appears to be the largest expansion of corporate surveillance in human history,\u201d said Evan Greer, deputy director of tech nonprofit Fight for the Future. \u201cIf this becomes the norm, we are talking about the extinction of human privacy.\u201d  Amazon has come under scrutiny in the past for accidents involving delivery drivers.  A company spokeswoman said in emailed comments that \u201cthis technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.\u201d  In an instructional video about the cameras, Amazon\u2019s senior manager for last-mile safety Karolina Haraldsdottir said cameras will record 100% of the time, but are not set up to livestream from inside of vans.  They will detect unsafe driving, including when drivers appear distracted or drowsy, she explained, adding that the footage could be used by the company\u2019s safety team, or in investigations of theft or accidents.  But Greer said that safety issues could be addressed by slowing the pace of work. \u201cThe first thing they (Amazon) should do to improve safety would be not have such outrageous delivery quotas that force people into unsafe conditions,\u201d she said.  Another driver in Massachusetts, who asked not to use his name to protect his identity, said he would welcome a camera displayed outside his van to record evidence for any accident.  \u201cBut a camera on my face all the time, I don\u2019t see how that keeps me safe - it\u2019s too much,\u201d he said in a phone interview, noting that drivers already use an app called Mentor that tracks the location and movements of the vehicle.  DATA USE  Haraldsdottir said that \u201conly a limited set of authorized people\u201d would have access to driver footage from the cameras.  But some drivers worried Amazon might sell or share the footage with third parties, or use the cameras to monitor their performance on the job.  \u201cThe footage recorded could be shared with a future possible employer who can then decide to reject you before even knowing you,\u201d said one driver from Michigan who asked not to give his full name.  Although he enjoys doing deliveries for Amazon, he said he is currently looking for other work because he does not want to be subjected to surveillance.  Rights activists say Amazon already has an extensive surveillance system in its warehouses to track workers\u2019 movements and boost productivity, including navigation software, item scanners, wristbands, thermal cameras and recorded footage.  \u201cThere are no laws in place to meaningfully limit what Amazon can do with the footage they collect,\u201d said Greer, noting that other surveillance products, such as the Ring doorbell camera system, can share footage with police departments.  \u2018DYSTOPIA PRIME\u2019  Surveillance experts say that the privacy implications of Amazon\u2019s camera network for delivery vans extend far beyond drivers.  Andrew Ferguson, a professor of law at D.C.\u2019s American University, said Amazon\u2019s private surveillance networks would further entrench the snooping powers of government.  \u201cWhile the inclination to use AI technology to enhance driver safety is commendable, the failure to think about the privacy and surveillance issues and equities is troubling,\u201d he said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Singapore Exchange SGX, London-based Aquis Exchange and Amazon Web Services said they undertook a proof of concept to show that trading shares in the cloud can be sufficiently fast and reliable.  \u201cIt\u2019s proven to be technically capable,\u201d said Adrian Ip, a director at Aquis Exchange\u2019s technology arm.  Exchanges using the cloud to date for trading are limited in size or niche, such as dealing in crypto assets, Ip said.  Amazon\u2019s move into \u201cmulticast\u201d or an ability to send data to many parties at the same time in the cloud, a key requirement for any exchange of size, was a breakthrough, Ip said.  Despite exchanges spending millions of dollars on physical back-up servers, there have been outages this year in Japan, Australia, and at Euronext in Europe, drawing close scrutiny from regulators.  A cloud-based exchange could be more resilient than relying on physical infrastructure dotted across regions, Ip said.  Mayumi Hiramatsu, Vice President at Amazon Web Services, said the pilot showed a path to free up customers from maintaining legacy on-premises infrastructure.  Aquis and SGX are looking at how to take forward findings from their pilot with Amazon, which they say could bring savings of up to 90%.  \u201cWe will be looking at how this can be scaled globally. We will take a considered and measured approach and discuss with regulators and members,\u201d Ip said.  It comes at a time when regulators globally are also taking a harder look at how financial firms are increasingly relying on third party cloud providers like Amazon, Google and Microsoft for critical services.  The European Union aims to be the first to introduce new laws to regulate such use of the cloud.","797":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will retain voting control of his entire $143 billion stake in the company under a divorce settlement with his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, who will own 25 percent of those shares, the couple said on Thursday, removing uncertainty over control of the online retailer.  The world\u2019s richest couple had announced their impending divorce in a joint Twitter statement in January, causing some to worry that Jeff Bezos could wind up with less Amazon voting power or that he or MacKenzie would liquidate large positions.  (Graphic: Amazon filing with U.S. SEC - bit.ly\/2IaO24s)  \u201cIt takes the issue off the table, with less turbulence than you might have expected,\u201d said an investor, whose company owns several million dollars worth of Amazon shares but who asked for anonymity because of a firm policy.  MacKenzie Bezos will wind up with a stake in Amazon that is worth roughly $36 billion. Her shares represent a 4 percent stake in Amazon, according to a regulatory filing by the company. The Amazon shares will make her the world\u2019s third-richest woman while Jeff Bezos will remain the world\u2019s richest person, according to Forbes.  The couple, who tweeted separately on Thursday, disclosed that under their settlement MacKenzie will give up her interests in the Washington Post, which Jeff Bezos bought in 2013 and which has been a frequent target of criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, and the rocket company Blue Origin he founded in 2000.  \u201cGrateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage with Jeff,\u201d MacKenzie Bezos said in her tweet outlining the agreement, the first and only post from an account created this month.  The two did not provide any further financial details about the settlement.  \u201cINFLUENCE WOULD BE THE SAME\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest online retailer, said in the filing that 4 percent of its outstanding shares would be registered in MacKenzie Bezos\u2019 name after court approval of the divorce, which is expected to occur in about 90 days.  The petition for divorce was filed in Washington state, a person familiar with the matter said.  Jeff Bezos, whom Amazon listed in its most recent proxy statement as its single largest shareholder with a 16.3 percent stake, will keep sole voting authority over the shares unless MacKenzie donates them to a nonprofit or sells them in the open market.  Amazon shares closed down 0.1 percent at $1,818.86.  Jeff Bezos, 55, is seen as essential to Amazon\u2019s meteoric growth and stock price rise since he founded the company as an online bookseller in 1994. He has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon.  \u201cWhen I think about Amazon, and the influence Bezos has on Amazon, I would argue his influence would be the same if he had 51 percent shares outstanding or 1 percent. I think his influence is dictated by his vision for Amazon,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said.  MacKenzie Bezos\u2019 stake in Amazon is worth more than the market values of nearly 70 percent of the components of the S&P 500.  The settlement suggests that Amazon will be spared the kind of boardroom battle that has plagued other companies whose owners are dealing with family rifts, even though the divorce had jolted the once-private Bezos couple into the public spotlight.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Jeff Bezos re-tweeted MacKenzie\u2019s statement and added in a separate post that he was grateful \u201cfor her support and for her kindness in this process.\u201d  Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, said the settlement should put investors at ease.  \u201cThey\u2019ve done a lot of work behind the scenes to make their breakup as amicable as it seems,\u201d she said. Still, Sadler added, \u201cWithout knowing what cash she received, I have no idea how favorable it was to him or not.\u201d  The day the couple announced their separation on Twitter, the National Enquirer promised to reveal an affair by Jeff Bezos that it claimed had ended their marriage, contrary to the couple\u2019s statement that they were on a \u201clong period of loving exploration and trial separation.\u201d  The U.S. tabloid then published alleged photos and intimate text messages between Bezos and his new partner, former television news anchor Lauren Sanchez.","798":"LOS ANGELES, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Tambor, the award-winning star of Amazon Studios television series \u201cTransparent,\u201d is exiting the show, Amazon said on Thursday, following accusations of sexual misconduct.

The deal would involve Amazon acquiring a minority stake in Rackspace, the sources said. Rackspace helps companies migrate their data to Amazon Web Services, and the investment would strengthen the ties between the two companies. Rackspace also migrates companies to Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud, Microsoft Corp\u2019s Azure and VMware Inc.  There is no certainty that Amazon and Rackspace, which is majority-owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc, will agree a deal, the sources said. If there is one, it could take one to two months to negotiate it, the sourced added, asking anonymity because the matter is confidential.  Rackspace and Apollo declined to comment, while Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.  Rackspace leases server space and helps corporations store and access data in the cloud. It was acquired by Apollo in a $4.3 leveraged buyout in 2016, and was listed in the stock market earlier this month. The San Antonio, Texas-based company has market capitalization of more than $3 billion, almost as much as its debt pile.  Amazon\u2019s cloud services is thriving on higher demand from companies switching to virtual offices amid the coronavirus outbreak. Its revenue from Amazon Web Services, which sells data storage and computing power in the cloud, rose nearly 29% in the second quarter to $10.81 billion.  If Rackspace bring in Amazon as an investor, it would be the second Apollo-owned company to secure such a deal with a major technology company this year.  Earlier this month, Google revealed it had picked up a 6.6% stake in ADT Inc for $450 million, betting on the home security company\u2019s strong customer base and an army of technicians to drive sales of its Nest devices.  Apollo had acquired ADT in a nearly $7 billion deal in 2016, and still owns a majority stake in the company. ADT shares have risen in value by more than a third since the deal with Google was announced.

Periodically mooted as a possible bidder for Morrisons, Amazon has been slowly extending its food service in Britain, but market research firm Kantar Worldpanel estimates its market share is so far less than 1%.  The new Amazon agreement was for \u201ca number of years rather than on a rolling basis, and will be exploring new opportunities to innovate and improve the shopping experience,\u201d Bradford, northern England, based Morrisons said.  Morrisons, which has a 10.1% market share, trails market leader Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Walmart\u2019s Asda in annual sales.  It first tied up with Amazon in 2016 with a wholesale supply deal, whose scope has grown. In June the companies agreed to expand the \u201cMorrisons store on Prime Now\u201d service to more cities across Britain, including Glasgow and Newcastle.  Doug Gurr, Amazon\u2019s UK country manager, said its relationship with Morrisons was an important part of its UK grocery growth plan.  Customers can already order a full Morrisons shop online, which is then picked at a local Morrisons store, and delivered by Amazon. There is also an option for one hour delivery.  Although Morrisons Chief Executive David Potts was vague on what the exploration would entail and declined to provide the agreement\u2019s duration, he said as a wholesaler to Amazon the British company could be \u201cpart of their ambitions\u201d.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re exploring, life can be a bit unclear ... We achieve capital light growth by leveraging partners\u2019 knowhow and assets,\u201d he told reporters.  Analysts have also suggested Morrisons could be a candidate for a takeover by an overseas private equity firm, given the 24% fall in its share price over the last year and the weakness of the pound making deals cheaper.  Potts said the takeover talk was \u201cpure speculation\u201d.  BE PREPARED  Shares in Morrisons were up 4.2% at 1416 GMT after also beating expectations for first half profit and forecasting improved sales in its second half despite the threat of a no-deal Brexit, after quarterly sales fell for the first time since 2016. It also paid another special dividend.  For the six months to Aug. 4, Morrisons reported a 5.3% rise in pretax profit before one-off items to 198 million pounds ($244 million) on revenue up 0.4% to 8.83 billion pounds.  Group like-for-like sales, excluding fuel and VAT sales tax, fell 1.9% in its second quarter, having increased 2.3% in the first quarter.  Second quarter results faced a tough comparison with a year earlier, when sales were boosted by hot weather, a royal wedding and the soccer World Cup. The sales fall followed 14 straight quarters of growth.  UK consumer confidence continued to be weak but Morrisons\u2019 data had not indicated consumers were stockpiling ahead of Brexit, said Potts.  He said the group was prepared for all Brexit scenarios.  The British government\u2019s plans in the event of a no-deal Brexit warn of severe disruption to cross-channel routes, affecting the supply of fresh foods.  Morrisons has stockpiled ambient goods and packaging materials, shifted some supplies away from the main Calais-Dover route, and obtained Authorised Economic Operator status, which it hopes will speed-up border checks in the event of hold-ups.  Potts said the group would also be able to leverage its British credentials - two thirds of what it sells is British, it is Britain\u2019s No.2 producer of food, and is British farming\u2019s biggest single supermarket customer.","814":"Lamar Jackson, the reigning most valuable player in the National Football League, sued Amazon.com Inc for trademark infringement, saying the online retailer sold unlicensed clothing bearing his name and likeness without permission.

Those indicted planned to pay over $100,000 in exchange for an unfair competitive advantage on the Amazon marketplace - a platform where third-party merchants sell goods, the Department said.  The defendants used bribery and fraud to reinstate products and accounts that Amazon had suspended or blocked entirely from doing business on its marketplace. That resulted in more than $100 million of competitive benefits to those accounts, harm to competitors and harm to consumers, according to the indictment.  \u201cThe ultimate victim from this criminal conduct is the buying public who get inferior or even dangerous goods that should have been removed from the marketplace,\u201d U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran said in a statement.  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The move comes as the online retailer is also recruiting new delivery service partners, or DSPs, to help reduce delivery costs that more than tripled to $21.7 billion between 2013 and 2017.  Amazon and its DSP owners are competing for workers in the tightest U.S. labor market in decades. UPS and FedEx combined plan to hire more than 150,000 temporary holiday workers.

Amazon is hiring across the United States and will provide vans for the seasonal workers, a company spokeswoman said.

The move is part of a push at Cisco, one of the biggest suppliers of the routers and switches that send data across computer networks, to derive more revenue from software and stay current with longtime business customers that are seeking to do more work with cloud computing companies like Amazon, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud unit or Microsoft Corp\u2019s Azure.  Cisco began making that push under Chief Executive Chuck Robbins after sales declines in its core network hardware business - declines that were largely driven by big businesses\u2019 deciding not to build out their own data centers in favor of moving to public computing clouds like AWS.  But now those clouds are part of Cisco\u2019s growth plans, Kip Compton, Cisco\u2019s senior vice president of cloud platform, told Reuters.  Cisco is offering new software tools, based on a technology called containers, that let developers slice up applications to run them either in their own data centers, where they might use a lot of Cisco gear, or a cloud data center like the ones offered by AWS. Developers can also use a mix of both.  Cisco\u2019s new tools use the technology to let businesses move their software applications back and forth between Amazon and their own data center without interruptions. Compton said the tools will work for companies that do not currently use any Cisco hardware in their data centers, though extra security features will be available to those that do.  \u201cThe way we like to think about it at Cisco is, we\u2019re growing and adding a software business to a very important hardware business,\u201d Compton said in an interview.

But if innovation means that the consumer is put at a disadvantage and price comparisons are made difficult then we fight that,\u201d Wolfgang Schuldzinski, head of the consumer body, said in a statement.  The online retailer launched its thumb-sized Dash button in 2015, allowing members of its Prime membership scheme to re-order products such as laundry detergent, coffee and dishwasher tablets by pushing a wifi-connected button.  An Amazon spokesman said the company was convinced the Dash button complied with German law and it would fight the ruling through other legal channels, even though the consumer body said the court would not grant an appeal.  \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is not only hostile to innovation. It also stops customers from making an informed decision about whether a service like the Dash button gives them a convenient shopping experience,\u201d he said.  Separately, Amazon is under investigation by Germany\u2019s anti-trust authority, which is looking into whether the company is exploiting its market dominance in its relations with third-party retailers who use its website as a marketplace.  Germany is Amazon\u2019s second biggest market. It has faced a long-running battle with unions in the country over pay and conditions for logistics workers.","838":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are reviewing whether National Enquirer parent company American Media Inc violated an earlier agreement granting it legal immunity in exchange for cooperation given the tabloid\u2019s handling of a story about Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: People move past a hoarding of Amazon India outside a metro rail station in New Delhi, India, October 23, 2019. REUTERS\/Anushree Fadnavis\/File Photo  Last month the Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered an investigation of Amazon and rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart, over alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices.  Amazon and Flipkart have faced mounting criticism from India\u2019s brick-and-mortar retailers, which accuse the U.S. giants of violating Indian law by racking up billions of dollars of losses to fund deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers. The companies deny the allegations.  The CCI ordered its probe after a New Delhi-based trader group complained that the e-commerce giants were promoting select sellers and in turn hurting business for other smaller players in one of the world\u2019s biggest online shopping markets.  \u201cThe entire order passed by (the CCI) ... is bereft of any foundation,\u201d Amazon said in a Feb. 10 filing to a court in the city of Bengaluru, rejecting the allegations leveled against the company.  \u201c(The investigation order) suffers from non-application of mind as it appears to contain no reference to the finding of an appreciable adverse effect on competition.\u201d  Amazon declined a Reuters request for comment, saying the matter was going through the courts. The CCI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Flipkart said after the CCI ordered the probe that it was \u201cfully compliant\u201d with all laws in India.  The Bengaluru court is likely to hear Amazon\u2019s petition later this week and the complainant trader group, Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, has been informed about it, a lawyer involved in the matter said.  The trader group will defend its case to ensure the antitrust probe is not quashed or put on hold, the lawyer added.  More stringent foreign investment rules in India have also affected Amazon.  Last month, after the CCI probe was launched, India\u2019s trade minister said Amazon wasn\u2019t doing any \u201cgreat favor\u201d by announcing a new $1 billion investment, laying bare the tensions with the U.S. online retailer.  \u201cThe (CCI) investigation also has reputational consequences for the petitioner, being a global company and a part of the internationally reputed Amazon Group,\u201d the e-commerce giant said in its filing.","842":"NEW DELHI\/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Amazon.com AMZN.O is in early-stage talks to buy a stake worth at least $2 billion in Indian mobile operator Bharti Airtel BRTI.NS, three people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters, in a move that could turbocharge India's digital economy.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  The planned investment, if completed, would mean Amazon acquiring a roughly 5% stake based on the current market value of Bharti and would give India\u2019s third-largest telecoms company a boost as it seeks to compete against the number one player Reliance Jio.  \u201cJio has transformed itself from a pure mobile operator to a digital technology-led consumer facing platform, and Airtel can do the same,\u201d said one of the people.  \u201cAirtel is looking to play a catch-up game here, and for Amazon it makes all the strategic directional sense for the India business.\u201d  Amazon had been mulling several investment options, including buying a stake worth up to 8-10%, a second person said.  The talks between Bharti and Amazon are at an early stage and the deal terms could change, or an agreement may not be reached, said two of the three people, all of whom declined to be identified because the discussions are confidential.  If talks to buy a stake fail, the companies could also look at a commercial transaction that could give Bharti\u2019s customers cheap access to Amazon products, one of the people said.  An Amazon spokeswoman said the company does \u201cnot offer comments on speculation of what we may or may not do in future.\u201d  Bharti said they routinely work with all digital players to bring their products, content and services to customers. \u201cBeyond that there is no other activity to report,\u201d it said in a statement.  Shares in Bharti closed 3.8% higher after rising as much as 6% on news of the Amazon talks. The broader NSE Nifty 50 index .NSEI closed down 0.32%.  U.S. TECH INTEREST  The discussions between Amazon and Bharti underscore the attraction of India\u2019s digital economy for U.S. tech giants.  Over the past six weeks, Jio, the digital arm of Reliance Industries RELI.NS raised $10 billion from global investors including Facebook FB.O as it seeks to establish itself as a one-stop digital commerce platform.  Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google is also exploring an investment in Vodafone Idea, a joint venture between Britain's Vodafone Group Plc VOD.L and India's Idea Cellular, the Financial Times reported last week.  Vodafone Idea is the second-largest telecoms company in India, where the coronavirus lockdown has led to a surge in demand for online shopping, entertainment and data.  Amazon counts India as a crucial growth market where it has committed $6.5 billion in investments mainly toward expanding its e-commerce footprint.  The Seattle-based company has also expanded its digital offerings in India via its voice-activated speakers, video streaming and cloud storage, as it seeks to tap a rising number of internet and smartphone users in the country of 1.3 billion people.  A deal with Bharti could help Amazon expand offerings via its smart speakers and also boost its cloud business as access to Bharti\u2019s vast telecom fibre network could help Amazon lower costs.

So did workers in New York, Illinois and Minnesota.  Former Amazon employee, Christian Smalls, stands with fellow demonstrators during a protest outside of an Amazon warehouse as the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in the Staten Island borough of New York U.S., May 1, 2020. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  These and other Amazon.com Inc employees across the country are seizing on the coronavirus to demand the world\u2019s largest online retailer offer more paid sick time and temporarily shut warehouses with infections for deep cleaning.  Employees in at least 11 states this year have voiced their concerns and staged actions to highlight a variety of purported workplace deficiencies, allegations the company has denied.  Supporting these Amazon workers are labor groups and unions eager to penetrate the Seattle-based behemoth after years of failed attempts to unionize its operations.  Reuters spoke with 16 unions and labor groups targeting Amazon. They included established organizations such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), as well as newer worker advocacy groups like Warehouse Workers for Justice and Athena, a coalition of labor and social justice groups that have criticized Amazon\u2019s business practices.  Most unions acknowledged their long odds at organizing Amazon using traditional tactics such as holding meetings and gauging interest. Legal hurdles to unionizing the company\u2019s workplaces and mounting elections are steep. For now, many groups said, they are showing workers how to harness public opinion to shame Amazon into granting concessions.  The strategy proved effective in the national \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign to raise the minimum wage. Labor organizations in recent years helped retail and fast-food workers stage highly publicized protests and social media campaigns to draw attention to their modest pay at a time when the economy was booming.  Cities and states including Seattle, San Francisco, California, Arkansas and Missouri raised their minimum wages as did some large U.S. employers, including Amazon, which attributed its pay hikes to a tight labor market as well as pressure from lawmakers and labor groups.  In labor\u2019s latest efforts targeting Amazon, organizations are helping workers create online petitions, connect with elected officials, contact media and file labor complaints with the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The initiative puts public pressure on Amazon to respond, several groups said, while laying the groundwork for unions to recruit card-carrying members in the future.  \u201cWe expect that there will be more push for unionization when we get to the other side of this,\u201d said Stuart Applebaum, president of RWDSU.  Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said Amazon already offers what these groups are requesting: $15 per hour or more to start, health benefits and opportunities for career growth.  \u201cWe encourage anyone interested in the facts to compare our overall pay and benefits, as well as our speed in managing this crisis, to other retailers and major employers across the country,\u201d she said.  Central to the organizing effort, union officials said, is fear among some frontline Amazon workers over the spread of coronavirus in the company\u2019s warehouses.  At least 800 workers in Amazon\u2019s 519 U.S. distribution facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, based on internal company figures compiled by Jana Jumpp, an Amazon warehouse employee in Indiana, who shared the numbers with Reuters. Amazon sends text messages and automated calls to employees alerting them to positive cases in their facilities. Jumpp aggregates cases mentioned in messages sent to her by Amazon workers around the country.  Jumpp said the informal process she has developed likely misses cases. She and other employees said Amazon does not share a running tally of cases at each facility or provide a nationwide count.  \u201cWe have no idea how many people are actually sick, not tested or out on quarantine,\u201d Jumpp said on a recent media call organized by Athena, the labor coalition.  At least six Amazon workers have died of COVID-19, which the company confirmed publicly after each incident.  Amazon\u2019s Lighty would not disclose to Reuters the total number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States. She said the company\u2019s efforts to quarantine infected workers are helping to slow the spread, and rates of infection \u201care at or below the communities we\u2019re operating in at almost all of our facilities.\u201d Lighty did not provide data to support that claim.  A majority of Amazon employees are showing up at work and the company \u201cobjects to the irresponsible actions of labor groups and others in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon,\u201d she said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Lighty said employee health and safety is the company\u2019s top priority. Amazon will spend more than $800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, she said.  Amazon over the past decade has eviscerated brick-and-mortar retail competitors, some of them unionized, while successfully fending off several attempts by its own employees to organize. With shutdowns now battering Main Street, Amazon is poised to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger than ever.  The company reported record first-quarter sales of $75.5 billion, up 26% from the same period a year ago, as customers sheltering in place have relied on its services and its stock price has risen 35% since the start of the year.  Amazon had nearly 600,000 U.S. employees in 2019, according to its latest annual report, making it one of the largest employers in the country.  In 2019, 10.3% of U.S. workers were union members, down from 20.1% in 1983, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Over 33 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, strengthening the hand of employers at a time of mass unemployment. Still, some labor experts said coronavirus presents unions with their best shot in decades to make inroads at Amazon.  \u201cJustice issues and safety at work tend to be the most powerful arguments in organizing,\u201d said Alex Colvin, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. \u201cThey\u2019re the strongest reason for workers to want representation.\u201d  He said unions have resorted to public relations as a tool to pressure companies as worker protections such as \u201ccollective bargaining and employment rights enforcement have weakened.\u201d  FIGHTING UNIONS  Amazon has resisted unionization within its workforce since its founding in 1994. It defeated unionizing efforts in Seattle in 2000 and in Delaware in 2014 by a wide margin.  In recent weeks it has fired at least four workers in three states who had publicly criticized the company and were involved in organizing.  Lighty said Amazon has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for retaliation. These workers were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but for violating policies such as physical distancing, she said.  Among those sacked was Emily Cunningham, a Seattle-based activist with Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more to fight global warming. She had recently circulated a petition calling for measures such as improved sick leave and urged all employees to agree on a day in April to call in sick to protest warehouse working conditions.  \u201cThere is a lot of frustration on how Amazon is handling the issue of workplace safety,\u201d Cunningham said. She said she has been in touch with the AFL-CIO about the sickout, and a local affiliate of the union called MLK Labor has offered support to continue the fight on working conditions. MLK Labor confirmed it is working with employees that Amazon fired in Seattle.  The AFL-CIO\u2019s secretary treasurer, Elizabeth Shuler, said the union is using the pandemic to galvanize Amazon workers at company headquarters and enlist support from elected officials. Amazon had over 53,000 employees in Seattle in 2019.  \u201cAmazon\u2019s backyard is Seattle, and that\u2019s a major focus for us in terms of how to take the energy, the courage, the activism that we are already seeing there and build that into a real movement,\u201d she said.  Amazon\u2019s Lighty said the company has listened to complaints and implemented over 150 measures to keep workers safe.  The company is also running television advertisements thanking warehouse workers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in April showed up at a Texas distribution center and met workers to show his support.  NEW APPROACH  But a steady rise in the number of infections at warehouses has spurred more protests.  Amazon worker Mario Crippen led an April 1 walkout at a Michigan warehouse to protest what he said was a lack of transparency from the company about the number of infections. He said about 40 workers participated in that action at the facility in Romulus, about 24 miles southwest of Detroit.  Amazon disputed that figure, saying fewer than 15 people participated.  Helping Crippen was labor nonprofit United for Respect, which coached him on how to gain media attention without getting fired and use social media to gather more supporters. The group also offered legal help from attorneys if he was terminated.  Crippen, 26, whose job is to stow products at the warehouse, told Reuters he felt as if \u201csomebody had my back.\u201d He said at least 25 workers at the Romulus warehouse have tested positive, according to figures compiled by employees at the site. Crippen said some workers want the facility shut down for cleaning, and plan to continue protesting working conditions while exploring the idea of working closely with labor groups and unions in the future.  Amazon spokeswoman Lighty did not comment about the Romulus protest, the number of cases at the site or the company\u2019s decision to not shut down the facility. She said Amazon\u2019s decision to handle the closure of a building for deep cleaning depends on several factors, including consulting with health authorities and medical experts.  A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Labor said the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA), received employee complaints about the Romulus site and sent a letter to Amazon listing steps the company \u201ccould take to correct the hazards.\u201d She and MIOSHA would not provide more information.  Lighty did not comment on the details in the letter.  Some labor organizers are instructing workers on how to file such safety complaints. They are also using Facebook Live, Instagram posts, Telegram chats and WhatsApp messages to share other tactics with Amazon employees.  At Whole Foods, an upscale supermarket chain owned by Amazon, several current and former employees have been using Telegram to rally coworkers across the country to agitate for expanded paid sick leave and temporary shutdown of stores with confirmed COVID-19 cases.  \u201cFirst step is to ask what will you do if our store is tested positive? Then form a committee. Plan actions. Document. Call the government,\u201d wrote one of the workers, who confirmed sending the message and discussed the strategy with Reuters on condition of anonymity. The employee said the group has doubled to 400 members since the pandemic began. Reuters could not independently confirm the growth in membership.  This worker and fellow organizers are collaborating with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and are working under the name \u201cWhole Worker\u2019s National Organizing Committee.\u201d  UFCW President Marc Perrone said the union is currently not focusing on the traditional playbook of getting employees to sign cards and become members.  \u201cRight now ...it is about showing workers value and what we can do for them,\u201d he said.","845":"FILE PHOTO: Prompts on how to use Amazon's Alexa personal assistant are seen in an Amazon \u2018experience centre\u2019 in Vallejo, California, U.S., May 8, 2018.

When users of devices such as Amazon\u2019s Echo line of smart speakers ask the voice assistant a question, the query is sent to one of Amazon\u2019s data centers for several steps of processing. When Amazon\u2019s computers spit out an answer, that reply is in a text format that must be translated into audible speech for the voice assistant.  Amazon previously handled that computing using chips from Nvidia but now the \u201cmajority\u201d of it will happen using its own \u201cInferentia\u201d computing chip. First announced in 2018, the Amazon chip is custom designed to speed up large volumes of machine learning tasks such as translating text to speech or recognizing images.  Cloud computing customers such as Amazon, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alpahbet Inc's GOOGL.O Google have become some of the biggest buyers of computing chips, driving booming data center sales at Intel Corp INTC.O, Nvidia and others.  But major technology companies are increasingly ditching traditional silicon providers to design their own chips. Apple on Tuesday introduced its first Mac computers with its own central processors, moving away from Intel chips. [nL1N2HW1WF}  Amazon said the shift to the Infertia chip for some of its Alexa work has resulted in 25% better latency, which is a measure of speed, at a 30% lower cost.  Amazon has also said that \u201cRekognition,\u201d its cloud-based facial recognition service, has started to adopt its own Inferentia chips. However, the company did not say which chips the facial recognition service had previously used or how much of the work had shifted to its own chips.  The service has come under scrutiny from civil rights groups because of its use by law enforcement.

The pandemic pushed U.S. hospitals to the brink of capacity as coronavirus cases surpassed 9 million, while the prospect of wider COVID-19 restrictions in Europe raised concerns about the economic recovery.

FILE PHOTO: A shopper is seen wearing a mask while shopping at a Walmart store in Bradford, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The world\u2019s largest retailer is making better use of its wealth of shopper data to link promotions on its website and app with ads inside its network of 4,700 U.S. stores, according to Reuters interviews with six advertising agencies and Walmart ad tech partners, three major brands plus bankers and ex-employees.  The refocused strategy was born early last year when Walmart cut ties with its external advertising partner and took the business in-house, calling it Walmart Media Group.  The company bet it could do a better job of bridging online and offline data for its advertisers and give itself a shot at developing an ad platform that could take on Amazon.com Inc, the sources said.  The shift has been paying off, according to one source briefed on the company\u2019s plans who said Walmart Media Group was on track to earn nearly $1 billion of advertising sales this year, more than double the amount it brought in last year.  Walmart declined to comment on the sales estimate, but it explained its approach to the ad business. \u201cOne thing we do at Walmart Media Group is make sure that the advertising we\u2019re placing is additive to the customer experience, that we\u2019re not just throwing ads on anything anywhere, that we\u2019re really strategic,\u201d Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.  The big challenge now, according to the source, is figuring out how it can continue to expand the ad business into one that will matter to investors for a company that earned about $524 billion in total revenue in fiscal year 2020.  \u201cIt\u2019s going well, and they want it to go very, very well,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere have been very material gains but it doesn\u2019t yet put a dent in Amazon\u2019s lead or Walmart\u2019s top or bottom line.\u201d  A deal for TikTok, which reaches 100 million U.S. users a month, was supposed to supercharge the strategy by helping Walmart\u2019s ad machine engage with younger audiences that may not shop regularly at Walmart. But the talks to invest in the Chinese-owned TikTok remain shrouded in political uncertainty.  That, however, has not stopped Walmart from moving ahead with its strategy, the advertising agencies and brands said.  Yet it\u2019s early days in the drive for Walmart, which has historically struggled to create new lines of business and has never turned a profit form its e-commerce business. Some advertisers and ad agencies said the retailer still had a distance to go on the technology front, including tracking how ads translated into sales - a key selling point for brands.  Walmart faces a huge task chasing Amazon, which is expected to generate about $13 billion in ads this year according to eMarketer, while it is also battling smaller rivals including Target and Kroger which are building their own ad platforms.  Another challenge it must overcome: Walmart disclosed this month that Stefanie Jay, leader of Walmart Media Group, will leave the company for a \u201cnew opportunity.\u201d Rich Lehrfeld, Walmart\u2019s former interim chief marketing officer, will now lead Walmart Media Group.  \u2018ALWAYS IN, ALWAYS ON\u2019  In meetings with brands and advertising technology partners, Walmart\u2019s executives have summed up its goals with a tagline - \u201cAlways In, Always On\u201d - a reference to how its store network will help advertisers reach more customers, Walmart told Reuters.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cWhether it\u2019s online or in the shopping aisle on a screen in the grocery section, they want that brand message through the whole ecosystem,\u201d said Nich Weinheimer, general manager of e-commerce at ad tech firm Kenshoo, which works with Walmart.  Walmart has used its data to improve targeting of ads and convinced some advertisers to sign long-term advertising contracts, brands and former employees say. The company told Reuters that its deals, which include store and digital ads, are typically worth low double-digit millions of dollars.  Dan Cooke, head of e-commerce at jam-maker JM Smucker Co which places ads with Walmart, told Reuters that the retailer had gathered better data on consumers and their purchases this year.  Walmart has uses the data to improve its online display advertising, give clients a better idea of how their ads are performing and provide \u201ccritical\u201d online tools that makes it easier for them to monitor and control campaigns themselves, he added.  \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of an arms race that\u2019s going on - Amazon has certainly been a trailblazer,\u201d said Cooke, adding that Walmart was responding \u201cvery aggressively.\u201d  KNOWING WHAT SELLS  Walmart executives view the advertising drive as significant to the success of the retailer\u2019s e-commerce business as a whole, according to the source briefed on the company\u2019s plans.  Nearly 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart, according to the retailer\u2019s website. This is a strength that Walmart needs to leverage more, according to the ad agencies and brands, as it has an insight into consumers\u2019 shopping habits.  Walmart\u2019s stores and Walmart.com together count about 160 million visitors a week, data from investment bank Cowen shows.  Walmart\u2019s advertising strategy has nonetheless been somewhat hit or miss over the decades.  The retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, dabbled with the advertising business in the late 1990s and early 2000s with an in-store TV network that aired commercials. It expanded the business about 15 years ago to include its website through Triad Retail Media.  The retailer cut ties with Triad in February 2019 and brought all ad operations in-house under Walmart Media Group.  \u2018GLITCHES\u2019 COMPLAINTS  The company still faces a series of challenges.  It needs to improve ad-measuring capabilities to show exactly how certain ads lead to specific sales, Smucker\u2019s Cooke said.  Some advertisers have also complained about \u201cglitches\u201d where ads occasionally disappear from Walmart.com or don\u2019t show up at all. Kimberly Williams, a former campaign manager at Walmart Media Group, said this happened \u201call the time\u201d, recalling an ad for Mars Inc\u2019s M&M candies that disappeared for several hours.  According to brands, this happens from time to time on other retailers\u2019 platforms as well. Walmart declined to comment.  Longer term, the challenge for Walmart is to figure out an overarching media content strategy to keep customers engaged for longer periods, according to the industry players interviewed.  Walmart considered launching a subscription video service in 2018 but decided against it, according to sources. In other forays, it invested $250 million in a joint venture to develop interactive content and struck a deal with \u201cJames Bond\u201d studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to create content for the Vudu video-on-demand service, which it sold last April.  Walmart is also going after a new channel of ad revenue called \u201cbrand advertising,\u201d typically reserved for TV, by offering more formats like online display ads, said George Manas, chief media officer at ad agency OMD USA.  Executives hope successful advertising relationships could help it secure promotional tie-ins with the Walmart+ subscription service, its version of Amazon Prime.  Losing the TikTok deal won\u2019t be a disaster, but landing it would help Walmart flesh out a competitive media strategy, said Mark Boidman, managing director and head of media and tech services at PJ Solomon, which advises Walmart.  \u201cAmazon surrounds the consumer in a 360-degree manner,\u201d Boidman said, referring to Amazon Prime and the free video-streaming service that comes with it.  Walmart is still \u201cgetting there.\u201d  (This story adds dropped word \u201cformer\u201d in paragraph 13)","848":"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is sounding out some of Europe's top insurance firms to see if they would contribute products to a UK price comparison website in what would be a major foray by the U.S. online retail giant into the region's financial services.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Three industry executives told Reuters they had held talks with Amazon about the possible launch of a site. One said the talks were part of several discussions Amazon is having with insurers. A second said there were no imminent launch plans.  While it was not immediately clear what type of insurance would be sold on any Amazon site, home and motor policies are popular sellers on existing UK price comparison sites.  \u201cAs Amazon becomes a larger part of the home, whether it\u2019s products delivered to the home, security monitoring, home services like Wi-Fi installation, you can make the case that insurance is the next logical step for this company,\u201d said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy.  The industry sources declined to be named as the talks are confidential. Amazon declined to comment.  An Amazon price comparison website for insurance products would be a potential challenge to existing UK sites given the U.S. company\u2019s cutting-edge technology, reach and loyal customer base.  Two of the most high profile are comparethemarket.com which shows products from insurers including AXA AXAF.PA, Hastings HSTG.L and eSure ESUR.L; and GoCompare GOCO.L, which lists insurance from firms such as Santander SAN.MC and LV= [LV.UL].  In response to the prospect of Amazon launching a rival service, shares in Moneysupermarket MONY.L, GoCompare and Admiral ADML.L, which runs the confused.com site, were down between 1.6 percent and 4.6 percent on Thursday.  A UK insurance site would also build on Amazon\u2019s existing products in Europe offering extensions to manufacturers\u2019 warranties, a service known as Amazon Protect.  While Amazon\u2019s loyal customer base and reach would probably prove attractive to some insurers happy to cede some of their premiums to Amazon to expand sales, the potential for premiums to be forced lower through competition could deter others.  One of the industry sources said the comparison site model fitted Amazon\u2019s strategy of offering a range of products, as opposed to partnering with one firm.  A price comparison website in particular could also be used to help drive traffic to its other marketplaces, Hottovy said.  It was not immediately clear what financial arrangements Amazon would strike with insurers if it were to go ahead.  Tech-rival Google launched a financial services comparison site in the United Kingdom and the United States in 2016 but shut it down after only a year due to low traffic.  REGULATORY BURDEN  In the United States, Amazon has a joint venture with insurer Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N and JP Morgan JPM.N aimed at slashing U.S. healthcare costs. It also offers a small business loan program.  In Europe, Amazon has had a partnership with The Warranty Group since 2016 to offer the warranty extensions. It also offers co-branded credit cards in the United Kingdom and Germany although it does not lend money of its own.  In a sign of potential expansion plans, Amazon began to place job ads last year for staff for a new insurance business in Europe, without giving details.  While Chinese tech giants Alibaba BABA.N and Tencent 0700.HK have large finance arms, leading Western tech firms have taken a more cautious approach to heavily regulated financial services, which often have hefty capital requirements.  A comparison site, however, would let Amazon give its customers access to insurance from a variety of providers while avoiding that level of regulatory burden, industry sources said.  The use of comparison websites to buy motor and home insurance is more prevalent in the United Kingdom than Europe or the United States.  Some insurers rely heavily on comparison websites for sales. UK insurer Hastings HSTG.L, for example, told Reuters it sells 90 percent of its motor policies through such sites.  Rival car insurer Admiral ADML.L also relies on websites for sales and would be open to joining any Amazon site, its chief financial officer, Geraint Jones, said.  \u201cIf it establishes a comparison site then I suspect Admiral will be interested in being a member, potentially. Price comparison is the main source of distribution of our products and we\u2019ll await with interest what they do,\u201d Jones told Reuters.","849":"March 5 (Reuters) -  * GAMESPARKS SAYS IT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED BY AMAZON - STATEMENT","850":"Dec 6 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering putting some of Amazon.com Inc's overseas websites on a list of global marketplaces known for counterfeit goods, the Wall Street Journal on.wsj.com\/2LtUZOR reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

File Photo: Amazon employees are pictured outside the Amazon Go brick-and-mortar grocery store without lines or checkout counters, in Seattle Washington, U.S. December 5, 2016. REUTERS\/Jason Redmond  The world\u2019s biggest web retailer said it has \u201cseveral\u201d signed deals with customers it would not name. A new website Monday will invite others to inquire about the service, dubbed Just Walk Out technology by Amazon.  The highly anticipated business reflects Amazon\u2019s strategy of building out internal capabilities - such as warehouses to help with package delivery and cloud technology to support its website - and then turning those into lucrative services it offers others.  Its chain Amazon Go has brought shopping without checkout lines into the mainstream, and the market for retail without cashiers - one of the most common vocations in the United States - could grow to $50 billion, U.S. venture firm Loup Ventures has estimated.  Dilip Kumar, Amazon\u2019s vice president of physical retail and technology, had no market forecast to share but said shoppers\u2019 preferences will determine how big the business becomes.  \u201cDo customers like standing in lines?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis has pretty broad applicability across store sizes, across industries, because it fundamentally tackles a problem of how do you get convenience in physical locations, especially when people are hard-pressed for time.\u201d  Unlike Amazon Go stores, shoppers will insert a credit card into a gated turnstile to enter, rather than scan an app. The turnstiles will display the logo \u201cJust Walk Out technology by Amazon,\u201d but all other branding and store aspects will be controlled by the retailer using the service.  Items picked up by a customer and any guests who enter with them will be added to the shopper\u2019s virtual cart. The store will then bill the credit card once the person or group leaves the store - no bar code scans or checkout lines necessary.  Kumar said Amazon will install the technology including ceiling cameras and shelf weight sensors at retailers\u2019 stores, whether they are new locations or retrofits, and it will have a 24-7 support line.  COURTING RIVALS?  A by-product of demand for the offering would be increased usage of Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud that underpins its checkout-free systems.  Still, high demand is by no means certain. Other vendors including Grabango and AiFi are offering automated checkout to retailers, which in the past have been loath to hand deals to their rival Amazon that has been the biggest disruptor of their brick-and-mortar businesses.  Media reports have said Amazon was in talks to bring its technology to airport stores, for instance, rather than to Walmart Inc or Target Corp. Kumar said Amazon \u201cpotentially\u201d could sell the service to big box rivals but would not speculate.  He declined to comment on the service\u2019s business model or pricing, saying, \u201ca lot of those are bespoke deals.\u201d  One issue that may arise is who owns the shopper data, something that businesses typically want in order to tailor marketing offers and build their customer base.  Shoppers who desire a receipt will be able to type their email into a kiosk at any store. Amazon will send receipts to that address each subsequent time the credit card is used at a Just Walk Out location, no matter the retailer. Kumar said Amazon saves the email address and ties that to the credit card information, solely for the purpose of charging the customer.  Kumar would not discuss whether or how Amazon would integrate this into retailers\u2019 loyalty programs but said, \u201cThese are the retailers\u2019 customers.\u201d  \u201cWe prohibit the use of Just Walk Out technology data for anything other than supporting Just Walk Out retailers,\u201d he said.","857":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) -Amazon Web Services (AWS) chief Andy Jassy will replace billionaire founder Jeff Bezos as Amazon.com\u2019s next chief executive officer.

Repairing the pipeline would allow Canadian oil junior Frontera Energy Corp to resume production of some 12,000 barrels of oil per day in a month, the company has said.  The pipeline normally transports crude to Petroperu\u2019s refinery on the Pacific coast from oil fields in the Amazon, including Frontera Energy\u2019s Block 192. But it has been offline since November, when Petroperu said members of the indigenous community of Mayuriaga ruptured it in a dispute over local elections and refused to let it enter a remote area for repairs.  The government announced late on Tuesday that it reached an agreement with Mayuriaga that will deliver a series of basic public services to the community in exchange for allowing repairs on the pipeline.  Representatives of Mayuriaga could not immediately be reached for comment.  A spokesman for Petroperu said early on Wednesday that teams of its workers were on their way to begin repairs.  The impasse between the government and the community had halted Frontera Energy\u2019s output from Block 192 and cost the company $10 million. The company called for the government to solve the dispute earlier this month, saying it was rethinking its interest in investing in Peru in the long-term.  Frontera could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. The company has said its engineers estimated repairing the pipeline would take about a day, and that its operations at Block 192 would fully resume within an month.  Peru, a major minerals exporter and a relatively small oil producer, is rife with social conflicts, especially in provinces where extractive companies operate alongside poor communities. Remote villages often seize control of roads and infrastructure to demand public services or compensation for use of local land.  The government of President Martin Vizcarra said the deal with Mayuriaga includes plans to build an elementary school and a telecommunications antenna. The community will also be included in the government\u2019s rural electrification program by the end of the year, it added.","864":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - For most U.S. fund managers, beating the market this year has come down to one decision: whether or not to own shares of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  More than 70 percent of the actively-managed U.S. large-cap funds that are beating the 3.5-percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 own shares of the Seattle-based e-commerce giant, according to Lipper data. Shares of the company are up nearly 45 percent for the year-to-date, and account for nearly 40 percent of the S&P 500\u2019s gain for the year, according to S&P Global.  Those gains have left even investors like Warren Buffett, who has never invested in Amazon, kicking themselves for missing out on the company\u2019s growth.  \"I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen,\u201d Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's BRKa.N annual shareholder meeting in early May.  Amazon has benefited this year from continued growth of e-commerce and is a business that seems largely immune from the threat of a global trade wars.  Yet with volatility in the stock market expected to continue through the U.S. midterm elections in the fall, Amazon\u2019s pricy valuation and high level of fund ownership may leave the stock more vulnerable to a steep decline, analysts warn.  As a result, some outperforming fund managers who have so far avoided Amazon are branching out into companies ranging from Asian e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd BABA.N to medical device maker Abiomed Inc ABMD.O, all in an effort to find better values.

Doll has avoided Amazon because of its trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 267, a valuation more than ten times that of the broad S&P 500. Instead, he has benefited from positions in MasterCard Inc MA.N, Red Hat Inc RHT.N, and Intuit Inc INTU.O, all of which are up more than 30 percent for the year and trade at less than a third of Amazon's valuation.  \u201cThese stocks aren\u2019t exactly cheap, they\u2019re cheap compared to a concept stock like Amazon where the valuation is so full,\u201d he said.  Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager at the Biondo Growth Fund, said that his fund has been increasing its position in Alibaba instead of owning Amazon because he sees it as a cheaper way to invest in the growth of e-commerce.  \u201cWould we have liked to be in Amazon 5 years ago? Yes. But in last year maybe Alibaba is the way to play it, because you\u2019re getting the same growth profile without the same multiple.\u201d  Shares of Alibaba are up 21 percent for the year and trade at a trailing price to earnings ratio of 54.3.  Fund manager concentration in Amazon may leave the company more vulnerable to sell off if the volatility in the broad market increases this fall ahead of the mid-term elections, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA Research.  \u201cWe\u2019re of the belief that there will be greater market volatility for the duration of 2018 and while in theory that gives active managers a chance to buy in on whatever they have missed out on, that volatility could hit the better performers first,\u201d he said.  The outsized gain in Amazon relative to other stocks in the S&P 500 suggests that growth is hard to come by in the U.S. market and should benefit more concentrated portfolios, said Daniel Davidowitz, a portfolio manager of the $2.1-billion Polen Growth Fund.  Davidowitz, whose fund holds only 20 stocks, said he has avoided Amazon because of its high valuation and stretched balance sheet and has instead moved into stocks like Invisalign braces-maker Align Technology Inc ALGN.O and Adobe Systems Inc ADBE.O, both of which are up more than 40 percent year-to-date.  \u201cThe average U.S. company is not growing that much. Earnings may be up a lot but a big slug of that is from the benefits of the Trump tax cut,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to outperform is to find companies that are creating their own theme.\u201d","865":"July 13 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's cloud services business is considering selling its own networking switches to business customers, the Information reported here on Friday.

This dominance has raised concerns in Europe that sensitive corporate data could be insecure in the wake of the adoption of the U.S. CLOUD Act of 2018 and in the absence of any major competitors, except China\u2019s Alibaba.  The concerns led to creation of European association Gaia-X, set up to establish common standards for storing and processing data on servers that are sited locally and comply with the European Union\u2019s strict laws on data privacy.  Atos and OVHcloud say they together have a network of 130 data centres able to host data in virtual spaces whose resources are not shared with other users, or private environments.

America\u2019s automakers led early in the U.S. race to reopen. Ford Motor, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles kept up the pace this month, returning to pre-coronavirus production levels. Now comes the tricky part: persuading Americans to buy vehicles. That, as in past crises, means liberal use of discounts. These set a record for the month of June of $4,411 per vehicle, consultancy J.D. Power estimates.  Yet balancing the trade-off between sales and discounts is more important than ever. Manufacturers already needed to maximize sales of high-margin trucks and SUVs to finance the shift to electric and autonomous cars. Now they also need to pay down debt \u2013 around $16 billion apiece for Ford and GM \u2013 borrowed in case of prolonged shutdowns.  Every dollar given away detracts from those goals. With new Covid-19 cases surging in populous states like California, Florida and Texas, they may need to offer more. That must be giving auto execs the shakes. (By Antony Currie)  FALSE START.

Climate and health campaigners, respectively, may not like some of these picks. They see a chance to shape where financial support should go, for example encouraging a lower-carbon future.

(By Aimee Donnellan)","868":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has ordered hundreds of trucks that run on compressed natural gas as it tests ways to shift its U.S. fleet away from heavier polluting trucks, the company told Reuters on Friday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The coronavirus pandemic caused delivery activity to surge in 2020, with truck volumes exceeding 2019 levels on average while passenger car traffic fell. But that increase in road activity means more pollution, as heavier-duty trucks emit higher levels of greenhouse gases than passenger vehicles.  Transportation companies are building their stable of electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. Much of the nation\u2019s freight is delivered via medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which account for more than 20% of the industry\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions even though they make up less than 5% of the road fleet, according to U.S. federal data.  \u201cAmazon is excited about introducing new sustainable solutions for freight transportation and is working on testing a number of new vehicle types including electric, CNG and others,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Amazon has ordered more than 700 compressed natural gas class 6 and class 8 trucks so far, according to the company.  The online retailer\u2019s sales rose 38% in 2020; it plans to run a carbon neutral business by 2040.  The engines, supplied by a joint venture between Cummins Inc and Vancouver-based Westport Fuel Systems Inc, are to be used for Amazon\u2019s heavy duty trucks that run from warehouses to distribution centers. More than 1,000 engines that can operate on both renewable and non-renewable natural gas have been ordered by the supplier, according to a source familiar with the situation.  Natural gas emits approximately 27% less carbon dioxide when burned compared with diesel fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Electric-powered motors are considered less viable for heavy-duty trucks than for the average passenger vehicle.  In 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans from startup Rivian Automotive LLC. The first of those vans, to be used for last-mile delivery to customers, are to be delivered this year. The company also ordered 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz for its European delivery fleet.  Other transportation companies are also experimenting with ways to reduce emissions.  In 2019, United Parcel Service Inc announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks over three years and step up purchases of renewable natural gas (RNG) as part of a $450 million investment to reduce the environmental impact of its 123,000-vehicle fleet.  RNG and natural gas from fossil fuel are both methane gases and can be used interchangeably. RNG is derived from decomposing organic matter such as cow manure on dairy farms, discarded food in landfills and human waste in water treatment plants. It also prevents naturally occurring methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from being released into the environment.  Amazon shares were down 0.1% in post-close trading. Shares of Cummins rose 4%, while the U.S.-listed shares of Canada-based Westport surged, gaining 47% in the aftermarket session.","869":"(Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator has stepped in to pause Amazon's AMZN.O deal with online food delivery group Deliveroo while it considers launching a full investigation.  Amazon led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May, making what the two parties called \"a minority investment\" and going up against Uber Eats UBER.N in the global race to dominate the market for takeaway meal deliveries.  On Friday Britain\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it served an initial enforcement order (IEO) on the two companies on June 24, signaling possible concerns about the transaction.  The regulator, which referred to Amazon\u2019s investment as \u201ca minority shareholding\u201d said it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that Amazon and Deliveroo \u201chave ceased to be distinct\u201d or were putting in place or considering arrangements which would result in them \u201cceasing to be distinct\u201d.  The order requires Amazon and Deliveroo to operate independently for now, meaning they cannot press ahead with the tie-up. It gives the regulator time to decide if it will launch a formal \u201cPhase 1\u201d competition probe.  The Deliveroo investment is Amazon\u2019s latest attempt to enter the takeaway delivery market, worth around $100 billion globally, after it shut down its own service, Amazon Restaurants, first in the UK and then last month in the United States.  Deliveroo said it and Amazon had been working closely with regulators to obtain their approval. The two companies will argue that the investment will help Deliveroo grow its coverage, increase competition and boost the restaurant sector.  The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, January 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  \u201cWe believe this minority investment will enable Deliveroo to expand its services, benefiting consumers through increased choice and creating new jobs as more restaurants gain access to the service,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  Deliveroo noted that it was competing with a number of major companies in the sector and that the investment would help to create jobs and restaurants to expand.  RESTRICTIONS  IEOs do not prevent parties from continuing to talk to each other, but typically do prevent the transfer of key staff or the transfer of commercially sensitive information.  If the CMA were to undertake an investigation and find competition concerns then the companies could offer undertakings to try to address those concerns. That process could be compromised if the companies had already merged financially.  Neither Deliveroo or Amazon have disclosed a figure for Amazon\u2019s funding contribution.  Deliveroo competes in Britain with Just Eat JE.L and with Uber Eats which is also present in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. It also competes in Europe with Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero.  Headquartered in London, Deliveroo uses 60,000 riders dressed in black and teal jackets to deliver meals from more than 80,000 restaurants and takeaway outlets in 14 countries including France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore and Kuwait.  Since former lawmaker Andrew Tyrie became chairman of the CMA a year a go, it has increasingly bared its teeth. In April it blocked supermarket group Sainsbury's SBRY.L 7.3 billion pound ($9.2 billion) takeover of rival Asda. In April the regulator proposed some of the biggest reforms to auditing globally since the aftermath of the Enron scandal, while earlier this month it launched an investigation into the power wielded by Facebook FB.O and Google GOOGL.O in digital advertising markets.

Amazon shoppers in China will no longer be able to buy goods from third-party merchants in the country, but they still will be able to order from the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan via the firm\u2019s global store. Amazon expects to close fulfillment centers and wind down support for domestic-selling merchants in China in the next 90 days, one of the people said.  The move underscores how entrenched, home-grown e-commerce rivals have made it difficult for Amazon\u2019s marketplace to gain a foothold. Consumer insights firm iResearch Global said Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s Tmall marketplace and JD.com Inc controlled 81.9 percent of the Chinese market last year.  \u201cThey\u2019re pulling out because it\u2019s not profitable and not growing,\u201d said analyst Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities.  Ker Zheng, marketing specialist at Shenzhen-based e-commerce consultancy Azoya, said Amazon had no major competitive advantage in China over its domestic rivals.  Unless someone is searching for a very specific imported good that can\u2019t be found elsewhere, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason for a consumer to pick Amazon because they\u2019re not going to be able to ship things as fast as Tmall or JD,\u201d he said.  Amazon\u2019s customers in China will still be able to purchase the firm\u2019s Kindle e-readers and online content, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud computing unit that sells data storage and computing power to enterprises, will remain as well.  The U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba and JD.com rose 1 percent on Wednesday after Reuters first reported the move, before paring gains later in the day. Amazon\u2019s shares closed flat.  U.S. RETREAT  The withdrawal of the world\u2019s largest online retailer - founded by the world\u2019s richest person - comes amid a broader e-commerce slowdown in China. Alibaba in January reported its lowest quarterly earnings growth since 2016, while JD.com is responding to the changing business environment with staff cuts.  It also follows the Chinese e-commerce retreat of other big-name Western retailers. Wal-Mart Stores Inc sold its Chinese online shopping platform to JD.com in 2016 in return for a stake in JD.com to focus on its bricks-and-mortar stores.  Similarly, the country appears to factor less in the global aspirations of fellow U.S. tech majors Netflix Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Pachter said.  Amazon bought Chinese online shopping website Joyo.com in 2004 for $75 million, rebranding the business in 2011 as Amazon China. But in a sign of Tmall\u2019s dominance, Amazon nevertheless opened an online store on the Alibaba site in 2015.  The firm is still expanding aggressively in other countries, notably India, where it is contending with local rival Flipkart.

The logo of Amazon is seen on a building in San Jose, Costa Rica March 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Juan Carlos Ulate  Amazon, the city\u2019s largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed.  As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker.  That \u201chead tax\u201d formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city.  Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday\u2019s action. The move by the world\u2019s largest online retailer, whose chief executive is billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs.  Following the council vote, Amazon\u2019s vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago.  However, he added, \u201cWe remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council\u2019s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.\u201d  Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square, meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability.  The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy.  The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city\u2019s private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits.  Sponsors of the tax said Seattle\u2019s biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city.  Supporters cite data showing Seattle\u2019s median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as \u201crent-burdened,\u201d meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing.  The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered.  Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law.  She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original$75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority.  On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure.  \u201cBy threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,\u201d the officials wrote.  The head tax approved on Monday is not the first. Denver has enacted a similar tax, and Chicago had one but repealed it. Seattle itself had a head tax in effect from 2006 to 2009 but it was repealed to help businesses in the midst of the recession.

Revenue at its core U.S. package service rose 7.2 percent to $10.2 billion from a year-ago, driven by a 4.6-percent rise in parcel volumes that reflected growth of online purchases.  However, severe winter weather dragged down its operating profit by $85 million, as did higher expenses for network improvements, higher pension costs, and a big expansion of Saturday delivery over the last year. Operating profit in its core domestic segment plummeted 20 percent, and was down 6 percent overall.  \u201cHigher costs continue to pressure earnings,\u201d Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. \u201cIn general, the company struggles with capacity issues during the peak season (the weeks leading up to Christmas), and could have issues achieving their EPS target unless their performance improves.\u201d  UPS, seen as an indicator of U.S. economic strength and consumer demand, reaffirmed its 2018 earnings per share range of $7.03 to $7.37 and maintained its 2018 spending plan of between $6.5 billion to $7 billion on network improvements like new technology and automating its parcel sorting hubs.  Chief Executive David Abney has promised to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions to handle the growth of e-commerce, as investors bristle over the costs.  The rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for shipping demand, but UPS has struggled to bring down the extra costs of delivering to households which on average receive fewer packages at one time than businesses.  Revenue per parcel delivered rose just 2.6 percent, as higher prices and fuel surcharges offset the higher costs, the company said.  Analysts on a conference call asked Abney about Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O efforts to expand its own delivery capacity for volume traditionally handled by UPS and rival FedEx Corp FDX.N.  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to predict what Amazon or any other of our large shippers are going to do,\u201d Abney said, adding UPS would evaluate any market moves and react accordingly.

The Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) original clearance and methodology was criticised in submissions by companies including Just Eat Takeaway and Dominos Pizza DOM.L.  Amazon led a $575 million fundraising in Deliveroo in May last year making what the two parties called \"a minority investment\" and pitching it against Uber Eats UBER.N and Just Eat Takeaway.com in the global race to dominate the market for meal deliveries.  Having launched an investigation into the deal in December, the CMA said in April it had become clear that the coronavirus crisis was damaging Deliveroo\u2019s revenues, given the closure of a large number of the restaurants available through its platform during the lockdown.  On Wednesday, the CMA said Deliveroo\u2019s finances had shown considerable recent improvement and it no longer believed it would exit the market without the Amazon deal.  \u201cLooking closely at the size of the shareholding and how it will affect Amazon\u2019s incentives, as well as the competition that the businesses will continue to face in food delivery and convenience groceries, we\u2019ve found that the investment should not have a negative impact on customers,\u201d said inquiry chair Stuart McIntosh.  The CMA, however, warned that were Amazon to gain greater control over Deliveroo, in particular by making a full acquisition, a further investigation could follow.  It said it would now seek views on its latest findings by July 10 with a final ruling by Aug 6.  A spokeswoman for Deliveroo welcomed the decision, while a spokeswoman for Amazon said it was committed to the investment.","879":"NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc will expand its grocery home delivery services to more than 100 metro areas this year from an existing six cities as the retailer steps up a fight against rival Amazon.com Inc.  Walmart said on Wednesday the service would be rolled out to more than 40 percent of U.S. households by the end of the year. Deliveries will cost $9.95 with a minimum $30 order and companies like Uber Technologies Inc will provide transport. Other delivery companies will be added later this year.  \u201cWe will be pretty aggressive with it,\u201d said Tom Ward, vice president of digital operations on a call with reporters.  The move will complement Walmart\u2019s rollout of curbside grocery pickup, which is currently available in 1,200 stores and will be added to a 1,000 more stores this year. It also allows Walmart to compete with Amazon\u2019s two-hour Prime Now service for shoppers of its loyalty program.  The expanded service allows the Bentonville, Arkansas based retailer to get its store shoppers to transact with the company online, where they spend twice as much. It also comes at a time of intense competition within the grocery space and follows Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods last year. Amazon has also expanded food delivery options from Whole Foods in six metro areas over the past month. Walmart\u2019s other brick-and-mortar rivals like Kroger Co and Target have invested in similar services.  Online revenue growth slowed at Walmart in the most recent quarter, causing some analysts to question its strategy to compete with Amazon. Company officials said Walmart was still on track to increase its e-commerce sales by 40 percent this year.","880":"Jan 22 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday said it filed a motion to pause the U.S. Department of Defense and Microsoft Corp from carrying out an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal until a court rules on its protest of the contract award.

During the suspension, Amazon will tap a state partial unemployment scheme to pay its employees, the group said in the internal document.  Amazon\u2019s French subsidiary did not return calls seeking comments.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer is facing mounting scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic of the health measures it has put in place to protect employees from the coronavirus while it deals with a surge in online orders.  With most shops in France shuttered as the government tries to contain the pandemic, the closure of the warehouses will likely disrupt deliveries across the country.  In a ruling on Tuesday, a French court said Amazon had to carry out a more thorough assessment of the risk of coronavirus contagion at its warehouses and should restrict its deliveries in the meantime, or face a fine.  \u201cWe\u2019re puzzled by the court ruling given the hard evidence brought forward regarding security measures put in place to protect our employees\u201d, Amazon said in a statement.  \u201cOur interpretation suggests that we may be forced to suspend the activity of our distribution centres in France,\u201d the group said, adding it would appeal the decision.

Trump, without presenting evidence, has accused the world\u2019s largest online retailer repeatedly over the past year of taking advantage of USPS by not paying enough for deliveries to make the service profitable.  USPS reported operating revenue of $70.6 billion for fiscal year 2018, which ended on Sept. 30, as sales at its shipping and packages business rose 10 percent.  However, its net loss rose to $3.9 billion from a loss of $2.7 billion in 2017, hurt by rising pay and benefits and higher transport costs, such as gas prices.  An independent agency within the federal government, USPS is limited in what it can do to improve its financials.  \u201cThe flawed business model imposed by law continues to be the root cause of our financial instability,\u201d said Postmaster General Megan Brennan, adding that the Postal Service is pressing for reforms that would allow it to cut costs, increase revenue and compete more effectively.  Neither USPS nor the president have the power to set postal rates directly. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners from both political parties who are selected by the president. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Package delivery, especially for major customer Amazon, has become a key part of USPS\u2019s business, but has not been enough to offset the sharp decline in first-class letters caused by the internet and email.  The Cowen Washington Research Group earlier this year forecast that USPS will nearly double the number of U.S. packages delivered for Amazon from 1.1 billion in 2018, or 55 percent of total USPS package deliveries, to 1.9 billion in 2023.  \u201cFollowing discussions with persons in the U.S. Postal Service ecosystem and a review of USPS financials, it\u2019s clear that Amazon has been a key driver of USPS for years,\u201d Cowen analysts said in a research note.  Amazon is run by founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against. It has shown interest in delivering its own packages, and has tested drones for doing so.  In 2015, Amazon spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year. It has not commented publicly on Trump\u2019s criticisms. (Reporting by Chris Sanders and Diane Bartz Editing by Bill Rigby)","886":"EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. (Reuters) - Standing before an audience of 14,000 people last year, Walmart Inc executives described a radical plan to help it fend off Amazon.com Inc and other online delivery services from stealing its customers.  Walmart\u2019s own store employees would bring online orders directly to shoppers\u2019 homes after completing their usual shifts of up to nine hours on the sales floors. Aiming to lower the retailer\u2019s shipping costs by tapping its massive workforce, the program was part of a multi-pronged strategy to boost its $11.5 billion U.S. ecommerce business and tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the so-called \u201clast mile\u201d of delivering goods to online customers.  Its workers, meanwhile, could earn extra money on top of their hourly pay, which starts at $11 an hour.  \u201cJust imagine associates all over the world delivering orders to customers on their way home,\u201d Marc Lore, head of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce operations, said at its annual meeting in June 2017. \u201cThat can be a real game-changer.\u201d  But months later, Walmart quietly retreated from its original vision for the pilot program - launched in New Jersey and Arkansas - and ended it altogether in January, according to company documents obtained by Reuters and interviews with more than two dozen Walmart employees.  The story behind the foundering employee delivery initiative, which has not been reported, offers insight into Walmart\u2019s ongoing attempts to find unconventional ways to close the gap with Amazon in the game of cheap, rapid, doorstep delivery of packages. According to Walmart data, people who shop in stores and become online customers spend nearly twice as much as those who shop at one or the other.  Here in New Jersey, Walmart started the program with the idea that store employees could courier all items that would fit in a car. But the initiative failed to gain traction with skeptical employees who had to use their time after work, according to sixteen workers who participated in the trial.  Walmart is now testing a more modest service with just four Walmart employees who deliver goods from a single store in Woodstock, Georgia, Reuters has learned. In this latest initiative, Walmart is also overhauling the guidelines for employees and limiting deliveries to groceries and related items such as paper plates.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman confirmed that the retailer ended its first experiment early this year, without elaborating. Walmart is testing a variety of ways to deliver merchandise, she said, and is \u201cencouraged by what we\u2019re seeing\u201d in the Georgia store.  Despite having 4,700 U.S. stores within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Walmart is still trying to figure out how to efficiently make deliveries and has poured billions of dollars into ecommerce in recent years.  But as recently as the last holiday season, its online sales disappointed some investors.  Walmart caters to U.S. online shoppers by having them drive up to their local store themselves to collect merchandise they ordered online. It also partners with shippers such as FedEx Corp, the United States Postal Service (USPS) for routine deliveries.  Still, Walmart aims to be able to deliver groceries to more than 40 percent of households in the country by the end of this year. Globally, Walmart is experimenting with deliveries by motorbike in Mexico and with new small supermarkets in China to make deliveries in 30 minutes or less. In Japan, Walmart is opening a new warehouse to support orders, and expanding its online offerings to include meal kits.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Earlier this year, Reuters reported the retailer\u2019s delivery partnerships with Uber and Lyft ended after the ride-hailing services struggled to deliver people and packages together. It continues to rely on third-party companies such as Postmates, Deliv and Doordash to help deliver groceries, and last week partnered with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo.  SKEPTICAL DRIVERS  Walmart\u2019s associate delivery pilot program in the leafy, middle-class suburb of East Brunswick, New Jersey, started with store managers pitching employees an unusual new way to boost pay. Those who passed background checks could moonlight as drivers for the Walmart.com delivery service, they said.  Some staffers, who did not wish to be named fearing retribution for speaking to the media, told Reuters they balked at having to use their own cars and personal insurance policies for a program that would benefit Walmart.  To entice them to sign up, Walmart offered free TVs and iPads as gifts, they said. Eventually, about 50 of the store\u2019s more than 150 associates initially signed up, they added, though many had no prior experience as couriers with a delivery service.  Walmart declined comment on this.  Fourteen of the sixteen Walmart employees told Reuters that they were put off by the program\u2019s poor compensation. And all of them expressed concern over who would be responsible if they got into an accident or if merchandise was lost.  For example, the East Brunswick Walmart paid store associates $2 per package, with participants making three to five total drop-offs during a typical trip within a ten mile radius, participants told Reuters. It also reimbursed them 54 cents for fuel per mile, over the federal fuel reimbursement rate of 53.5 cents in 2017, and offered them an extra hour of overtime pay.  But every employee Reuters spoke to who signed up said they typically lost at least 30 minutes of time, waiting at the store after their shifts ended to collect the items and were never compensated for it.  Walmart didn\u2019t offer more than one hour of overtime even if it took more than an hour to deliver orders after finishing their 40 hour work week, former participants said. Walmart disputed this saying it paid workers overtime when they exceeded 40 hours.  All sixteen workers who had participated in the program said delivery of five packages would generally take them more than two hours to complete. If a worker drove 10 miles to drop five packages, that would earn them $15.40 in compensation per package and fuel, before overtime pay.  Rival Amazon pays independent drivers $18 to $25 an hour for deliveries, and the fuel costs belong to the driver, according to the Amazon Flex website. Amazon declined to comment on the story.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  One of the Walmart employees said in only one instance did she earn an additional $100 at the end of the week \u2013 after making nearly a dozen deliveries.  \u201cThe money was never worth it... and they stopped paying mileage in the end,\u201d said an employee who did not wish to be named.  Twelve out of sixteen employees said they were not paid mileage for the final deliveries they made before the program was shut. Walmart did not comment on mileage payments that employees said were not made.  As for insurance, risk and liability for accidents and lost packages, many of the employees Reuters spoke with said they were unclear if Walmart would shoulder the responsibility or not.  DOWN TO A TEAM OF FOUR  Now, an initiative known internally as \u2018Associate Delivery 2.0\u2019 is being run with four employees hired specifically as delivery drivers in Woodstock, Georgia, according to company documents and interviews.  To build demand, Walmart will waive the fee for the first delivery order if it is for $50 or more, according to a Walmart promotional pamphlet at the store. For subsequent orders, the retailer\u2019s mobile app offered delivery on a minimum $30 order for a fee of $7.99 to $9.95.  The team of three men and one woman, working separately, load up their cars to make deliveries to shoppers within ten miles.  Maurice Thomas, who is one of the four Walmart employees, illustrates the retailer\u2019s new tack. A hybrid between a delivery driver and a store employee, Thomas\u2019s role is newly created to revive the initiative, he and other store employees in Georgia said.  Thomas took a job at the Woodstock store three years ago unloading trucks. Now he uses his own car, fuel and personal insurance to deliver 6 to 7 packages to shopper\u2019s homes every day.  \u201cI have a fixed schedule and doing this is much better than unloading trucks,\u201d said Thomas, who is 28.  Walmart pays Thomas $12.50 an hour and reimburses 54.5 cents a mile, comparable to the 54.5 federal fuel reimbursement rate in 2018, he said. If Thomas drove 10 miles within an hour to make deliveries, he would earn $18.30.  Thomas said every two weeks he is usually left with about $130-$140 dollars after buying fuel.  Walmart informed employees in Georgia they would have to use their own car insurance policies when they were hired, Blakeman said. But the retailer will cover any expenses that their personal insurance policies won\u2019t cover, she added.  An internal document seen by Reuters provides Walmart delivery workers with a specific new protocol. Among the guidelines: \u201cdo not mix orders\u201d and \u201cmake sure you have your \u2018thank you\u2019 cards ready\u201d to leave inside their deliveries.  \u201cWe\u2019re testing and learning how best to use associates,\u201d said Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for pilots.\u201d","887":"Oct 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened marginally lower on Friday, as a dour sales forecast from Amazon overshadowed another set of strong results in what has so far been an upbeat third-quarter earnings season.

The Facebook data scandal, self-driving car crashes and Trump\u2019s intervention against Amazon pushed the S&P technology sector to post its worst monthly losses in nearly two years in March.  Facebook was down 1.7 percent on Monday, while the other FANG constituents like Netflix, Google-parent Alphabet were down between 2 percent and 3 percent.

Chicago, Miami and Newark are among the passed-over finalists that have expressed interest in another chance to become the home of an Amazon project that could bring 25,000 jobs. Nashville, Tennessee, which was awarded a 5,000-person center, also said it was open to taking on a bigger role should New York withdraw from consideration.  Newark, New Jersey, some 15 miles (24 km) to the west of New York City, is willing to share the headquarters in the event its larger neighbor would be satisfied with a scaled-down project, said Aisha Glover, chief executive of Newark Alliance, the group leading that city\u2019s effort.  \u201cWe\u2019re definitely interested in reactivating our bid,\u201d Glover said, stressing the importance of keeping Amazon in the New York metropolitan area.  Amazon in November announced New York City and Arlington, Virginia, which borders Washington, D.C., would share the so-called HQ2 project, splitting some 50,000 jobs between the two places as the Seattle-based company looked to expand elsewhere.  But the New York project, to be based in the Long Island City neighborhood in the borough of Queens, just across the East River from Manhattan, has run into opposition from local politicians who oppose the $2.8-billion in incentives promised to Amazon in a deal secretly negotiated by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.  Among those leading the opposition is state Senator Michael Gianaris, a Democrat who represents the waterfront district where Amazon wants to locate. He criticized offering huge tax credits to a company that made a net profit of $3 billion last quarter and whose chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is listed by Forbes as the richest man in the world.

The state senate has nominated Gianaris to the Public Authorities Control Board, which could sink the project as it has other deals in the past. In 2005, the board rejected a plan to build an Olympic and American football stadium in Manhattan.  Among Gianaris\u2019 allies is U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the rookie Democratic congresswoman from a nearby district whose progressive politics have captured a large national following.  Amazon has the support of other politicians including Cuomo, who has yet to ratify Gianaris\u2019 position on the control board.

Wall Street's optimism about last year's 10th anniversary iPhone, coupled with record share buybacks, have propelled Apple's stock 34 percent higher over the past 12 months, pushing the company's stock market value above $1 trillion on Thursday. The Cupertino, California company's shares added another 0.3 percent on Friday, putting its market capitalization at $1.005 trillion. Apple's 12-month gain is far better than the S&P 500's 14 percent increase over the past year, but it pales beside Amazon's astounding 85 percent surge, propelled by the online retailer's and cloud computing heavyweight's scorchingly fast revenue and profit growth. Amazon is now the second-largest publicly-listed U.S. company, with a market capitalization of $889 billion, followed closely by Alphabet and Microsoft, at $856 billion and $830 billion respectively. Google-owner Alphabet's stock has risen 32 percent over the past 12 months, and is up nearly 18 percent in 2018. Together with Facebook, the five largest U.S. companies account for 15 percent of the S&P 500. Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan said he owns shares of Amazon mostly because of its dominance of the cloud computing industry, a business that grew 42 percent in the June quarter and provided most of Amazon's operating profits. \"Of the three companies, I'd say Amazon will get to $1 trillion next,\" Morgan said. Average analyst price targets put Apple's stock market value at $1.05 trillion, Amazon at $1.02 trillion, Alphabet at $970 billion and Microsoft at $953 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But Amazon's market capitalization would overtake Apple's later in 2018 if both companies shares were to continue their 12-month growth pace.

Frederic Duval also told RTL radio that Amazon planned to appeal the court\u2019s ruling, after worker unions raised concerns about health measures.  The group said on Wednesday it planned to temporarily shutter the warehouses, confirming an internal document sent earlier on to French unions.  In the internal document seen by Reuters, the company said it would close the warehouses between from April 16 until at least April 20, after it was ordered to curtail deliveries and focus only on groceries and medical and hygiene supplies.","895":"(Reuters) - More than a year of work to bring Amazon.com Inc\u2019s headquarters and tens of thousands of jobs to New York City ended on Thursday with a couple of phone calls.  Jay Carney, the company\u2019s top policy executive, told New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that the world\u2019s biggest online retailer would not go ahead with plans to invest $2.5 billion to build a second head office in the New York City borough of Queens.  Carney, a former press secretary for President Barack Obama, told New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio the same shortly after.  Abruptly scuttling its Big Apple plans blindsided Amazon\u2019s allies and opponents alike. The company said the decision came together only in the last 48 hours, made by its senior leadership team and Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, chief executive and the richest person in the world.  Yet by some measures the decision was months in the making, as community opposition signaled to the company that it was not entirely welcome.  The abrupt reversal has made the company a target of ire from progressives like U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who are swiftly gaining ground and influence in the U.S. Democratic party. It may also play into an intensifying battle between Republicans and Democrats as President Donald Trump and his allies accuse left-leaning rivals of embracing socialism.  The decision has also generated fresh debate about the rich tax-breaks and public funding that municipalities routinely throw at companies to lure their business and the jobs they bring with them.  Seattle-based Amazon captivated elected officials across North America in September 2017 when it announced it would create more than 50,000 jobs in a second headquarters dubbed HQ2. Cities and states vied desperately for the economic stimulus, with New Jersey offering $7 billion in potential credits and the mayor of an Atlanta suburb promising to make Bezos mayor for life of a new city called \u201cAmazon.\u201d  A backlash began in earnest when Amazon announced two winners to split the offices last November: Arlington, Virginia, and New York\u2019s Long Island City neighborhood, with New York offering incentives worth $1.53 billion to Amazon. The company could apply for $900 million more, too.  A delivery person pushes a cart full of Amazon boxes in New York City, U.S., February 14, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  New York State Senator Michael Gianaris and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer said that day that it was \u201cunfathomable that we would sign a $3 billion check\u201d to one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies considering the city\u2019s crumbling subways and overcrowded schools.  City Council meetings in December and January showed Amazon executives who showed up the stern opposition they could expect from some elected officials and labor organizers.  Protesters interrupted the meetings. A television report showed people unfurling signs saying, \u201cAmazon delivers lies,\u201d and \u201cAmazon fuels ICE deportations\u201d - a reference to the company\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. Department in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Amazon felt that a small number of local and state officials had no desire to collaborate on a path forward, the company later said, despite what it said was strong popular support for its project.  RELATIVELY PAINLESS EXIT  Tension ratcheted up earlier this month, when Gianaris was nominated to a state panel set to vote in 2020 on whether to approve the financial terms for Amazon.  Days later, Amazon executives weighed the pros and cons of whether to follow through with its New York headquarters, two people briefed on talks inside the company said. Concerned that Amazon could be in limbo for more than a year ahead of the state panel\u2019s vote, the growing consensus within the company was that it did not make sense to move ahead in the face of persistent opposition with a headquarters in New York City, where it already has 5,000 employees.  Amazon had no binding legal contracts to acquire or lease the land for the project. It could exit with relatively little pain, the people said.  Company officials also concluded Amazon could shift the jobs that would have been created in New York to other corporate centers it has across the United States, from the San Francisco Bay Area to Boston. Reopening talks with former HQ2 contestants did not make sense, the people said.  Gianaris blamed Amazon for the reversal.  \u201cAmazon never showed willingness to look seriously at the concerns that were raised,\u201d he said.  Still, up to the moment of the announcement, there were signs that the parties could work together.  One union leader said he and other labor organizers met on Wednesday with Cuomo and four Amazon officials, including Brian Huseman, its vice president of public policy.  \u201cWe had such a productive meeting yesterday. Everyone left happy,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, head of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.  The group is trying to organize workers at an Amazon facility in Staten Island, another New York City borough, despite the company\u2019s past opposition to unionization.  \u201cIt was a complete surprise that they would say they look forward to working with us, and we talked about next steps, and then they call it all off the next morning,\u201d said Appelbaum.","896":"(Adds Amazon\u2019s contesting the award; Defense Secretary\u2019s response)  Nov. 15 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday it is contesting the Pentagon\u2019s award of an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft Corp, expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process.  Last month, Microsoft beat favorite Amazon for the contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, which is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon\u2019s information technology systems.  Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award:  JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals from competitors, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. It said the deal\u2019s initial two-year period would provide time to ensure JEDI was up to standards, noting that new contractors would be needed for other cloud computing demands in the future. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September.  AUGUST 6, 2018: Oracle Corp filed a protest with the DOD over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more. DOD\u2019s Government Accountability Office had until November to respond.  OCTOBER 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said it was no longer vying for the $10 billion cloud computing contract with the DOD, in part because the company\u2019s new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.  OCTOBER 9, 2018: Microsoft said its expanded Azure cloud service to help government clients save data on their own servers would be available by the end of the first quarter of 2019, as it battled Amazon.com for the contract. NOVEMBER 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \u201creasonably\u201d determined that the single-award approach was in the government\u2019s best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.  APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected to continue competing for Pentagon cloud-computing services as part of a contract that could be worth some $10 billion.  The selection left Oracle and IBM Corp out of the competition for the contract, which is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  JULY 18, 2019: U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was looking closely at Amazon.com\u2019s bid on a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD after getting complaints from other technology companies.  JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD.  AUGUST 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon.com Inc\u2019s bid following complaints from other technology companies.  AUGUST 5, 2019: Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper if \u201coutside\u201d influence caused him to delay awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract, after Trump suggested Amazon.com Inc should not win it.  OCTOBER 22, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing a disputed $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of a possible conflict of interest.  OCTOBER 25, 2019: The Defense Department said that Microsoft Corp has won the U.S. Pentagon\u2019s $10 billion cloud-computing contract, beating out favorite Amazon.  NOVEMBER 14, 2019: Amazon said it is contesting the Pentagon\u2019s award of an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft, expressing concern that politics got in the way of a fair contracting process.  NOVEMBER 15, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday rejected any suggestion of bias in a Pentagon decision to award Microsoft an up to $10 billion cloud computing contract, after Amazon announced plans to challenge it.

The appeal will likely be heard later this month at a time when both Amazon and Flipkart are battling slowing sales and logistical challenges during India\u2019s lockdown to tackle the coronavirus which has resulted in supply chain disruptions.  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in January ordered an investigation into business practices of the two e-commerce giants, but the High Court in Karnataka state put it on hold after Amazon argued the CCI did not have sufficient evidence to order it.  In a legal filing, trader group Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh urged the court to allow the CCI investigation to continue, arguing the antitrust body had reviewed enough initial evidence to order it, and the judge had erred in his decision.  \u201cThe present case before the CCI is one which involves matters of grave public interest and economic interest, and no stay should have been granted,\u201d the group said in its filing, which was made before India entered a nationwide lockdown late last month and has previously not been reported.  Amazon had approached the court against the CCI investigation as it was aware the businesses of brick-and-mortar traders were struggling and they don\u2019t have the resources to continue a prolonged litigation, the trader group\u2019s petition added.  Flipkart too had challenged the CCI investigation and the trader group will file a separate challenge against it once Indian courts reopen after the lockdown, a lawyer involved in the case said.  The CCI had ordered its investigation following a review of allegations that Amazon and Flipkart were promoting some \u201cpreferred sellers\u201d and in turn hurting business for other, smaller sellers.

Whole Foods did not give Cincinnati shoppers the option to have Instacart provide those services, as it did in other markets.

Instacart bagged the Whole Foods delivery deal in 2014, elevating its brand with influential young consumers who want everything from groceries to sofas delivered to their doorsteps.

On Tuesday, Amazon Pantry was offering select food products, such as cookies and tea, in New Delhi and Mumbai. Though Reuters reporters in both cities were able to place Pantry orders, several customers complained on Twitter they were struggling to get their requests fulfilled.

However, the potential penalty outlined by the Versailles Court of Appeal means that even a rate of 0.1% of handling or shipping items that are not included in the judgement could lead to a fine of more than a billion euros per week,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  \u201cUnfortunately, this means we have no option but to keep our fulfilment centres in France temporarily closed. We therefore anticipate a further extension of the temporary closure until May 18,\u201d it added.","908":"* Fnac Darty shares rise  * To roll out demo areas for Google products in France  PARIS, April 16 (Reuters) - French electronics retailer Fnac Darty said it would roll out demonstration areas for Google products and services in all its stores, as it speeds up the integration of Google\u2019s voice assistant and to fend off challenges from Amazon.  The deal initially lifted shares in Fnac Darty by 1.9 percent, sending the stock - in which Germany group Ceconomy has a 24 percent stake - to the top of Paris\u2019 SBF-120 index.  Fnac Darty shares later pared some of those gains to stand 0.6 percent higher by 0730 GMT.  The move comes as Google\u2019s rival Amazon is also set to launch its own Alexa voice assistant in France this spring.  Fnac Darty said in a statement that customers would be able to explore Google\u2019s range of products in hands-on areas ranging from 10-50 square metres.  People visiting Fnac Darty stores would also be able to examine options offered by the Google personal assistant, loaded on many devices such as the Google Home smart speaker or compatible smartphones, and the general Google ecosystem.  In March, French retailer Carrefour, which has a purchasing deal with Fnac Darty, said it had joined forces with Google to create an online voice assistant called \u201cLea\u201d as part of the French retailer\u2019s digital expansion.  Carrefour chief executive Alexandre Bompard, who joined last July and is the former boss of Fnac Darty, announced plans in January to invest 2.8 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in digital commerce by 2022, in the face of competition from Amazon.","909":"FILE PHOTO: An Amazon.com Inc driver stands next to an Amazon delivery truck in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 21, 2016.

In its results release on Thursday it kept all its targets under the plan.  For the full year that ended in December 2019 it said it expected recurring operating profit to reach 2.1 billion euros ($2.3 billion), an increase of 145 million at constant exchange rates. The company, which has a purchasing alliance with Britain's Tesco TSCO.L, is due to report its full earnings on Feb. 27.  \u201cThe year 2019 marks an important milestone for our group. Carrefour posted solid and profitable growth. Our transformation plan is bearing fruit,\u201d Chairman and CEO Alexandre Bompard said in a statement.  Fourth-quarter sales came to 21.74 billion euros, broadly in line with expectations.  Sales growth reached 3.1% on a like-for-like basis, excluding fuel and calendar effects, against 2.3% in the previous quarter.  In Brazil, same-store sales rose 7.6% in the fourth quarter.  However, in France where Bompard has made reviving flagging sales at large hypermarkets a priority, sales were down 0.9%, after falling by a similar 0.9% in the third quarter.  Hypermarket sales were down 3.4% in the last three months of the year after falling 3.6% in the third quarter, offsetting positive growth in supermarkets and convenience stores.  Carrefour\u2019s turnaround plan also includes fewer sales promotions in France to focus on everyday low prices and scaling back of non-food items, which already weighed on hypermarket sales in the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter hypermarket sales were also hit by transport strikes in France against pension reforms.  Last week, smaller French rival Casino CASP.PA slashed its forecast for 2019 French operating profit growth after transport strikes shaved some 80 million euros off revenue in the fourth quarter.  Carrefour, however, said that for the whole of last year it expected recurring operating profit for France alone would grow at a double-digit rate.","913":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday it would spend $2 billion to create affordable homes in regions where three of its major U.S. employment hubs are located.

Walmart-owned Flipkart\u2019s six-day sale begins Sept. 29, while Amazon is yet to announce dates. Both e-retailers promise big discounts on everything from fashion to smartphones to home appliances and have previously said discounts and deals are offered by sellers on their platforms.  \u201cBy offering deep discounts ranging from 10% to 80% on their e-commerce portals, these companies are clearly influencing the prices and create an uneven level playing field which is in direct contravention of the policy,\u201d the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said in a letter to the federal trade minister.  CAIT, which represents 500,000 merchants and traders in India, also demanded a \u201cblanket ban\u201d on such sales and asked the government to probe the potential violation of FDI norms.  Its demand is unlikely to see government action before this year\u2019s sales kick off but it could help frame government policy on deep discounts.  FDI RULES  India does not allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in inventory-driven models of e-commerce, used by Walmart and Amazon in the United States, where goods and services are owned by an e-commerce firm that sells directly to retail customers.  It modified e-commerce rules late last year to protect the country\u2019s vast unorganized retail sector that does not have the clout to purchase at scale and offer big discounts.  Those rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to reconfigure ownership structures and re-jig some key vendor relationships and agreements.  Asked for comment, Flipkart said more than 100,000 sellers on its platform awaited its \u2018Big Billion Days\u2019 sale event.  \u201cWe empower our sellers with business insights that allow them to decide the best value for their own products, so they can deliver benefits and savings to consumers and scale their businesses at the same time,\u201d said Rajneesh Kumar, chief corporate affairs officer at Flipkart Group.

The Internet retail and infrastructure heavyweight provided the greatest lift to the S&P 500, followed by Alphabet and Microsoft.  A strong earnings season has helped U.S. stocks cushion some of the impact from the ongoing trade issues.  With second-quarter reporting season winding down, 79 percent of S&P 500 companies have topped estimates.

It hopes that the program, launched nationally in July, along with a push into millennial-focused designs and introduction of perks for shoppers will boost sluggish store traffic.  Comparable sales growth for the third quarter, however, was down from 2.5% a year earlier and only half of the 0.76% growth forecast by analysts.  The company, which holds a call with analysts before the opening bell, cut its full-year profit forecast to between $4.75 and $4.95 per share from a previous range of $5.15 to $5.45, but gave no reason in its statement for the revision.

On Friday, Sinclair announced a deal to buy Walt Disney Co\u2019s collection of 21 regional sports networks (RSNs), turning the largest U.S. broadcast station owner into one of the biggest live news and sports companies this side of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corp.  With Walt Disney Co, Amazon, Netflix Inc and AT&T Inc just some of the combatants now in the video streaming wars, \u201cThere is only going to be more competition and more interest for key assets like this in the future,\u201d President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley said, in response to a question about licensing sports to big tech companies. \u201cWe have an interest in as broad a distribution as possible.\u201d  The deal is a capstone to Sinclair\u2019s expansion from a stodgy TV station owner to a Trump-supporting media company stitching together 190 local TV stations across the country.  In January, it launched an advertising-supported streaming TV service called STIRR. It is also modernizing its broadcast technology to the new ATSC 3.0 standard, which will let it act more like an online TV company by offering interactivity and ads targeted to viewers.  In an interview on Sunday, Ripley said the deal was a bargain because Disney needed to sell the assets to gain approval for its $71.3 billion deal to buy the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox from Murdoch.  The sports networks are valued at five and a half times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, after tax benefits, compared to MSG Networks which trades at around eight times.  But Sinclair\u2019s doubling down on traditional TV appears to run counter to the shift in consumers away from traditional television, broadcast and pay TV to digital services owned by Netflix and Google.  Ripley said battling the tech giants head-on, as Disney and AT&T are preparing to do with upcoming digital video services, made no sense for the much smaller Sinclair.  \u201cWe\u2019re a local media company with a strong focus in local news and we continue to see that as an area that will have strong relevancy if we took it multiplatform and not be an area flooded by cheap cash by big tech,\u201d he said.  The company views live sports as a long term profitable business because of its scarcity.  \u201cThere are only 160 or so baseball games a year,\u201d Ripley said. \u201cNo matter how much money that Amazon or Google or Apple throws at the MLB (Major League Baseball), they can\u2019t really change that dynamic very easily.\u201d  Sinclair already distributes content to multiple cable, satellite and streaming companies, including YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google. Adding more digital clients like Amazon would be just another distributor relationship, he said.  BETTING THE FUTURE  The acquisition will see Sinclair capitalizing on the new U.S. sports betting market, which is \u201ca huge opportunity for this platform. The RSNs are ideally positioned in so many different ways to benefit from this mega-trend,\u201d he said.  In addition to increased fan engagement and viewership, he expects a wave of new advertising dollars to come from what he thinks will be $1.5 billion to $2 billion of new ad revenue industry-wide \u201cin short order,\u201d from sportsbook operators and other companies marketing in the space.  Ripley also plans to eventually allow viewers to place bets right from their screens during live games, similar to how fans can wager in Europe now.  \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in gaming, we\u2019re going to add on extra stats, the ability to do prop bets in the game, pitch by pitch, play by play,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can play along and wager while you watch.\u201d  The in-game, on-screen wagers would be done in partnership with sportsbook operators, but Sinclair would not want to become a bookie itself.  \u201cOur preliminary conclusion is that it doesn\u2019t make sense to be the licensee and run the book,\u201d he said.  Sinclair has already been in talks with sportsbook operators about in-game wagering for the Tennis Channel cable network, which it also owns, he said.

The contract, called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI, is part of a broad modernization of the Pentagon\u2019s information technology systems.  Here is a timeline of important dates leading up to the award:  JULY 26, 2018: The Pentagon released the final request for proposals from competitors, seeking a single winner to allow for the most rapid adoption of the technology. It said the deal\u2019s initial two-year period would provide time to ensure JEDI was up to standards, noting that new contractors would be needed for other cloud computing demands in the future. The contract, valued at $10 billion over 10 years, was set to be awarded in September.  AUGUST 6, 2018: Oracle Corp filed a protest with the DOD over its plans to award the contract to a single company instead of allowing for multiple winners, arguing that the Pentagon would be locked into a legacy contract for a decade or more. DOD\u2019s Government Accountability Office had until November to respond.  OCTOBER 8, 2018: Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said it was no longer vying for the $10 billion cloud computing contract with the DOD, in part because the company\u2019s new ethical guidelines did not align with the project, without elaborating.  OCTOBER 9, 2018: Microsoft said its expanded Azure cloud service to help government clients save data on their own servers would be available by the end of the first quarter of 2019, as it battled Amazon.com for the contract. NOVEMBER 14, 2018: The Government Accountability Office denied the protest filed by Oracle, finding that the agency \u201creasonably\u201d determined that the single-award approach was in the government\u2019s best interests for reasons including national security concerns and complied with applicable law.  APRIL 26, 2019: Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected to continue competing for Pentagon cloud-computing services as part of a contract that could be worth some $10 billion.  The selection left Oracle and IBM Corp out of the competition for the contract, which is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  JULY 18, 2019: U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was looking closely at Amazon.com\u2019s bid on a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD after getting complaints from other technology companies.  JULY 19, 2019: Four Republican members of U.S. Congress, including House Armed Services Committee ranking member Mac Thornberry, sent a letter to Trump urging him to move forward with a $10 billion cloud contract with the DOD.  AUGUST 1, 2019: The Pentagon decided to put on hold its decision to award the $10 billion cloud-computing contract after Trump said his administration was examining Amazon.com Inc\u2019s bid following complaints from other technology companies.  AUGUST 5, 2019: Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jack Reed asked U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper if \u201coutside\u201d influence caused him to delay awarding a $10 billion cloud-computing contract, after Trump suggested Amazon.com Inc should not win it.  OCTOBER 22, 2019: U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper removed himself from reviewing a disputed $10 billion cloud-computing contract because of a possible conflict of interest.","928":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The owner of U.S. tabloid newspaper the National Enquirer pushed back on Friday against accusations of \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d from Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, saying its reporting on an extramarital relationship involving the world\u2019s richest man was lawful and it would investigate his claims.  Bezos on Thursday accused American Media Inc (AMI) of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing \u201cintimate photos\u201d he allegedly sent to his girlfriend unless he said in public that the American supermarket tabloid\u2019s reporting on him was not politically motivated.  The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan is reviewing whether the alleged extortion violated a non-prosecution agreement, a person familiar with the matter said, confirming an earlier report by Bloomberg News.  AMI signed the agreement with federal prosecutors last year in connection with a $150,000 hush-money payment to a former Playboy model who claims she had an affair with U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump denies the affair.  The agreement can be voided if AMI commits any crimes. If the agreement is nullified, AMI or its executives could face prosecution for the hush payment and its conduct with Bezos, legal experts said.  AMI and its CEO David Pecker have had close links to Trump, who has attacked Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, on Twitter.  \u201cAmerican Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.  Bezos opened an investigation into how the messages could have ended up in the hands of the tabloid, led by longtime security consultant Gavin de Becker. De Becker told media that the leak was politically motivated.  \u2018POLITICALLY MOTIVATED\u2019  In a blog post on Thursday, Bezos cited an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposed a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that \u201cthey have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI\u2019s) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u201d  In return for such an acknowledgment, according to the email, AMI offered \u201cnot to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos,\u201d Bezos said.  Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an \u201cextortionate proposal.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Bezos, Fine, and de Becker were not immediately available for comment. Amazon declined to comment. Shares of the world\u2019s largest online retailer were down 1.8 percent at $1,584.74.  Extortion typically involves an effort to obtain property, services, money or some other benefit by threatening violence, reputational harm or other injury, although definitions can vary across state and federal laws.  In Florida, where American Media is based, extortion includes maliciously threatening targets with disgrace, or to expose their secrets. In Washington state, where Amazon is based, it includes threatening to expose secrets that may subject targets to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or reveal information that the targets wanted to conceal.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Federal law defines extortion as someone seeking or actually obtaining \u201cproperty\u201d through the \u201cwrongful use\u201d of actual or threatened force, violence or fear. \u201cProperty\u201d can be something of value not limited to a tangible object or money.  Elie Honig, a former prosecutor, argued in a column on CNN that the actions alleged by Bezos amounted to extortion because the act of stopping Bezos\u2019 investigation was of value to AMI and AMI\u2019s threat of exposing lurid photos met the \u201cwrongful\u201d test.  But criminal defense lawyer Page Pate said what AMI sought to gain from Bezos was \u201ctoo fuzzy\u201d and would not be enough to put them in violation of the non-prosecution deal.  \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a clear enough hook to show that what they wanted from Bezos was a thing of value,\u201d Pate said.  On Friday, AMI said that at the time of Bezos\u2019 allegations it was \u201cin good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him.\u201d  \u201cIn light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary,\u201d it added.","929":"April 4 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has been in contact with the CEOs of two coronavirus test makers as it considers how to screen its staff and reduce the risk of infection at its warehouses, according to internal meeting notes seen by Reuters.  The chief executives of Abbott Laboratories and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc have told Amazon they would like to work with the e-commerce company, though the U.S. government is taking up all of their testing capacity at present, the notes said.  The company also discussed whether it could start such tests in at least one warehouse near its Seattle headquarters, the status of which was unclear. The nature of Amazon\u2019s conversations with the test makers and the exact assistance they might offer were unclear.  The document separately indicated Amazon is looking into the ability to screen more than one person at a time for the virus, and it also wants to partner with a medical organization in its testing efforts. It did not give further details on multi-person testing or name a partner.  Abbott and Thermo Fisher did not return a request for comment late Friday. Amazon declined to comment.  Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, is rolling out face masks and temperature checks for workers at all its U.S. and European warehouses by next week.  Longer term, however, it wants to test workers for the virus and hopes other companies will follow suit, according to the notes, in which Amazon\u2019s general counsel also criticized an employee who was fired on Monday.  The notes reveal how the company is focused on coronavirus testing as important to its operation and to bolstering the U.S. economy. They also show how Amazon remains in the early stages of determining how to start checks for the virus and tackle a shortage of tests.  The attempts to increase screening measures come at a time when high-profile protests have hit several Amazon warehouses, as employees increasingly fear they will contract the virus by showing up to work. The COVID-19 disease already has been reported among staff from at least 19 of its U.S. warehouses.  More than a million people globally have been infected and more than 58,000 have died in the pandemic.  Abbott has U.S. marketing approval for a diagnostic test that can give patients results in minutes, for use in physicians\u2019 offices and other community healthcare settings. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a Thermo Fisher test as well.  The type of evaluation Amazon was considering was also unclear, whether diagnostic to detect current infections or an antibody test to tell if someone may be immune.  Amazon has had a growing interest in healthcare. The company announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co two years ago to lower health costs for their employees, a venture now known as Haven.  Other retailers, meanwhile, including rival Walmart Inc , have worked with the White House on drive-through testing for first responders.

The plaintiffs said Whole Foods would send workers home without pay or impose disciplinary actions for wearing the masks and related apparel, even as it let employees wear masks bearing political messages and sports team logos.  U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, however, said Whole Foods and its parent, Amazon.com Inc, did not engage in racial discrimination or violate Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \u201cAt worst, they were selectively enforcing a dress code to suppress certain speech in the workplace,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHowever unappealing that might be, it is not conduct made unlawful by Title VII.\u201d  Burroughs said one plaintiff can pursue a retaliation claim.  The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan expects her clients to appeal, saying in an email the decision \u201cgoes against the tide of case law recognizing the critical importance of eradicating race discrimination from worksites across our country.\u201d  Whole Foods has said its dress code was \u201cfacially neutral\u201d and that it has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for retaliation.

Started in the garage of co-founder Steve Jobs in 1976, the iPhone maker\u2019s annual revenue has ballooned to $229 billion, greater than the gross domestic product of countries including Portugal and New Zealand.  (Big Tech Rev vs Countries' GDP: reut.rs\/2ry9qr6)  Apple\u2019s market capitalization on Thursday topped a record $934 billion, following its unveiling last week of a $100 billion buyback budget and news that Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway dramatically increased its stake in the company.  Thanks to a 12 percent rally since its quarterly report last Tuesday, the Cupertino, California company is just 8 percent short of hitting the $1 trillion valuation mark.  Pointing to Apple\u2019s recent 31 percent jump in service revenue, including music streaming and online storage, CFRA analyst Angelo Zino on Wednesday upped his target price for the stock from $195 to $210, which would put Apple\u2019s market capitalization at $1.03 trillion. Zino joins at least 12 other analysts with price targets putting Apple\u2019s stock market value at 13 digits.  But Apple is in danger of being beaten to the $1 trillion mark - or passed soon after - by Amazon.com, the second largest listed U.S. company by market value, at $780 billion.  Saudi Arabian authorities, meanwhile, have said they expect a planned international initial public offering of Saudi Aramco that would value the national oil producer at about $2 trillion.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Alphabet\u2019s shares fell 7.5 percent on Tuesday, a day after the company reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth in three years. About 85 percent of the company\u2019s revenue comes from Google\u2019s ad business.  \u201cOne word: Amazon,\u201d said Mat Baxter, global chief executive of Initiative, an ad buying agency owned by IPG Mediabrands whose clients include Amazon.  Baxter said in an interview that clients are starting to pivot and move ad dollars from platforms where people search for products to places like Amazon Inc, where they are making the purchase, in order to be closer to the moment of transaction.  Monica Peart, forecasting director at research firm eMarketer, offered a different take, however. \u201cAmazon is of course a growing part of advertisers\u2019 ad budgets and some of its growth is indeed coming at the expense of what would have gone to Google. But this is not a major impact to Google\u2019s ad revenue growth at this time,\u201d she said.  Google\u2019s massive size, which still had revenue of $36.3 billion in the first quarter, means that growth must slow as global digital ad budgets and international economies have also slowed, said Peart.  Amazon\u2019s ad business, which is combined in an \u201cadvertising and other sales\u201d segment, brought in $2.7 billion in the first quarter, less than one-tenth of Google\u2019s ad sales.  Google\u2019s streaming video platform YouTube has also struggled to stop the spread of disturbing or adult content on the site, prompting some major advertisers including AT&T Inc to remove its ads for fear they could appear next to offensive content.  \u201cSome clients have made the decision to pull back a bit,\u201d said Jon Stimmel, chief investment officer at Universal McCann, an ad buying agency and a unit of IPG Mediabrands, referring to YouTube. Those clients have repositioned to streaming platforms considered more brand safe, such as Hulu and Roku, he said.  Given that search engine marketing, or promoting websites in search results, has not become less expensive on Google, YouTube must be the main reason for the revenue decline, said Barry Lowenthal, chief executive of ad agency The Media Kitchen, adding that his clients still spend more money on Google than many other ad platforms.","939":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Contract manufacturer Foxconn said on Sunday it is investigating a plant in China that makes devices for Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, after a U.S. watchdog group criticized what it described as harsh working conditions at the factory.  A 94-page report by New York-based China Labor Watch that followed a nine-month investigation cited excessive hours, low wages, inadequate training and an overreliance on \u201cdispatch\u201d or temporary workers in violation of Chinese law at the Hengyang Foxconn plant in Hunan province, which makes Echo Dot smart speakers and Kindle e-readers.  \u201cWe are carrying out a full investigation of the areas raised by that report, and if found to be true, immediate actions will be taken to bring the operations into compliance with our Code of Conduct,\u201d Foxconn Technology Group said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  Taiwan-based Foxconn, known formally as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd 2317.TW, is the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and employs more than a million people.  Foxconn, which also makes Apple Inc AAPL.O iPhones, came under fire in 2010 for a spate of suicides at plants in China. Foxconn pledged to improve working conditions.  China Labor Watch said its investigation found that about 40 percent of workers at the plant were dispatch workers, far exceeding the 10 percent limit under Chinese law. Dispatch workers were paid at the same rate for regular and overtime hours, rather than time and a half as required, said China Labor Watch Program Officer Elaine Lu.  \u201cThey were underpaid,\u201d Lu said. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Dispatch workers earned 14.5 yuan ($2.26) per hour, the report said. Workers also put in more than 100 overtime hours per month during peak season, far more than the 36 hours allowed by law, and some worked for 14 consecutive days.  Amazon said it audited the factory in March and found overtime and use of dispatch workers were \u201cissues of concern.\u201d  \u201cWe immediately requested a corrective action plan from Foxconn,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. It said it is monitoring Foxconn\u2019s response and \u201ccompliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We are committed to ensuring that these issues are resolved.\u201d  Foxconn said in an earlier statement that it \u201cworks hard to comply with all relevant laws and regulations\u201d where it operates and conducts regular audits. \u201cIf infractions are identified, we work to immediately rectify them,\u201d it said.","940":"FILE PHOTO: The Spotify logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 3, 2018.

The company reported sales growth of 24% to $70 billion in the third quarter, but its prediction of $80 billion to $86.5 billion sales in the fourth quarter fell short of the $87.4 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The selection leaves Oracle Corp and IBM Corp out of the competition for the contract for the Defense Department\u2019s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI. The contract is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  \u201cI can confirm that AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Microsoft are the companies that met the minimum requirements outlined\u201d in the Request for Proposals, department spokeswoman Elissa Smith said in a statement.  The Pentagon said in its request for bidders last year that the contract for cloud computing services could be worth as much as $10 billion over a 10-year period.  Amazon Web Services, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle were considered front runners for the contract, according to industry executives. AWS at the time was the only company approved by the government to handle secret and top secret data.  Smith said the earliest a contract was likely to be awarded was mid-July, mainly because of the size and complexity of the deal, potential protest litigation and an ongoing investigation.  Oracle has expressed concern about the role of a former Amazon employee who worked on the JEDI project until recusing himself, then later left the Defense Department and returned to Amazon Web Services.  Smith said a department review of the acquisitions process did uncover potential ethical violations, which have been referred to the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general for further investigation.

REUTERS\/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa  MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - Online shopping baskets in India are about to get lighter. Amazon and Walmart will be limited to operating a marketplace and prevented from acting as retailers under stricter rules which came into effect on Friday, resulting in products disappearing from the virtual shelves. Their miscalculation on the direction of policy could be costly.  New Delhi is clamping down on a long-standing policy to keep foreign investment out of big retail. It means Walmart, which recently ploughed $16 billion into India\u2019s Flipkart, and Amazon can no longer sell products from companies in which they own a stake, nor push vendors to hawk goods exclusively through their online services. They must also ensure they account for no more than a quarter of any merchant\u2019s purchases.  Amazon and Walmart, whose combined market values are $1.1 trillion, will suffer because they have been adhering to the letter rather than the spirit of India\u2019s rules. Through complex structures, they replicate some benefits of an inventory-led business model, leveraging scale to deliver goods to consumers faster and cheaper. Cash rewards are often thrown in, too.  For example, Amazon owns a minority stake in the parent company of Cloudtail, which is backed by Infosys co-founder and billionaire Narayana Murthy. It is one of Amazon\u2019s biggest vendors. Under the latest rules, Cloudtail will not be allowed to sell on Amazon. Nor would Amazon\u2019s own fledgling food business.  As a result of the changes, online sales could fall by $46 billion by 2022, according to a draft analysis by consultancy PwC seen by Reuters. The overhaul also creates room for local operators to dominate, as is the case in China. Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, for one, will gain an edge as he attempts to turn his $109 billion Reliance Industries into a retail and media empire akin to the one built by Jeff Bezos.  New Delhi only belatedly has decided to enforce its original intended policy aims. In their eagerness to grab market share, however, Amazon and Walmart too lightly dismissed the risk it would happen. Ahead of an upcoming general election, politicians will be counting on votes from the country\u2019s millions of appeased shopkeepers. The U.S. retailers can only elect how they want to proceed in India from here.","949":"* Nasdaq slipping after 11 days of gains  * China\u2019s industrial profits grow at fastest in 8 months  * Amazon extends Thursday gains on online holiday sales data  * Indexes: Dow up 0.18%, S&P up 0.04%, Nasdaq down 0.12% (Updates with mid-afternoon trading)  Dec 27 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow industrials edged higher to fresh records on Friday, as a year-end rally fueled by optimism over an initial U.S.-China trade deal chugged along.  The Nasdaq was slightly lower, however, putting the tech-heavy index on pace to snap its 11-session streak of gains.  With only a few days left for the year, the benchmark S&P 500 has climbed more than 29% so far in 2019, its biggest annual percentage gain since 2013.

That\u2019s a recipe for equity values to continue to move higher,\u201d Ragan said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 51.68 points, or 0.18%, to 28,673.07, the S&P 500 gained 1.39 points, or 0.04%, to 3,241.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.87 points, or 0.12%, to 9,011.53.  Among S&P 500 sectors, consumer staples, real estate and consumer discretionary led the way.  Shares of Amazon.com Inc rose 0.3%, building on strong gains a day earlier when a report showed U.S. shoppers spent more online during the holiday shopping season than in 2018.  Financials and energy lagged among the sectors.  Aside from optimism over trade relations, the stock market has been lifted by interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and better than feared economic data and corporate profits.  Data on Friday showed profits at China\u2019s industrial firms grew at the fastest pace in eight months in November, but broad weakness in the country\u2019s domestic demand remains a risk for company earnings next year.

The expansion plan highlights Amazon\u2019s intent to plant roots beyond Mexico\u2019s bustling capital, banking on the nation\u2019s potential to grow into an e-commerce engine of Latin America.  Online shopping in Mexico comprised just 3.0 percent of total sales last year, according to market research firm Euromonitor International, but it is projected to more than double by 2022, reaching $14 billion.  \u201cMexico\u2019s digital economy has great potential.

The company has considered several properties in Queretaro, and was looking for 50 acres where it could commission a more than one million-square-foot warehouse, about the size of 17 football fields, plus office space, one of the sources said.  Amazon declined to comment.  Queretaro, 114 miles north of Mexico City, is within a day\u2019s reach of Monterrey and Guadalajara, two of Mexico\u2019s most populous regions. It also sits in a cluster of middle-class cities in the Bajio, a region dense with automotive and aerospace plants.  Most of the state\u2019s industrial parks sit along the so-called \u201cNAFTA highway,\u201d a key artery for companies in Mexico receiving goods from the United States and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement. An updated pact was agreed last month and is expected to preserve cross-border commerce once it becomes law.  The parks are also within several miles of the Queretaro Intercontinental Airport that handles cargo.  Amazon\u2019s expansion to Queretaro would be part of the company\u2019s bid to reel in shoppers with fast deliveries while keeping a lid on shipping expenses.  \u201cIt\u2019s all about speed to market and keeping costs low,\u201d said Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL International Inc.  Amazon, which began selling physical goods in Mexico in 2015, already operates three warehouses just outside Mexico City with about 1.5 million square feet. That space is equivalent to just 1.0 percent of its vast U.S. logistics footprint, according to MWPVL.  Still, it has scaled up faster in Mexico than in Brazil, which MWPVL says has 665,400 square feet.  For Pedro Villa, whose Mexico-based company Konekte sells home storage equipment, speedy deliveries boost sales by reining in first-time shoppers who are concerned about online fraud and worry packages may not arrive.  \u201cIt\u2019s about confidence,\u201d Villa said. \u201cIf you pay and it takes a week or 15 days, you\u2019re going to want your money back.\u201d","953":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Reliance Group is seen at Reliance Center in Mumbai, India, December 26, 2017.

Duval gave no indication that Amazon could cancel its \u201cBlack Friday\u201d discount shopping day on Nov. 27 at a time when small shops, which have been struggling to compete against Amazon, are closed.  \u201cThe French need to do their Christmas shopping and they need to make savings. This period at the end of November is very important for that and it is very important to offer that opportunity,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhat I hope is that small shopkeepers that were prevented from opening during the lockdown can reopen as soon as possible and if they can do that on Nov. 27, it\u2019s perfect,\u201d  Recent data have shown signs France was starting to curb the spread of the virus with its lockdown.

Drawing on its wealth of customer data, Amazon has stocked the store with its best sellers as well as products popular with New Yorkers. The shop, known as Amazon 4-star, will let customers play with Echo speakers, Kindle e-readers and other devices made by the company. It will also sell books, games and kitchenware.  The news marks Amazon's latest incursion into the turf of rivals such as Target Corp TGT.N, which has courted urban shoppers with new small-format stores. It also highlights how the world's largest online retailer, famous for upending retail chains' business, is increasingly turning to physical stores to please customers.  Digital price tags will line the shelves of Amazon 4-star. That will allow items\u2019 prices to fluctuate, so members of Amazon\u2019s loyalty club Prime will always pay the online price in the store.  Those without membership in the fast-shipping club will be charged the typically higher list price, unless they sign up for Prime on the spot. Amazon\u2019s chain of more than a dozen book stores operates in the same way.  Encouraging sign-ups is key to the company\u2019s strategy because Prime members tend to shop more on Amazon.com.  The extent of Amazon\u2019s ambition for the new store format is unclear. The company is known for experimentation, and a spokesman declined to comment on expansion plans.  Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Amazon will add new stores if the format takes off, but he expects it may not.  \u201cIf I\u2019m looking for a television and the store is full of kitchen appliances, it doesn\u2019t help me very much,\u201d he said.  Grocery remains the other key category for Amazon\u2019s brick-and-mortar play.  The company bought Whole Foods Market in a $13.7 billion deal last year, from which it is now delivering fresh food to shoppers\u2019 homes. It is also rolling out smaller grocery shops known as Amazon Go, where in-store technology allows customers to walk out with items and have their credit cards billed without having to stop by a cash register.","958":"FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a combination photo.

FILE PHOTO: A TikTok logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The news generated widespread attention for the Chinese-owned social media platform coming the same week U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is \u201ccertainly looking at\u201d banning TikTok, suggesting it shared information with the Chinese government.  It was not immediately clear what led to the initial ban by Amazon. One person familiar with the matter said senior Amazon executives were unaware of the request to delete TikTok from employee devices. The ban was reversed after TikTok and Amazon representatives discussed the matter, according to an email sent to TikTok employees.  Earlier this week, Wells Fargo sent a note to employees who had installed TikTok on company-owned mobile devices telling them to remove the app immediately.  \u201cDue to concerns about TikTok\u2019s privacy and security controls and practices, and because corporate-owned devices should be used for company business only, we have directed those employees to remove the app from their devices,\u201d Wells Fargo said in a statement.  \u201cWe have not been contacted by Wells Fargo, but as with any organization that has concerns, we are open to engaging with them constructively and letting them know about the actions we have taken to protect data security for our users,\u201d a TikTok spokesman told Reuters in a statement.  The attention underscores the hotseat that TikTok\u2019s owner, China-based ByteDance, has found itself in over recent days.  The Chinese ownership of TikTok, among the fastest growing digital platforms ever, has come under heavy scrutiny on issues including their handling of user data. India banned TikTok and other Chinese apps in June.  The company has said user data is stored in the United States with a backup copy in Singapore. One person familiar with the matter said TikTok\u2019s user data is primarily stored in the Google Cloud in its Virginia-based data center.  TikTok declined to comment. Google could not immediately be reached for comment.  That did not stop Pompeo from floating a possible ban of TikTok in the United States. Asked if Americans should download it, he told Fox News: \u201cOnly if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d  On Friday, the Republican National Committee asked its members via email not to download TikTok. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Friday also reiterated its guidance from December to stop downloading the app.  A person familiar with the matter said the DNC has been advising campaign staff for months not to use TikTok on their personal devices and to use a separate phone and account if they use the platform for campaign work because of the amount of data it tracks. A spokesman for the DNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Two Republican senators in March introduced a bill aimed at banning federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones, citing national security concerns around the collection and sharing of data on U.S. users with China\u2019s government.  Last year the United States Navy banned TikTok from government-issued mobile devices, saying the app represented a \u201ccybersecurity threat.\u201d  Last November, the U.S. government launched a national security review of TikTok owner Beijing ByteDance Technology Co\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of U.S. social media app Musical.ly, Reuters first reported last year.  SECURITY CONCERNS  To address concerns over its Chinese ownership, ByteDance has taken steps to shift its center of power away from China, Reuters previously reported. It is also looking to make changes to TikTok\u2019s corporate structure for the same reasons, a company spokesperson said this week.  But concerns persist. Last month, when Apple released to developers a test version of its iOS operating system with new privacy features, developers showed images of TikTok\u2019s app triggering notifications that it was copying data from users\u2019 clipboards, where data is temporarily stored while copying and pasting from one app to another.  TikTok said the notifications were caused by an anti-spam feature but that it would end the practice.  Apple has not restricted TikTok use by employees, one of them said.  Some U.S. semiconductor companies have been reluctant to consider a ban on TikTok because ByteDance is a customer, according to people familiar with the matter.  Some firms providing security services to big companies have added TikTok to their lists of banned apps on managed devices.","963":"The National Labor Relations Board on Friday rejected Amazon.com Inc\u2019s claim that 6,000 employees at its Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse could safely vote in person on whether to join a union, citing a spate of COVID-19 infections among the workers and the surrounding area\u2019s high positivity rate.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Uber Technologies is no Amazon.com. Some of the ride-hailing firm\u2019s boosters have pushed a comparison with the e-commerce giant in roadshow meetings for the company\u2019s imminent initial public offering, according to news reports. The idea is that hefty losses now are laying the foundation for a future profit juggernaut. Instead of the income statement, though, investors should look at cash flow numbers.  Uber, led by Dara Khosrowshahi, is racking up tremendous losses. Its accumulated deficit since its founding in 2009 totaled $7.9 billion at the end of 2018. It estimates it lost another $1 billion in the first quarter this year. The hope is that subsidies to drivers and passengers help the company grow and dominate what could be a winner-take-most market. Once that happens, Uber will be able to raise prices and reduce incentives. And if and when autonomous vehicles arrive, eliminating drivers could result in hefty profit margins.  The Amazon comparison initially hangs together. It took Jeff Bezos\u2019 firm some seven years to deliver its first profitable quarter, and more than a dozen years for accumulated earnings to wipe out earlier deficits.  Yet Amazon needed little outside funding. It raised less than $10 million initially and a bit over $50 million when it floated, plus nearly $2 billion in convertible debt during the dot-com boom. That\u2019s a relatively light demand for capital. Bezos managed to finance most of his company\u2019s growth with positive cash flow: Customers pay first, and Amazon can reimburse most vendors later. The firm\u2019s operations threw off cash in its first quarter as a public company in 1997, and operating cash flow has been positive on an annual basis since 2002.  In contrast, Uber\u2019s operations burned nearly $6 billion over the past three years, and there\u2019s no reason to suspect that will change any time soon. Rivals such as Lyft are competing aggressively for market share. And hefty R&D expenditure, as well as expansion in new areas like meal delivery and freight, may accelerate Uber\u2019s cash burn. It has plenty of funds on hand \u2013 more than $10 billion of net cash after the IPO, according to the latest draft prospectus. But in one important way the company\u2019s voracious appetite for cash makes it almost the opposite of Amazon.","968":"(Updates to late afternoon, changes byline)  * Indexes waffle in choppy trading session  * Amazon.com, Tesla weigh on consumer discretionary stocks  * Q4 GDP revised up, biggest consumer spending gain in 3 years  * Dow up 0.29 pct, S&P up 0.11 pct, Nasdaq off 0.34 pct  By Stephen Culp  NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street edged higher during a rocky session on Wednesday as gains for defensive stocks offset a sharp fall in Amazon shares and declines in technology stocks.

Online retailer Amazon.com lost as much as $53 billion in market value after a report that President Donald Trump indicated he wanted to rein in the company. The stock later pared its loses and was down 4.2 percent in afternoon trading.  Shares of automaker Tesla slumped 8.1 percent, extending recent losses, following a credit downgrade and news that officials are investigating a fatal crash and fire in California.  Countering those losses were gains for defensive sectors such as consumer staples, real estate, and telecom .  The U.S. economy slowed less than previously expected in the final months of 2017 as consumer spending saw its biggest quarterly gain in three years. GDP expanded at an 2.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2017, ahead of the previously reported 2.5 percent, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.  Robust economic data could open the door to more aggressive interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year.  \u201cI think there is general consensus that the economy is doing good and that number proves it, but it\u2019s always difficult to know what\u2019s already in the stock market versus what people are anticipating,\u201d said Tuz. \u201cI get the sense that people are nervous right now.\u201d  Stocks had shot up earlier in the week as comments from officials in United States and China implied the world\u2019s two largest economies would renegotiate tariffs and trade imbalances, averting a dreaded trade war.

Amazon is also striving to make inroads in Brazil, where it recently opened its fifth and biggest fulfillment center in the country, with 100,000 square meters (1,076,391 sq ft).

Chiyomi Brent, described as a picker who fills orders at Amazon\u2019s San Francisco Fulfillment Center, filed a lawsuit on June 11 contending the world\u2019s largest online retailer has put workers at \u201cneedless risk.\u201d The lawsuit alleges unsafe practices such as having workers share equipment such as freezer suits and failing to allow extra time for safe social distancing.  The attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment, and Amazon and the other agencies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Schulman refused to issue a preliminary injunction that would have closed the warehouse until more precautions were taken. He said Brent had failed to show risk of imminent harm and her concerns would be better handled by government investigators.  SFDPH told Schulman that Amazon\u2019s practices at the San Francisco facility had improved between visits on July 7 and July 16, while Cal\/OSHA told the judge its investigation is ongoing following a July 14 inspection.  The attorney general\u2019s office told the court last week that its statewide Amazon investigation, which dates back to at least May, also is ongoing.  Amazon faced criticism for working conditions in its warehouses even before the coronavirus hit, and in April was accused of firing three critics of its pandemic response.  U.S. consumers have come to rely on Amazon to shop online and avoid the coronavirus, which has killed more than 146,00 Americans.  Amazon has argued in court papers that it has taken many steps to protect workers at the San Francisco facility, including requiring masks and extensively disinfecting equipment such as freezer suits. Amazon and SFDPH told the court that no coronavirus cases had been linked to the facility.  New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019s office sent a letter to Amazon in April saying the online retailer may have violated safety measures and labor practices during the pandemic. The letter came after Amazon terminated Christian Smalls, a critic of the company\u2019s warehouse conditions in the pandemic, for violating a paid quarantine.","977":"MEXICO CITY, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa announced on Thursday that it would partner with Amazon to distribute original content on the e-commerce giant\u2019s video streaming platform.

Ocado shares leapt as much as 15% in early Friday trading as investors welcomed the latest partnership for the British company, whose technology deals have become more important than its original business of selling food online.  \u201cGiven that Japan must have plenty of rival automated robotic warehouse providers, this is quite a coup for the business,\u201d said independent retail analyst Nick Bubb.  Internet grocery shopping has yet to take off in Japan, where consumers still often buy fresh produce on a daily basis. But growing numbers of working women and improved technology and logistics networks are expected to change that.  Aeon\u2019s rival Seiyu, operated by U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc, launched an online grocery venture with e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc in 2018, aiming to compete with the likes of Amazon Fresh.  Aeon, which operates more than 21,000 stores and has about 100 million customers, plans to harness Ocado\u2019s robotic warehouses, which it calls customer fulfillment centers (CFCs), and its software to create a distribution network serving the whole of the Japanese market.  The partnership anticipates Aeon will have an online grocery sales capacity of about 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion) by 2030 and 1 trillion yen by 2035.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Initial CFCs will serve Japan\u2019s Kanto region, with the first planned to go live in 2023, followed by others over the next two years.  Aeon will also use Ocado\u2019s product-picking software within parts of its existing store network, and offer click-and-collect services from selected sites.  The Japanese firm did not say how much it was paying Ocado, but said the agreement included upfront fees, in addition to later payments which will depend on sales performance and capacity installation.  \u201cWe see Ocado as a state-of-the-art, exciting and transformative partner aligned with our strategy of accelerating Aeon\u2019s digital shift to serve Japan\u2019s consumers,\u201d said Aeon CEO Motoya Okada.  The deal is Ocado\u2019s first in Asia.  While Ocado\u2019s retail business has only a 1.4% share of Britain\u2019s grocery market, its technology has powered the group\u2019s 8.4 billion pound ($10.8 billion) stock market valuation, enabling it to win partnership deals with supermarket groups including Kroger in the United States and Casino in France.  Ocado said it expected an additional 25 million pounds ($32.1 million) of operating costs in its fiscal 2020 year to implement the Aeon deal.  In February, Ocado and Marks & Spencer agreed a 1.5-billion-pound joint venture, signaling the end of Ocado\u2019s long running supply contract with upmarket supermarket chain Waitrose in September 2020.","981":"Nov 25 (Reuters) - Synchrony Financial said on Monday it was investigating the cause of a notification sent erroneously to some customers regarding the financial services company\u2019s co-branded card with Amazon.com Inc.

That compares with the 7 percent gain at stores in the same cities that do not have the banks of lockers, inMarket said.  Amazon shoppers, including those seeking to avoid \u201cporch pirate\u201d package thefts, can choose to have their orders sent to a locker for one-time use at no additional cost. Amazon sends the customer the locker number and a unique code to open it and collect their package.  The firm studied 98 stores in the New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Francisco, Washington, Houston, Boston and Atlanta metro areas. Some 76 stores, or about 16 percent the chain\u2019s 473 stores, had lockers.  People who stop at Whole Foods to retrieve a package from an Amazon locker could be tempted to buy a drink, milk or a promoted item, said experts, who added that the trips are also a way for the retailer to keep shoppers abreast of changes at the chain.  \u201cThere\u2019s a serendipity and immediacy to the in-store experience,\u201d said Todd Dipaola, chief executive and founder of inMarket, which analyzes anonymous location data from the mobile devices of 50 million U.S. consumers.  \u201cAs good as delivery is getting - one-day delivery, sometimes one-hour delivery - that still can\u2019t compete with the one-second immediacy of being in store and picking up that avocado that I\u2019m about to make guacamole out of because I thought about it in that moment,\u201d Dipaola said.  Micro visits have accounted for about 9 percent of all visits to grocery sellers so far this year, with Whole Foods lagging at 6.5 percent, inMarket said.  Representatives from Amazon and Whole Foods did not comment.  Whole Foods can drive impulse sales by placing products adjacent to lockers and providing quick and easy payment options, such as self-checkout, said Stewart Samuel, program director for IGD Services. He added that the chain already has tested an impulse\/food-to-go area within a larger store in New York.  \u201cWhile this would be additional volume for Whole Foods Market, the impact on the convenience store channel overall would be negligible,\u201d Samuel said.

REUTERS\/Aly Song  Qualcomm provides the chips for so-called infotainment systems as well as dashboard displays, but is also trying to fight its way into the market for self-driving car systems as they emerge.  Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon told Reuters in an interview ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that the company\u2019s backlog of design wins - that is, instances where carmakers plan to include Qualcomm\u2019s chip in future vehicles - has reached $5.5 billion, up slightly from the $5 billion Qualcomm officials disclosed last year.  The reach into the automotive market is important for Qualcomm because its biggest chip market - mobile phones - is stagnating, though Qualcomm also said on Monday that the number of device makers working on 5G devices to be released in 2019 has grown to 30 from 20, with most of them smartphones.  In fending off a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Inc AVGO.O last year, Qualcomm promised investors it would look to new markets like automobiles for future revenue growth. The effort became more critical after Chinese regulators scuttled Qualcomm's planned $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O last summer.  Qualcomm will sell three levels of car computing platforms, from entry-level to expensive: Performance, Premiere and Paramount. Amon said the intention is to provide a budget-friendly option to automakers so they can put more complex computing systems into ever-cheaper cars.  On some of the most inexpensive cars where automakers struggle to earn healthy profit, revenue generated from selling services to drivers over those computers could bring in extra revenue for automakers, Amon said.  \u201cWe are going to have a tier of products for every single kind of car.

Amazon\u2019s 35 percent surge in 2018 has pushed its market capitalization up to $770 billion, equivalent to 3 percent of the S&P 500 and close behind Apple\u2019s nearly 4 percent share of the index.  Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet have grown their collective market value by more than 40 percent in the past year to $3 trillion, and they now account for a quarter of the Nasdaq Composite Index.  Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a \u201ccrowded trade,\u201d a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big momentum trade, investors don\u2019t care if they\u2019re paying 15 or 20 or even 50 times earnings,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Rourke, Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading. \u201cThe problem is, once those names start giving up those gains, then the market starts to have problems.\u201d  Investors have been attracted to those stocks for good reason: Amazon\u2019s revenue ballooned 31 percent to $178 billion last year, while Netflix is expected by analysts on average to more than double its net income to $1.2 billion in 2018.  An expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday may not have a strong effect on technology companies, which generally rely less than other kinds of companies on debt.  The S&P 500 information technology index dipped by an average of 0.3 percent in the five-session period following the Fed\u2019s four most recent rate hikes, in line with S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Investors nervous about how much longer a nine-year bull market can last have favored big tech names as among the most reliable on the stock market because their business models are often viewed as disruptive and less susceptible to economic downturns, at least over the long run.  The popularity of Amazon, which is pushing beyond online retail and cloud computing into supermarkets and even healthcare, has left it trading at 167 times expected earnings, up from around 100 a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. By comparison, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings.  \u201cIf you ask anyone right now, if it\u2019s a business owner they\u2019ll say they\u2019re afraid of Amazon. If they\u2019re an investor, they\u2019ll tell you Amazon is going up forever,\u201d said Andrew Bodner, president of Double Diamond Investment Group in Parsippany, New Jersey.  \u201cOverall, it creates more volatility for the market because everyone owns Amazon, and if Amazon goes down you\u2019ll see that reflected,\u201d Bodner said.  Investors\u2019 increased reliance on passively managed index funds has also contributed to the rally in technology shares because the companies\u2019 inclusion in the S&P 500 and other indexes means money will be poured into them even if they have expensive earnings multiples, O\u2019Rourke said.  Momentum for some major technology stocks is already showing signs of moderation. Facebook has fallen 5 percent after hitting a record high at the start of February, with some investors worried that people are spending less time on the social media platform.  Posing a potential threat to the rally, the S&P 500 technology index is trading at a relatively expensive 18.8 times expected earnings, 12 percent above its 15-year average, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.  While S&P 500 information technology earnings per share are expected to grow by a healthy 17.5 percent this year, that\u2019s less than last year\u2019s 20.8 percent surge and lower than the 19.5 percent earnings expansion expected for the entire S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Technology companies may be benefiting more modestly than others from corporate tax cuts enacted this year, according to CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Even as the S&P 500 wavered over worries that President Donald Trump might spark a trade war, the Nasdaq on Monday closed at a record high, more than bouncing back from a deep selloff across Wall Street only a month ago.  \u201cPeople are going with what works, and if tech was working before the shakeout in February, then they\u2019re going to stay in it,\u201d said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.","994":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos on Thursday challenged retailers to hike their minimum wages to $16 an hour, prompting a comeback from Walmart Inc which asked its rivals to pay taxes.  \u201cToday I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our $15 minimum wage,\u201d the billionaire entrepreneur said in a letter to shareholders.  \u201cDo it! Better yet, go to $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us.\u201d  The online retailer raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees from November, giving in to critics of poor pay and working conditions at the company.  Some critics have said the hike was insufficient and note that Amazon paid zero U.S. federal income tax on more than $11 billion in profits before taxes in 2018, and received a $129 million tax rebate from the federal government.  Walmart\u2019s executive vice president of corporate affairs, Dan Bartlett, responded to Bezos by tweeting, \u201cHey retail competitors out there (you know who you are) how about paying your taxes?\u201d  Walmart, which has raised its minimum wage twice since 2015, pays an entry wage of $11 per hour. CEO Doug McMillon has said Walmart\u2019s average U.S. hourly wage is $17.50 including bonuses based on store performance, and excluding healthcare benefits.  The two retailers, which are fierce rivals, rarely go after one another other publicly.  Amazon\u2019s wage hike came as U.S. unemployment was at a near two-decade low, with retailers and shippers competing for hundreds of thousands of workers for the all-important holiday shopping season.  Bezos said in his letter that the wage hike has benefited more than 250,000 Amazon employees and over 100,000 seasonal employees who worked during the last holiday season at Amazon sites in the United States.  Amazon\u2019s third party sales in 2018 accounted for 58 percent of total sales, up from 56 percent in 2017, Bezos said.  Amazon has said that it pays all the required taxes in every country where it operates, including $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years.  \u201cCorporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits remain modest given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business,\u201d according to recent Amazon statements.","995":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * UPS gains on quarterly profit beat  * Exxon posts first annual loss as publicly listed company  * Amazon, Alphabet among top boosts to S&P 500  * Indexes: Dow 1.27%, S&P 1.29%, Nasdaq 1.36% (Updates to market open)  Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes rose on Tuesday, building on the previous session\u2019s momentum, as investors anticipated strong results from Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet while also looking for signs of progress on a pandemic relief package.

FILE PHOTO: An employee of Amazon walks through a turnstile gate inside an Amazon Fulfillment Centre (BLR7) on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS\/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  As a result, both Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon are scrambling to reconfigure ownership structures and re-jig some key vendor relationships and agreements before the rules come into effect on Friday.  What is the issue?  At the heart of the problem is India\u2019s view on the two e-commerce models that exist today: marketplace and inventory.  * India allows 100 percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in the marketplace model of e-commerce, which it defines as a tech platform that connects buyers and sellers.  * New Delhi has not allowed FDI in inventory-driven models of e-commerce. The inventory model, which Walmart and Amazon use in the United States, is where the goods and services are owned by an e-commerce firm that sells directly to retail customers.  * The restriction is aimed largely at protecting India\u2019s vast unorganized retail sector that does not have the clout to purchase at scale and offer big discounts.  * It means that Amazon and Flipkart can only operate the marketplace model in India. Both companies have wholesale units that bulk purchase goods and sell them to vendors listed on their platform. These vendors in turn sell to retail customers.  What are the restrictions on controlling inventory?  * Existing regulations state that e-commerce firms cannot exercise ownership over the goods sold on their online marketplace.  * Both Amazon and Flipkart developed complicated seller structures that helped them comply with the inventory control rule while exercising some level of control over inventory.  * Traders and small online sellers have accused Amazon and Flipkart of violating the spirit of the law and of using the structures to offer deep discounts, accusations they deny.  * The new rules state that the inventory of a seller or vendor will be seen as being controlled by a marketplace if the vendor purchases more than 25 percent of its inventory from the marketplace, or any of its group firms.  * The rule would not allow sellers on Flipkart and Amazon to make bulk purchases from the wholesale units of the companies.  * The new regulation replaces a rule that said an e-commerce firm could not permit one vendor\u2019s retail sales to overshoot 25 percent of the overall sales of the marketplace by value in a fiscal year.  What are the equity interest restrictions?  * The rules now bar any entity in which an e-commerce firm or its group companies have a stake from selling on their online platform.  * This is a problem for Amazon, which had been picking up stakes in offline Indian retailers to boost its market share.  * The U.S. company\u2019s investment arm owns a 5 percent stake in Indian department store chain Shopper\u2019s Stop. Through an investment vehicle it also picked up a stake in the More retail chain. Amazon also owns a minority stake in the parent companies of Cloudtail and Appario, even though it does not have a direct stake on either of the two sellers.  What are the other rules?  * The government has also prohibited e-commerce firms from pushing merchants to sell any product exclusively on its platform. The sellers can, however, choose to have a preferred online partner.  * Amazon and Flipkart launch products such as smartphones exclusively on their online portals and apps. While such arrangements may continue, e-commerce firms are unlikely to use the word \u201cexclusive\u201d anymore and will likely re-negotiate contracts to give brands more freedom to sell elsewhere.  * The new rules also stipulate that an e-commerce marketplace, as well as any companies the marketplace has equity stakes in, should provide services such as fulfillment, logistics and payments to all sellers on the platform in a fair manner.  * Providing such services to one seller and not to others in similar circumstances would be deemed as unfair and discriminatory, according to the rules.","998":"(Reuters) - Kroger Co projected annual profit below Wall Street estimates on Thursday, as the grocer spends billions of dollars on modernizing its stores and delivery to compete better with Walmart and Amazon.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned 48 cents per share, below analysts\u2019 estimates of 52 cents.  Revenue fell to $28.09 billion, missing estimates of $28.38 billion, mainly due to higher gas prices that discouraged customers from buying fuel.

The move comes as rival Amazon is boosting profits by letting merchants pay for high placement in its search results. Its ad sales and other revenue jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.  About 300 million shoppers visit Walmart\u2019s stores every month, and millions make online purchases on its website, according to Forrester Research.

Trade marketing, typically used by packaged goods manufacturers to target shoppers, are moving to Amazon, according to analysts.

Kennedy Library in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., June 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Katherine Taylor\/File Photo  Amazon poured a record $1.5 million into a Super PAC run by the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to back a slate of candidates in the Nov. 5 council elections viewed as pro-business, or at least more corporate friendly than the incumbent council majority.  Amazon, the world\u2019s leading online retailer whose chief executive is billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, accounted for more than half of nearly $2.7 million raised by the Super PAC, a group allowed to accept unlimited sums from wealthy donors in support of their favorite candidates. Four years ago, Amazon donated $25,000.  By comparison, labor unions spent more than $1 million on the council race.  The unprecedented level of spending in a Seattle municipal race drew national attention, with Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders accusing Amazon of trying to buy the council.  The outcome for most of the seven council seats at stake in Tuesday\u2019s election was too close to call until Friday night, when a tally of 97 percent of votes cast showed that progressive candidates had won five of the seats, including two incumbents.  One of them was Kshama Sawant, a self-described socialist and Amazon\u2019s fiercest critic on the council, whose re-election bid was seen as the bellwether contest.  Just two of the seven candidates endorsed by Amazon and other companies through the chamber\u2019s Super Pac emerged winners, one of them an incumbent.  The overall progressive balance of the nine-seat council was little changed. Two other seats come up for re-election in 2021.  HOUSING CRISIS  \u201cThe election results are a repudiation of the billionaire class, corporate real estate, and the establishment,\u201d Sawant said at a press conference on Saturday, flanked by supporters holding a \u201cTax Amazon\u201d banner.  Sawant led the council in May 2018 in approving a new per-employee \u201chead tax\u201d on 500 of the city\u2019s largest companies, aimed at combating a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs.  The tax was designed to raise at least $45 million a year to build more affordable housing and help support a homeless population that is the third-largest of any U.S. metropolitan area.  The measure passed the council unanimously, despite threats from Amazon, Seattle\u2019s largest employer, to freeze planned expansions in the city.  But just four weeks later, the council repealed the tax altogether in the face of a well-financed campaign by Amazon and other businesses to mount a referendum drive against the measure.  On Saturday, Sawant characterized the latest election as a referendum on the head tax and pledged to pursue the policy with the new council.  Its backers argue that Seattle\u2019s biggest businesses should contribute to easing a shortage of low-cost housing they helped create through an over-heated real estate market that left many working poor and middle-class families unable to afford to live in the city.  Opponents have branded the measure a \u201ctax on jobs\u201d that would spark an economic backlash.  Corporate reaction to the election outcome was muted.  \u201cThe business community stands ready to work with the new Seattle City Council,\u201d the PAC\u2019s director, Markham McIntyre, said in a statement on Friday. \u201cHow our local government chooses to partner \u2013 or create division \u2013 matters.\u201d  On Wednesday, before the outcome was known, Amazon said it was \u201cpleased with the direction\u201d of the election and looked forward \u201cto working with the new city council, which we believe will be considerably more open to constructive dialogue.\u201d  Amazon has since not responded to further requests for comment.","1007":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's anti-trust regulator has approved U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc's WMT.N $16 billion acquisition of online marketplace Flipkart, beefing up the competition to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in the fast growing e-commerce market.

The acquisition of Bengaluru-headquartered Flipkart will give Walmart, which runs 21 cash-and-carry stores in India, a stronger foothold in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy where it has struggled to expand in the last decade, partly due to restrictions around foreign investment in bricks-and-mortar retail.

Speaking at the annual shareholder meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc conglomerate, Buffett maintained that healthcare is a \u201ctapeworm\u201d on American businesses, hurting their ability to compete with rivals in other countries.  While there is no guarantee the venture between Amazon.com, Berkshire and JPMorgan, which collectively employ more than 1 million people, will succeed, Buffett said it is well positioned to try.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a CEO within a couple of months,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cWe want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost ... The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.\u201d  Amazon.com\u2019s reputation as a disruptor prompted investors in January, when the venture was announced, to sell shares of companies that might be hurt.  These included drugmakers, health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) such as CVS Health Corp and Express Scripts Holding Co.  Buffett said the goal was to challenge the entire healthcare industry, not individual segments.  Yet Charlie Munger, Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman, suggested that Democrats could take over Congress after November\u2019s elections and push for a national healthcare system financed by a single payer. Munger predicted that such a change would harm drug benefit managers.  \u201cI suspect that eventually, when Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, that we will get single-payer medical care, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much more friendly than any of the PBMs,\u201d Munger said.  Buffett, famed for his love of junk food, has said spiraling healthcare costs are responsible for 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, up from 5 percent in 1960, and he wants to slash a few percentage points off.  \u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Buffett said.

The European Commission has been seeking feedback from retailers and manufacturers since September last year, one of several competition enforcers taking a deeper look into Amazon\u2019s business practices amidst calls by some for its break-up.  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has said the issue is about a company hosting merchants on its site and at the same time competing with those same retailers by using their data for its own sales.  Merchants have complained about harm caused by Amazon copies of their products.  Politico first reported the investigation last week.  The Commission had been struggling to define the market in which Amazon operates in order to identify where the competitive harm could have been, other sources said. They said the issue was whether to look at Amazon in the overall retail market or in its own niche.  The EU competition enforcer, which can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  This would not be Amazon\u2019s first run-in with the Commission. Two years ago, it was told to pay back taxes of about 250 million euros to Luxembourg because of illegal tax benefits. That same year it settled with the regulator over its distribution deals with e-book publishers in Europe.

FILE PHOTO: Shoppers cross the road in Oxford Street, in London, Britain August 14, 2016. REUTERS\/Peter Nicholls\/File Photo  The figures gave little obvious sign that either the possibility of a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 or a fall in sterling over the summer had dealt a visible blow to consumer spending, which has solidly supported British growth in recent years.  Monthly retail sales volumes dipped by 0.2%, the Office for National Statistics said, compared with an average forecast for a flat reading in a Reuters poll of economists and the first fall in three months.  \u201cNo cause for alarm,\u201d economist Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note to clients. \u201cThe modest fall in retail sales volumes does not change the overall picture of solid momentum in household spending.\u201d  British consumers appear to have largely taken the prospect of leaving the European Union in their stride, helped by weaker inflation and stronger growth in wages that are now rising at their fastest rate in more than a decade.  On Thursday the boss of Next NXT.L, one of Britain's biggest clothing retailers, reported a rise in profits and told Reuters that disappointing sales in recent weeks appeared to reflect unusually warm weather, rather than Brexit jitters.  The category of \u2018non-store retailing\u2019 - predominantly online shopping - dropped by 3.2%, the biggest decline since August 2015, and came a month after Amazon held its annual \u2018Prime Day\u2019 promotion which helped boost sales by 7.6% the previous month.  Compared with August 2018, sales were up by 2.7%, slowing from growth of 3.4% in July and again the weakest since May. The Reuters poll had pointed to annual sales growth of 2.9%.  Looking at the three months to August as a whole, sales rose 3.3% on an annual basis, broadly in line with their average over the past year, and there was no market reaction to the data.  The figures broadly chimed with a British Retail Consortium survey that showed spending in August was flat on a year earlier, as shoppers cut non-essential spending.  But the picture is less bleak than that presented by the Confederation of British Industry, which said its members reported the biggest fall since 2008 in its gauge of retail sales in August, as sentiment crumbled in the sector.  Many businesses are more cautious than consumers as Britain\u2019s political crisis drags on, and fear that a no-deal Brexit could lead to significant disruption to imports of fresh food and other goods.  Department store and supermarket operator John Lewis said last week a possible no-deal Brexit could worsen already difficult trading conditions after first-half operating losses at the group\u2019s department stores widened and that the impact could be \u201csignificant\u201d.  Separately on Thursday the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, its economy was likely to be 2% smaller than otherwise in 2020-2021, pointing towards a recession, even if its exit is relatively well managed.","1016":"FILE PHOTO: Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and Blue Origin speaks during the JFK Space Summit, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, at the John F.

In fiscal 2017, U.S. public schools lost $1.8 billion across 28 states through corporate tax incentives over which most schools themselves had little or no control.  The 10 most affected states could hire more than 28,000 new teachers if they were able to use the lost revenues, according to a report to be released by Good Jobs First, a left-leaning Washington think tank.  The report comes amid increased taxpayer scrutiny of such deals in the wake of Amazon\u2019s nationwide, year-long search for its \u201cHQ2\u201d site.  Though conducted mostly in secret, the search was still a public spectacle, pitting state against state in a bidding war and raising questions about transparency and the efficacy of such subsidies for a company run by the richest man in the world.  Amazon decided last month to build two new headquarters at $5 billion each in New York City and Arlington, Virginia, saying it will hire up to 50,000 people altogether.  States and cities have long used abatements, subsidies and other tax incentives to lure companies, keep them from leaving or encourage them to expand.  Such deals are meant to boost development and investment, and proponents of the agreements say the lost tax revenue is worth it because they grow local economies.  But it can be hard to know if the benefits outweigh the burdens, and until recently it has been difficult to discern how much one entity lost because of another entity\u2019s tax breaks.  However, a new governmental accounting rule issued in August 2015 now requires local U.S. governments to report how much money they lose on corporate tax breaks for development projects - their own, or another nearby governmental entity.  Good Jobs examined the first full year of reporting for most of the school districts, which are particularly affected because most of their revenues come from property taxes - yet they usually have little influence over subsidies granted by the cities or counties where they are located.  \u201cCities say they care about economic development, but then they end up granting subsidies in a way that cuts out control by school boards, parents and others,\u201d said Good Jobs\u2019 Scott Klinger, who authored the report.  Good Jobs reviewed financial reports from fiscal 2017 for more than 5,600 of the nation\u2019s 13,500 independent school districts.  Of the five districts that lost the most, three are in Louisiana. Together, they lost more than $158 million, or at least $2,500 for each student enrolled.  More than half of the districts did not report any such losses - in many cases because the new accounting rule appeared to have been \u201csimply ignored,\u201d the report said.  In Oregon\u2019s Washington County, Intel Corp and Genentech Inc have both been getting a property tax exemption on capital projects for years. Its Hillsboro School District lost nearly $97 million in fiscal 2017, more than any district in the country, the report found.  The School District of Philadelphia, which only last year regained control from state officials after climbing out of a deep fiscal crisis, lost the second most revenue at $62 million.  Schools\u2019 lost revenues are often offset by state funding formulas, but \u201cthey seldom make school districts anywhere near whole\u201d and are ultimately \u201ca transfer of money from districts with few abatements to those where abatements are common,\u201d the report said.

The reversal relieved shoppers who had complained since July about being locked out of the much larger range of offerings they had grown accustomed to on the U.S. site following the opening of Amazon\u2019s local platform a year ago.

Amazon must limit deliveries in France to IT products, health items, food and pet food, the Court of Appeal said, upholding a previous order for the firm to curtail shipments while it improves its health protocols.  The decision is a blow for thousands of small businesses that sell through Amazon, and comes as firms across Europe are trying to figure out how to let staff safely return to offices and factories once coronavirus restrictions are eased.  The unions called the verdict as a \u201cDavid against Goliath\u201d moment, at a time when Amazon is seeing a surge in demand but also facing labour unrest on both sides of the Atlantic over its handling of deliveries during the pandemic.  \u201cJust because this is a giant U.S. company, it doesn\u2019t mean it should not have to make efforts during this crisis. It is not above the law,\u201d said Laurent Degousee of France\u2019s Sud union.  The ruling \u201cis also a warning to other companies, whether they are still operational or not, or looking to restart their activities,\u201d he said.  Amazon\u2019s six warehouses in France, where goods are packed up and dispatched and which staff had complained were too crowded, have been shut since April 16, after the initial court ruling last week curtailing the scope of deliveries.  The U.S. group had argued that defining essential goods such as health products was too complex and that it did not want to risk fines.  It said it would extend the closures until April 28 with staff receiving full pay, and that it was assessing how to operate following the court\u2019s decision.

Unions said they were negotiating with Amazon to try to find a compromise, including health protocols they are satisfied with, so that operations can resume - albeit with fewer staff deployed at once.  Amazon has said its safety measures were adequate, and that it had made hand gel and face masks available to workers.  VENDORS STUCK  The spat has accentuated losses for some French businesses that were still managing to sell and ship through Amazon.  \u201cIt\u2019s been horrendous,\u201d said Yannick Jan, whose stationery company on the outskirts of Paris has been trying to handle 600 orders a day from its own premises, rather than the usual 80, since the Amazon warehouses shut.  Jan\u2019s monthly sales were already on the wane due to the pandemic. Skyrocketing shipment costs were now eating into margins, he said.

A spokesman for Amazon, which has been butting heads with the city for two years over attempts to levy more taxes on the company, declined to comment.  \u201cWhat they are proposing is likely an unconstitutional backdoor ban on U.S. companies speaking about local elections,\u201d Jim Manley, an attorney with the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, told Reuters.  The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling struck down limits on political contributions by corporations or unions. Companies and unions may not give money directly to campaigns but may spend unlimited amounts on ads and other means.  The legislation before the Seattle City Council says that companies that have at least 5% of their shares held by foreigners, or 1% by a single foreigner, are subject to foreign influence and therefore cannot participate in elections.  Amazon\u2019s $1.5 million political donation for Seattle\u2019s November elections represented more than half of the nearly $2.7 million raised by a Super Pac for those elections. Four years ago, Amazon donated $25,000.  Super Pacs may accept unlimited contributions from any non-foreign source.  Amazon began to prominently flex its political muscle in May 2018 when the Seattle council approved an employee \u201chead tax\u201d on the city\u2019s largest companies, in order to combat a housing crisis. Just four weeks later, the City Council repealed the tax after a coalition of businesses, with Amazon at the forefront, mounted a well-financed campaign for a referendum to repeal the tax.  Socialist council member Kshama Sawant says she will restart the \u201cTax Amazon\u201d campaign she led in 2018 with a rally at City Hall on Monday.  Seattle is not the first city to take aim at campaign spending. St. Petersburg, Florida, approved a similar ordinance on foreign-influenced corporations in 2017 that has not yet been challenged in court.","1029":"March 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is offering higher pay to recruit its own warehouse employees to pick and pack Whole Foods groceries amid rising demand and a worker shortage, according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters.  This move, known as labor sharing, highlights how the ecommerce giant is reallocating some of its vast workforce to handle a spike in online sales of groceries, as millions of American are stuck at home amid the COVID-19 outbreak.  Amazon offers online grocery services through Amazon Fresh from its own grocery warehouses, and Amazon Prime Now, which delivers from its Whole Foods stores.  \u201cThe Prime Now business has seen a mass increase in volume and is now offering labor share opportunities,\u201d Amazon said in a message sent to warehouse workers in Maryland, which was reviewed by Reuters. Workers in other states where Amazon operates grocery services have received similar communications, including California, Nevada, and Tennessee.  Employees who are selected to make the switch can make $19 per hour, a $2 raise on top of the pay hike Amazon announced earlier this month.

FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a poster of Reliance Industries installed outside the venue of the company's annual general meeting in Mumbai June 7, 2012. REUTERS\/Vivek Prakash  As part of the 10-year alliance, Jio will build data centers across India that will be hosted on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders at the company annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.  \u201cWe now have the capability to develop truly India-native solutions, including speech recognition and natural language understanding for all major Indian languages and dialects,\u201d said Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man with a net worth of $46.2 billion according to Forbes.  Reliance\u2019s foray into the cloud services market - essentially selling computer services such as website hosting and data storage - could intensify competition in an Indian market dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS), say analysts.  Ambani disrupted India\u2019s telecoms industry in late 2016 when he launched Jio with free voice and cut-price data plans, pushing some rivals out of business and forcing others to match tariffs and consolidate in a crowded sector that once comprised more than 10 carriers.  \u201cOther cloud players like AWS and Google will have to come up with new, perhaps cheaper pricing models for India,\u201d said Satyajit Sinha, an analyst at tech consultancy Counterpoint.  Ambani has always dubbed Jio a technology company, and used it to launch internet-enabled devices, deliver entertainment services, build fiber broadband and develop other offerings.  The Reliance-Microsoft partnership could help Jio extend its services to India\u2019s booming start-up ecosystem.  On Monday, addressing Reliance shareholders via a recorded video message, Microsoft\u2019s Indian-born Chief Executive Satya Nadella said: \u201cTogether, we will offer comprehensive technology solutions \u2013 from compute and storage, to connectivity and productivity \u2013 to small and medium businesses everywhere in the country.\u201d  PRICE WAR  Jio would provide free connectivity and cloud infrastructure to start-ups, Ambani said, adding the company would offer a \u201cbundle of connectivity, productivity and automation tools\u201d to micro, small and medium business for as little as 1,500 rupees ($21.05) a month.  \u201cThis pricing of elementary services is really the rock bottom price,\u201d said Naveen Mishra, of tech researcher Gartner.  Rivals such as Amazon Web Services and Google offer similar services at multiple times that price, and technology analysts said Ambani\u2019s move could spark a price war in the Indian cloud market, expected to grow at an average 23% annually over the next five years to touch $5.6 billion.  Amazon\u2019s cloud services unit declined to comment on the matter. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \u201cWe definitely will reassess whether we should keep using AWS or something else, because storage is a huge cost,\u201d said Aprameya Radhakrishna, the founder and CEO of Vokal, an audio-video knowledge-sharing platform similar to Quora.  \u201cIndia is a price conscious nation in general and anything which is competing on price will definitely get attention.\u201d  Reliance\u2019s big push into cloud services also comes as India, one of the world\u2019s fastest growing web services markets, is framing a data privacy law, drafts of which have emphasized storage of key consumer data locally.  The country's central bank has also asked foreign firms such as Mastercard MA.N and Visa V.N to store payments data solely in India.  \"Companies that have a fairly mature IT adoption or those that are playing with a lot of Indian consumer data, they might prefer to move to (Reliance) because this data is guaranteed to be stored locally,\" said Krishna Iyer, an independent technology advisor who was previously a senior executive at cloud services firm Akamai Technologies AKAM.O.","1031":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O shares seesawed on Thursday as investors questioned how the impending divorce of company founder Jeff Bezos would affect his control of the most valuable company on Wall Street and its ambitious expansion plans.  Bezos, whom Forbes lists as the world\u2019s richest person, worth an estimated $136.2 billion, said via Twitter on Wednesday that he and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, will divorce. Amazon shares were down 0.5 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday, after gaining earlier in the session.  The split throws into question how the couple will split their fortune, which includes an approximately 16 percent ownership stake in Amazon\u2019s roughly $811.4 billion market capitalization. Divorce laws in Washington state, where they live, hold that property acquired during a marriage is generally divided equally between spouses.  Most analysts and fund managers are largely sanguine and say the divorce will not lead to any significant change in the company\u2019s leadership or its growth prospects.  Prominent short-seller Doug Kass, however, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners, said he sold his stake in Amazon on news of the divorce. That was after initially buying a stake in late December and naming Amazon among his \u201cbest ideas list.\u201d  \u201cIs it premature to ask what happens to Amazon when Jeff Bezos chooses to turn over the day-to-day running of the company he founded?\u201d he said. \u201cHis announced divorce gives me pause for thought.\u201d  The couple has multiple residences across the country, so there is a possibility the divorce could be filed in a state where marital property is not presumed to be divided equally.  New York matrimonial lawyer Bernard Clair said in that case a judge would likely determine MacKenzie Bezos\u2019 share of Amazon stock based on her contribution to her husband\u2019s success, which could include helping him make important business decisions or raising their children so he could focus on work.  Any transfer of Jeff Bezos\u2019 stock would be subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements. As an officer and director at the company, Bezos could be required to file an SEC Form 4 within two business days of any transfer, though former SEC lawyer Broc Romanek noted a provision of U.S. securities laws exempts share transfers made pursuant to a domestic relations order.  Even if Bezos were exempted from filing a Form 4, he would be required to update promptly the record of his Amazon holdings on file with the SEC if his position in the company changed by 1 percent or more, said D.C. securities lawyer Thomas Gorman. MacKenzie Bezos would also need to file a similar record if she received more than 5 percent of Amazon stock.  Peter Henning, a securities law professor at Wayne State University, noted that Amazon, unlike fellow tech giants Facebook Inc. FB.O and Google Inc GOOGL.O, does not give its founder's shares greater voting rights. If MacKenzie Bezos is given a large block of shares, she could have a big say at the company.  Gorman agreed. \u201cShe could wind up with some sort of control block, and get herself a directorship,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on what she wants to do.\u201d  Any effort to dilute MacKenzie Bezos\u2019 voting rights by creating a separate class of shares would require a shareholder vote, said Gorman, though he added that he thought such a move unlikely.

REUTERS\/Danny Moloshok  \u201cNobody wants to run their divorce through a shareholder meeting,\u201d he said.  Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager of the Monetta fund, said that while he is not changing his investment in Amazon, he expects other growth-focused portfolio managers may trim their stakes due to concerns about the divorce\u2019s impact.  \u201cThis is such an over-owned company and this gives them an excuse to say \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll trim some back because it adds a new question mark\u2019,\u201d he said.  Bacarella, however, said he is not concerned because even if MacKenzie Bezos liquidated a stake that could be as high as 8 percent, there would be no fundamental reason behind the sale. Any impact would be short-term in nature.  \u201cUnless you worry that he will get so distracted by the divorce that he cannot manage the company, this will be a non-event,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cHe is given control of the company because shareholders like him and his vision, not because he has 50 percent of the stock.\u201d  Thomas Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said questions about the future of the company due to the divorce are legitimate due to Jeff Bezos\u2019 outsized influence on its value. Should he leave the company for any reason, its shares would likely immediately fall more than 10 percent, he said.  \u201cHis influence on the company is as a significant as if he had super-voting shares because of his track record and the way he runs the company as if he owned the whole thing,\u201d he said.","1032":"FILE PHOTO: 62nd Grammy Awards \u2013 Photo Room\u2013 Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 26, 2020 \u2013 Lizzo poses backstage with her Best Pop Solo Performance award for \"Truth Hurts\", Best Urban Contemporary Album for \"Cuz I Love You (Deluxe)\" and Best Traditional R&B Performance for \"Jerome\".

It wants Alexa to be a dominant computing platform like Microsoft Corp\u2019s MSFT.O Windows.  Amazon, at an event in Seattle, announced updated versions of its Echo Show, Echo Dot and Echo Plus, as well as new devices such as a voice-controlled microwave and wall clock. The new Echo Auto is designed to sit on a car\u2019s dashboard and give directions or play music, while plugged into a car\u2019s power outlet.  Shares of smart speaker company Sonos Inc SONO.O closed down 3.1 percent after Amazon announced a wireless Echo subwoofer and the $299.99 Echo Link Amp to control a home stereo system. By contrast, shares of U.S. security and alarm company ADT Inc ADT.N rose 6.6 percent after Amazon said its new Alexa Guard service could notify ADT professionals to disturbances in the home.  The new products underscore a strategic difference from Google and Apple, which so far have released fewer devices while Amazon has released many different gadgets for different purposes.  \u201cOne or more of these products is likely to resonate, but (it\u2019s) impossible to speculate today,\u201d Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said.

Asked if he wanted to make policy changes related to the company, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a very serious look at that.\u201d  The \u201csales tax situation\u201d was going to be looked at soon by the Supreme Court, he added.

The Justice Department filed a brief in support of South Dakota, which lost in lower courts.  Amazon is not involved in the case but the eventual ruling could have consequences for it and other e-commerce businesses. Amazon has already agreed to collect sales taxes in all 45 states that impose them on items it sells directly.  South Dakota argues that brick-and-mortar retailers suffer because they have to collect the taxes and therefore have a pricing disadvantage.

His lobbying allegations repeated a previous unsubstantiated attack on the newspaper, while White House officials in recent days have said no policy changes related to Amazon were currently planned.  The Washington Post is privately owned by Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive officer of the online retailer. Amazon does not own the Post.  Trump regularly lashes out against what he perceives as critical articles in the Post as well as the New York Times and CNN. On Thursday, he took issue with a headline in the Post on China retaliating with trade penalties against U.S. products.  \u201cThe Fake News Washington Post, Amazon\u2019s \u2018chief lobbyist,\u2019 has another (of many) phony headlines,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.

(GRAPHIC: Expensive tweets - tmsnrt.rs\/2GAsPNK )","1036":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O cloud computing arm is making an aggressive push into one of the most sensitive technology sectors: U.S. elections.  FILE PHOTO: The Amazon.com logo and stock price information is seen on screens at the Nasdaq Market Site in New York City, New York, U.S., September 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The expansion by Amazon Web Services into state and local elections has quietly gathered pace since the 2016 U.S. presidential vote. More than 40 states now use one or more of Amazon\u2019s election offerings, according to a presentation given by an Amazon executive this year and seen by Reuters.  So do America\u2019s two main political parties, the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and the U.S. federal body charged with administering and enforcing federal campaign finance laws.  While it does not handle voting on election day, AWS - along with a broad network of partners - now runs state and county election websites, stores voter registration rolls and ballot data, facilitates overseas voting by military personnel and helps provide live election-night results, according to company documents and interviews.  In the fullest public picture yet of Amazon\u2019s strategic move into U.S. election infrastructure, Reuters reviewed previously unreported company presentations and documents, and conducted more than two dozen interviews with lawmakers, election administrators, and heads of election security and technology in nearly a dozen states and counties that use Amazon\u2019s cloud.  Amazon pitches itself as a low-cost provider of secure election technology at a time when local officials and political campaigns are under intense pressure to prevent a repeat of 2016 presidential elections, which saw cyber-attacks on voting systems and election infrastructure.  \u201cThe fact that we have invested heavily in this area, it helps to attest to the fact that in over 40 states, the Amazon cloud is being trusted to power in some way, some aspect of elections,\u201d Michael Jackson, leader, Public Health & U.S. Elections at AWS, told prospective government clients in February via a presentation on a webinar, which was viewed by Reuters.  The company\u2019s efforts are welcomed by election administrators, who in interviews said they often struggle with keeping outdated systems up to date at the local level.  In Oregon, for example, the state\u2019s in-house servers that support election services shut down every time there is a power outage - an often occurrence as Oregon updates its electric grid, according to Peter Threlkel, chief information officer at the Oregon Secretary of State. A move to the cloud fixes that problem, and Oregon ran a pilot with AWS to move its voter registration system to the cloud, he said.  Some security experts like David O\u2019Berry, co-founder, Precog Security, said moving to AWS is \u201ca good option for campaigns, who do not have the resources to protect themselves.\u201d  Still, Amazon\u2019s growing presence in the elections business could undermine what many officials view as a strength of the U.S. voting system: decentralization.  Most security experts Reuters spoke to said that while Amazon\u2019s cloud is likely much harder to hack than systems it is replacing, putting data from many jurisdictions on a single system raises the prospect that a single major breach could prove damaging.  \u201cIt makes Amazon a bigger target\u201d for hackers, \u201cand also increases the challenge of dealing with an insider attack,\u201d said Chris Vickery, director of cyber risk research at cybersecurity startup Upguard.  A recent hack into Capital One Financial Corp's COF.N data stored on Amazon's cloud service was perpetrated by a former Amazon employee. The breach affected more than 100 million customers, underscoring how rogue employees or untrained workers can create security risks even if the underlying systems are secure. [nL2N24U1LH]  Amazon says its systems are reliable. \u201cOver time, states, counties, cities, and countries will leverage AWS services to ensure modernization of their elections for increased security, reliability, and analytics for an efficient and more effective use of taxpayer dollars,\u201d an AWS spokesperson told Reuters.  Amazon\u2019s push into the election business comes as the company faces criticism from politicians, labor unions and privacy advocates over its business practices and growing influence. President Donald Trump has accused the company of competing unfairly and repeatedly attacked the Washington Post, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, for alleged bias, a charge Bezos and the paper deny.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Amazon is forging ahead. It now powers the websites for the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), according to a source and election security experts.  The FEC, DNC and RNC declined comment. A person familiar with the DNC's plans said the committee has recently moved some data from AWS to Alphabet-owned Google GOOGL.O cloud but did not explain the reason for the shift.  Amazon has also won over major individual candidates, the executive leading the company\u2019s election push said earlier this year.  \u201cSome of the largest presidential, congressional and gubernatorial campaigns are also trusted to AWS,\u201d Amazon\u2019s Jackson told clients in the February webinar viewed by Reuters.  For example, Democratic Presidential frontrunner Joe Biden\u2019s online fundraising operations rely on AWS, a source with knowledge of the matter said. The Biden campaign did not respond to requests for comment. In the past, AWS powered the Obama for America campaign in 2012, the source added.  Reuters could not verify what cloud service the Trump campaign is using. It had no comment.  The privatization of voting infrastructure is part of a broader trend that has swept across nearly every aspect of government activities in America - from parking tickets to prisons - and continues under the Trump administration.  Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Azure, the biggest rival to AWS, has a sizeable government business and offers some election services but it has not focused on them and lags Amazon, according to companies who partner with both firms for government contracts. Microsoft declined to comment.  Amazon is also competing with traditional election technology vendors including Elections Systems & Software (ES&S) and Dominion Voting Systems Corp, which offer some similar services such as election night reporting and data storage, according to consultants.  An ES&S spokeswoman said the company has not seen any impact from Amazon\u2019s efforts. Dominion did not respond to requests for comment.  LESS THAN $100 TO SECURE ELECTION NIGHT  Voting itself does not happen via Amazon. Voting machines in most states are not connected to any cloud service.  But elections require a raft of other technologies to keep track of voters and provide information. Amazon often works with specialized partners, who actually do the bidding on government contracts and include Amazon as a preferred vendor.  North Carolina chose Amazon Web Services over Microsoft\u2019s Azure to deliver election night results reporting because it \u201cwas simple to set up (and) very low in cost,\u201d the State Board of Elections said. Before it worked with Amazon, North Carolina spent \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d on a similar service. Amazon charged them less than $100 during elections in 2016 and 2018 for the same service, the State Board of Elections said.  California\u2019s Alameda County turned to Amazon\u2019s cloud to let citizens view results on election night. The cost is less than $100 a year, county officials said.  In his webinar to clients, Amazon\u2019s Jackson said these services help the company win bigger contracts. For example, Oklahoma has tied up with an Amazon partner and pays $26,000 for two services on Amazon\u2019s servers, Pam Slater, assistant secretary at the Oklahoma State Election board said.  Amazon has three categories of election-related clients: election administrators in states and counties, political campaigns and election-related non-profits, the documents, presentations and interviews show.  The company's expansion in the election arena reflects its broader dominance in the fast-growing cloud computing business. Amazon had 33% percent of the overall cloud market in the second quarter of 2019 followed by Microsoft, according to SRG Research. For a graphic on market share, click tmsnrt.rs\/323b9Vw  AWS, officially launched in 2006, generated $25.7 billion in sales in 2018 and is the company\u2019s biggest profit-generator. It was not clear how big the election business is inside AWS and the company declined to provide any details.  IS IT BULLET PROOF?  One of the main security concerns with election systems involves voter registration data, which Russian hackers breached in at least Arizona and Illinois in 2016, according to the FBI.  Such databases generally include voter ID information such as partial social security numbers, addresses, voting history, party affiliation, whether an early ballot was sent, early primary ballots for independent voters, provisional ballots, and hand-written signatures of voters and absentee ballots, according to an analysis of RFP\u2019s (request for proposal) from states looking to move such databases to the cloud.  Vickery, the director at Upguard, uncovered at least three instances where voter data on Amazon\u2019s cloud servers was exposed to the internet, which have been reported previously.  For example, in 2017, he found a Republican contractor's database for nearly every registered American voter hosted on AWS exposed on the internet for 12 days. In 2016, he found Mexico's entire voter database on AWS servers was leaked. reut.rs\/30J35be  Amazon said the breaches were caused by customer errors, adding that while AWS secures the cloud infrastructure, customers are responsible for security of what goes in the cloud.  Errors caused by customers could continue, experts said, as many employees of states and counties who use AWS services lack the skills and training to avoid such errors in the future.  Greg Miller, co-founder of the OSET Institute, which works with the Department of Homeland Security and Congress on election security, also noted many of Amazon\u2019s partners - such as technology companies also called managed service providers (MSP\u2019s) who are tasked with delivering AWS services to customers - do not have the credentials or experience needed in delivering and handling election services.  Amazon did not comment on the issue.  None of these risks have failed to deter those that have signed up with AWS.  \u201cWe think (AWS) provides us with the best available level of security,\u201d said Ron Morgan, chief deputy county clerk of Travis County in Texas, one of the largest counties in the state, which uses Amazon\u2019s servers to run its election website.  \u201cIs it bullet proof?

A separate report on Friday about Canadian government officials expressing concerns that a final North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) pact will not be reached within the Friday deadline, added to the trade worries.  \u201cThe threat of global growth taking a hit from a damaging U.S-China relationship remains \u2018front and center\u2019,\u201d said Dean Popplewell, vice president of market analysis at Oanda.

Optimism about gradually reopening the U.S. economy has fueled a rally on Wall Street in recent weeks, but the S&P 500 remains down 13% since Feb. 19, just before fear caused by the coronavirus gripped Wall Street and ended the benchmark\u2019s 11-year bull market. With online shopping booming as millions of people stay at home and avoid traditional stores, Amazon\u2019s stock has climbed 9% in the same period, including a 2% jump on Wednesday.

The Seattle, Washington-based company\u2019s results on Thursday after the bell will give investors a glimpse of how the global crisis has affected its retail business in the final month of the quarter, as well as its highly profitable Amazon Web Services cloud computing arm. Investors will also want to know how Amazon expects the ongoing health crisis to affect its business in coming months, including the company\u2019s ongoing, deep investments to reduce its Prime shipping to one-day from two-day service.  With hand sanitizers, groceries, office chairs, home exercise equipment and other products selling out on its website as millions of people around the world shelter at home, Amazon has struggled to increase capacity at its warehouses and maintain its supply chains while minimizing health risks to employees. Critics, including New York Attorney General Letitia James, have accused Amazon of taking inadequate measures to protect warehouse workers from catching the illness.  Reflecting changes caused by the coronavirus, the average analyst estimate for Amazon\u2019s quarterly revenue has increased by over $1 billion since the end of January, while the average estimate for its earnings has dipped by 20 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data, reflecting expectations of higher costs related to the coronavirus.  Amazon and other leading retailers may also emerge from the pandemic in stronger positions relative to competitors. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the financial crisis because of shelter-in-place orders, and stores that were already struggling may not survive the health crisis.  Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection, Reuters has reported, and Gap Inc last week warned it may not survive the next 12 months.  Overall, about 50 S&P 500 stocks are up since Feb. 19, a few of them directly because of the coronavirus outbreak and related changes in consumer behavior. Some of those have risen more on a percentage basis than Amazon. Gilead Sciences, which on Wednesday gave an encouraging update on a potential COVID-19 treatment, has jumped 25% since Feb. 19, adding $21 billion to its market capitalization. General Mills and Conagra Brands have both climbed 15% as consumers stocked up on food and other consumer staples.  Analysts on average expect Amazon\u2019s March quarter revenue to have jumped 23% to $73.61 billion, with adjusted earnings of $6.25 per share, according to Refinitiv.","1042":"FILE PHOTO: An Amazon logo is seen at its centre in Darlington, County Durham, Britain September 3, 2020.

Those indicted planned to pay over $100,000 in exchange for an unfair competitive advantage on the Amazon marketplace - a platform where third-party merchants sell goods, the Department said.  The defendants used bribery and fraud to reinstate products and accounts that Amazon had suspended or blocked entirely from doing business on its marketplace. That resulted in more than $100 million of competitive benefits to those accounts, harm to competitors and harm to consumers, according to the indictment.  \u201cThe ultimate victim from this criminal conduct is the buying public who get inferior or even dangerous goods that should have been removed from the marketplace,\u201d U.S. Attorney Brian T.

The move comes only three weeks after the U.S. e-commerce giant introduced its Prime subscription service to Brazilian consumers, toughening the competition with local retailers by offering unlimited nationwide free shipping and a maximum 48-hour delivery time in over 90 municipalities.  \u201cThis is a particularly exciting moment for Amazon in Brazil,\u201d Amazon\u2019s international director for Alexa, Michele Butti, told journalists on Wednesday, adding the company has hired a local team to adapt Alexa to Portuguese language.  Amazon is offering discounts in pre-orders for two of the three Alexa devices - Echo Dot and Echo Show 5 - which will also be available in some brick-and-mortar stores of local retailer Fast Shop as of Oct. 8. The third one, called Amazon Eco, will be available as of November.  Ricardo Garrido, country manager for Alexa in Brazil, added the U.S. giant may consider selling these gadgets in other Brazilian retail chains going forward and also does not rule out potential partnerships with local telecommunications carriers.  Both executives said the company will be importing all three devices from China, but declined to specify volumes or how many Amazon expected to sell in Brazil.  \u201cWe are proud of our products and results are exceeding expectations in other countries, but we are not particularly focused on sales numbers in the first year or month,\u201d Butti said.  Garrido added that a major concern for Amazon at the moment is how Brazilian consumers will prefer to use its virtual assistant, since Alexa can also be used in gadgets produced by other manufacturers. Currently, there are approximately 100 million devices connected to Alexa worldwide, according to the company.  Prices for Amazon\u2019s three gadgets in Brazil vary from 349 to 699 reais ($84.53-$169.30).","1044":"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a combination photo.\/File Photo  BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU privacy watchdog EDPS on Wednesday backed the bloc\u2019s push to curb the power of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet unit Google and Facebook via new tough rules and suggested more safeguards to boost users\u2019 privacy rights.  Unveiled by EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton in December last year, the two sets of rules are known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).  DMA takes aim at online gatekeepers which will be subject to a list of dos such as sharing some data with rivals and regulators and don\u2019ts among them not favouring their own services on their platforms.  The DSA requires large online platforms and other internet players to do more to tackle illegal content, be more transparent about political advertising on their platforms. DMA fines can be as much as 10% of global turnover and 6% for DSA breaches.  \u201cThe EDPS welcomes the (DMA) proposal, as it seeks to promote fair and open markets and the fair processing of personal data,\u201d the EU watchdog, which ensures that EU institutions comply with the bloc\u2019s privacy rules, said in an opinion.  Its comments could encourage privacy advocates and EU lawmakers to push for a tougher line.  EDPS said gatekeepers should provide an easy and accessible way for users to consent or decline the use of their personal data by the companies for their other services, and that there should be tests to ensure personal data is effectively anonymous.  On the DSA, the agency said profiling of users for content moderation purposes should be banned and that online targeted advertising should be phased out and banned in the case of pervasive tracking while some data should be shielded from targeted advertising.  The proposed European Commission rules will need to be discussed with EU countries and EU lawmakers before they become law, a process which will take 16-24 months.","1045":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian stock exchanges on Wednesday gave the go ahead for Future Group\u2019s $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets, taking it a step closer toward closing a deal that has soured its ties with its business partner Amazon.com Inc.

SEBI has advised that Future should share various details of company\u2019s ongoing litigation with Amazon when it approaches India\u2019s National Company Law Tribunal, which also needs to sign off on the deal, the Bombay Stock Exchange notification said.  SEBI has separately not made its observations public.  Reliance and Future did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The notifications will be a setback for Amazon, which has in recent weeks repeatedly written letters to SEBI and stock exchanges to suspend the deal\u2019s review.  Amazon has also dragged Future before a Singapore arbitrator, which passed an interim order in October saying the Reliance deal should be halted. Future says that order is not binding on it.

The move, which follows an initial co-operation between Casino\u2019s upmarket Monoprix supermarket chain and Amazon in Paris, could re-ignite speculation of a bigger deal later on.  An Amazon spokeswoman said it had a policy of not commenting on market speculation. Amazon\u2019s purchase of bricks-and-mortar U.S. food retailer Whole Foods Market last year has raised speculation it could buy a European food retailer.  The extended partnership comes as Casino is selling assets and cutting debt to try to allay investor concerns over its finances and those of parent company Rallye.  The deal, unveiled on Tuesday, will see Amazon lockers installed in 1,000 locations across France in nine of Casino\u2019s brands, including Monoprix, Monop, Geant, Hyper Casino, Casino Supermarche, Leaderprice, Viva and Spar by the end of the year. The lockers store Amazon products to be picked up by customers.  Tina Schuler, CEO of LeaderPrice, Casino Supermarches, Geant Casino and Casino Proximites, told a conference call that the deal - whose financial terms were not disclosed - will help Casino \u201cboost traffic and revenues in e-commerce and in stores\u201d.  For Amazon, a key attraction was \u201cCasino\u2019s dense store network, which it views as a real strength,\u201d she added.

CASINO SHARES DIP  Nevertheless, Casino\u2019s shares fell 0.9 percent by 1113 GMT, after Standard & Poor\u2019s cut its credit rating on Casino to \u2018BB- negative outlook\u2019, pushing it further into junk territory.  Investment bank Morgan Stanley also kept an \u201cunderweight\u201d rating on Casino\u2019s shares.  Monoprix, seen by analysts as similar to Whole Foods, started filling orders for subscribers to Amazon\u2019s Prime loyalty program in parts of Paris last September.  This partnership has been closely watched as Monoprix was the first French retailer to agree in March 2018 to sell products via Amazon, causing a stir in the fiercely competitive domestic market.  France is Amazon\u2019s third largest market in Europe, after Britain and Germany. Amazon is the e-commerce leader in France with a market share of 17.3 percent, but its grocery market share stands at just 2 percent, according to Kantar data.  The U.S. group, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its ambitions to expand in food retail.  But the French supermarket sector has powerful incumbents such as Carrefour and Leclerc, operating at low margins and with a dense network of stores.  Earlier this week, Casino said it would sell 12 Casino hypermarkets and 20 supermarkets to Apollo Global Management in a deal worth up to 470 million euros.","1047":"Add \u201cgame developer\u201d to Amazon\u2019s list of operations alongside online retailer and video content streamer.

Crucible is the first big-budget released by the company\u2019s eight-year-old Amazon Game Studios.  Multiple media reports compared the Windows 10-based game to Overwatch, League of Legends, Fortnite and Apex Legends.  Amazon already had an entry into the world of video games through its 2014 purchase of Twitch for $970 million. Twitch is the live-streaming platform of choice for many video-game enthusiasts.  Now Crucible sends Amazon into the big-money gaming world. Whether the move will wind up being profitable is open to debate.  David Cole, founder and CEO of research firm DFC Intelligence, told CNN regarding Amazon\u2019s release of Crucible, \u201cThese companies are like huge oil tankers that cannot exactly turn on a dime.

Carney, who is Amazon\u2019s public policy and communications chief, touted the hundreds of thousands of jobs his company has created and joined Microsoft Corp\u2019s President Brad Smith as one of two senior tech executives to have a public role at the convention - hinting at Amazon\u2019s potential influence on a Biden administration if the democrat wins the White House.  Amazon appears to have taken an early lead making in-roads with the Biden camp, according to data gathered by Reuters from OpenSecrets and campaign finance records, along with interviews with over a dozen stakeholders including anti-monopoly groups, lobbyists, congressional aides, competitors and lawmakers.  Joining Amazon, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft are among the top five contributors to Joe Biden's candidate campaign committee in the 2020 cycle, according to data from OpenSecrets, a website which tracks money in politics and campaign finance records. Click here tmsnrt.rs\/2GsjNa4 and here tmsnrt.rs\/34bbg3M for graphic on top contributors.  The firms are prohibited by law from donating themselves. The contributions were either made by the company\u2019s political action committees (PACs) themselves, members of the PAC or their employees.  Tech is strengthening relationships in case of a Biden victory to ensure they have a voice in an onslaught of federal and state investigations into their business practices, according to campaign finance records and interviews.  The industry\u2019s coziness with the Democratic Party, which dates back through several elections, has critics of their market dominance worried.  Sally Hubbard, who has worked with Democratic lawmakers in the past and currently focuses on monopoly power of tech companies at Washington-based Open Markets Institute, does not want a Biden victory to translate into a repeat of what was widely viewed as President Barack Obama\u2019s hands off approach to tech.  \u201cAre we going to see the same thing with a Biden administration?\u201d she asked, adding there will be a significant amount of pressure from anti-monopoly groups and the progressive wing of the Democratic party to hold the companies accountable.  Depending on the stance of a potential Biden administration, existing antitrust probes under President Trump and state attorneys general could intensify or be weakened.  Biden, for his part, has criticized large internet companies during interviews and campaign events. He has urged the revocation of a key legal shield protecting internet companies from liability over user-generated content. He has also expressed concern over market concentration and privacy issues in the technology industry; criticized Amazon for not paying taxes; and expressed displeasure with Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg.  His two main advisors on tech policy include Bruce Reed, who served as Biden\u2019s chief of staff from 2011-13, and Stef Feldman, the campaign\u2019s policy director, according to a source with the Biden campaign. Reed and Feldman did not respond to requests for comment via the campaign.  A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company\u2019s PAC did not contribute to the Biden campaign. She said Amazon supported both the Democratic and Republican National Convention with technology and digital services to increase viewership. \u201cWe work with each administration in the same way ... our approach will not change regardless of who wins the election,\u201d the spokeswoman added.  Biden campaign spokesman Matt Hill said Joe Biden is against the abuse of power. \u201cMany technology giants and their executives have not only abused their power, but misled the American people, damaged our democracy, and evaded any form of responsibility. That ends with a President Biden,\u201d Hill added.  Google declined comment. Microsoft said the contributions were made by its employees.  \u2018PROGRESSIVES WILL STRUGGLE\u2019  Tech\u2019s ties to Biden run deep.  Amazon\u2019s Carney worked in former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration as press secretary for a little over three years. He was Vice President Biden\u2019s communications director for the first two years of the Obama administration.  Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky is a top fundraiser for Biden, also known as a bundler who as individuals have raised more than $25,000. Bundlers are sometimes rewarded with plum positions in their beneficiary\u2019s administration, such as key jobs in federal agencies and influential advisory commissions. Zapolsky has also directly contributed a little over $250,000 to different funds supporting Biden\u2019s presidency, according to campaign finance records. Zapolsky did not comment.  Meanwhile the Biden campaign\u2019s transition team and working groups have added at least eight people who worked for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple and others with ties to these companies.  A senior policy counsel for a progressive Senate Democrat, who did not wish to be named, said Big Tech\u2019s closeness with the Biden campaign is worrying. The battle for the left wing of the Democratic party on this issue will be on whether they can get crucial appointments in the administration and less about moving Biden toward progressive options, the aide added.  Republican Senator Josh Hawley, a close ally of Trump and a vocal critic of large tech companies, said the progressives may get a \u201crhetorical nod in their direction now and then,\u201d but the Biden campaign\u2019s fundraising shows the progressives will struggle.  \u201cFor Amazon in particular to be featured at a political convention is really, really worrisome,\u201d Hawley told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s taking their lobbying to a whole new level.\u201d  To be sure, many large technology companies - their employees, PAC\u2019s or PAC members - have been top contributors to Democratic presidential campaigns in the past three election cycles, with one notable exception: Amazon.  However, contributions from the Seattle-based retailer\u2019s employees have now made Amazon the fifth largest contributor to the Democratic nominee\u2019s candidate campaign committee, according to data from OpenSecrets and campaign finance records.  Large technology companies are entirely missing from the Trump campaign committee\u2019s top 20 contributors list.  Donations from senior Amazon executives to the Biden campaign during the primaries were second only to Microsoft, according to data from the Revolving Door Project, which is part of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.  \u201cI think all the fundraising we are seeing is probably going to buy them (Amazon) access, but in terms of policy results, I think it\u2019s going to buy them very little,\u201d said an advisor on tech policy to the Biden campaign, who did not wish to be named. \u201cThere is a lot of collective outrage against tech in Washington these days, and they simply cannot fly under the radar.\u201d","1049":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - XPO Logistics Inc shares sank more than 14 percent on Friday after it said its biggest customer, believed to be Amazon.com, slashed its business with the warehousing and last-mile delivery provider by two-thirds.

A former XPO employee also told Reuters that the 571,000 square-foot warehouse in Aberdeen handled Amazon work.  When XPO opened its Edgerton, Kansas facility in 2016, a broker told the Kansas City Business Journal the company\u2019s client for the 500,000 square-foot facility was Amazon.  XPO facility closures on the East Coast and in the Midwest received heavy media coverage. \u201cThat was with our largest customer,\u201d XPO Chief Executive Bradley Jacobs said on a conference call with analysts.  XPO disclosed plans to close its Rialto facility with California\u2019s Employment Development Department in late January.  Amazon is building out its shipping capabilities. That's putting pressure on last-mile delivery companies such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, as well as truckers who move products on highways and between distribution centers.  The e-commerce giant also is edging into the heavy and bulky warehousing and delivery category that is XPO\u2019s specialty.  The planning board for the town of Schodack, New York, in July approved Amazon\u2019s plan to build a 1,000,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center \u201cdesigned to handle heavy, bulky items - such as TVs, kayaks and canoes,\u201d according to WNYT.

While that growth should entice any retailer, Chico\u2019s is one of a growing number of clothing brands treading carefully.  From Nike Inc and Under Armour Inc to Lands\u2019 End Inc and Levi Strauss & Co, major brands are distributing clothing and accessories directly through Amazon.com, attracted by more than 100 million members of Amazon\u2019s loyalty club Prime and its advanced delivery network.  The risk in this relationship, according to interviews with retailers and industry analysts, comes if Amazon uses real-time data from customer purchases to help it quickly build out its own private label clothing brands, and ends up stealing market share from its current retail partners.  \u201cThe word that\u2019s most commonly used with respect to Amazon from a brand perspective, and also retailers to some extent, is \u2018frenemy,\u2019\u201d said Kate Delhagen, an independent retail consultant and former senior director of global digital business development at Nike. She had input into Nike\u2019s decision process to partner with Amazon, but left the shoe company shortly before the deal was finalized in July 2017.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2WHcPkH  Recognizing the concern from retailers, the European Commission has launched a preliminary antitrust investigation into Amazon and whether it might \u201cgain access to competitively sensitive information about competitors\u2019 products which it could use to boost its own retail activities at the expense of third party sellers on its marketplace,\u201d an EU spokesman said.  Amazon declined to comment on the early-stage probe, or say how many private label clothing brands it had and how fast it was churning out new ones. A spokeswoman said Amazon\u2019s private label products account for about 1 percent of its total retail sales.  \u201cOur private brands supplement the great assortment that our selling partners provide,\u201d she added.  A Nike spokeswoman said its business with Amazon continued to perform well, but said the company\u2019s approach was broader than Amazon alone and that it continued to engage with a number of digital marketplaces.  To sell through Amazon, Chico\u2019s and other clothing retailers can either sell product to Amazon in a traditional wholesale relationship or sell directly to consumers as third-party merchants, paying a 17 percent referral fee on clothing and accessories sold.  Retailers pay Amazon extra to store and ship their orders under the \u2018fulfillment by Amazon\u2019 model.  Amazon has set a goal of being a leader in the apparel space for around a decade, former Amazon director Mike Pazak told Reuters, and has invested heavily in the sector. It has recently ramped up its own private label apparel brands.  It had 109 of its own brands in clothing, shoes and jewelry categories at the start of 2019, which is more than a five-fold increase over two years, according to TJI Research.  \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re aware of and understand the risks,\u201d said George Nahra, senior vice president of strategy, business development and international at Chico\u2019s, which flies executives to Seattle regularly to review the growing Amazon business.  OVERTAKING WALMART  Amazon markets fashion across the world from Brazil to China. It has made its Prime Wardrobe concept, which allows Prime members to order clothing with no upfront charge and free delivery, available in the United States, Britain and Japan.  The online giant has sponsored fashion weeks in the United States, Mexico, Japan and India and has photography studios for fashion shoots in New York, London, Tokyo and New Delhi. It is a patron of the British Fashion Council.  Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States, according to a Coresight Research survey.  In Britain, Amazon has outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC as the most-shopped clothing retailer, according to an HSBC survey.  Amazon Prime member Abby Kidd bought a pair of Silver brand $80 jeans the first time she used the Prime Wardrobe service.  \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll look anywhere else for jeans as long as Amazon keeps expanding their options,\u201d said the 35-year-old private tutor, based in Oak Harbor, Washington who also shops at chain stores Macy\u2019s Inc and Maurices.  Classic American clothing retailer Lands\u2019 End turned to Amazon more than a year ago when it looked to increase sales after a bruising exit from previous owner Sears.  \u201cWe\u2019d be ostriches sticking our heads in the sand if we didn\u2019t take heed and pay attention to where customers are going,\u201d said Sarah Rasmusen, senior vice president of e-commerce at Lands\u2019 End, founded in the 1960s as a mail-order business.  Lands\u2019 End started selling core items such as flannel shirts and down coats on Amazon in February last year as part of its strategy to branch out from troubled Sears stores, where it has lost dozens of retail locations.  Lands\u2019 End\u2019s key swimwear lines compete with Amazon\u2019s Coastal Blue swimwear private label on the site.  Both Chico\u2019s and Lands\u2019 End declined to say what percentage of their sales were made through Amazon, but said the platform was a useful customer acquisition tool that was not drawing clients away from their own e-commerce sites.  A gripe for retailers is that selling on Amazon loses the direct customer relationship they get from their own website or store.  \u201cYou don\u2019t know where your customer\u2019s coming from, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re clicking on once they get to the site,\u201d said Melanie Travis, founder of upmarket swimwear brand Andie who has talked to Amazon, but decided against selling on the platform.  Others are satisfied with the limited data they get from Amazon. For instance, Chico\u2019s gets enough to mail catalogs to new Amazon customers, said senior vice president Nahra.  Canadian shoe retailer Aldo, which deepened its 10-year relationship with Amazon to a wholesale model this year, said it receives more information as a result, such as the basket composition of customers who buy Aldo\u2019s products on Amazon. That allows it to adapt its product offering accordingly.  Insights shared by Amazon can influence how the retailer designs collections, Aldo said. Its products compete with Amazon\u2019s footwear private label The Fix on the platform.  \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting partnership you get by selling to Amazon instead of selling through Amazon,\u201d said Justin Cohen, senior director of e-commerce for Aldo North America. \u201cWe\u2019re just starting to lean back into that relationship.\u201d","1051":"(Adds details, background)  Feb 14 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said Thursday it will not move forward with plans to build a headquarters in New York after rising opposition from local politicians.

Sales generated on web-based marketplaces rose 14 percent, while sales via apps on tablets and smartphones grew by 20 percent.  The average value of each online purchase fell by 4 euros year-on-year to 63 euros, but there was an increase in the frequency of purchases, the federation said.

With shoppers clearing out shelves in fear of quarantines or product shortages, retailers are racing to keep food and hygienic items in stock and have employees on hand for in-store work or delivery.  Like Amazon, U.S. supermarket chains Albertsons, Kroger KR.N and Raley's have sought new hires to staff busy sections and fulfill online orders. They are turning to people in the restaurant, travel and entertainment businesses who are suddenly looking for work because of the coronavirus.  \"We want those people to know we welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back,\" Amazon said in a blog post here.  Major shipper United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N said its trucking and air deliveries were still on despite growing government restrictions on commercial activities. It said Monday it was meeting demand with its existing workforce.  The coronavirus, which has led to more than 7,100 deaths globally and prompted mass lockdowns of people, has also led to items being out of stock on Amazon and some deliveries taking longer than usual.  Amazon\u2019s headcount fluctuates seasonally, recently peaking for the holiday quarter at 798,000 full and part-time workers. It was not immediately clear how many people Amazon would employ after it hires 100,000 more.

The extra pay for hourly employees in North America and Europe is expected to cost more than $350 million, Amazon said.  Meanwhile, other retailers facing long queues are making pitches for talent, too.  It was not clear if there would be any impact on delivery operations from new government restrictions.

Ted Hope and Matt Newman will both run the division as interim co-heads while the company searches for a replacement, Amazon said.  Until now, Jennifer Salke, Amazon Studios\u2019 chief who was hired in February, had largely made personnel changes related to the company\u2019s television programming. The move on Tuesday highlights Salke\u2019s interest in reviewing the direction of Amazon\u2019s film slate as well.  Ropell helped the streaming media service capture its first Academy Awards in 2017 for the drama \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d which won two Oscars.  Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d was an Oscar nominee this year, and another project championed by Ropell, the upcoming film \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d starring actor Steve Carell, has already generated Oscar buzz for 2019.  While artistic fare put Amazon on the map in Hollywood and helped it attract top talent, the company is increasingly seeking a wider audience as it pursues its central business goal: attracting more members to Prime, its subscription-based video streaming and shopping club.  Amazon\u2019s 100 million Prime members globally buy more goods on average than those who are not in the club, which in the United States costs $119 per year.  Reuters reported earlier this year that Amazon expected to go after films with budgets in the $50 million range at the expense of indie projects costing around $5 million.  Ropell\u2019s departure could accelerate that shift.  Changes to Amazon\u2019s TV lineup are already under way.

The tightly choreographed morning operation is designed to maximize speed and minimize costs, preconditions for the success of Amazon\u2019s rapid expansion in its biggest international market.  But contractors which hire delivery people say that finding drivers is increasingly difficult.  Salem Ahmad runs a small logistics company which recently won a contract to deliver parcels for Amazon in the city of Bochum. An Iraqi who has lived in Germany since 2001, he is struggling to find around 50 to 60 new drivers.  Many migrants with families calculate they will get more in benefits than the average 1,600 euros a month Ahmad can pay them, he said. \u201cThey think, why bother and work in such demanding job if it won\u2019t benefit them financially.\u201d  Raising salaries could help attract more drivers, Ahmad said: \u201cBut at the current rates we have, it\u2019s not easy to solve this problem.\u201d  Amazon sends almost a third of the 1.4 billion parcels delivered to private customers in Germany each year, said Horst Manner-Romberg, head of logistics consultancy MDU. He estimates the parcel delivery sector overall is short of as many as 9,000 drivers.  In Munich, where Amazon launched its own delivery service for Germany in 2015, it has recently begun hiring drivers directly. An Amazon spokeswoman said there is usually a shortage of drivers in the city during the Christmas shopping peak.  Bernd Gschaider, Germany director for Amazon Logistics, which covers deliveries from distribution centers, denied there was shortage of delivery drivers in Germany. \u201cOf course we are competing for the best workers as in many other sectors but we believe we offer our drivers - and those of our partners - a good package,\u201d he said.  \u201cHARD LABOR\u201d  Several drivers currently or formerly employed by contractors told Reuters working conditions were punishing.  \u201cThe days were difficult: hard labor in every sense of the word,\u201d said one of them, Ihsan Hardan, a 35-year-old father of four from Syria who spent seven months delivering parcels for a subcontractor driving for Amazon until he quit in May.  Working days were as long as 12 hours, some drivers said, because there was no way they could deliver so many parcels in a standard eight-hour shift. A few drivers said they had to turn up at the depot well before they started driving and return undelivered parcels.  \u201cYou have 180 stops, 180 times to get out of and in the car, 180 times you have to find parking, 180 times knocking on client house, sometimes they are there, sometime they aren\u2019t,\u201d Hardan said, declining to name the subcontractor which hired him.  Amazon says it designs routes to fit a regular shift and that contractors should bring in relief drivers if they find they cannot deliver within the time.  Yves Delmas, chief operating officer Europe for parcel delivery firm DPD, owned by France\u2019s La Poste, noted DPD\u2019s turnover of workers is as much as 40 percent a year in Germany. \u201cHome delivery will become more and more expensive,\u201d he said.  The other two major logistics companies in Germany which both deliver for Amazon - Deutsche Post DHL DPWGn.DEand Hermes - have both hiked prices for parcel deliveries in the last year - citing the need to pay more to attract drivers.

DHL pays its employee drivers at least 13.37 euros per hour.  Amazon said it will pay the drivers it has begun employing directly in Munich 12.80 euros per hour. Reuters did not interview any drivers working directly for Amazon.  Hermes plans to increase parcel fees for contractors so they can eventually hike hourly pay to 12 euros from 9.50 euros now.  \u201cShortage of personnel is a massive challenge,\u201d a Hermes spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are convinced that the job of parcel couriers needs to be financially more attractive.\u201d  A German law is expected to pass by the end of the year making companies responsible for ensuring their contractors pay social security for their employees.  Kira Falter, a labor expert with German law firm CMS, said companies will have to hire controllers to ensure their contractors make those deductions, pay workers properly and stick to working time regulations.  \u201cThe latest amendments will result in significant additional costs, which will either be borne by the e-commerce company itself or by the customer through higher prices,\u201d Falter said.  Amazon\u2019s Gschaider said its auditors already perform spot checks to ensure contractors comply with working time and other rules so the changes would not affect its business.  The company\u2019s sales in Germany rose 17% in 2018 to almost $20 billion, or 9% of the group total.

Amazon is under pressure to make good on one- and two-day deliveries promised to customers who subscribe to its $119 annual Prime service.

This has freed up enough people for Kraft Heinz to create a third shift in many factories, up from two, Patricio said.  Patricio said sales of Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Planters nuts have increased, and that people are also buying more Heinz vinegar to use as an alternative to cleaning products.  \u201cWe\u2019re breaking production records every day,\u201d Patricio said, adding that a Davenport, Iowa-based Oscar Mayer plant he visited yesterday had increased weekly capacity by 40% compared with the same week last month.

Confronted by red tape and delays after Britain\u2019s messy exit from the European Union, Irish traders are shipping goods directly to and from European ports, shunning the once-speedier route through Britain.  \u201cYou see the shift in supply chains right here,\u201d he said.  All five operators connecting Ireland to mainland Europe have increased ferry services in the past nine months, with some bringing forward planned sailings and others moving larger ships away from quieter British routes to meet new demand.  Millet forecast Cherbourg would handle 9,000 trucks in January, equivalent to almost a quarter of what passed through the French port annually before the COVID-19 crisis.  For decades, the land bridge offered Irish traders the swiftest, most reliable route to continental Europe. It involves a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover and Calais. Every year 150,000 lorries would use the route.  But post-Brexit paperwork and delays in customs clearance are snarling up the process, adding hours or days to journeys and ratcheting up costs. Many companies are switching routes.  \u201cThis is a game-changer,\u201d said Chris Smyth, commercial director at Ireland\u2019s Perennial Freight. Demand was huge for freight space to ship to Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, he added.  Cherbourg\u2019s business before Brexit had been evenly split between Ireland and Britain. Now, the port would orient itself towards Ireland, Millet said.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cI thought traffic would double but it has tripled,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question now is whether the traffic volumes we see today will hold in the months to come.\u201d  AVOIDING THE MIDDLEMAN  Stena Line, the largest Irish Sea operator, has doubled its services on the booming Rosslare-Cherbourg route, temporarily cancelling some sailings to Britain after freight volumes fell 60% in the first half of January.  Irish Ferries has deployed a larger vessel out of Dublin and planned to add more weekly rotations next month, the Port of Cherbourg said. Brittany Ferries also brought forward a planned sailing linking France and Ireland.  Danish operator DFDS said the freight ferries plying its new 23-hour crossing from Rosslare to Dunkirk six days a week were \u201cpretty much full\u201d. Route director Aidan Coffey said capturing 30% of \u201cland bridge\u201d traffic would make the route viable and DFDS might soon add up to two more sailings per week.  \u201cWe\u2019re blown away by the demand,\u201d Coffey said.  No one knows if the shift is permanent.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, a government shipping promotion body, said a return to pre-Brexit logistic chains would depend on the speed of customs formalities along the land bridge and that ferries linking Ireland and mainland Europe could not replicate its volumes.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Eddie Burke, a senior official at Ireland\u2019s transport department, said the route through Britain would undoubtedly come back into play again.  Ferry operators were taking decisions on capacity week by week, said Ole Bockmann, Stena\u2019s operations chief in Cherbourg. Reverting to land bridge routes was simple, he said. \u201cWe just take the ships off and go back to the old system.\u201d  RENAISSANCE  It gives ports like Cherbourg and Ireland\u2019s Rosslare a narrow window to persuade traders that the longer sea crossing between Ireland and mainland Europe is commercially viable for just-in-time logistics.  Eighteen months ago, Rosslare on the southeastern tip of Ireland was struggling. Its traffic volumes were stagnant while rivals were enjoying a 10-year run of growth.  Now its general manager, Glenn Carr, is fending off complaints about the number trucks passing through after freight traffic increased 500% in the first half of January.  Carr said the old perception that direct crossings from Ireland were too long for fresh food and just-in-time supply chains was changing. Many of the companies that had switched from the land bridge would remain, he forecast.  \u201cI was talking to some multinationals only this week and the question they asked me was, \u2018Glenn, are you putting on more services?\u2019\u201d  An 18-hour ferry ride away, Cherbourg port\u2019s Millet said his immediate priority was responding to shipping companies demands for better restaurants and washrooms for truckers and ironing out quayside glitches in the loading of extra vessels.  \u201cBrexit has for us been an opportunity to rethink our port,\u201d he said.","1074":"FILE PHOTO: Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016.

The dispute centres around FRL\u2019s decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com\u2019s data deal is inviting D.C. scrutiny. As its executives appeared at an antitrust hearing in Congress alongside those of other tech firms, the e-commerce giant offered customers $10 to track their web browsing. It\u2019s a smart way to grab business from rivals, and the price low-balls the value of user data. That\u2019s a demonstration of how dominance works.  There\u2019s nothing new about retailers extending discounts for information on shoppers. Companies used to offer a few bucks or a prize entry to those who filled out surveys. Amazon is offering $10 to new users of Amazon Assistant, its shopping comparison tool, if they spend $50.  What\u2019s different is the scale of information being collected, and the potential anti-competitive effects given Amazon\u2019s size. The tool collects and processes information such as search results and page content from rivals. And it shows Amazon offers and reviews to consumers as they browse rival sites.  Amazon is worth nearly $1 trillion because it has a commanding lead in e-commerce. Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have also grown hugely valuable by dominating search and social networking. It\u2019s difficult to prove these businesses harm consumers under conventional antitrust theories. Amazon\u2019s profit margins are razor thin. Alphabet and Facebook don\u2019t even charge for most of their offerings.  One reason these firms dominate their respective categories is because of their huge collections of data. Amazon, for example, can use its trove to figure out the best way to price goods \u2013 attracting skinflints with cheap prices and charging more to those who can\u2019t be bothered to comparison shop. It can also precision-target potential buyers with its own-label offerings. And the value is snowballing over time. Amazon\u2019s growing collection of product reviews, for example, makes the site useful and sticky.  While the value of consumer data to these behemoths is high, the price isn\u2019t. Consumers are willing to part with it free, or for a song in this Amazon case. It would be hard for consumers to band together to demand higher remuneration, even if they wanted to. That leaves it to lawmakers to consider measures such as limiting data collection, or requiring firms to pay a data dividend to consumers. That might start to level the playing field.","1080":"FILE PHOTO: A Microsoft store is pictured in New York City, New York, U.S., August 21, 2018.

The deal brings Borkum Riffgrund 3 a step closer to being built, said Orsted, the world\u2019s biggest offshore wind power operator.  The Danish company said it will make a final investment decision for the subsidy-free wind farm at the end of 2021, with operation then scheduled for 2025, but did not provide financial details.

Over the past 12 months, the Danish firm had concluded corporate PPAs for an accumulated capacity of 1,301 MW across its global offshore wind portfolio, it said.  PPAs have become a key part of renewable energy project development, providing a reliable revenue stream for asset owners as governments have closed or are closing subsidy schemes as wind and solar power technologies mature.  They typically involve the owner of an asset selling their power to a third party or directly to a consumer.

However, that company reported a tax credit of 294 million euros last year.  Amazon has faced criticism for its tax practices in the UK for years and is currently fighting a legal battle with the European Commission over claims, which Amazon denies, that it received unfair tax advantages from Luxembourg.

News of Amazon\u2019s planned expansion into Israel jolted shares of large local retailers and shopping malls.  Azrieli Group, which owns 13 shopping malls in Israel, was down 1 percent in Tel Aviv on Wednesday after shedding 3.4 percent on Tuesday. Retailer Fox was 1.5 percent lower after a nearly 10 percent drop on Tuesday.  There has been widespread speculation in Israel\u2019s media that Amazon plans to expand further into the country by opening a local fulfillment center since many Israelis already order from Amazon\u2019s sites in the United States, Britain and Germany.  With the cost of living high, sites such as Amazon have become increasingly popular in Israel since orders below $75 are exempt from taxes, while orders up to $500 are free from customs taxes.  Newspapers have also reported that Amazon began developing a local website in Hebrew and was looking for translators and editors who specialize in Hebrew to English translation.  The company, in the letter seen by Reuters, said that customers outside of the United States will be able to purchase products from Israeli vendors when they enable local delivery.  Ilanit Scherf, head of research at the Psagot brokerage, said small businesses should benefit since Amazon\u2019s platform puts them on the map, gives them a broader marketing base and an ability to reach customers they couldn\u2019t in the past due to high costs of mall rentals.  She estimated that Amazon \u201cviews Israel as an important target, given local growth, the developed consumption here and the business development capability that the global company can do in this part of the world through local developments.\u201d","1091":"WARSAW, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Polish commerce platform Allegro said on Monday it plans to raise around 1 billion zlotys ($266.54 million) from a new share issue as part of its initial public offering, which is expected to be the biggest debut on the Warsaw bourse for years.

In December, India modified foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for its burgeoning e-commerce sector that has drawn major bets from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc , which earlier in 2018 had acquired a controlling stake in homegrown e-commerce player Flipkart.

Hours before the Feb. 1 deadline on Thursday, numerous items sold by sellers, such as Cloudtail, in which Amazon holds an indirect equity stake, were no more available on the website.

The decision enables the Amazon boss to tap two of the nation\u2019s deepest pools of technology talent. The unconventional choice of two conventional cities also aggravates the socioeconomic divisions that plague America.  Amazon set off a frenzy last year when it asked cities to bid for the so-called HQ2. Fully 238 did so, believing the promised $5 billion investment and 50,000 jobs could transform their communities. But few areas offer the workforce, cultural attractions and transportation links that the company sought. It quickly whittled the field down to 20 finalists, most with sizable tech communities, and ultimately decided to go with two of the largest.  The decision will be expensive for Amazon, even with the more than $2 billion in grants and tax credits that New York and Virginia authorities are providing. Speculators have already been making punts on property in New York\u2019s Long Island City neighborhood and the Crystal City area of Arlington, Virginia, and the cities boast two of the nation\u2019s hottest labor markets. Unemployment in the nation\u2019s capital stands at just 3.3 percent and Google is aggressively expanding its workforce in New York City.  That probably explains why the average salary at Amazon\u2019s new headquarters will be more than $150,000, half again as much as the company originally promised and more than five times the company\u2019s median salary.  Bezos is offering a consolation prize to the heartland by putting a new operations center that will employ 5,000 in Nashville, Tennessee. But the world\u2019s wealthiest man has effectively bypassed flyover country, leaving aside cities like Detroit, where its investment could have been transformative. That gesture of elitism may be noticed by President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of Bezos and his Washington Post.  Amazon is growing at a prodigious rate and spreading plenty of jobs around in cities across the United States, albeit many of them lower-paying warehouse jobs. The bidding exercise has given it a trove of data and insight about what communities will do to attract more of its business. That will pay dividends in the years ahead \u2013 mainly, it must be said, to Bezos.","1095":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O more than doubled its profit on Thursday and predicted strong spring results as the world's biggest online retailer raised the price for U.S. Prime subscribers, added U.S. football games and touted its cloud services for business.  The results showed the broad strength of the company, which has been expanding far beyond shipping packages, the business that has drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.  The forecast beat expectations on Wall Street, sending shares up 7 percent to a new record high in after-hours trade and adding $8 billion to the net worth of Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive and largest shareholder.  Seattle-based Amazon is winning business from older, big box rivals by delivering virtually any product to customers at a low cost, and at times faster than it takes to buy goods from a physical store. It is expanding across industries, too, striking a $130 million deal to stream Thursday night games for the U.S. National Football League online and working to ship groceries to doorsteps from Whole Foods stores nationwide.  Sales jumped 43 percent to $51.0 billion in the quarter, topping estimates of $49.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/24gibla)  Amazon\u2019s fast ascent has made it a lightning rod for the ire of Trump. Bezos privately owns the Washington Post, which Trump has described as Amazon\u2019s \u201cchief lobbyist.\u201d Bezos has no involvement in news coverage, the paper\u2019s top editor has said. Trump has also claimed without evidence that Amazon is costing the U.S. Postal Service money and ordered a task force to investigate.  Success is \u201cthe best revenge that Bezos can get against the administration for its veiled threats about sales taxes and not paying its fair share,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.  Prime, Amazon\u2019s loyalty club that includes fast shipping, video streaming and other benefits, has been key to Amazon\u2019s strategy. Its more than 100 million members globally spend above average on Amazon.  The company announced Thursday it will increase the yearly price of Prime to $119 from $99 for U.S. members this spring. The fee hike is expected to add a windfall to Amazon\u2019s subscription revenue, already up 60 percent in the first quarter at $3.1 billion.

He said the number of items Prime members can get within two days had grown fivefold since the last price increase four years ago.  Despite the surge in shopping, Olsavsky gave credit for Amazon\u2019s $1.6 billion profit last quarter to two younger businesses: advertising and Amazon Web Services.  Revenue from third-party sellers paying to promote their products on Amazon.com was an unusually large bright spot during the quarter, with sales in the category, which includes some other items, growing 139 percent to $2.03 billion. This included $560 million from an accounting change.  \u201cAdvertising is an important and very profitable bucket of revenue for Amazon and is also growing at a fast rate,\u201d said D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte. \u201cThey are just getting started here.\u201d  Amazon said it expects operating profit this quarter between $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, up from $628 million a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $1.01 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.

It posted a 49 percent rise in sales from a year earlier to $5.44 billion, beating estimates.  Amazon remains the biggest in the space by revenue, and its stock trades at a significant premium to cloud-computing rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.  Amazon's shares have also outperformed the S&P 500 .SPX, rising 30 percent this year as of Thursday's market close, compared with the S&P's less than 1 percent decline.  Notorious for running on a low profit margin, Amazon has still reaped rewards for shareholders as it has bet on new services like voice-controlled computing and has expanded across continents and industries.  Global headcount was up 60 percent from a year earlier at 563,100 full-time and part-time employees, thanks to a hiring spree and an influx of workers from Whole Foods Market.  The company plans to increase its video content spending this year, Amazon\u2019s Olsavsky said, with a prequel to \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d in the works. The third quarter will also see extra spending to prepare for the busy holiday season.

For GM, the deal is the latest in a series of moves to embrace widely-used technology industry brands. For years, GM and other automakers tried to develop infotainment technology in-house using automotive suppliers. But customers have panned the results, and instead embraced digital assistants such as Alexa, Google Voice or Apple Inc's AAPL.O Siri.  Earlier this month, GM said it would embed Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O's Google technology in the dashboards of vehicles sold outside of China starting in 2021.  Santiago Chamorro, GM\u2019s vice president for Global Connected Services, said customers ultimately will be able to choose which voice concierge service to use - the car\u2019s standard voice controls, Alexa, Google or an app embedded in a smartphone.  \u201cWe believe in a future where the customer has options,\u201d said Amazon\u2019s Ned Curic, vice president of Alexa Auto at Amazon.

The company\u2019s main goal was to minimize the impact of the new rules on customers and sellers, he added.  Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy warned last month that it faced \u201csignificant customer disruption\u201d if the new rules were implemented from Feb. 1. On Friday, the company said it was disappointed the government acted in \u201chaste\u201d, but assured compliance.  \u201cWe are committed to doing everything we can to be compliant with the new rules,\u201d Flipkart India executive Rajneesh Kumar said in a statement, without explaining how the website was impacted.  POLITICS, INVESTOR SETBACK  The new policy was announced after complaints from small Indian traders who said the e-commerce giants used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace where they could offer discounts. Such arrangements will now be barred.  Both Amazon and Walmart unsuccessfully lobbied against the latest rules and pushed for a delay in their implementation. The U.S. government too urged India to protect the investments of the two retailers, Reuters reported last week.

Verdi said in a statement on Tuesday that around 1,200 workers had joined the strike that started during the Sunday to Monday night shift at warehouses in Bad Hersfeld, Koblenz and Leipzig, and is due to last until Saturday.  \u201cThe work at Amazon is tough, particularly at Christmas time, and the pressure is extremely high. Employees pay the price for Amazon\u2019s fast delivery promise to its customers,\u201d Verdi said.  An Amazon spokesman said participation in the strikes was very low and the stoppages were not affecting operations.  Amazon employs 20,000 staff across 35 sites in Germany and adds thousands of temporary workers to help cover the Christmas rush.

Scott Anderson, director of Amazon Robotics Fulfillment, said current technology is at least 10 years away from fully automating the processing of a single order picked by a worker inside a warehouse.  \u201cThere is a fallacy in the initial understanding of \u2018Are we going to be a lights-out fulfillment network in the next few years?\u2019\u201d Anderson said during a tour of Amazon\u2019s Baltimore warehouse for journalists on Tuesday.  For example, he said, the technology for a robot to pick a single product from a bin without damaging other products or picking multiple products at the same time in a way that could benefit the e-commerce retailer is years away.  Anderson said Amazon is exploring a variety of technologies to automate the process of packing merchandise into boxes but it could take a decade or more for the company to do that.  \u201cIn the current form, the technology is very limited. The technology is very far from the fully automated workstation that we would need,\u201d Anderson said.  The tour came at a time when the company has come under fire from labor groups and other Amazon critics for allegedly poor working conditions in its warehouses and for increasingly automating jobs and reducing its dependence on human labor.  The company said it is not changing the level of productivity inside its warehouses to catch up with its recent one-day shipping announcement. It is instead making changes to the transportation and delivery process.  Last month, Amazon said it plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club, Prime, in just one day instead of two.  Anderson said Amazon\u2019s current target is 4 hours from the time a product is ordered to the time it leaves the warehouse and the company is sticking with that.  The e-commerce company did not share details on how its decision to raise its minimum wage to $15 had impacted workforce turnover.  However, it said applications for seasonal jobs doubled to 850,000 at the end of October last year from the record number of applications the company received in August 2017, when it held a national job fair.  Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees in November, giving in to critics of what they said was poor pay and working conditions. (Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington Editing by Phil Berlowitz )","1103":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is planning to give more data on counterfeit goods to law enforcement in a further crackdown on fakes listed on its e-commerce sites, a person familiar with the program told Reuters.  The move comes as Amazon faces public scrutiny over how it polices counterfeits and allegedly unsafe products on its platform. Fakes have long frustrated top labels like Apple Inc and Nike Inc, discouraging some from selling via Amazon at all.  In the past, the world\u2019s largest online retailer has informed authorities of counterfeit peddlers when it thought it had enough information for police to pursue a culprit. Now, the company plans to disclose merchant information to European and U.S. federal authorities every time it confirms a counterfeit was sold to customers, increasing the frequency and volume of reporting to law enforcement, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Why the new program was happening now was not immediately clear. Amazon struck a deal with Apple in 2018 in which it agreed to rid its site of products from merchants not authorized by the Cupertino, California-based technology company. It has sued peddlers of fakes and launched a counterfeit removal tool for brands, actions in tension with its aim to increase profit by offering more products for sale.  In recent weeks, Amazon has held meetings with government authorities and related organizations to discuss its new counterfeit reporting strategy and how the company can further their enforcement efforts, the person said. The hope has been that Amazon\u2019s coveted data will help law enforcement make connections about criminals.  According to the source, Amazon will report a merchant\u2019s name, company name, product and contact information to authorities, after it confirms a business was selling fakes, closes the seller\u2019s account, and the account holder does not make a successful appeal via Amazon\u2019s typical processes.  In an April memo, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a crackdown on fakes sold via online marketplaces while the country was locked in trade talks with China, one source of counterfeits. The Trump administration also considered last year adding some Amazon websites to its \"Notorious Markets\" list for counterfeits, the Wall Street Journal on.wsj.com\/2LtUZOR reported, though similar proposals in 2018 were discarded.  The value of global trade in pirated and counterfeit goods is half a trillion dollars per year, according to an estimate cited in the Trump memo.","1104":"(Reuters) - For the second time just three weeks, a federal appeals court has determined that Amazon is not liable for facilitating the sale of a defective product manufactured by another company. Like the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in last month\u2019s Erie Insurance v. Amazon, the 6th Circuit held in Monday\u2019s Fox v. Amazon that Amazon cannot be held responsible under state product liability law because it was not the seller of the defective product \u2013 even though the product was advertised on Amazon\u2019s platform and Amazon shipped and collected payment for it.  The 4th and 6th Circuits join a long list of courts to reach that conclusion, including, most recently, an Ohio state appeals court in February in Stiner v. Amazon and two federal trial judges in March, in San Francisco\u2019s Carpenter v. Amazon and Chicago\u2019s Garber v. Amazon. The 3rd Circuit is poised to weigh in on the key question of whether Amazon is a seller under product liability law in Oberdorf v. Amazon, which was argued last October. The 9th Circuit will apparently also get a crack at the issue in the Carpenter case, in which the plaintiff docketed an appeal in April.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  The key to Amazon\u2019s strategy to avoid liability is that the company does not take title to goods manufactured by other sellers. Yes, the products are sold via Amazon\u2019s website. Yes, they\u2019re stored in its warehouses and delivered in Amazon packaging. And yes, Amazon processes customers\u2019 payments. But for the most part, courts have found that if Amazon didn\u2019t own title to products that turned out to be defective, it can\u2019t be liable as a seller of those products.  What\u2019s interesting about the 4th and 6th Circuit opinions, though, is that they show hairline fractures in Amazon\u2019s defenses. In a concurrence in the 4th Circuit\u2019s May 22 decision, Judge Diana Motz mused that longstanding product liability law does not account for newly ubiquitous Internet retailers like Amazon. It is surely no accident, Judge Motz said, that Amazon has designed its relationship with third-party sellers to avoid taking title to their products and assuming product liability risk. But she warned that \u201cconsiderations of public policy may justify a change in the common law\u201d when old laws appear outdated.  Amazon, she noted, has so far been very successful at removing product liability cases to federal courts, which are bound to apply state laws as they exist, thereby \u201cstunting,\u201d to use Judge Motz\u2019s word, the evolution of state law to reflect the role of Internet retailers. But that reckoning, she said, may yet come \u2013 from state legislators, state Supreme Courts or even the U.S. Supreme Court, which, as Judge Motz pointed out, just held in the antitrust case Apple v. Pepper that Apple should be considered a seller of iPhone apps even though it technically just facilitates their sale by app developers.  Meanwhile, in Monday\u2019s 6th Circuit opinion, written by Judge Eric Clay for a panel that included Judge Jane Stranch and U.S. District Judge Benita Pearson of Youngstown, Ohio, sitting by designation, the court concluded that mere title of an allegedly defective hoverboard wasn\u2019t enough to decide the issue of whether Amazon was a seller of the product. The hoverboard was apparently a product of a company called W2M Trading Corp, which had a third-party seller agreement with Amazon in which Amazon controlled communications with buyers and facilitated payments. (Some of the facts of Amazon\u2019s relationship with W2M and W2M\u2019s relationship with the company that fulfilled orders for the hoverboard remain murky.)  Amazon\u2019s lawyers at Perkins Coie had argued that because Tennessee has adopted the Uniform Commercial Code, a \u201cseller\u201d under Tennessee product liability law can only be someone who accepts a price to transfer title of a product to a buyer. The 6th Circuit rejected the argument, noting that Tennessee\u2019s law extends liability to people who lease defective products, and those people don\u2019t hold title. Instead, the 6th Circuit adopted the test suggested by lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case \u2013 members of the Fox family, whose home burned down when the hoverboard\u2019s battery caught fire \u2013 who argued that a seller should be construed to be anyone who exercises control over the sale or lease of a product.  But unfortunately for the Fox family, the 6th Circuit concluded that the evidence did not show conclusively that Amazon exercised sufficient control over the sale of the hoverboard to be deemed a seller. Amazon didn\u2019t choose to sell the product, set its price or make representations in the marketplace about the hoverboard\u2019s safety. So even though Amazon stored and shipped the product and processed payment for it \u2013 and even though the Foxes thought of Amazon as the product\u2019s seller \u2013 Amazon isn\u2019t liable under Tennessee product liability law, the 6th Circuit said.  \u201cWe may have helped other people\u201d suing Amazon \u201cbut we didn\u2019t help ourselves,\u201d said Steven Anderson of Anderson & Reynolds, who argued for the Foxes at the 6th Circuit. Anderson, like 4th Circuit Judge Motz in her concurrence, said state product liability laws, most of which date to the 1970s, simply never contemplated Internet retailers like Amazon, which, in his view, is a seller in all but name.  Amazon spokeswoman Cecilia Fan declined to comment.  I should point out that the 6th Circuit decision was not a complete win for Amazon. The court revived the Foxes\u2019 Tennessee tort law claim that Amazon negligently failed to provide adequate warning about the risk that hoverboard batteries would catch fire. The company did apparently send an email to Fox and other Amazon customers who had purchased hoverboards, citing \u201cnews reports of safety issues\u201d and offering \u201csome additional information about lithium ion batteries and safety tips for using products that contain them.\u201d The email did not, however, disclose that Amazon had conducted an internal investigation of hoverboards, that it had ceased sales of the products or that the safety risk included fire and explosion.  The 6th Circuit concluded that by sending the email, Amazon assumed a duty to warn customers, so the Foxes are entitled to make a case that Amazon breached its duty to provide adequate warning.  There\u2019s no doubt that Amazon designed a shrewd system to stave off exposure to product liability claims. Whether its dominance prompts a new look at old state laws remains to be seen.","1105":"A federal appeals court on Friday asked Texas\u2019 highest court to decide whether Amazon.com Inc can be held liable under the state\u2019s law for a defective product listed by a third-party seller on its website in one of a series of similar cases against the e-commerce giant around the country.  Amazon earlier this month urged the 5th U.S. District Court of Appeals to overturn a district ruling that it was a \u201cseller\u201d under Texas law of a battery from a Chinese-made knockoff Apple TV remote that injured a toddler.

Herculean research efforts have seen several promising vaccines reach the brink of approval in recent weeks. But with richer countries ordering up supplies, concerns have grown that poorer nations will miss out.

On Sunday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was concerned that not enough had been done to ensure adequate supplies of the new vaccines were available to poorer states, even as European governments and the United States snapped up supplies.

The U.S. e-commerce giant has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of global ambitions to expand in food retail.  Leclerc, France\u2019s biggest food retailer by market share, privately held operator Systeme U and Casino were all linked in recent months with Amazon, which has steadily been building its presence in France.

A sign is seen at the Nike flagship store on Fifth Ave in Manhattan, with a top floor dedicated to Nike Plus members where they can shop for exclusive merchandise, in New York, U.S., May 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Melissa Fares  Over the past two years, major U.S. retailers, including Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Kohls Corp and others, have spent billions of dollars to overhaul existing programs or launch new loyalty schemes.  According to estimates compiled by market intelligence firm Beroe, the U.S. loyalty program market was worth between $47 billion and $55 billion in 2018 in terms of spending by companies and sector analysts expect it to keep growing by 2 percent to 4 percent a year between 2018-2020.  Data from research firm LoyaltyOne showed retailers now invest at least 2 percent of their total revenue on loyalty programs and double that or more on related customer targeting and analytics. Department stores and apparel retailers typically invest more than the others.  Its report \u201cLoyalty Big Picture\u201d based on an international survey of 1,200 loyalty plan providers and some 4,500 members said 69 percent of executives reported a rise in spending on royalty schemes over the past two years, and 55 percent expected a further increase in investment in the next two years.  Around in some form for over a century, loyalty programs have long relied on a simple concept - reward shoppers with coupons, discounts, prizes or air miles and they will come back.  E-commerce has changed that.  It has made shopping around for bargains easier than ever while Amazon\u2019s Prime program set a new benchmark with perks, such as free two-day shipping, video streaming or cloud storage.  Just last month, Amazon raised the stakes again announcing it would spend $800 million to ensure one-day delivery for its Prime members.  \u201cIn the age of Amazon, it\u2019s very much \u2018what have you done for me lately type of retail environment\u2019,\u201d Matt Lindner, senior ecommerce analyst at market intelligence firm Mintel.  \u201cThe challenge these retailers are facing is how do you offer attractive rewards without totally compromising your bottom line.\u201d  Realizing that expensive advertising is unlike to win back shoppers lost to online rivals, traditional retailers have shifted their focus to retaining existing customers and making them spend more, industry analysts say.  \u2018BIGGEST AND BADDEST\u2019  Those most successful have employed sophisticated data gathering and analytics to better tailor offers to customers\u2019 tastes while providing perks that Amazon cannot match, such as private dressing rooms, members-only stores or beauty workshops.  \u201cRetailers are finally realizing that they need to respond to the \u2018biggest and baddest\u2019 loyalty program in the market right now and that is Amazon Prime,\u201d research firm Gartner director Tom Gehani said.  They have done so over the past five years by combining revamped loyalty schemes with increased online presence, in-store pickup for online purchases, upgraded stores and new or improved mobile apps that tie in with loyalty programs.  Macy\u2019s, for example, relaunched its scheme in mid-2017 after 10 straight quarters of comparable sales declines as a tiered plan with special privileges to its most loyal and big spending customers. The perks include ticketed seats to Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade sales, concerts, fashion shows and cooking classes.  When a year later, Macy\u2019s reported third quarter 2018 earnings that nearly doubled Wall Street\u2019s predictions, the department store chain attributed some of the growth to its \u201cStar Rewards\u201d program.  \u201cThe program is outperforming our expectation,\u201d Macy\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gennette said in February.  Rival Nordstrom redesigned its customer loyalty program, \u201cThe Nordy Club\u201d, in October 2018. It offers more reward points, fast redemptions, curbside pickup of purchases, and perks such as beauty and style workshops or brands not available to other shoppers. Today, the program\u2019s 11 million members account for a third of Nordstrom\u2019s customers and over half of its sales.  Members can also save items in an app that will send push notifications to remind them of their wish list once they get close enough to a Nordstrom store.  Only three or four years ago the retailer would spend most of its advertising dollars on seasonal campaigns, said Sean Claessen, executive vice president of Bond Brand Loyalty.  \u201cYou are now seeing them turn their attention to the \u2018Nordy Club\u2019 and those kind of components,\u201d he said.  Brand retailers have also joined the fray.  J Crew launched its first rewards program in July 2018 with free shipping and exclusive sales and offers, while Nike has a members-only floor at its flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City.  Members of its no-fee NikePlus program get free courier delivery for purchases at the store, exclusive access to in-demand shoes and one-on-one assessments by its experts.  \u201cMy favorite perks would be the fact that they can reserve a pair of sneakers for you, also exclusive wear where you can only get it if you\u2019re a member and birthday discounts,\u201d said Carlos Pena, 23, a college student from New York City. Pena said he bought a pair of sneakers for his 22th birthday using the program\u2019s discount.  In December, Lululemon said it was testing its first ever annual membership program for $128 with perks such as access to workout classes, free shipping and a pair of yoga pants.  \u201cThe standards of what it takes to win and keep customers are just going to keep getting higher,\u201d Gartner\u2019s Gehani said. \u201cAmazon is a company that has risen to meet that challenge and every other retailer is learning that they need to continually rise to meet that challenge too.\u201d","1109":"(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday said it would push for foreign postal carriers to pay the U.S. Postal Service more to deliver small parcels within the United States, taking up a longtime complaint by Amazon.com AMZN.O, UPS UPS.N and others who have alleged the current system is unfair.  The State Department also said it would push foreign postal services to furnish data that would help customs officials detect opioids and other illegal shipments entering the United States. That task could also add to their costs.  If successful, the effort would benefit U.S. merchants and shippers who say they are undercut by foreign postal services\u2019 access to low rates. U.S. shoppers could see higher bills for foreign goods ordered online.  The move may face pushback during meetings next month of the United Nation\u2019s Universal Postal Union, from countries like China and Brazil, which already face price hikes for mail to Europe and the United States.  On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump issued a memorandum on \u201cterminal dues,\u201d or rates one country\u2019s postal service pays another for finishing an international delivery.  \u201cThe current system of terminal dues distorts the flow of small packages around the world by incentivizing the shipping of goods from foreign countries that benefit from artificially low reimbursement rates,\u201d the memo said.  It added that the U.S. Secretary of State \u201cshall include recommendations for future action, including the possibility of adopting self-declared rates,\u201d if insufficient progress is made with the Universal Postal Union.  The policy makes Trump a surprise ally of Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, which he has accused of turning the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) into its \u201cdelivery boy.\u201d  Amazon did not return a request for comment. UPS called the administration\u2019s actions \u201ca positive step\u201d toward addressing \u201clongstanding imbalances in the global postal market.\u201d  Those companies and industry groups have sought White House meetings since last year to attack arcane postal agreements they say make it cheaper to air-mail goods to Los Angeles from Beijing than from New York.  Others say the issue is not so simple. USPS claims to save money on outbound shipments thanks to the Universal Postal Union\u2019s exchange system, and rates for countries such as China have already been negotiated to rise by 2021 to a significant percentage of USPS\u2019s costs, the same rate USPS pays other countries.  Mighty Mug CEO Jayme Smaldone, who has found merchants in China cheaply shipping knock-offs of his products directly to U.S. consumers, said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that should be phased out over years.

Amazon\u2019s massive online presence could help bolster Reliance\u2019s consumer and private labels business. More importantly, a potential partnership will help the duo counter Walmart, which last year invested $16 billion in India\u2019s Flipkart, in their battle for a bigger share of India\u2019s fast-growing e-commerce market.  In late December, India modified rules around foreign direct investment (FDI) in e-commerce, creating additional hurdles for companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, and giving companies such as Reliance an edge.  Amazon had made the proposal to Reliance for the partnership, but it was not clear whether a deal would materialize, said one of the sources.  The second source said Amazon had been pondering a proposal to purchase an up to 26% stake in the Reliance unit since at least February.  \u201cFor Amazon, it is about neutralizing a major rival and allowing itself to grow,\u201d said the second source, who added the company envisions helping Reliance\u2019s roughly 40 brands and grocery products go online.  Further details of the possible deal, first reported by India\u2019s Economic Times newspaper on Thursday, were not immediately clear.  Amazon and Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Amazon had on Thursday declined to comment, while Reliance had said it would make any disclosures to stock exchanges as and when necessary.  Reliance could potentially leverage Amazon\u2019s global experience in technology, supply chain and logistics as it aims to connect grocery stores across the country digitally through its Jio telecoms network - the biggest in India by subscribers.  For Amazon, picking up a stake in a Reliance unit could mean getting access to the Jio telecoms platform and its vast retail footprint of more than 10,600 stores across India. It might also add more firepower to their lobbying efforts, as the Ambani family is viewed as being well-connected politically.  Seattle-based Amazon is keen to get a bigger share of India\u2019s e-commerce market, which Deloitte expects to more than treble to $84 billion between 2017 and 2021. Reliance was previously in talks with China\u2019s Alibaba to sell a stake in Reliance Retail, but a deal could not be sealed due to differences in valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The service, currently available to Amazon\u2019s Prime Now customers in Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and parts of London, will be rolled out to Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, Sheffield and Portsmouth this year, the companies said on Thursday.  It allows Amazon Prime customers to order a full Morrisons shop online, which is then picked at a local store, and delivered by Amazon, with an option for delivery within one hour of the order being placed in some locations.  The service will be expanded to more British cities in future, the companies said.  Morrisons, Britain\u2019s fourth-biggest supermarket group behind Walmart\u2019s Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and market leader Tesco, also provides food in a wholesale deal for Amazon\u2019s \u201cFresh\u201d and \u201cPantry\u201d grocery offers.  The U.S. online giant has gradually extended its food offer in Britain, but according to market researchers Kantar Worldpanel, its market share is still less than 1%.  Shares in Morrisons were up 1.5%, outperforming a weak sector after a trading update from Tesco showed sales growth slowing. Tesco\u2019s shares were down 2%, while Sainsbury\u2019s was down 0.5%.  Jefferies analyst James Grzinic said that, given the urban skew of Prime Now customers, the tie-up would provide an opportunity for Morrisons to increase sales in parts of Britain where it is under-represented.","1121":"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com Inc, said it will help astronomers in Chile crunch huge troves of data using its cloud computing services, a symbolically important step for the retail-to-entertainment giant as it looks to expand in Latin America.

Amazon - which controls nearly one-third of the global cloud computing business, ahead of rivals Microsoft Corp and Google - has until recently struggled to lure public institutions in Latin America to store their data online instead of on physical machines.  At a ceremony announcing the project in Santiago on Tuesday, Chile Economy Minister Jose Ramon Valente said the country had selected Amazon to provide the infrastructure for the initiative, calling it \u201cone of the largest centers for the study of big data in the world.\u201d  \u201cOur objective was to create an organization that would be open to the community, and neutral, that could make the best use of the ... data that is generated in our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want this to be very inclusive.\u201d  Chilean officials have previously told Reuters tools developed for the astrodata project would also be applicable for a wide variety of other uses, such as tracking potential shop-lifters, fare-evaders on public transport or spotting anomalies in banking or medical datasets.  Valente said the data and tools could also be used to assist in the country\u2019s mining sector, as well as in the study of climate change.  Kratz said Amazon, which has invested \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d in the project, would itself not have access to the data, which will remain encrypted. Access will be granted to participants selected by the non-profit Chilean Data Observatory.  The deal also comes amid speculation about where in the region the tech giant will install its next data center, which would allow local firms and government to store information on the cloud. Chile and Argentina are both vying for Amazon\u2019s investment.  Economy Minister Valente said the project bodes well for Chile\u2019s relationship with Amazon.  \u201cThis alliance with Amazon shows that Amazon believes in Chile,\u201d he said.  AWS is a lucrative and fast-growing part of Amazon\u2019s overall business. The company said in January that fourth-quarter revenue for the unit had surged 45 percent to $7.43 billion.  Kratz said the company was constantly reevaluating its options for new investments but had no further announcements.","1122":"Sept 12 (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators on Thursday said Amazon.com Inc should stop working with delivery contractors that violate labor laws by imposing unfair conditions on drivers delivering packages for the e-commerce company.

The third-quarter results were the second time running that billionaire Jeff Bezos' firm had fallen short of sales targets and, allied to a similar disappointment from Google-owner Alphabet GOOGL.O, they sent a shockwave through stock markets.  There were no ratings downgrades from the Wall Street analysts who have almost universally backed the companies\u2019 long-term prospects but several said there were signs that both were beginning to face tougher competition from tech peers as well as the retail companies Amazon has bullied in recent years.  The fall of as much as 9 percent in shares knocked more than $80 billion off Amazon's market value and relegated it behind Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O in terms of market value.  Now that the Seattle-based firm has devoured retail players like Borders, Sears and Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, it is facing bigger challenges from multinationals who are making substantial investments to compete, D.A. Davidson & Co analyst Thomas Forte said.  \u201cGoogle, Microsoft, and Walmart ... are more difficult to kill,\u201d he said.  Shares in Alphabet dropped about 2 percent after it fell short on sales after beating estimates for the past eight quarters.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Revenue from Amazon\u2019s international business, which brings in 27.5 percent of total sales, was at the heart of the shortfall in results, growth halving to 13.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see any real structural issue with Amazon but nearly every line in the business is decelerating a tad and we typically see another deceleration in retail in 4Q, hence are struggling to identify a catalyst,\u201d Barclays analyst Ross Sandler said.  Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin saw two possible reasons Amazon forecast a holiday shopping quarter weaker than anticipated by Wall Street.  \u201cThey are worried about the macro. The second thing is they\u2019re worried about competition,\u201d he said, noting that there were both signs of a slowing economy and that major retailers were aggressively deploying strategies to compete with Amazon for holiday sales.  Amazon expected sales in the holiday quarter leading up to Christmas to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, to as much as $72.5 billion, while analysts on average had expected $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates.  Several analysts called the company\u2019s outlook conservative and said any outright dip in profit seems highly unlikely.  \u201cOverall, Amazon\u2019s growth trajectory remains solid, including advertising, grocery, pharmacy, and specialty retail, as well as Amazon Business ($10 billion in sales in eight countries) and Amazon Web Services,\u201d Telsey Advisory Group analysts said.  Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all continued growth in cloud services but with signs of deceleration.  In the latest quarterly reports, Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing business Azure marked revenue growth of 76 percent, down from 89 percent in the previous quarter. Google\u2019s other revenue, which includes its cloud business, grew 29 percent on year, 4 percent below estimates of Cowen & Co. analysts. Amazon\u2019s cloud business saw a 46 percent rise in revenue to $6.68 billion, only narrowly edging past estimates of $6.67 billion.  \u201cIn general the cloud business will continue to grow but not at the previous pace and that\u2019s an indication of the market maturity,\u201d says Sid Nag, senior director, cloud technologies and services, Gartner Research.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo\/File Photo  BERLIN (Reuters) - Amazon.com is lowering the fee it charges in Germany for delivering groceries through its Fresh service and allowing its Prime subscribers to pay per order instead of committing to monthly membership, the U.S. company said on Thursday.  Amazon said last month it would eliminate its grocery delivery charge for Prime members in the United States and make shopping easier by combining AmazonFresh and Whole Foods Market ordering on a single site, as it battles rival grocery sellers.  On Thursday, Amazon said it would cut the monthly membership fee for Fresh in Germany to 7.99 euros ($8.80) from 9.99 euros and also reduce the additional delivery fee for orders worth less than 40 euros to 3.99 euros from a previous 5.99 euros.  It is also allowing Prime members to pay 5.99 euros per delivery without having to sign up for separate Fresh membership and is offering a 20 euro discount for new customers who spend above 60 euros and discounts for the first five orders.  The reduction does not apply to Amazon\u2019s separate Prime Now service, which delivers products including fresh groceries within an hour in Berlin and Munich, or its Pantry service, which sells non-perishable groceries.  Amazon last month forecast revenue and profit below Wall Street\u2019s expectations, amid surging costs related to its drive to speed up shipping times around the world.  Deutsche Post DHL said in August it would no longer deliver fresh food in Germany for Amazon as the market for food ecommerce had been disappointing.  Amazon launched its Fresh service in 2007 in Seattle and expanded it to Germany, its second biggest market, in 2017, but still only delivers in Berlin, Potsdam, Hamburg and Munich.  Online sales of food have grown slower in Germany than in many developed markets, partly due to the high density of discount stores like Aldi and Lidl. Ecommerce only made up about 1.2% of food sales in Germany in 2018, according to the HDE retail association.","1125":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  This move, known as labor sharing, highlights how the ecommerce giant is reallocating some of its vast workforce to handle a spike in online sales of groceries, as millions of American are stuck at home amid the COVID-19 outbreak.  Amazon offers online grocery services through Amazon Fresh from its own grocery warehouses, and Amazon Prime Now, which delivers from its Whole Foods stores.  \u201cThe Prime Now business has seen a mass increase in volume and is now offering labor share opportunities,\u201d Amazon said in a message sent to warehouse workers in Maryland, which was reviewed by Reuters. Workers in other states where Amazon operates grocery services have received similar communications, including California, Nevada, and Tennessee.  Employees who are selected to make the switch can make $19 per hour, a $2 raise on top of the pay hike Amazon announced earlier this month. Amazon Fresh positions require working in a freezer environment, while a Prime Now shopper role entails picking and packing products for online orders in a Whole Foods store under tight time limits.  \u201cAs we continue to see a significant increase in demand for grocery orders, we are offering temporary opportunities for associates across our fulfillment network to provide additional support,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said on late Friday, confirming the action.  Amazon has been doubling down on the grocery industry since its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017. It has expanded grocery delivery service to over 2,000 cities. Free for Prime subscribers, AmazonFresh and Amazon Prime Now tout quick delivery within hours.  Since the outbreak, grocery delivery has become a lifeline for people to get household staples while trying to avoid stepping outside. Grocery shoppers on Amazon have frequently seen items out of stock and delivery windows unavailable as the company struggles to meet the rising demand. It has announced the hiring of 100,000 full and part-time positions across the U.S. in fulfillment and delivery networks, including in AmazonFresh and Whole Foods delivery.  So far, coronavirus has spread to at least 17 Amazon warehouses in the U.S., prompting workers and lawmakers to question if enough safety measures have been taken to protect employees on the frontlines.  Grocery stores are competing for workers to fulfill online orders. Walmart, with a fast growing online grocery business, plans to hire 150,000 employees at stores, distribution and fulfillment centers through May.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a dramatic increase in the use of online grocery shopping,\u201d said Bill Bishop, co-founder of Brick Meets Click. \u201cAmazon eventually wants to be one of the very dominant distributors of grocery in the United States, and I think they\u2019re looking at this as a period when they\u2019ve got a chance to ramp that up by actions like this.\u201d","1127":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru, India, April 20, 2018.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  The company also said its investment in faster shipping was starting to pay off, with revenue rising 20% to $63.4 billion in the second quarter ended in June. That topped analysts\u2019 estimates and the 17% rate of growth that Amazon posted in April.  Shares fell more than 1% in after-hours trade.  Seattle-based Amazon has drawn more than 100 million paid subscribers to its loyalty club Prime by releasing original TV shows, equipping more gadgets with its voice assistant Alexa and offering quick shipping for countless goods, including groceries from its subsidiary Whole Foods Market.  Now, it is investing heavily to halve delivery times to one day for Prime members, to stay ahead of rivals such as Walmart Inc WMT.N that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees. So far Amazon has expanded one-day delivery to more than 10 million items, a fraction of the 100 million-plus goods it offers in two days in the United States.  The cost slightly exceeded the $800 million Amazon had forecast it would spend on the initiative in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.

Amazon\u2019s profit inched up to $2.6 billion in the quarter, short of $2.8 billion that analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Operating expenses had jumped about 21%.  The money Amazon is sinking into delivery shows how the world\u2019s largest online retailer is not immune to competition, said Neil Saunders, managing director at research firm GlobalData.  \u201cIt is a necessary evil,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cAmazon exists in a world where a lot of retailers have the advantage of allowing customers to pick things up the same day in stores,\u201d with far larger brick-and-mortar footprints than Amazon can boast.  SLOWING CLOUD?  Amazon\u2019s slowing revenue growth has in part reflected the evolving nature of its business. The company is gradually moving away from low-margin retail toward a marketplace model where it collects lucrative fees for helping other merchants on its site ship and advertise their products.  Revenue from seller services grew 23% to $12.0 billion in the second quarter, while ad and other sales increased 37% to $3.0 billion.  Though profitable, the dual retail and marketplace model has drawn scrutiny. Earlier this month, the European Commission launched an antitrust probe into whether Amazon\u2019s use of other merchants\u2019 data offered an unfair advantage to its retail unit, which has made private-label versions of popular products.  The U.S. Justice Department also said Tuesday it would look into whether Big Tech engaged in any anticompetitive practices, including in online retail.  Olsavsky declined to discuss the matter.  At the same time, sales growth for Amazon's cloud unit fell below 40% for the first time in years. The unit, which handles data storage and computing operations for other enterprises, raked in $8.4 billion in revenue in the second quarter, or 37% more than the year prior. Nascent competitor Google GOOGL.O on Thursday reported a doubling of cloud revenue to about $2 billion, from its last disclosure of $1 billion at the end of 2017.  CFO Olsavsky said Amazon Web Services\u2019 revenue was strong, though sales cycles fluctuate depending on the timing of customers\u2019 migration to the cloud.  \u201cWe\u2019re growing faster than anyone\u201d on a dollar basis, he said.  Still, that is not sufficient to cover the stepped-up investments that Amazon has planned for this year. It now is gearing up for the winter holiday shopping season. It is expanding a variety of its U.S. services globally. And it has beefed up AWS sales staff and overall marketing, which included a live-streamed concert with pop star Taylor Swift to promote its summer \u201cPrime Day\u201d sale.  These bets and others further afield, like its recent investments in electric and self-driving car companies, show how Amazon has been happy to forgo short-term income for long-term gains. The company for years had been known for rollercoaster profits.  Overall for the third quarter, Amazon said it expects operating income between $2.1 billion and $3.1 billion, versus $3.7 billion the year prior. Analysts were expecting $4.4 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet.

At an Amazon warehouse and shipping centre at Saran just outside Orleans, a city south of Paris, some 250-300 workers staged a strike, gathering outside the site and calling for its closure. It normally employs some 1,800 full-time staff.  Unions representing employees there and in other Amazon hubs in France said some workers were unwilling to potentially expose themselves to the coronavirus.  \u201cFewer than 1% of our stocks are groceries, so we\u2019re far from being indispensable for the country to keep going,\u201d said Julien Vincent, who represents Amazon logistics workers for France\u2019s CFDT. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, either everyone has to close, or no one does - you can\u2019t have half-measures.\u201d  Vincent estimated that 30%-40% of Amazon employees in France had now dropped out of work for fear of coronavirus contagion or because they had to keep children at home after French schools closed. The company had called on temporary workers to make up for any shortages, he added.  Amazon had also offered to negotiate salary increases for those who stayed on, he said.  Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Several hundred people at Amazon have now exercised a French right to stop work while still receiving full pay, according to Vincent and another union official.  Protestors at the Saran site were also demonstrating to be allowed to apply this rule, an official at the CGT union there said, saying that employees had been told by Amazon managers that it might be contested.  With shopping in stores now banned, demand for Amazon deliveries is surging, particularly for household staples and medical supplies, the U.S. company told its sellers on Tuesday.  Amazon said it would take in only essential supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, to free up inventory space for these products. They include baby products, beauty and personal care items, pet supplies, books and industrial and scientific goods.  Amazon will not stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys, but those products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks as a result.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Friday said its longtime executive and consumer chief Jeff Wilke plans to retire after more than two decades with the company, a decision that appeared to take him out of line to succeed CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.  Dave Clark, 47, another Amazon veteran who has run the retailer\u2019s supply chain and delivery operations, will step into Wilke\u2019s role, the company said in a filing. Wilke aims to retire in the first quarter of next year to explore personal interests, he said in a note to staff that was shared with Reuters.  Wilke, 53, is Amazon\u2019s second-highest ranking officer along with Andy Jassy, who is chief executive of the company\u2019s cloud computing division. That made Wilke a contender to take over the top job from Bezos, 56, if he were to leave. Amazon declined to comment on succession plans.  Bezos, who became the world\u2019s richest person as Amazon\u2019s stock soared, said in another note to staff that Wilke\u2019s \u201clegacy and impact will live on long after he departs.\u201d  Wilke joined Amazon as vice president in 1999 when the young company still sent corporate workers to help pack orders during the holiday shopping season. Now, he oversees a range of businesses including online and physical stores and the loyalty club Prime, which helped make Amazon the world\u2019s largest internet retailer.  Wilke said in his note that he does not have a new job and is \u201cas happy with and proud of Amazon as ever,\u201d but he wants to move on and step aside for others.  Clark, who will take over, currently is Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide operations. He built out the company\u2019s air cargo fleet and last-mile service that now delivers more packages for Amazon than any other U.S. carrier.

The market, in the Woodland Hills neighborhood, is called the Amazon Fresh grocery store. It is the first location to let customers in - by invitation only - out of seven that Amazon has confirmed for Southern California and greater Chicago. The Woodland Hills site will open to the wider public in coming weeks, Amazon said.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer has experimented with physical stores in recent years to capture more consumer spending, particularly in groceries. It has more than 20 cashier-less shops with grab-and-go food for office workers and over 500 stores in the Whole Foods Market chain it acquired in 2017.  Amazon\u2019s latest concept faces stiff competition from far larger incumbents Kroger Co and Albertsons Companies Inc.  It is roughly the size of a Whole Foods store at 35,000 square feet (3,252 square meters) but serves a different need, not focused on natural and organic items, said Amazon Vice President Jeff Helbling.  \u201cWe feature a lot of national brands,\u201d he said in an interview.

Amazon last month posted its biggest quarterly profit ever due to online sales during the coronavirus pandemic, but a 13% drop in physical store revenue.","1133":"EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 30 (Reuters) - Standing before an audience of 14,000 people last year, Walmart Inc executives described a radical plan to help it fend off Amazon.com Inc and other online delivery services from stealing its customers.  Walmart\u2019s own store employees would bring online orders directly to shoppers\u2019 homes after completing their usual shifts of up to nine hours on the sales floors. Aiming to lower the retailer\u2019s shipping costs by tapping its massive workforce, the program was part of a multi-pronged strategy to boost its $11.5 billion U.S. ecommerce business and tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the so-called \u201clast mile\u201d of delivering goods to online customers.  Its workers, meanwhile, could earn extra money on top of their hourly pay, which starts at $11 an hour.  \u201cJust imagine associates all over the world delivering orders to customers on their way home,\u201d Marc Lore, head of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce operations, said at its annual meeting in June 2017. \u201cThat can be a real game-changer.\u201d  But months later, Walmart quietly retreated from its original vision for the pilot program - launched in New Jersey and Arkansas - and ended it altogether in January, according to company documents obtained by Reuters and interviews with more than two dozen Walmart employees.  The story behind the foundering employee delivery initiative, which has not been reported, offers insight into Walmart\u2019s ongoing attempts to find unconventional ways to close the gap with Amazon in the game of cheap, rapid, doorstep delivery of packages. According to Walmart data, people who shop in stores and become online customers spend nearly twice as much as those who shop at one or the other.  Here in New Jersey, Walmart started the program with the idea that store employees could courier all items that would fit in a car. But the initiative failed to gain traction with skeptical employees who had to use their time after work, according to sixteen workers who participated in the trial.  Walmart is now testing a more modest service with just four Walmart employees who deliver goods from a single store in Woodstock, Georgia, Reuters has learned. In this latest initiative, Walmart is also overhauling the guidelines for employees and limiting deliveries to groceries and related items such as paper plates.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman confirmed that the retailer ended its first experiment early this year, without elaborating. Walmart is testing a variety of ways to deliver merchandise, she said, and is \u201cencouraged by what we\u2019re seeing\u201d in the Georgia store.  Despite having 4,700 U.S. stores within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Walmart is still trying to figure out how to efficiently make deliveries and has poured billions of dollars into ecommerce in recent years.  But as recently as the last holiday season, its online sales disappointed some investors.  Walmart caters to U.S. online shoppers by having them drive up to their local store themselves to collect merchandise they ordered online. It also partners with shippers such as FedEx Corp, the United States Postal Service (USPS) for routine deliveries.  Still, Walmart aims to be able to deliver groceries to more than 40 percent of households in the country by the end of this year. Globally, Walmart is experimenting with deliveries by motorbike in Mexico and with new small supermarkets in China to make deliveries in 30 minutes or less. In Japan, Walmart is opening a new warehouse to support orders, and expanding its online offerings to include meal kits.  Earlier this year, Reuters reported the retailer\u2019s delivery partnerships with Uber and Lyft ended after the ride-hailing services struggled to deliver people and packages together. It continues to rely on third-party companies such as Postmates, Deliv and Doordash to help deliver groceries, and last week partnered with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo.  SKEPTICAL DRIVERS  Walmart\u2019s associate delivery pilot program in the leafy, middle-class suburb of East Brunswick, New Jersey, started with store managers pitching employees an unusual new way to boost pay. Those who passed background checks could moonlight as drivers for the Walmart.com delivery service, they said.  Some staffers, who did not wish to be named fearing retribution for speaking to the media, told Reuters they balked at having to use their own cars and personal insurance policies for a program that would benefit Walmart.  To entice them to sign up, Walmart offered free TVs and iPads as gifts, they said. Eventually, about 50 of the store\u2019s more than 150 associates initially signed up, they added, though many had no prior experience as couriers with a delivery service.  Walmart declined comment on this.  Fourteen of the sixteen Walmart employees told Reuters that they were put off by the program\u2019s poor compensation. And all of them expressed concern over who would be responsible if they got into an accident or if merchandise was lost.  For example, the East Brunswick Walmart paid store associates $2 per package, with participants making three to five total drop-offs during a typical trip within a ten mile radius, participants told Reuters. It also reimbursed them 54 cents for fuel per mile, over the federal fuel reimbursement rate of 53.5 cents in 2017, and offered them an extra hour of overtime pay.  But every employee Reuters spoke to who signed up said they typically lost at least 30 minutes of time, waiting at the store after their shifts ended to collect the items and were never compensated for it.  Walmart didn\u2019t offer more than one hour of overtime even if it took more than an hour to deliver orders after finishing their 40 hour work week, former participants said. Walmart disputed this saying it paid workers overtime when they exceeded 40 hours.  All sixteen workers who had participated in the program said delivery of five packages would generally take them more than two hours to complete. If a worker drove 10 miles to drop five packages, that would earn them $15.40 in compensation per package and fuel, before overtime pay.  Rival Amazon pays independent drivers $18 to $25 an hour for deliveries, and the fuel costs belong to the driver, according to the Amazon Flex website. Amazon declined to comment on the story.  One of the Walmart employees said in only one instance did she earn an additional $100 at the end of the week \u2013 after making nearly a dozen deliveries.  \u201cThe money was never worth it... and they stopped paying mileage in the end,\u201d said an employee who did not wish to be named.  Twelve out of sixteen employees said they were not paid mileage for the final deliveries they made before the program was shut. Walmart did not comment on mileage payments that employees said were not made.  As for insurance, risk and liability for accidents and lost packages, many of the employees Reuters spoke with said they were unclear if Walmart would shoulder the responsibility or not.  DOWN TO A TEAM OF FOUR  Now, an initiative known internally as \u2018Associate Delivery 2.0\u2019 is being run with four employees hired specifically as delivery drivers in Woodstock, Georgia, according to company documents and interviews.  To build demand, Walmart will waive the fee for the first delivery order if it is for $50 or more, according to a Walmart promotional pamphlet at the store. For subsequent orders, the retailer\u2019s mobile app offered delivery on a minimum $30 order for a fee of $7.99 to $9.95.  The team of three men and one woman, working separately, load up their cars to make deliveries to shoppers within ten miles.  Maurice Thomas, who is one of the four Walmart employees, illustrates the retailer\u2019s new tack. A hybrid between a delivery driver and a store employee, Thomas\u2019s role is newly created to revive the initiative, he and other store employees in Georgia said.  Thomas took a job at the Woodstock store three years ago unloading trucks. Now he uses his own car, fuel and personal insurance to deliver 6 to 7 packages to shopper\u2019s homes every day.  \u201cI have a fixed schedule and doing this is much better than unloading trucks,\u201d said Thomas, who is 28.  Walmart pays Thomas $12.50 an hour and reimburses 54.5 cents a mile, comparable to the 54.5 federal fuel reimbursement rate in 2018, he said. If Thomas drove 10 miles within an hour to make deliveries, he would earn $18.30.  Thomas said every two weeks he is usually left with about $130-$140 dollars after buying fuel.  Walmart informed employees in Georgia they would have to use their own car insurance policies when they were hired, Blakeman said. But the retailer will cover any expenses that their personal insurance policies won\u2019t cover, she added.  An internal document seen by Reuters provides Walmart delivery workers with a specific new protocol. Among the guidelines: \u201cdo not mix orders\u201d and \u201cmake sure you have your \u2018thank you\u2019 cards ready\u201d to leave inside their deliveries.  \u201cWe\u2019re testing and learning how best to use associates,\u201d said Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for pilots.\u201d","1134":"April 26 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc:  * AMAZON.COM CFO SAYS WILL INCREASE ANNUAL PRICE OF PRIME FOR U.S. MEMBERS - CONF CALL  * AMAZON.COM CFO SAYS EFFECTIVE MAY 11, GOING TO INCREASE PRICE OF U.S. ANNUAL PLAN FROM $99 TO $119 FOR NEW MEMBERS - CONF CALL  * AMAZON\u2019S AD AND OTHER REVENUE INCREASE INCLUDES $560 MILLION RISE DUE TO ACCOUNTING CHANGE - OFFICIAL  * AMAZON.COM CFO SAYS THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES OVER TIME TO HAVE MORE ADVERTISING IN ITS VIDEO STREAMS - CONF CALL Further company coverage:","1135":"March 20 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc:  * AMAZON SAYS LAUNCHING AWS DIAGNOSTIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE, WITH $20 MILLION TO SUPPORT CUSTOMERS WORKING ON DIAGNOSTICS SOLUTIONS Source text - bit.ly\/3diIRfZ Further company coverage:","1136":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Thursday that it ordered Amazon.com Inc and eBay Inc to stop selling a wide range of pesticide products on their platforms, including those that are falsely marketed as being effective against the novel coronavirus.

The e-commerce company now handles delivery for the majority of U.S. orders through its in-house logistics arm, and is expected to sink nearly $1.5 billion this holiday season alone into halving fulfillment times to one day for Prime loyalty customers. Delivery that is faster than what retail rivals can offer has been key to Prime, a paid subscription program that incentivizes its 100-plus million members to do more of their shopping on Amazon.

Wednesday\u2019s filing includes investments by Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, but does not say who bought and sold what.  Buffett told CNBC this month that the 483,300 share Amazon investment, which would now be worth $904 million, was made by Combs or Weschler, and that he had been \u201can idiot\u201d for not investing in Amazon himself.  The investment tightens the relationship between Buffett and fellow billionaire Bezos, whose companies teamed up last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co to create a venture, Haven, to reduce their employees\u2019 healthcare costs.  Berkshire also invests in JPMorgan, and boosted its holdings in the largest U.S. bank by 19 percent in the first quarter to 59.5 million shares, worth $6.02 billion.  Bezos has also drawn praise from longtime Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.  \u201cI don\u2019t mind not having caught Amazon early.

Berkshire also owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer.  It often buys stocks when buying whole companies appear too costly.

The talks, which have been little reported on so far and which were described to Reuters by Chilean officials and an astronomer, are aimed at fuelling growth in Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud computing business in Latin America and boosting its data processing capabilities.  President Sebastian Pinera\u2019s center-right government, which is seeking to wean Chile\u2019s $325 billion economy from reliance on copper mining, announced last week it plans to pool data from all its telescopes onto a virtual observatory stored in the cloud, without giving a timeframe. The government talked of the potential for astrodata innovation, but did not give details.  The government did not comment on companies that might host astrodata in the computing cloud.  Amazon executives have been holding discussions with the Chilean government for two years about a possible data center to provide infrastructure for local firms and the government to store information on the cloud, an official at InvestChile, the government\u2019s investment body, told Reuters.  For at least some of that time, the talks have included discussion about the possibility of Amazon Web Services (AWS), hosting astrodata, astronomer Chris Smith said, based on email exchanges he was part of between AWS and Chilean Economy Ministry officials over the last six months. Smith was at the time mission head of AURA observatory, which manages three of the U.S. federally-funded telescope projects in Chile.  Jeffrey Kratz, AWS\u2019s General Manager for Public Sector for Latin American, Caribbean and Canada, has visited Chile for talks with Pinera. He confirmed the company\u2019s interest in astrodata but said Amazon had no announcements to make at present.  \u201cChile is a very important country for AWS,\u201d he said in an email to Reuters. \u201cWe kept being amazed about the incredible work on astronomy and the telescopes, as real proof points on innovation and technology working together.\u201d  \u201cThe Chilean telescopes can benefit from the cloud by eliminating the heavy lifting of managing IT,\u201d Kratz added.  A view of the Milky Way from an area of Puyehue National Park near Osorno City, Chile, May 8, 2008. REUTERS\/Ivan Alvarado  AWS is a fast-growing part of Amazon\u2019s overall business. In July it reported second-quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up by 49 percent over the same period a year ago, accounting for 12 percent of Amazon\u2019s overall sales.  STAR-GAZING TO SHOP-LIFTING  Chile is home to 70 percent of global astronomy investment, thanks to the cloudless skies above its northern Atacama desert, the driest on earth. Within five years, the South American country will host three of the world\u2019s four next-generation, billion-dollar telescopes, according to Smith.  He and Economy Ministry officials leading the Chilean initiative to store astrodata in the cloud saw potential in more Earth-bound matters.  The particular tools developed for the astrodata project could be applicable for a wide variety of other uses, such as tracking potential shop-lifters, fare-evaders on public transport and endangered animals, Julio Pertuze, a ministry official, told Reuters at the event announcing Chile\u2019s aim to build a virtual observatory on the cloud.  Smith added that the same technology could also be applied to medicine and banking to spot anomalies in large datasets.  Amazon, whose founder and largest shareholder Jeff Bezos is well known for his interest in space, already provides a cloud platform for the Hubble Telescope\u2019s data and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia.  As Amazon explores the potential in Chile\u2019s astrodata, tech rival Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, is already a member of Chile\u2019s Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will be fully operational in Cerro Pachon in 2022. Google also has a data center established in the country.  Justin Burr, senior PR associate for AI and Machine learning at Google, declined to comment on any Google plans around astrodata or its involvement in other telescope projects.  Separately, a Google spokeswoman said last week that the company will announce expansion plans for its Chilean data center on Sept. 12.  GIANT DATABASE  Smith said that what the Chileans are calling the Astroinformatics Initiative - to harness the potential of astrodata - could enable Amazon Web Services access to the research that astronomers are doing on projects like the LSST.  \u201cWe are going to have to go through a huge database of billions of stars to find the three stars that an astronomer wants,\u201d Smith said, adding that was not too different from searching a database of billions of people to find the right profile for a targeted advertisement.  \u201cSo a tool that might get developed in LSST or the astronomical world could be applicable for Amazon in their commercial world.\u201d  Since speaking to Reuters, Smith has moved on from his job heading AURA to a new position at the U.S. National Science Foundation.  Amazon\u2019s role in the astrodata project would also give it an entry into a market where it is seeking to expand. Amazon - which controls nearly one-third of the global cloud computing business, ahead of rivals Microsoft Corp and Google - has struggled to lure public institutions in Latin America, including research facilities, to store their data online instead of on physical machines.  AWS declined to provide any information on the size of its regional business in Latin America.  Economy Minister Jose Ramon Valente said at last week\u2019s announcement, \u201cChile has enormous potential in its pristine skies not only in the observation of the universe but also in the amount of data that observation generates.\u201d","1140":"BERLIN (Reuters) - German retailer Metro AG plans to sell its struggling Real hypermarkets and is confident of interest in the chain, though bankers played down talk it might attract Amazon and a price tag of up to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).  FILE PHOTO: German retailer Metro AG sign is seen on the headquarters in Duesseldorf, Germany March 02, 2018. REUTERS\/Thilo Schmuelgen\/File Photo  Industry bankers contacted by Reuters said private equity firms were the most likely bidders and that Metro might have to effectively pay a buyer to take the chain off its hands.  Foreign players have shunned the cut-throat German grocery market, which is dominated by discounters Aldi and Lidl, since Walmart took a loss of $1 billion when it sold its stores to Metro and pulled out of the country in 2006.  Metro says it wants to focus on its wholesale business which serves independent traders, hotels and restaurants and is more shielded from ecommerce, while doing more delivery to customers.  \u201cThe fact that we repeatedly had expressions of interest shows that we can take up the journey again,\u201d Metro\u2019s chief executive Olaf Koch told journalists on Friday.  Metro previously tried to sell Real in 2012 and a consortium of Apollo and Towerbrook made an offer, as did KKR, before the retailer opted instead to restructure the chain.  Koch expected the sales process to take up to eight months.  HSBC\u2019s European retail analyst, Andrew Porteous, welcomed the plan and raised his price target for Metro shares to 14 euros from 11.50 euros.  \u201cIncreased focus is a positive,\u201d he said in a note. \u201cWe have consistently held that Metro needed to simplify in order to create value.\u201d  Large European retailers such as Ahold, Carrefour, Auchan, Tesco are unlikely to bid for Real, people familiar with the industry said.  The chain may attract more interest from investors such as Apollo-backed Alteri, owner of Babywalz and CBR Fashion Group or from other private equity firms.  Buyout groups, have had mixed results though with retail in Germany and several deals - such as Sun Capital\u2019s Neckermann investment - have turned sour.  Some analysts speculated Amazon could be interested after its acquisition of U.S. grocery chain Whole Foods last year. Germany is its second biggest market after the United States.  \u201cGermany\u2019s grocery ecommerce is very underdeveloped and Germany is a very important country for Amazon,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, adding a price of around 1 billion euros would be no hurdle for the ecommerce giant.  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment and the buyout groups named either declined to comment or were not immediately available.  FINDING A BUYER  Real has suffered from tough competition from the advance of online players like Amazon and has sought to build up an online grocery business in recent years. Its ecommerce still only accounts for 2 percent of its 7.2 billion euro sales.  The business posted a loss and saw sales slide 7.2 percent in the latest quarter, which it blamed on an early Easter and unusually hot weather.  Bankers do not view Real as high on Amazon\u2019s shopping list. One said Real could be sold for \u201cnear zero at best\u201d, while another said Metro may have to pay to offload the business.  Koch said selling Real was not connected to Daniel Kretinsky buying a stake in Metro last month, although he said the company had met the Czech billionaire, whose move prompted speculation he could make a full bid and take Metro private.  Analysts said a financial investor might be interested in the real estate value of the 65 hypermarkets that Real owns, while other options could be a sale of parcels of stores to chains like Lidl or dominant supermarket group Edeka.  However, peers need to tread carefully to avoid anti-trust concerns like those that dogged Edeka\u2019s purchase of loss-making chain Kaiser\u2019s in 2015.  One of the bankers said fellow German supermarket chain Kaufland, held by Lidl owner Schwarz Group, could show an interest in some sites.

The deal\u2019s rationale and price tag, previously unreported, underscore how Amazon aims to do more than sell another popular camera, as analysts had thought. The online retailer is exploring chips exclusive to Blink that could lower production costs and lengthen the battery life of other gadgets, starting with Amazon\u2019s Cloud Cam and potentially extending to its family of Echo speakers, one of the people said.  Amazon views its in-house devices as key to deepening its relationship with shoppers. The Cloud Cam and Echo currently need a plug-in power source to operate. Blink, which says its cameras can last two years on a single pair of AA lithium batteries, could change that.  Amazon declined to comment on the acquisition\u2019s terms or strategy.  The deal so far has drawn little attention. The camera maker announced its takeover by Amazon with scant details in a Dec. 21 blog post. Analysts have viewed Blink as part of the retailer\u2019s strategy for Amazon Key, a new program where shoppers can set up a smart lock and surveillance camera so delivery personnel can slip packages inside their homes when they are away. Amazon also sees opportunity in the security camera market as smart-home technology expands.  But Blink was not merely a camera business. Its little-known owner, Immedia Semiconductor, was started in Massachusetts by old hands from the chip industry. Chief Executive Peter Besen and two of his co-founders came from Sand Video, which had designed chips in the early 2000s that decoded a new and improved video standard.  In 2004 they sold Sand Video to Broadcom Ltd and remained there as executives, according to an Immedia website. The group left in 2008 to create Immedia, aiming to design chips for video conferencing, and later targeting laptop makers as potential customers.  Dan Grunberg, a co-founder who left Immedia in 2016, said that plan fell through. Laptop makers were unwilling to pay $1 per chip when cheaper options were on the market. So Immedia pivoted.  \u201cIf we make our own camera, we don\u2019t have to sell a hundred million\u201d chips, he said. Grunberg declined to discuss Immedia\u2019s sale to Amazon.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in Manhattan, New York, U.S., January 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The Blink security camera, which hit the market in 2016, did not require a power cable like many rival products, making it easier to place around users\u2019 properties. It was cheaper, too, starting at $99. Amazon\u2019s wired Cloud Cam launched at $119.99, while Netgear Inc\u2019s wire-free Arlo cost more still. Netgear said last week it plans to spin off its Arlo business.  \u201cBattery life is a big issue in connected devices,\u201d said Scott Jacobson, a former Amazon devices manager and now managing director of Madrona Venture Group. \u201cAlways-on cameras that last for months and don\u2019t require a wired connection or an electrician to install could be game-changing.\u201d  As Blink\u2019s sales rose on Amazon\u2019s website, the retailer took notice, sources said, leading to talks with the camera maker about a deal.  Flybridge Capital Partners, Comcast Ventures, Baker Capital, Dot Capital and some suppliers were investors in the company.  Amazon\u2019s regulatory filings show it spent $78 million on acquisition activity in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Sources said the bid was competitive, and that compensation and incentives offered by Amazon pushed the deal\u2019s value to about $90 million.  Madrona\u2019s Jacobson, who had no knowledge of the acquisition\u2019s details, speculated that Amazon might apply the Blink team\u2019s expertise to cameras in drones or in its new checkout-free stores.  The chips could give Amazon other advantages, too.  The proprietary chip design will make it harder for rival retailers to copy Amazon\u2019s devices, said Matt Crowley, chief executive of Vesper, a sensor and semiconductor company that makes microphones.  And now that Amazon owns its own chips, it can go straight to the manufacturers, cutting out middlemen chip designers such as Ambarella Inc, which has powered GoPro Inc products. Amazon has a division called Annapurna Labs that makes an unrelated kind of chip, and it was not clear which supplier it uses for chips that primarily process video.  \u201cVertical integration reduces cost,\u201d Crowley said. Digital video chips \u201care one of the more expensive components\u201d in a camera.","1142":"Sept 19 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc and Indian private equity firm Samara Capital have bought Aditya Birla Group's 'More' retail chain for an enterprise value of 42 billion rupees ($580.35 million), CNBC TV18 reported here on Wednesday, citing sources.

India revised its ecommerce rules in early 2019, creating hurdles for Amazon and rival Walmart Inc\u2019s ecommerce subsidiary, Flipkart.  \u201cI feel ecommerce can actually accelerate India\u2019s economy in a big way, if it\u2019s just allowed to thrive,\u201d said Agarwal, whose comments come at a time when India\u2019s economic growth has slumped to near five-year lows.  Agarwal said Amazon works with some 500,000 sellers, and has created over 200,000 jobs in India since launching its ecommerce operations in 2013.  He said Amazon\u2019s push to get small and medium businesses in India to export has resulted in more than $1 billion in exports and it expects this to exceed $5 billion in the next three years, but red tape is holding some businesses back.  \u201cEven a seller, who wants to sell out of their state, has to get a tax registration in the new state. How many small business owners would go through the onerous job of doing that?\u201d he said.  \u201cThe number of basic paper cut opportunities out there are so many,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel we\u2019re getting lost in the high level debate around ecommerce and data localization.\u201d  India\u2019s revised ecommerce regulations, along with its push to compel multinationals to store data locally, have irked the U.S. government and heightened trade tensions between the two countries. India has argued the rules are aimed at protecting interests of its small traders and also its citizens\u2019 privacy.  INDIA EXPANSION  Amazon\u2019s launch of a new campus in India comes just months after the Seattle-based company scrapped its plans to build a major outpost in New York, blaming opposition from local leaders. It has since picked Arlington, Virginia as the site of its upcoming second headquarters.  India is considered the last major growth market for the e-commerce giant and founder Jeff Bezos has committed investments of more than $5 billion toward Amazon\u2019s expansion in India.  Amazon said the new campus in India, spread over 9.5 acres, cost hundreds of millions of dollars and could house more than 15,000 employees. Amazon has 62,000 employees in India, roughly a third of whom are based in Hyderabad.  Despite weaker economic conditions Amazon has no plans to slow down its expansion in India, said Agarwal, adding that in tougher times \u201ccustomers want even more value, convenience and selection.\u201d  While declining to give any specific numbers, Agarwal said membership in Amazon\u2019s Prime loyalty program has doubled in the last 18 months in India and the market remains Amazon\u2019s fastest growing for Prime worldwide.","1144":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Walmart\u2019s Flipkart has filed a legal challenge against an antitrust investigation ordered against the company in India, a court filing seen by Reuters showed, following a similar petition by its rival Amazon.com Inc.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/Illustration\/File Photo  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in January ordered a probe into alleged violations of competition law and certain discounting practices by the two e-commerce giants, but a state court put the investigation on hold last week following a challenge by Amazon.  Flipkart\u2019s legal filing was aimed at signaling the company is aggrieved by the CCI\u2019s probe order, a person familiar with the matter said.  The filing comes days ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to India, and amid U.S. concerns about India\u2019s tightening of foreign investment rules for the ecommerce sector.  In its Feb. 18 court filing in southern Bengaluru city, which is not public, Flipkart argues the CCI ordered its probe without initial evidence that the company\u2019s practices were harming competition.  Flipkart said the CCI order was \u201cperverse (and) passed without any application of mind\u201d.  \u201cSuch an order exposes responsible corporate entities ... to the rigors of an intrusive investigation prejudicially affecting not only its credibility and reputation, but also its commercial prospects,\u201d said Flipkart, urging the court to quash the probe.  A spokesman for Flipkart did not comment on the contents of the filing, saying it was a \u201cprocedural matter\u201d. The case is likely to be heard next week.  The CCI did not respond to a request for comment.  Amazon and Flipkart have faced criticism from Indian retailers which accuse them of violating local laws by racking up billions of dollars of losses to fund deep discounts and discriminating against small sellers.  The companies deny the allegations.  The antitrust probe was ordered after a New Delhi-based trader group complained that the e-commerce giants were promoting select sellers and in turn hurting business for other smaller players.  Flipkart in its filing said the CCI had \u201cfailed in its duty\u201d to close the frivolous complaint and an investigation would harm the company\u2019s reputation, lead to significant managerial time loss and legal costs.","1145":"FILE PHOTO: An eBay sign is seen at an office building in San Jose, California May 28, 2014.

EBay said it was alerted of the situation about 10 days ago after a seller reached out to the company after being contacted by an Amazon employee under false pretenses.

The Amazon boss is locked in an ugly fight to stop a troubled big-box retailer from selling itself to his biggest rival, Mukesh Ambani\u2019s $166 billion Reliance Industries. Any victory by the U.S. e-commerce giant could wind up costing thousands of jobs and spark a nasty political backlash, but the standoff also might deliver longer-term rewards.  FILE PHOTO: Kishore Biyani, CEO and founder of India's Future Group poses after the inauguration of Foodhall, a premium lifestyle food superstore by the Future Group, store in Mumbai, India, December 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas\/File Photo  Ambani will turbocharge his retail business if he successfully acquires Kishore Biyani\u2019s sprawling Future empire. The $3.4 billion deal announced in August includes more than 17 companies. In addition to its huge oil and telecom operations, Reliance is India\u2019s top brick-and-mortar retailer, with some 12,000 stores. Swallowing Future Retail, its closest competitor, would bag another 1,500. India\u2019s Competition Commission already has cleared the deal.  The takeover would trample over part of Amazon\u2019s expansion strategy in online groceries. It has a partnership with Future Retail, including its Big Bazaar hypermarkets. The $1.6 trillion company snapped up upscale U.S. supermarket chain Whole Foods back in 2017 in its biggest acquisition. In India, however, where Amazon already has invested some $6.5 billion over the past decade, it lacks its own physical shops. Even Walmart\u2019s Indian online marketplace, Flipkart, has the benefit of the Best Price cash-and-carry stores operated by its parent company.  In its push to stop the sale to Reliance, Amazon has been accused of acting like the East India Company, a 17th century London start-up whose employees killed, pillaged and bribed as they conquered the subcontinent. Counsel for Biyani\u2019s Future group have trotted out the provocative comparison to complain that a foreign company is using a dubious minority investment to decide the fate of a struggling Indian outfit.  COUPON CLIPPING  Amazon\u2019s involvement is contentious. Bezos took a circuitous route to sink his claws into Future Retail after debt issues prompted Biyani to consider selling. India does not welcome foreign direct investment into physical retailers that sell multiple brands. Indian politicians consider mom-and-pop store owners as an important constituency. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is easing investment restrictions across multiple sectors and Bezos reasonably took a punt that rules governing retail might change too.  On that basis, Amazon spent about $200 million in August 2019 to pick up a 49% stake in Future Coupons, a wholesaling part of the group. As part of the deal, Biyani and his related entities agreed to restrictions on transferring shares. According to Amazon, that included to Reliance. At the time, Biyani\u2019s group, along with Future Coupons, controlled Future Retail through stock and warrants. Days earlier, Future Coupons inked a separate agreement giving it the right to veto any transfer of assets by Future Retail, effectively locking up the shopping assets.  Almost exactly a year later, as Biyani\u2019s debt problems ballooned, Amazon was shoved aside. Reliance swooped in and agreed to its own complex, multistage deal to buy Future\u2019s retail, wholesale and supply chain businesses. If that transaction closes, Amazon and other investors in Future companies will end up owning shares in a rump that holds a hodgepodge of assets including an insurance joint venture with Generali.  India\u2019s foreign investment rules mean Amazon is precluded from offering an alternative deal to Reliance\u2019s to stop Future Retail from going into liquidation, which could save some 29,000 jobs. Amazon had lined up friendly domestic backers to try and help before the Reliance deal was struck. They were interested in the retail operations, but not much of the rest. Either way, any such investors are unlikely to be interested in going up against India\u2019s richest man.  Bezos is not intimidated, however. He\u2019s fighting to uphold Amazon\u2019s original agreement, in part to make clear that he won\u2019t be pushed around. The company in October won an emergency hold on the transaction through an arbitration in Singapore, and lawyers for both sides are now arguing in a Delhi court about whether that ruling applies in India. The outcome is key to Future group\u2019s fate and the dispute could go all the way to the country\u2019s top court.  PRECEDENTS SET  Amazon is testing the enforceability of contracts in the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, a measure of the ease of doing business. It\u2019s also a fresh test to see if local courts uphold foreign arbitration awards; overseas companies with Indian partners typically look to London or Singapore tribunals. Japanese telecom operator NTT Docomo and pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo both won overseas arbitrations against commercial partners and those rulings were upheld in India.  Politicians reeling from the pandemic won\u2019t be pleased if Amazon\u2019s aggressive move results in job losses. A local media report last week suggested an official investigative agency is probing the company\u2019s Future deal for potential violations of foreign investment rules. But India is better off with Amazon than without it. The company operates 60 massive fulfilment centres and is creating jobs, developing logistics and supporting exports by small- and medium-sized Indian businesses.  The entire mess might have been avoided had India set a stronger example for tycoons to follow. Even now it is unclear if the government will honour two recent arbitration rulings it lost over tax disputes with British companies. Cairn Energy has written to New Delhi threatening to seize Indian assets overseas if it fails to pay the $1.4 billion awarded in its favour. Unlike Vodafone, which also won its case, the oil and gas explorer can afford to play hardball because it is no longer invested in the country.  Future\u2019s retail assets are a prize, but not necessarily a must-have in a fragmented retail market. The bigger message is Amazon\u2019s willingness to fight against powerful rivals. To win in India, that is what it will take.","1147":"BRASILIA (Reuters) - A doctor working with the largest tribe in the Amazon has tested positive for the coronavirus, Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry said on Friday, ringing alarm bells that the epidemic could spread to vulnerable and remote indigenous communities with devastating effect.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The doctor, who has not been named, had returned from vacation on March 18 to work with the Tikunas, a tribe of more than 30,000 people who live in the upper Amazon near the borders with Colombia and Peru.  He developed a fever later that day and went into isolation, testing positive for the respiratory disease COVID-19 a week later, the ministry said.  Eight tribe members he treated on his first day back working for the indigenous health service Sesai have also been isolated in their homes and are being monitored, the ministry said.  The doctor\u2019s infection is the first confirmed case of the virus directly present in an indigenous village. It raises fears of an outbreak that could be lethal for Brazil\u2019s 850,000 indigenous people that have a history of decimation by diseases brought by Europeans, from smallpox and malaria to the flu.  Health experts say their way of life in communal hamlets under large thatched structures increases the risk of contagion if any single member contracts the new coronavirus. Social isolation is hard for tribes to practise.  The ministry said the doctor had no symptoms when he returned to work using a protective mask and gloves, but quarantined himself as soon as he developed a fever.  News website G1\u2019s columnist Matheus Leit\u00e3o reported that the doctor is Brazilian and may have caught the virus while vacationing in southern Brazil or on the boat ride up the Amazon to his work place at Santo Ant\u00f4nio do I\u00e7\u00e1.  So far, Sesai has reported four suspected cases of the coronavirus in indigenous communities, with only one in the Amazon.  But doctors fear the virus could spread fast among tribes whose immune systems often are already weakened by malnutrition, hepatitis B, tuberculosis and diabetes.  About a third of indigenous deaths in Brazil are caused by existing respiratory diseases.  The H1N1 epidemic in 2016 killed hundreds of indigenous people, mainly of the Guaran\u00ed tribe in the colder south of Brazil, where about half of them caught the bug.","1148":"(Adds detail from letter, background)  Jan 20 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday offered to help with the United States\u2019 efforts involving the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a letter addressed to President Joe Biden, seen by Reuters.

Amazon said in 2017 it was ending its Fresh grocery delivery service for select areas. Landry, however, said the business is growing and has expanded this year to areas like Nashville, Orlando and Las Vegas.  Amazon last week forecast revenue and profit below Wall Street\u2019s target, amid intense competition and surging costs related to its drive to speed up shipping times around the world.  Sales at Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods Market chain and other physical stores stalled in the second quarter and fell 1 percent in the third quarter.  Profits from grocery sales are notoriously slim. But selling staples like bananas, milk and toilet paper gives retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target Corp the opportunity to upsell shoppers who make frequent visits to replenish such necessities.  Tuesday\u2019s move from the world\u2019s biggest online retailer is yet another salvo in the continuing delivery \u201carms race,\u201d Charlie O\u2019Shea of Moody\u2019s said.  Amazon is already cutting delivery times to one day for its Prime loyalty members in a bid to outmaneuver Walmart and other retailers who offer competing two-day shipping without subscription fees.  \u201cThis new delivery effort is yet another example of Amazon\u2019s willingness to suffer short-term for the potential for long-term benefit,\u201d O\u2019Shea added.  Shares in Amazon slipped 0.6% in afternoon trading, while Kroger Co and Walmart were down 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively.  Walmart plans to offer its \u201cDelivery Unlimited\u201d grocery membership to shoppers in more than half of the United States by the end of the year. Members have the option of paying the $98 annual fee or $12.95 per month instead of the usual $9.99 delivery fee.  Kroger charges a $5.95 delivery fee and a $6.00 service fee to drop groceries at shopper doorsteps.  A recent study from Capgemini found that 38% of U.S. consumers order groceries online, but that only 14% were willing to pay more for two-hour deliveries.","1153":"FILE PHOTO: Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and Blue Origin speaks during the JFK Space Summit, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, at the John F.

Amazon sent a letter to the panel on Friday in response to the committee\u2019s May 1 letter and reiterated that any allegations that there was such a policy breach would be investigated.","1154":"(Repeats story with no changes)  CAPE TOWN, July 25 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is expanding its presence in the emerging tech hub of Cape Town, upping the ante in its regional battle with cloud computing rival Microsoft Corp.  Amazon will be the sole tenant in a new, modern eight-story office building that\u2019s nearing completion in the South African city, multiple sources familiar with the project told Reuters. The company is advertising dozens of jobs in Cape Town, which played a key role in the early development of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing business.  The adverts include one for a software development engineer that says Amazon is assembling a team for a \u201cgreen-field project\u201d dealing with machine learning, big data analysis and cloud computing, which are among the fastest-growing areas in the technology industry.  The company\u2019s expansion shows how fierce competition in the cloud business and rising demand for computing power are driving activity even in relatively undeveloped corners of the technology universe.  AWS is the global leader in cloud computing with 32 percent of the market, versus 16 percent for second-placed Microsoft in the first quarter of 2018, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft has been growing faster.  The global cloud infrastructure services market was worth nearly $55 billion in 2017 and is expected to exceed $155 billion by 2020, Canalys said. AWS accounted for 73 percent of Amazon\u2019s $1.9 billion operating profit in the first quarter, but just 11 percent of its revenue.  Amazon\u2019s new Cape Town building is due for completion in August, according to a source familiar with the matter. It sits near an existing Amazon technical centre and customer support operation.  Amazon did not offer details about the new building in Cape Town, or what its function might be.  \u201cAs more South African customers and partners continue to choose AWS as their cloud provider we continue to hire more staff into our offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg,\u201d Geoff Brown, AWS\u2019 Sub-Saharan Africa regional manager, told Reuters in a statement.  In another sign of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing drive in South Africa, it is offering start-ups free cloud trials for one year, according to local entrepreneur Tumi Menyatswe - a deal that prompted her to switch to AWS from Google\u2019s cloud.  \u201cThis allows me to focus on my business and to grow until I can pay them,\u201d said Menyatswe, CEO of two-year-old business Minderz, which pairs pet owners with people able to look after cats and dogs during holidays.  EDGE IN AFRICA  It is difficult to measure the relative success of the big cloud-computing players in Africa, as they do not break out financial results for the continent. However, according to analysts, data centres are one measure of growth.  Despite its history on the continent, Amazon has yet to build a data centre in Africa. Microsoft, by contrast, announced last year that it was building two data centres in South Africa, one in Cape Town and one in Johannesburg, both due to launch later this year.  Microsoft said in a statement that the plans were on track but would not specify when the data centres would be launched in 2018.  Local data centres offer advantages, in part by reducing \u201clatency\u201d, or delays, in data transmission. \u201cCloser is almost always better,\u201d said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research.  Clifford De Wit, former chief innovation officer at Microsoft South Africa, said a local data centre was a big advantage.  \u201cHaving the actual data centre close has so many implications,\u201d said De Wit, now chief technology officer at start-up Dexterity Digital. He cited privacy regulations that require banks and some other companies to store data locally, among other benefits.  Amazon\u2019s Brown told Reuters that South Africa was \u201cone of the many possibilities that we are currently looking at\u201d globally for opening a new data centre.  He said the company launched new \u201cEdge\u201d locations -infrastructure that boosts transmission speeds from primary data centres outside the continent - in Johannesburg and Cape Town in the past two months. This will reduce latency for South African customers and bring other benefits, he said.  Famous for its Table Mountain and sandy beaches, Cape Town is emerging as a continental tech hub, with some 35,000 people employed in the sector, according to Wesgro, a trade and investment agency. The city boasts one of the largest publicly available fibre optic networks in Africa, local economic development officials say.  Amazon has played a key role in the city\u2019s internet industry from the start. Two South Africans, Chris Pinkham and Willem van Biljon, led a small Cape Town-based team that developed the key technical underpinnings of AWS, a software architecture known as EC2, and helped build the business plan for the service.  \u201cWe knew it was going to have a large impact,\u201d Van Biljon, who left Amazon more than a decade ago and still lives in Cape Town, told Reuters. \u201cThe rate at which the growth occurred outstripped even our best expectations.\u201d (Additional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin and Sal Rodriguez in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Pravin Char)","1155":"Oct 29 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday it would make its grocery delivery service free for Prime members in the United States and integrate all orders for groceries into a single portal.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday launched a website for shoppers in Saudi Arabia, showing its continued business interests there despite a public dispute between Riyadh and the company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.  The website is a re-branding for Saudi customers of Souq.com, a Middle East e-commerce platform that Amazon acquired in 2017. Shoppers\u2019 account information with Souq automatically transferred to the new address, amazon.sa, Amazon said on the site. The company similarly converted Souq\u2019s website in the United Arab Emirates to a re-branded portal, amazon.ae, last year.  The news indicates that a conflict involving Bezos and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has not derailed Amazon\u2019s investment plans for the kingdom. In a press release, Amazon said it is building an operations network that will span the country, and its footprint already includes 14 warehouses, a workforce of more than 1,400 and a strategic delivery partnership with Saudi Post.  The publication of leaked text messages between Bezos and his girlfriend in early 2019 kicked off a dispute between the world\u2019s richest man and Saudi Arabia. Bezos\u2019 security chief last year said the kingdom was the source of the messages, and in January, United Nations experts said they had information pointing to the \u201cpossible involvement\u201d of Crown Prince Mohammed in an alleged plot to hack Bezos\u2019 phone. Saudi Arabia called the suggestion \u201cabsurd.\u201d  Bezos privately owns the Washington Post, which employed Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist and critic of the crown prince who was murdered in October 2018. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency believes Crown Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, sources previously told Reuters, while the crown prince last year denied the claim and said rogue operatives carried out the act.  The saga had fueled speculation that Amazon would pull back from doing business in the country.","1157":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s anti-trust authority has launched an investigation into Amazon\u2019s relationship with third-party traders selling on its site, its head was quoted as saying on Sunday.  \u201cWe are currently investigating whether and how Amazon influences how traders set prices on the market-place,\u201d Andreas Mundt, President of the Federal Cartel Office, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily.  Germany is Amazon\u2019s second-biggest market after the United States.  During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many stores were closed and shoppers flocked online, Mundt said there had been complaints that Amazon had blocked some traders because of allegedly overly high prices.  \u201cAmazon must not be a controller of prices,\u201d he said, adding that Amazon had responded to his office\u2019s requests for information and those statements were being evaluated.  The cartel office was not immediately available to comment.  An Amazon spokeswoman said the company\u2019s policies were designed to make sure its partners set competitive prices.  \u201cAmazon selling partners set their own product prices in our store,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cOur systems are designed to take action against price gouging,\u201d she said, adding that those who had concerns should contact its support team for its merchants.  Up until 2013, Amazon had prevented traders from offering their products via other online sites at a lower price than on its market place, a policy Germany\u2019s anti-trust watchdog forced it to abandon.  Last year, Amazon reached a deal with the German authority to overhaul its terms of service for third-party merchants, prompting the office to drop a previous seven-month investigation.","1158":"MUMBAI (Reuters) - The High Court of Delhi on Monday left it to regulators to decide the fate of the $3.38 billion sale of Future Group\u2019s retail assets to Reliance Industries Ltd, but allowed U.S. partner Amazon.com Inc to raise objections to it.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, Future sold its retail assets to oil-to-clothes conglomerate Reliance in August but Amazon said the deal breached agreements Future made with the U.S. ecommerce leader in 2019.  Analysts expect the Reliance deal, which has now cleared anti-trust hurdles, to go through despite the High Court of Delhi on Monday dismissing a plea from Future to restrain Amazon - which owns a small indirect stake in Future Retail - from interfering in the transaction.  The pursuit of Future Retail Ltd has been billed as the battle of the billionaires - namely Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Reliance\u2019s Mukesh Ambani.  If the deal with Reliance goes ahead, it will delay Amazon\u2019s goal of capturing India\u2019s massive groceries market that Forrester Research estimates will be worth $740 billion a year by 2024.  \u201cThe present application is disposed of ...\u201d the court said in its written order about the Future petition.  \u201cHowever, the Statutory Authorities\/Regulators are directed to take the decision on the applications\/objections in accordance with the law.\u201d  Amazon emailed a one-line statement welcoming the verdict, while Future said it was consulting with legal advisors.  \u201cIt is being portrayed that just because the interim injunction has not been granted, this round has gone to Amazon, which is not true,\u201d said Shweta Dubey, partner at legal firm SD Partners.  \u201cThere have been certain significant observations in the judgement which have put Future in a very advantageous position.\u201d  The court said Reliance and Future\u2019s agreement \u201csatisfies the requirement of a valid contract\u201d, although Justice Mukta Gupta noted in the verdict that Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators on account of potentially irreparable damage.  Reliance and Future dominate India\u2019s grocery market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd\u2019s DMart, far behind in terms of stores and reach.

REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jeff Bezos has some solid timing. The founder and chief executive of Amazon.com is handing over the CEO role to Andy Jassy, head of the cloud division AWS, after a fortuitously good year at the $1.7 trillion retail giant. The new boss will face a different, more challenging normal that includes regulatory scrutiny.  First the results: Amazon said Tuesday that fourth-quarter revenue rose 44% year-over-year to $126 billion. That\u2019s the first time the company topped $100 billion of sales in a quarter helped by delivering items to customer\u2019s doorsteps during the pandemic and, of course, the holidays.  That\u2019s the good news. The rest harkens some major challenges for Jassy. Operating expenses ballooned 42% in part because costs associated with worldwide shipping rose about two-thirds. The vaccine rollout will coincide with choice, which could make life harder for Amazon. The company is forecasting sales volume to drop by a quarter in this period compared to three months ending December.  The hurdles may partly be why Jassy is now leading the company. AWS is one of Amazon\u2019s jewels. Growth slowed a tad in the fourth quarter to 28%, but the division has much higher margins than Amazon\u2019s other units, booking more than half of its operating profit despite accounting for just 12% of total sales.  And yet Amazon\u2019s success is precisely what will make Washington continue its pursuit of the retail giant. On the same day as earnings, Amazon agreed to pay more than $60 million to the Federal Trade Commission to settle charges it withheld some tips from drivers.  Time away from the corner office will give Bezos the opportunity to focus on his other projects including the Bezos Earth Fund and the Washington Post. He will likely continue to have a guiding hand, too, and perhaps will find himself in the Beltway hot seat. Still, the company\u2019s forward enterprise value-to-sales figure is hovering near its high, hit earlier this year. As Bezos steps aside, Amazon is staring at the end of living high on the hog.","1161":"MADRID\/NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - Chico\u2019s FAS Inc warned in January that it would shutter at least 250 stores across its namesake brand, along with its White House Black Market and Soma labels.  But the U.S. women\u2019s clothing chain is expanding a different storefront - its Chico\u2019s-branded micro site on Amazon.com Inc .  The world\u2019s largest online retailer now sells around 2,300 Chico\u2019s styles, from crease-proof trousers to fine-knit sweaters, representing nearly six times more product offerings than when it started last May, Chico\u2019s told Reuters.  While that growth should entice any retailer, Chico\u2019s is one of a growing number of clothing brands treading carefully.  From Nike Inc and Under Armour Inc to Lands\u2019 End Inc and Levi Strauss & Co, major brands are distributing clothing and accessories directly through Amazon.com, attracted by more than 100 million members of Amazon\u2019s loyalty club Prime and its advanced delivery network.  The risk in this relationship, according to interviews with retailers and industry analysts, comes if Amazon uses real-time data from customer purchases to help it quickly build out its own private label clothing brands, and ends up stealing market share from its current retail partners.  \u201cThe word that\u2019s most commonly used with respect to Amazon from a brand perspective, and also retailers to some extent, is \u2018frenemy,\u2019\u201d said Kate Delhagen, an independent retail consultant and former senior director of global digital business development at Nike. She had input into Nike\u2019s decision process to partner with Amazon, but left the shoe company shortly before the deal was finalized in July 2017.  For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs\/2WHcPkH  Recognizing the concern from retailers, the European Commission has launched a preliminary antitrust investigation into Amazon and whether it might \u201cgain access to competitively sensitive information about competitors\u2019 products which it could use to boost its own retail activities at the expense of third party sellers on its marketplace,\u201d an EU spokesman said.  Amazon declined to comment on the early-stage probe, or say how many private label clothing brands it had and how fast it was churning out new ones. A spokeswoman said Amazon\u2019s private label products account for about 1 percent of its total retail sales.  \u201cOur private brands supplement the great assortment that our selling partners provide,\u201d she added.  A Nike spokeswoman said its business with Amazon continued to perform well, but said the company\u2019s approach was broader than Amazon alone and that it continued to engage with a number of digital marketplaces.  To sell through Amazon, Chico\u2019s and other clothing retailers can either sell product to Amazon in a traditional wholesale relationship or sell directly to consumers as third-party merchants, paying a 17 percent referral fee on clothing and accessories sold.  Retailers pay Amazon extra to store and ship their orders under the \u2018fulfillment by Amazon\u2019 model.  Amazon has set a goal of being a leader in the apparel space for around a decade, former Amazon director Mike Pazak told Reuters, and has invested heavily in the sector. It has recently ramped up its own private label apparel brands.  It had 109 of its own brands in clothing, shoes and jewelry categories at the start of 2019, which is more than a five-fold increase over two years, according to TJI Research.  \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re aware of and understand the risks,\u201d said George Nahra, senior vice president of strategy, business development and international at Chico\u2019s, which flies executives to Seattle regularly to review the growing Amazon business.  OVERTAKING WALMART  Amazon markets fashion across the world from Brazil to China. It has made its Prime Wardrobe concept, which allows Prime members to order clothing with no upfront charge and free delivery, available in the United States, Britain and Japan.  The online giant has sponsored fashion weeks in the United States, Mexico, Japan and India and has photography studios for fashion shoots in New York, London, Tokyo and New Delhi. It is a patron of the British Fashion Council.  Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States, according to a Coresight Research survey.  In Britain, Amazon has outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC as the most-shopped clothing retailer, according to an HSBC survey.  Amazon Prime member Abby Kidd bought a pair of Silver brand $80 jeans the first time she used the Prime Wardrobe service.  \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll look anywhere else for jeans as long as Amazon keeps expanding their options,\u201d said the 35-year-old private tutor, based in Oak Harbor, Washington who also shops at chain stores Macy\u2019s Inc and Maurices.  Classic American clothing retailer Lands\u2019 End turned to Amazon more than a year ago when it looked to increase sales after a bruising exit from previous owner Sears.  \u201cWe\u2019d be ostriches sticking our heads in the sand if we didn\u2019t take heed and pay attention to where customers are going,\u201d said Sarah Rasmusen, senior vice president of e-commerce at Lands\u2019 End, founded in the 1960s as a mail-order business.  Lands\u2019 End started selling core items such as flannel shirts and down coats on Amazon in February last year as part of its strategy to branch out from troubled Sears stores, where it has lost dozens of retail locations.  Lands\u2019 End\u2019s key swimwear lines compete with Amazon\u2019s Coastal Blue swimwear private label on the site.  Both Chico\u2019s and Lands\u2019 End declined to say what percentage of their sales were made through Amazon, but said the platform was a useful customer acquisition tool that was not drawing clients away from their own e-commerce sites.  A gripe for retailers is that selling on Amazon loses the direct customer relationship they get from their own website or store.  \u201cYou don\u2019t know where your customer\u2019s coming from, you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re clicking on once they get to the site,\u201d said Melanie Travis, founder of upmarket swimwear brand Andie who has talked to Amazon, but decided against selling on the platform.  Others are satisfied with the limited data they get from Amazon. For instance, Chico\u2019s gets enough to mail catalogs to new Amazon customers, said senior vice president Nahra.  Canadian shoe retailer Aldo, which deepened its 10-year relationship with Amazon to a wholesale model this year, said it receives more information as a result, such as the basket composition of customers who buy Aldo\u2019s products on Amazon. That allows it to adapt its product offering accordingly.  Insights shared by Amazon can influence how the retailer designs collections, Aldo said. Its products compete with Amazon\u2019s footwear private label The Fix on the platform.  \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting partnership you get by selling to Amazon instead of selling through Amazon,\u201d said Justin Cohen, senior director of e-commerce for Aldo North America. \u201cWe\u2019re just starting to lean back into that relationship.\u201d","1162":"March 5 (Reuters) -  * AMAZON IS IN TALKS WITH BIG BANKS INCLUDING JPMORGAN CHASE ABOUT BUILDING A CHECKING-ACCOUNT-LIKE PRODUCT - WSJ, CITING SOURCES Source text: on.wsj.com\/2H6LDE5 Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","1163":"The Citibank building, the site of a new workplace for Amazon employees, is seen in Long Island City of the Queens borough of New York, U.S., November 14, 2018.

Fifty-seven percent of New York City residents who responded to the poll approved of Amazon building one of two secondary headquarters in the Long Island City area of Queens, more than double the 26 percent who said they oppose the move, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.  Respondents were divided on the $2.8 billion in tax breaks and incentives offered to attract Amazon, with 46 percent supporting them versus 44 percent who oppose the package, the poll found.  Amazon last month announced plans to spend $5 billion on two new headquarters - one in Long Island City and one in Arlington, Virginia, outside of Washington - which the company said will each employ more than 25,000 people. Bidding for the campuses attracted hundreds of offers from states and cities in a year-long process that garnered widespread publicity for the company.  Results of the poll suggest that critics of the project will have trouble derailing it.  Local residents, including city and state lawmakers, have criticized arrangements that minimized the need for Amazon to obtain local approvals that would ordinarily be required of such projects.

Launched in 2016, the Russia-based company currently offers some 10 million mostly chinese-made products ranging from cell phones to sneakers to customers around the world.  It targets $1 billion in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) this year, something its CEO told Reuters in January they were already close to achieving but a tiny portion of Amazon\u2019s offering.  JOOM already offers 10,000 products from France and sees the home of haute-couture fashion as a testing ground for scaling up sales of higher-value items made outside of China, with French consumers among its most active in Europe.  \u201cThe next step will be helping French merchants sell their products in Europe\u201d JOOM CEO and co-founder Ilya Shirokov told Reuters in Paris. \u201cThen we will target merchants in other European countries.\u201d  \u201cIf we are successful in France, we will be successful in Europe.\u201d JOOM\u2019s long-term ambition, he said, was to become the number two choice in France and in Europe after Amazon.  JOOM, like rivals such as U.S.-based Wish and AliExpress, owned by China\u2019s Alibaba, keeps prices low by importing mostly unbranded items from Chinese manufacturers and sending them directly to an online shopper\u2019s front door.  It has been present in France since mid-2017 and the country is now its largest market in Europe. Europe makes up 50 percent of JOOM\u2019s global GMV, and Russia 45 percent. Some 40,000 new users install the JOOM app in France daily, it says.  Recruiting French merchants will allow for faster delivery to customers, while French products will add value.  \u201cFrench consumers want to buy branded items that are stored locally or in neighbor countries. I believe the sale of French products will exceed the sale of Chinese products in about a year,\u201d he said.  Shirokov, 37, who co-founded the first Russian social network \u201cMoi Krug\u201d in 2005 and later sold it to Russian search engine Yandex, said his app offers a social network environment where brands can also promote their goods through bloggers.  \u201cEverything I touch turns into a social network. It\u2019s my karma,\u201d he said.  Shirokov ran the social networking business at Mail.ru Group before its IPO. With the money he made, he founded JOOM with a partner.

This summer, Bezos, 57, will hand the keys of the world\u2019s largest online retailer to Andy Jassy, head of its cloud division Amazon Web Services known as AWS. The announcement on Tuesday settles a long-running question about who would replace the world\u2019s second-richest person at the company\u2019s helm.  Bezos is ending his role as CEO on a high note: the business he began as an internet bookseller 27 years ago is now one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies and posted three consecutive record profits after losses in decades prior. On Tuesday, Amazon reported quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time.  Jassy, 53, joined Amazon in 1997 after Harvard Business School, founding AWS and growing it to a cloud platform used by millions of customers, the company\u2019s website said. He had been a clear contender for the top job since Amazon created two CEO roles reporting to Bezos years ago, the other held by recently retired consumer CEO Jeff Wilke.  Tom Johnson, chief transformation officer at global marketing firm Mindshare, said Jassy\u2019s promotion underscored the centrality of the web hosting business to Amazon\u2019s strategy.  \u201cJassy\u2019s background in steering AWS shows just how top of mind those services are to Amazon\u2019s business strategy. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth,\u201d he said.  Jassy is known for understanding highly technical details and has regularly taken jabs at legacy player Oracle Corp and cloud rival Microsoft Corp, which AWS continues to exceed in sales. Bezos has made fewer public remarks about competitors.  Under Jassy\u2019s leadership, Amazon\u2019s cloud business has signed major customers including Verizon, McDonald\u2019s and Honeywell. Silicon Valley startups have long relied on AWS, and the division\u2019s annual revenue grew 37% in 2019 and 30% in 2020, helping cement its position as the market leader.  One contract AWS failed to win was the $10 billion \u201cJEDI\u201d project from the Pentagon, which was awarded to Microsoft.  Jassy has aimed to bestow a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS\u2019s annual Las Vegas conference, speaking before over 60,000 attendees in 2019 after upbeat music preceded his talk.  Bezos, who already has focused on other personal enterprises in years past, said in a note to employees posted on Amazon\u2019s website, \u201cAs Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions.\u201d Blue Origin is Bezos\u2019 space company.  He added, \u201cI\u2019ve never had more energy, and this isn\u2019t about retiring.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that Bezos would work on \u201clarge one-way door issues,\u201d such as acquisitions and other strategies where there is a high cost to reversing course.

Amazon shares were up less than 1% in after-hours trading.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Jassy\u2019s AWS, traditionally a bright spot, fell slightly short of expectations in the fourth quarter. While the cloud computing division recently announced deals with ViacomCBS, the BMW Group and others, it posted revenue of $12.7 billion, short of the $12.8 billion analysts had estimated.  Amazon said it was not naming an AWS replacement for Jassy at this time.  Meanwhile Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business has never been as big. Since the start of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies. While brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors, Amazon recruited over 400,000 more workers to keep up with demand.  That has placed the Seattle-based company at the center of workplace tumult. More than 19,000 have contracted COVID-19 as of September, and some staff have protested and demanded facility closures. Others, at Amazon\u2019s Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse, are seeking to be the first at the company to unionize in the United States, with an election to begin next week.  Olsavsky told reporters on a conference call that costs associated with the pandemic in the first quarter are expected to total $2 billion, down from $4 billion in the fourth quarter as shopping volumes decrease. The company has taken an array of COVID-19 precautions and written government officials - including U.S. President Joe Biden - saying it is eager to offer vaccine shots to staff.  A boost in revenue came from moving Amazon\u2019s marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, lengthening the holiday shopping season.  Net sales for the current quarter are expected to be between $100 billion and $106 billion.","1166":"NEW DELHI, Feb 8 (Reuters) - An Indian court on Monday overturned an order that had stalled Future Group\u2019s $3.4 billion deal to sell its retail assets, two sources said, in a setback for Future\u2019s partner Amazon.com Inc, which has challenged the sale.  A New Delhi court had last week sided with the U.S. online retailer and put Future\u2019s asset sale to Reliance Industries on hold, leading to an appeal from the Indian retail group.  A two-judge bench hearing Future\u2019s appeal on Monday put on hold the previous ruling, which had effectively stalled the mega retail deal, two sources familiar with the proceedings said.  Future in its appeal had said its creditors would be at \u201csignificant risk\u201d if the Reliance deal failed.  A detailed written order has yet to be made public.  Amazon and Future did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  \u201cIt is a major setback for Amazon,\u201d said one of the sources.  In a fight between two of the world\u2019s richest men - Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Reliance\u2019s Mukesh Ambani - the U.S. giant has argued that Future breached certain contracts by agreeing to the deal with Reliance. Future has denied any wrongdoing.  Future is India\u2019s second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores and agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year.

(Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N is starting a new same-day delivery service where customers can place orders using a text message, another step in its effort to scale up its e-commerce offerings and compete with rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  The service, called Jetblack, allows shoppers to order items from Walmart.com and even websites of rival retailers. It is a part of Walmart\u2019s internal start-up incubator, Store No. 8.  Jetblack has been launched in parts of New York City, with plans to roll it out to the rest of the United States over time.  \u201cThe goal is to think about game-changing technologies that will change the way people shop,\u201d said Jenny Fleiss, co-founder and chief executive of Jetblack, who also co-founded popular online fashion website Rent The Runway.  Fleiss said one of the technologies that will usher retail into the future will be the ability to have a personalized shopping experience through text messaging and online chat.  The U.S. retail giant is pouring billions of dollars into beefing up its e-commerce business and has recently announced partnerships with logistics companies to deliver groceries ordered online. Two such partnerships Walmart had struck with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft have ended, however, Reuters reported earlier this month.  Jetblack, which is available with a monthly membership fee of $50, will offer same-day and next-day delivery at no additional cost. The challenge for the service will be competing with other established membership services like Amazon Prime and Prime Now, which already enjoy wide adoption and are popular with urban consumers.  Fleiss said consumers who took part in a pilot were on average buying ten items per week from Jetblack. The service differentiates itself by sourcing everyday essentials from Walmart and Jet.com, while also allowing customers to order items from rival retailers like cosmetics retailer Sephora or local brands, she said.  Jetblack will also remind shoppers using text messaging if they are about to run out of a product they ordered. The service uses artificial intelligence to curate product suggestions, Fleiss said.","1169":"Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened higher on Thursday, boosted by gains in shares of high-flying companies such as Apple and Amazon, and as the Federal Reserve ended an era of \u201caccommodative\u201d monetary policy.

(Reporting by Amy Caren Daniel in Bengaluru)","1170":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said shareholders rejected proposals to curb and audit its facial recognition service on Wednesday, just as members of Congress indicated there was bipartisan support to one day regulate the technology.  In the past year Amazon has found itself at the center of a growing debate over the use of facial recognition by governments, with critics warning of false matches and arrests and proponents arguing it keeps the public safe. Law enforcement in Oregon and Florida have used Amazon\u2019s face and image ID service, known as Rekognition.  With support from civil liberties groups, two non-binding proposals on facial recognition made it to the ballot ahead of Amazon\u2019s shareholder meeting on Wednesday. The world\u2019s top online retailer and cloud computing company had tried to stop the votes, but it was effectively overruled by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The first proposal would have made the company stop offering facial recognition to governments unless its board determined sales did not violate civil liberties. A second would have requested a study by September of the extent to which Amazon\u2019s service harmed rights and privacy.  According to an Amazon spokeswoman, the resolutions failed by a wide margin. The vote breakdown will be disclosed at a later point in time.  Adding to shareholders\u2019 concerns was recent research that showed Amazon\u2019s technology struggled to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, prompting fears that a faulty technology would put innocent people behind bars.  Amazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law. It also added a web portal for people to report any abuse of the service here.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, May 13, 2019. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  The proposals faced an uphill battle. Amazon\u2019s board recommended against them, and Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive and founder, controls 16 percent of its stock and voting rights.  Still, critics of the technology believed the vote was beneficial.  \u201cThis shareholder intervention should serve as a wake-up call for the company to reckon with the real harms of face surveillance and to change course,\u201d said Shankar Narayan of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington state.  A key congressional committee also met on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., to discuss the civil rights impact of all facial recognition technology, not only Amazon\u2019s.  Responding to the shareholder vote, Democratic U.S. Representative Jimmy Gomez said, \u201cthat just means that it\u2019s more important that Congress acts.\u201d  Republican members of the committee expressed concern about U.S. citizens having their rights violated and their information shared with the likes of the FBI without elected officials\u2019 oversight. A second hearing on the topic is scheduled for June 4.  Any federal regulation would follow a major decision by San Francisco officials earlier this month to ban city personnel from using the technology. That contrasts with New York, Chicago and Detroit, where law enforcement have reportedly used facial recognition or acquired it with the hope of speeding up post-crime investigations.  Amazon is one of many facial recognition vendors, alongside France's Idemia, Japan's NEC Corp and Microsoft Corp, which has repeatedly called for regulation and said reut.rs\/2IygqgS it turned down sales for human rights concerns.

The same-day offer will now guarantee delivery of more than 100,000 products, from phone chargers to dog food, in as little as five hours, from a new warehouse close to each launch city, said Jon Alexander, Amazon\u2019s director of delivery experience. For comparison, Amazon offers more than 100 million items for two-day U.S. delivery or faster via Prime.  \u201cThe smaller selection enables us to put these types of facilities much closer to customers,\u201d he said. Additional items - up to 3 million - will pass through the facilities on their way to same-day customers.  The new format combines the storage, picking and packing functions of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers with the sorting and delivery functions of other facilities into a single building.  Compared with fulfillment centers, which are farther from urban cores and house much more inventory, the new warehouse is roughly a tenth the size, at 100,000 square feet. Amazon says shorter drive times will help it meet its pledge on carbon emissions.  The company declined to comment on the facilities\u2019 cost. Amazon, once famous for spending away profit, often cites warehouse build-outs as one of its biggest areas of investment.  According to Alexander, Amazon would typically lease existing spaces and alter them to accommodate the operation.  The new facilities are automated with the same \u2018drive units\u2019 used in Amazon\u2019s fulfillment centers. These are squat, floor-scurrying robots that hoist up movable shelves of inventory and bring them to associates who pick customer orders. Amazon said each building will create hundreds of full and part-time jobs.  While the same-day option is covered for Prime members who spend at least $35, those without Prime are charged $12.98 per order, a tactic that could draw people to sign up.

Amazon is considering buying Boost - currently one of Sprint\u2019s prepaid brands - mainly because the deal would allow it to use the new T-Mobile\u2019s wireless network for at least six years, one of the sources said.  New T-Mobile is the name used by T-Mobile and Sprint to refer to the new entity that will result from their potential merger.  Amazon would also be interested in any wireless spectrum that could be divested, the source said.  Amazon declined to comment. T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  It was not immediately clear why the largest U.S. online retailer would want the wireless network and spectrum.  Amazon has already been building experience by offering phone calls through its Echo Connect product, which uses a person\u2019s home phone service and allows an Alexa-enabled voice-activated speaker to make phone calls.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon, which started out selling books, has a long history of exploring new ventures, such as making original TV shows for Amazon Prime members. It is now one of the Big Four technology companies along with Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc, and is a leading cloud services provider.  T-Mobile and Sprint have already pledged to sell Boost as part of measures to reduce their market share in the prepaid wireless business and gain regulatory approval for their planned $26 billion merger.  The U.S. Justice Department would need to scrutinize the buyer of a divested asset to ensure it would stay viable and preserve competition.  The carriers are also considering divesting wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, in order to push the merger through.  The merger, if approved, would leave the United States with three wireless carriers instead of four. Some consumer advocates have raised concerns that the merger could raise prices for wireless users and have called for an additional competitor.  The sale of Boost could fetch up to $3 billion, potential bidders previously told Reuters.  This month, analysts at Cowen estimated Boost has 7 million to 8 million customers and a transaction could be valued at $4.5 billion if the deal included wireless spectrum, or the airwaves that carry data, and facilities.  Sprint has not disclosed the number of Boost customers.","1184":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, the world\u2019s most valuable publicly listed company, is in danger of being beaten by Amazon.com Inc to the $1 trillion mark.  Wall Street\u2019s optimism about last year\u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple\u2019s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  (For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs\/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.

Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.

More than a quarter of all revenue for sellers on Amazon globally was from cross-border transactions in 2017, up more than 50 percent from the year prior, Amazon Vice President Eric Broussard said in an interview, ahead of his Tuesday speech at the ShopTalk conference in Las Vegas.  That amounts to between $50 billion and $75 billion for merchants selling to customers in another country, based on analysts\u2019 estimates for Amazon\u2019s total gross merchandise sales. Amazon does not disclose the figure.  The cross-border increase - outpacing Amazon\u2019s 31 percent rise in overall net sales - represents a massive opportunity for the world\u2019s largest online retailer. That is why Amazon has encouraged merchants to list ever-more products on its websites around the world, which could make its marketplaces more desirable to shoppers than those of the competition.  \u201cThe speed with which sellers have been selling globally has accelerated over time,\u201d said Broussard, who oversees Amazon\u2019s international marketplaces.  Global trade has been crucial to Amazon and its e-commerce competitors. In a 2015 news post online, eBay touted cross-border sales as one of its key strengths. It said cross-border represented about 20 percent of its gross merchandise volume in 2014, or $17 billion. The company declined to offer a figure for 2017.  Last month, eBay\u2019s chief executive told Reuters the company planned to bring \u201cthe world\u2019s inventory into Japan\u201d as part of its global expansion. [nL4N1QH72Z]  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Alibaba, meanwhile, recruits companies to sell into China, and its unit Tmall Global features products from brands in 63 countries and regions, it has said.  Critics of Amazon have said there are too many counterfeit products from China on its U.S. marketplace. Amazon prohibits the sale of counterfeit goods and has said it is investing heavily in programs to keep them off its platform.  CUT OF SALES  For Amazon, a key way it attracts sellers is by renting space in more than 150 warehouses worldwide so merchants can store inventory near customers - without the hassle of exporting each order. Amazon operates 13 marketplaces globally.  \u201cA customer shops in German, pays in euros and gets very rapid fulfillment\u201d for a product from a U.S. seller, for example, Broussard said.  Tech Armor, a smartphone accessories maker near Los Angeles, said that its business was growing faster internationally than in the United States and that it has shipped more than 12 million units through Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) since 2012. That has come partly from Amazon\u2019s encouragement.

Chinnappa  The decision is a setback for Future, the country\u2019s second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, which agreed to sell its retail businesses to market leader Reliance last year. It has said it could face liquidation if the deal falls through.  U.S. online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list including Reliance.  The corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world\u2019s richest men - Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Reliance\u2019s Mukesh Ambani.  It could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.  After Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator\u2019s order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the Delhi High Court to enforce it.  Justice J. R. Midha said on Tuesday that an immediate order was necessary to protect the U.S. company\u2019s rights, adding that the arbitrator had \u201crightly proceeded\u201d against Future.  \u201cThis court is of the clear view that the (arbitration) order ... is enforceable,\u201d Midha added. \u201cAll the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo.\u201d  Amazon said it welcomed the order. Future said it would explore all legal remedies to pursue the deal.  Reliance did not respond to requests for comment.  LEGAL BRAINS  Future\u2019s planned deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt, had already been cleared by Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.  Justice Midha directed a government counsel to relay the court\u2019s decision to all authorities who were involved in reviewing the Future-Reliance deal. Future had acted \u201cin violation\u201d of the arbitrator\u2019s order, he added.  Both Future and Amazon hired some of the country\u2019s best legal brains to argue the matter, with the U.S. company engaging law firms P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.  Future, in sometimes acrimonious court arguments, accused Amazon of blocking its deal in an attempt to thwart any competition from Reliance, which has plans to expand into e-commerce.

The U.S.-only promotion, effective from Nov. 5, waives the $25 minimum that customers outside Amazon\u2019s Prime loyalty club must hit for free shipping. The deal lasts until Amazon can no longer promise items in time for Christmas with free delivery, which typically takes five to eight business days.  The company\u2019s shares fell more than 3 percent following the announcement. One analyst, Colin Sebastian of Baird Equity Research, said the offer could shave 5 percent to 6 percent off Amazon\u2019s operating profit this quarter.  Still, the news could help Amazon win more sales. That is important for the world\u2019s largest online retailer since a revenue slowdown it forecast last month spooked some investors and sent its stock tumbling. The current quarter typically is Amazon\u2019s biggest.  Amazon cut its order minimum for free shipping to $25 from $35 indefinitely in May 2017.  Monday's news will add to pressure on Walmart and Target Corp TGT.N, which in recent years have chipped away at Amazon's lead with their own offers of free two-day shipping. While Walmart has maintained its $35 order threshold this holiday, Target has scrapped its minimum until Dec. 22.

Free shipping can apply to hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, versus hundreds of thousands on Target. Target, however, promises to deliver the items more quickly.

The comment comes after Flipkart chief Kalyan Krishnamurthy, late on Wednesday, told Reuters Amazon was losing relevance in the country.  Amazon and Flipkart are locked in a battle to dominate an Indian e-commerce market tipped, within a decade, to be worth $200 billion annually, according to Morgan Stanley.  Agarwal said the company\u2019s push on attractive credit facilities, product insurance and a Hindi-version of its mobile website were among measures paying off this time around.

Its Prime loyalty program, which offers free delivery, early access to deals during sales and free music and video streaming, has helped Amazon win tens of millions of clients, making India its fastest-growing Prime market globally.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  The adviser was giving his opinion on a case that pits Amazon against U.S. cosmetics company Coty.  The dispute is one of the many battles between luxury goods companies seeking to preserve their exclusivity and branding and online platforms such as Amazon and eBay fighting against online sales curbs.  It also raises the question of the scope of online platforms\u2019 responsibility for products sold, or content transmitted, on their sites.  The opinion from Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona, advocate general at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), came in a case involving Coty\u2019s German subsidiary, which took Amazon to a German court for stocking Coty\u2019s Davidoff perfume for third party sellers.  Coty said such practices violate its trade mark rights and that Amazon should be liable for stocking trade mark infringing goods. The German court subsequently sought guidance from the CJEU.  Companies which are not aware of trade mark infringements cannot be held responsible for storing such products for third party sellers, Campos Sanchez-Bordona said.  However, if they are actively involved in distributing the goods and if they operate a scheme like Amazon\u2019s, then they should show diligence in checking the legality of goods sold on their platforms, he said.  Under a scheme called \u201cFulfilled by Amazon\u201d, the U.S. online retail giant stores and delivers goods for third-party sellers, one of the key features of its business model.  Companies cannot simply absolve themselves of responsibility and should be aware that without this control, they can serve as a channel for the sale of illegal, counterfeit, stolen or unethical products, Campos Sanchez-Bordona said.  Amazon said it took steps to combat illegal products on its platform.  \u201cAmazon continues to invest heavily in fighting bad actors on our store and is committed to driving counterfeits to zero. Courts have ruled in our favor in the first two instances of this proceeding, and we are now awaiting preliminary legal clarification from the CJEU,\u201d the company said.  The Luxembourg-based court, which follows such non-binding recommendations in the majority of cases, would normally give a ruling in the next two to four months.

Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) foreign affairs department, said there was \u201ca lot of problem\u201d with the newspaper\u2019s coverage of India, but gave no examples.  The swipe at the Post came a day after a cabinet minister gave short shrift to Amazon's AMZN.O investment plans for India.  Bezos has praised India during his visit, saying the 21st century will be the Indian century and calling the country\u2019s dynamism and energy \u201csomething special\u201d.  \u201cI am not opposing Amazon as a company, in fact I am a regular customer ... Jeff Bezos should go home tell Washington Post what is his impression about India,\u201d Chauthaiwale told Reuters.  \u201cThe Washington Post editorial policy is highly biased and agenda driven.\u201d  In a statement to Reuters, The Washington Post said it \u201chas covered India fairly and accurately, even when the government has imposed tight restrictions on the flow of information.\u201d The Post\u2019s Opinions department is independent from the news division and publishes different perspectives from within India and around the globe, the newspaper added.

In its statement announcing the job-creation plans, Bezos said \u201cwe\u2019re excited about what lies ahead.\u201d  Still, street protests this week by small retailers and adverse comments from politicians have made Bezos\u2019 visit a public relations nightmare for Amazon.  India\u2019s shopkeepers have been a core constituency for the BJP since the party\u2019s early days. Sources told Reuters that Modi, who has courted other foreign investors, was unlikely to meet Bezos during his visit despite repeated requests by Amazon.  SOURING SENTIMENT  India last year enforced stringent rules for foreign investment in e-commerce, which forced Amazon to rework its business structures and strained ties between New Delhi and Washington.  India's antitrust body this week launched a probe into Amazon and Walmart's WMT.N Flipkart e-commerce service. India's brick-and-mortar retailers say Amazon and Flipkart have flouted regulations and burned billions of dollars to offer steep discounts. The companies deny the allegations.  On Thursday, Bezos attended a company event in Mumbai with Bollywood actors such as Shah Rukh Khan and said the company would \u201cdouble down\u201d its investments on its video streaming service, Prime Video.  But the event was largely overshadowed by comments from India\u2019s trade minister Piyush Goyal, who raised questions about the company\u2019s business practices while addressing a security conference in New Delhi and said Amazon had done no big favor to India by announcing a $1 billion investment.  Industry executives and their advisers told Reuters on Friday that Goyal\u2019s remarks were likely to put off foreign investors, denting India\u2019s economic growth which is already projected to fall to a 11-year low this year.  \u201cThis clearly is unbecoming, and it will hurt how the world views India as a destination,\u201d said a senior executive of a U.S.-based company operating in India.","1205":"May 9 (Reuters) - Livexlive Media Inc:  * LIVEXLIVE LAUNCHES OTT STREAMING APP ON ROKU, AMAZON FIRE TV AND APPLE TV DEVICES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1206":"Slideshow ( 10 images )  BERLIN\/MADRID (Reuters) - Workers at Amazon logistic centers in Germany and Spain staged strikes on Friday, walking off the job on Black Friday, the discount spending spree that kicks-off the start of the crucial Christmas shopping season.

Amazon said the number is far lower than expected, given the infection rate for the general population. The company, which encouraged other companies to report comparable figures, expects it will ramp to testing 50,000 U.S. employees per day for the virus by November.  The online retailer\u2019s news offered a rare look at the disease\u2019s impact on a major U.S. employer, under pressure from elected officials and unions for months to close warehouses with outbreaks.

FILE PHOTO: Amazon Prime Now delivery bags are seen in this illustration photo, July 27, 2017. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/Illustration\/File Photo  Monoprix Chief Executive Regis Schultz told Reuters that orders had been beating expectations, and that he hoped the delivery service could be extended elsewhere in France, although the decision was in the hands of e-commerce giant Amazon.  Nearly a month after the launch, the number of orders was exceeding by 2-3 times the expectations of the two partners, he said.  \u201cA first assessment is very, very satisfactory. Our priority is now to expand the service,\u201d said Schultz.  Monoprix, which is seen by analysts as being similar to U.S. retailer Whole Foods, started filling orders for subscribers to Amazon\u2019s Prime loyalty program in parts of Paris on Sept. 12 through a two-hour delivery partnership.  The performance of the alliance is being closely watched since Monoprix was the first French retailer to agree in March to sell its products via Amazon, causing a stir in the fiercely competitive domestic French market.  Monoprix, one of Casino\u2019s most valuable assets, is also under scrutiny as parent Casino faces concerns over its debts and has been selling assets to cut debt.  The Amazon Prime service currently covers a third of the French capital, generating sales of 10 million-20 million euros ($11.5 million to $23 million), equivalent to the food sales of a Monoprix store. It should cover the whole of Paris next year.  Asked if there were plans to expand elsewhere in France, Schultz replied: \u201cWe are ready to follow Amazon\u2019s deployment in all big French cities. They are likely to make the announcement when they are ready. It\u2019s part of their plans for sure.\u201d  Asked if the partnership paved the way to other deals with Amazon, he added: \u201cToday this is not the spirit of our agreements.\u201d  The U.S. e-commerce giant, which has run its Amazon Prime express delivery service in Paris since 2016, has made no secret of its desire to launch a grocery delivery service in France as part of its ambitions to expand in food retail.  OTHERS TARGET PARIS MARKET  Amazon's purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons MRW.L, have led to speculation it could target the European food and supermarket sector next.  Amazon Prime currently offers 6,000 new products chosen by Monoprix. The products are prepared in one Monoprix store and delivered by Amazon. Delivery is free for orders over 60 euros. For those under 60 euros, a 3.90 euros fee is charged.  Monoprix had 2017 sales of 5 billion euros and a margin estimated by some analysts at 5-6 percent. A key contributor to parent Casino\u2019s overall profit, it makes over 30 percent of its sales in the lucrative Paris market.  Schultz said the deal with Amazon gave Monoprix access to the 70 to 80 percent of Amazon Prime clients who were not already Monoprix clients, including many offices.  \u201cWe clearly are getting new clients from Prime. There are no elements showing a cannibalisation of Monoprix or Monoprix.fr.\u201d  However, competition in the sector is looming in Paris.  Leclerc, France\u2019s largest grocer by market share and which has built its reputation on low prices, also has its sights on Paris, giving itself three years to establish a solid foothold in the capital.  Rival Carrefour CARR.PA, which has 250 convenience stores in Paris, has launched six pickup points in the capital, where customers can order 15,000 products online and collect them in store.  Shares in Casino - which has also been linked with Carrefour - are down nearly 30 percent this year.  Worries over its debts and the competition it faces in France have led some analysts to speculate that Casino may have to sell Monoprix, but Schultz played this down.  \u201cThis is mere speculation.

It said the deal\u2019s initial two-year period would provide time to ensure JEDI was up to standards, noting that new contractors would be needed for other cloud computing demands in the future.

French companies have embraced Black Friday, named for the sales held on the first Friday after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday when retailers typically heavily discount their goods to spur business. However, there has been a backlash against the event driven in part by environmental concerns.  Several dozen protesters gathered at dawn outside an Amazon headquarters building in the Clichy district of Paris and staged a sit-in outside the front gates. They held up a sign saying: \u201cNo to Amazon and its world.\u201d  Manon Aubry, a left-wing member of the European parliament, said the protest was intended to \u201cdenounce the social, environmental and fiscal damage from Amazon.\u201d  \u201cFrom the streets to parliament, we continue to fight against the impunity of the multinationals,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.  According to social media posts from Attac, a group that campaigns for more democratic globalisation, there was also a sit-in outside an Amazon logistics centre near Lyon, in eastern France.  Video posted online by Attac showed police in riot helmets picking up activists and hauling them away. The Lyon protesters had erected a sign saying: \u201cAmazon... Stop expansion, Stop Over-production!\u201d  In a e-mailed statement Amazon France said it respected the rights of people to express their opinions but that does not extend to organising violent demonstrations where people work.  \u201cThe demonstrators and Attac are throwing around untrue allegations based on factual errors and are pointing the finger at Amazon for political ends,\u201d it said.  Francois Momboisse, president of French online retail association Fevad, condemned the protests.  \u201cBlack Friday is one of the top sales days of the year and it allows us to smooth out Christmas shopping over a longer period rather than compressing all those sales in the Dec. 10 to 24 period. It does not necessarily lead to more consumption,\u201d he told French broadcaster BFM TV.  French lawmakers on Monday passed a legislative amendment to ban abusive advertising and misleading promotions during sale periods, taking aim at Black Friday campaigns in particular.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) announced its decision in a tweet on Friday, with details likely to be made public later.  Amazon had approached the CCI and the country\u2019s market regulator SEBI alleging the deal would violate some pre-existing agreements it had with Future Group.  Last month Amazon won an injunction from a Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal pending arbitration.  Amazon, Future and Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  While the deal is yet to receive approval of stock exchanges and market regulator SEBI, the three companies are now embroiled in a legal battle at the Delhi High Court over the transaction.  An Indian antitrust lawyer said the CCI only looks into competition issues around a deal and is not concerned with other disputes between parties.  \u201cIt\u2019s (CCI) not a regulator which approves the transaction as such,\u201d the lawyer said.  Amazon says its 2019 deal with a Future Group subsidiary included clauses saying it could not sell its retail assets to certain parties, including Reliance.  Future has argued it entered into the deal with Reliance because its retail business was severely hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was critical to protect all its stakeholders.  The dispute has put Amazon at odds not just with Future Retail - one of country\u2019s top retailers - but also with Ambani\u2019s Reliance Group which is fast expanding its e-commerce business and threatening the dominance of the U.S. giant.","1221":"PARIS (Reuters) - Total is determined to push ahead with its plans to drill for oil in the Amazon basin, it said on Friday as Greenpeace activists interrupted its annual general meeting in protest at the project.  Slideshow ( 17 images )  The French oil major wants to explore Brazil\u2019s Foz do Amazonas basin, but Brazil\u2019s environmental agency rejected its licence application on Tuesday for a fourth time.  As the company\u2019s annual general meeting opened in Paris on Friday, four activists from Greenpeace descended by rope from the ceiling above the stage, unfurling banners reading \u201cLet\u2019s save the Amazon\u2019s coral reef\u201d.  At least a dozen others managed to enter the hall, with some chaining themselves to fixtures in the room.  Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told the meeting he would not cede to any kind of blackmail over the project, as the activists dangled on ropes above him.  \u201cOur position on the Amazon project has not been abandoned. We have our rights and we have obviously to respect Brazilian laws,\u201d Pouyanne told shareholders.  \u201cIt is also clear that Brazil\u2019s environmental regulators are under immense pressure from other organizations. We are exchanging information with them.\u201d  Brazil\u2019s Foz do Amazonas basin could contain up to 14 billion barrels of oil, geologists estimate, or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico.  MASSIVE CORAL REEF  A Greenpeace expedition in April documented coral in the area where Total plans to drill, after an earlier discovery of a massive coral reef nearby.  \u201cTotal refuses to listen to reason and persists in wanting to drill near this unique reef, at the risk of destroying it,\u201d Francois Chartier, head of Greenpeace\u2019s Oceans campaign, said in a statement.  Brazil\u2019s environmental agency requested more information from the company when it rejected its bid for an environmental license on Tuesday.  The Greenpeace activists were also protesting at Total\u2019s investment in offshore oil production blocks in French Guyana, which will boost its presence in the potentially lucrative Guyana basin.  Total faces more protests this month, after France\u2019s largest farmers\u2019 union called for a blockade of French oil refineries in protest at the company\u2019s decision to use imported palm oil at a new biofuel production site.","1222":"WASHINGTON\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Four top U.S. tech companies, Alphabet\u2019s Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple, responded to questions from a congressional committee by defending their practices and declining to answer some questions.  FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are seen in a combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS\/File Photos  The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, which released the answers Tuesday, had sent the queries as part of its antitrust probe of the four giants, which face a long list of other antitrust probes.  The companies, long a symbol of the dynamism of the U.S. economy, have seen their reputations tarnished by privacy lapses and allegations they abused their perch on top of the market to hurt small and nascent rivals.  Facebook and Apple declined comment for this story while Amazon and Google had no immediate comment.  In its responses, Google, which owns YouTube, denied favoring its own services over those of competitors in search, video and internet browsers.  It said \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of clicks following a Google search go to non-Google websites, that results from its YouTube offering are not given greater weight than rivals\u2019, and that its word processing and analytics tools are designed to work well with all browsers, not just its Chrome.  Google also said its \u201cvertical integration\u201d of advertising tools benefits advertisers in part through better consumer targeting, but that the ability of rivals to compete is not \u201cmeaningfully affected\u201d because it takes steps to level the playing field.  Despite its huge collection of data on search queries and clicks, Google said it could not provide much of the data sought by the committee. For example, asked whether it could share how many searches display location information about a business, Google said, \u201cWe do not have a standard definition for what searches are considered \u2018location searches\u2019 and thus, cannot provide the specific information requested.\u201d  For its part, Facebook acknowledged cutting off certain third-party apps from its developer platform for replicating core functionalities, such as Twitter\u2019s now-shuttered Vine, which it said replicated a Facebook product.  But it provided limited answers to other questions on the company\u2019s handling of prospective competitors. For example, asked for the timing and \u201cexact circumstances\u201d that led it to remove apps Phhhoto, MessageMe, Voxer and Stackla, Facebook replied that it \u201cwill restrict apps that violate its policies,\u201d without disclosing details.  On a related note, Senators Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, and Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, wrote to Facebook Tuesday to ask how the social media giant acquires users\u2019 locations, why locations are collected and if collection occurs when users have asked that it not be.  Apple answered questions about its browser and commissions it pays in its App Store, and addressed other issues, most of which are generally known. It said exactly two employees had sought to take disputes to arbitration. But asked how much it had spent on its map app that competes with Google, it said only \u201cbillions.\u201d  Amazon.com said in its response that it uses aggregated data from merchants on its third-party marketplace for \u201cbusiness purposes,\u201d but denied using the data to launch, source or price private-label products.  As of Sept. 29, there were approximately 384,000 U.S. active individual seller accounts on Amazon and approximately 514,000 active professional seller accounts in the U.S, the company said.  Amazon also acknowledged asking third-party merchants to lower their price on Amazon.com, when it finds merchants sell items for less on a competing website.  Amazon declined, however, to say how many Amazon private label products are sold at cost or below cost, how much revenue and profit Amazon makes from selling private brands or how it prices such items.  Amazon said it has 45 brands encompassing 158,000 private-label products, as well as some private brand items that are part of its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service.","1223":"(Repeats to add update tag)  NEW YORK, March 17 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc will only receive vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, its latest move to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.  The change does not mean Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or that sellers have to ship directly to consumers.  The move reflects how the global spread of the virus has created challenges for retailers, from supply chain to delivery.  In a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to \u201cquickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.\u201d  Amazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well.  \u201cWe understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  The company said the new protocol applies to its retail inventory as well as to the products of third-party sellers on its platform.  The move follows Amazon\u2019s Monday announcement that it will hire 100,000 more workers, as the world\u2019s largest online retailer is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.  LESS AD REVENUE?  The news may hurt demand for lucrative services that Amazon offers to merchants, like advertising.  Amy Roskelley, owner of Utah-based Health Beet, said she pays Amazon around $1,000 a month to promote her flatware products that help consumers portion their meals. Now that she can\u2019t add inventory to Amazon\u2019s warehouses, she plans to cut ad spend in half.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to justify spending money if I don\u2019t have enough inventory to fill\u201d customers\u2019 orders, she said.  Roskelley is considering other ways to reduce her dependence on Amazon, too, whether shipping directly to customers or driving traffic to her own website.  \u201cI have been concerned that they\u2019ll shut down Amazon\u2019s warehouses and won\u2019t ship out at all, and that would just devastate me,\u201d she said.  Amazon has yet to indicate any such closures. Still, the months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the Seattle e-commerce company\u2019s operations.  Merchant Zengxie Pang said Amazon\u2019s change came just as the China-based seller\u2019s factories had resumed production.  \u201cNow we can\u2019t ship to warehouses until April,\u201d Pang said. \u201cWe are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies, and they will likely run out of stock.\u201d  Chief executive of personal massager company LuLu, Michael Gawrychowski, said his supplier in China woke him in the middle of the night with news of Amazon\u2019s change.  \u201cPeople are freaking out,\u201d he said. Gawrychowski immediately sent a request for a 25,000-unit shipment. That was rejected, but a second request went through, he said.  Amazon\u2019s two-day shipping guarantee has in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday\u2019s announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon\u2019s business.  \u201cThis change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay, Wish, Walmart, Facebook Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,\u201d Sebastian said.  Customer searches for popular items including iPhone cases, AirPods and Apple Watch bands have fallen from the week prior, an indication of shifting shopper interests, according to research from Helium 10, which provides tools to sellers.  Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses have been furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus, and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession.  For sellers, which account for over half of sales on Amazon, the new warehouse policy only adds to the economic uncertainty they are facing, said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com.  \u201cSellers are rethinking their entire strategies for selling in 2020,\u201d he said,","1224":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O rapid expansion of one-day shipping delivered a strong holiday quarter and showed the rising ambition of the company, which in six years has created a network that handles nearly as many packages as FedEx Corp FDX.N.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Amazon's growth may squeeze profits at United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and other carriers, but a booming e-commerce industry and Amazon's own needs mean the older companies are not packing it in.  The world\u2019s biggest online retailer started making its own deliveries after an unexpected surge in 2013 holiday orders swamped UPS and FedEx. Amazon delivered 3.5 billion - or roughly half - of its global orders in 2019.  By comparison, 46-year-old FedEx handled about 3.8 billion deliveries in its latest fiscal year. Amazon also made significant gains against UPS, which was founded in 1907, and had volume of 5.5 billion last year.  Research firm eMarketer expects global online sales to hit $6.25 trillion in 2023 - up 560% from 2013.  \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a room for a third\u201d major shipper, said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights, who added that the UPS-FedEx duopoly keeps U.S. prices high.  The average cost of shipping a U.S. parcel was $9.51 in 2018, versus $1.81 in China and $5.26 in Germany, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index.  The dominant U.S. carriers are getting squeezed as Amazon competition lowers rates and e-commerce pushes up some costs. Online orders cost more to handle than business packages because they are often far-flung, one-off residential deliveries. The physical breadth of the United States also means costs could remain higher than in other countries.  Amazon so far is reserving lower-cost urban deliveries for its in-house service, while handing rural packages to carriers. The density of urban environments means costs per package are lower than rural routes.  UPS has some leverage because its unified delivery network is more efficient than the split FedEx Express and Ground networks. But, UPS depends on Amazon for 11.6% of its revenue.  \u201cAs with any customer, there\u2019s no such thing as unattractive freight, just unattractive pricing, so it will be up to UPS to make a decent return on this growing customer,\u201d Stifel analyst David Ross said in a client note.  Amazon\u2019s use of inexpensive independent contractors and e-commerce dominance give it the ability to negotiate hard.  Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx broke up with Amazon over the summer, giving up about 1% of its revenue. UPS\u2019s U.S. Next Day Air business scooped up much of that volume - and saw a 9.2% drop in revenue per package for 2019.  UPS\u2019s unionized workforce - and its dependence on Amazon business - leaves it particularly exposed to competition from the Seattle company\u2019s rising logistics unit.  \u201cThat will be a bigger hit to UPS than FedEx,\u201d Roberson said.","1225":"SAO PAULO, March 27 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc and retail group Casino Guichard Perrachon SA are in talks to either partner in Brazil as they did in France or reach a deal for the outright sale of Casino\u2019s appliance and electronics chain Via Varejo SA, a source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  A 19 percent plunge in Facebook shares rattled Amazon.com investors earlier in the day, with traders in Amazon\u2019s options displaying heightened defensiveness ahead of its June-quarter report after the bell.  Facebook late on Wednesday warned about a margin hit as revenue growth slows and user privacy costs climb.  The social network\u2019s dismal forecast followed a disappointing report by fellow FANG company Netflix on July 16. The so-called FANG stocks, which also include Google-owner Alphabet, have been central to Wall Street\u2019s rally in recent years, and any serious weakness in their revenues and profit expansions could make future stock market gains more difficult.  \u201cEven though we had a bump in the road with Facebook and Netflix, we\u2019re not derailing the tech story,\u201d said Synovus Trust portfolio manager Daniel Morgan after Amazon\u2019s report. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge sigh of relief.\u201d  Following its upbeat report after the bell, Amazon\u2019s stock rose 3.2 percent to a record high $1,866, more than making up for a 3 percent loss during Thursday\u2019s trading session.  As Amazon expands into grocery retail through its acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, and as more businesses move their IT departments onto its cloud infrastructure, its stock price has been red hot. Amazon recently traded at 110 times expected earnings, compared to more-profitable but slower growing Apple\u2019s valuation of 15 times earnings.  Amazon\u2019s stock market value has surged more than 50 percent in 2018 and is now above $900 billion, closing in on Apple\u2019s $955 billion market capitalization.

Hours after Gorman\u2019s electric performance at the swearing-in of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, her two books - neither out yet - topped Amazon.com\u2019s sales list.  \u201cI AM ON THE FLOOR MY BOOKS ARE #1 & #2 ON AMAZON AFTER 1 DAY!\u201d Gorman, a Los Angeles resident, wrote on Twitter.

As Yeats put it: \u2018For words alone are certain good: Sing, then\u2019.\u201d  Gorman, the youngest poet in U.S. history to mark the transition of presidential power, offered a hopeful vision for a deeply divided country in Wednesday\u2019s rendition.  \u201cBeing American is more than a pride we inherit. It\u2019s the past we step into and how we repair it,\u201d Gorman said on the steps of the U.S. Capitol two weeks after a mob laid siege and following a year of global protests for racial justice.  \u201cWe will not march back to what was. We move to what shall be, a country that is bruised, but whole. Benevolent, but bold.

A graduate of Harvard University, Gorman says she overcame a speech impediment in her youth and became the first U.S. National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017.  She has now joined the ranks of august inaugural poets such as Robert Frost and Maya Angelou.  Her social media reach boomed, with her tens of thousands of followers ballooning into a Twitter fan base of a million-plus.  \u201cI have never been prouder to see another young woman rise!

The termination of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who worked as user-experience designers in Seattle, comes two weeks after the company fired another employee Christian Smalls after he came to its Staten Island warehouse for a demonstration in violation of his paid quarantine.  The Seattle-based firm has been facing public scrutiny over safety and working conditions of warehouse, delivery and retail gig workers in the United States after cases of COVID-19 were reported in some of its facilities.

REUTERS\/Kham  Such companies will be considered a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d liable for VAT in Indonesia regardless of whether they have a physical office in the country or not, Indrawati said in a statement issued by the Cabinet Secretariat late on Tuesday.  The minister said it was \"because they have what is called a significant economic presence, although they don't have a branch here,\" listing Google, Amazon and Netflix NFLX.O as examples of companies to be affected by the upcoming rules.  The VAT rate in Indonesia is currently 10%, imposed on most products and services.  Google had a tax dispute with Jakarta in 2016 over alleged tax evasion, including missing VAT payments on advertising revenues, which it resolved with an undisclosed settlement.  The Indonesian government has repeatedly said it wanted to make streaming service providers such as Netflix pay their fair share of taxes.  Amazon is not currently active in e-commerce in Indonesia, but operates cloud services.  The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The bill, which needs parliamentary approval, is part of broader tax reforms in Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy intended to improve revenue collection, increase compliance and attract investment.  President Joko Widodo\u2019s re-election campaign promise for a corporate tax cut will also be part of the bill, Indrawati said.  The corporate tax rate would be lowered to 20% from 25% starting from 2021, while for companies with public share ownership of at least 40% the rate will be 17% from 20% now, she said.  Indrawati said she will also propose removing income tax on dividends obtained from onshore or offshore investments if the money is reinvested within the country.  Indonesia will adopt a \u201cterritorial\u201d tax regime for personal income tax, a change from the current \u201cworld-wide\u201d regime, she said.  The bill will also call for simpler penalties on underpayment and late submission of tax returns, relaxation of prepaid VAT rules, as well as summarize all tax incentives the government currently provides to encourage investment, Indrawati said.  It was not clear when the bill would be submitted to parliament for approval.","1237":"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - E-commerce giant Amazon on Wednesday launched a Hebrew-language website to recruit local Israeli companies to sell their products via Amazon.com, the latest step toward launching a local business in the country.

There has been widespread speculation in Israel\u2019s media that Amazon plans to open a local fulfillment center.  Amazon started reaching out to Israeli businesses in May, inviting them to join its local delivery program, which allows firms to use an Amazon.com seller account to fulfill orders to customers in Israel and abroad using local inventory.  Amazon did not say how many Israeli retailers had registered and declined to say when it was planning to fully launch a local business, saying only that it would be \u201csoon\u201d.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service lost almost $4 billion in 2018 even as package deliveries rose, according to results released on Wednesday, giving U.S. President Donald Trump potential ammunition against Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, which he claims pays too little for the agency's services.  Trump, without presenting evidence, has attacked Amazon repeatedly over the past year, accusing the world\u2019s largest online retailer of taking advantage of USPS by not paying enough for deliveries to make the service profitable.  USPS, an independent agency within the federal government, reported operating revenue of $70.6 billion for fiscal year 2018, which ended on Sept. 30, as sales at its shipping and packages business rose 10 percent.  However, its net loss widened to $3.9 billion from a loss of $2.7 billion in 2017, hurt by rising pay and benefits and higher transport costs, such as gas prices.  Package delivery, especially for major customer Amazon, has become a key part of USPS\u2019s business, but has not been enough to offset the sharp decline in first-class letters caused by the internet and email.  The president does not have the power to determine postal rates. They are set by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency with commissioners from both political parties who are selected by the president. That panel raised prices on packages by almost 2 percent in November.  Amazon is run by founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a newspaper Trump has repeatedly railed against. It has shown interest in delivering its own packages, and has tested drones for doing so.  In 2015, Amazon spent $11.5 billion on shipping, 46 percent of its total operating expenses that year. It has not commented publicly on Trump\u2019s criticisms.","1240":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. online retailer Amazon AMZN.O does not have to provide a helpline phone number to consumers, Europe's top court said on Wednesday in a ruling that could boost e-commerce merchants.

The extra cost may hit Walmart\u2019s bottom line, but increased spending on grocery delivery is seen as essential in the fierce battle for online orders for food and household staples.  \u201cIt is an absolutely necessary step for them to take in terms of their ability to compete with Amazon in particular,\u201d said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics.  Walmart said on Wednesday the service would be rolled out by the end of the year. Deliveries will cost $9.95 with a minimum $30 order and companies like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will provide transport. Other delivery companies will be added later this year.  The move will complement Walmart\u2019s rollout of curbside grocery pickup, which is currently available in 1,200 stores and will be added to a 1,000 more stores this year. It also allows Walmart to compete with Amazon\u2019s two-hour Prime Now service for shoppers of its loyalty program.  The expanded service should help the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer to get more of its store shoppers to buy items online, where they spend twice as much.  Intense competition is sweeping the grocery market, following Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods last year.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Rivals are also expanding delivery options. Amazon recently debuted free two-hour Prime Now grocery delivery from Whole Foods in four cities, free for its annual $99 Prime subscribers.  Kroger Co KR.N, the nation's largest supermarket operator, has home delivery from more than 872 stores across the United States, and this week expanded its partnership with delivery company Instacart.  Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market, mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts.  Walmart is No. 2 with 9 percent, followed by Ahold USA's AD.AS Peapod with 7 percent, FreshDirect with 6 percent and Instacart at 5 percent.  Online revenue growth slowed at Walmart in the most recent quarter, causing some analysts to question its strategy to compete with Amazon.

The move underscores how a company that started as an online bookseller is making forays into brick-and-mortar retail to capture a greater share of shoppers\u2019 spending.  For months, the world\u2019s largest online retailer has been expanding Amazon Go, where customers scan their smartphones at a turnstile to enter, and then cameras identify what they take from the shelves. When shoppers are finished, they simply leave the store and Amazon bills their credit cards on file.  Amazon has opened seven of the stores to the public since January: in Chicago, San Francisco and its hometown Seattle, mostly catering to workers in nearby offices looking for a quick lunch.  Amazon is evaluating top U.S. airports for new locations, according to public records requests to several airport operators.  \u201cThe lead for Amazon Go requested a meeting,\u201d read a June 27 email from a technology adviser who supports Los Angeles International, the second-busiest airport in the country, to a concessions official. \u201cInterested?\u201d  \u201cYes. Thanks!\u201d the concessions official replied.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  A few hundred miles north, in the heart of Silicon Valley, an account manager at Amazon\u2019s cloud unit asked San Jose International Airport for a meeting and referenced Amazon Go, as \u201cone of many possibilities we can discuss.\u201d  After the June meeting took place, during which Amazon discussed how the stores work, an airport information technology manager wrote: \u201cI am looking forward to moving forward with the Amazon Go technology at the airport.\u201d  Officials from both airports have since told Reuters they had no further correspondence about Amazon Go and that the retailer would have to undergo a competitive bid process to become a concessionaire, as is typical. The company\u2019s cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, has been in touch with airports for other purposes. The status of the Amazon Go effort is unclear.  An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.  A person familiar with the strategy confirmed that Amazon is studying how to get the checkout-free stores into airports and that an employee with experience in business development was assigned to the task.  \u201cThink about how you can expose your brand,\u201d the person familiar with the matter said, on condition of anonymity. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to build broad awareness just being in a dozen of the best airports.\u201d  Slideshow ( 4 images )  More than 350 million passengers boarded flights at the country\u2019s top 12 airports last year, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data.  Operating in airports will present new challenges for Amazon Go.  Workers must gain clearances to staff concessions after security checkpoints, and square footage in busy sections of an airport can be expensive to lease. What is more, many airports are publicly run and require would-be concessionaires to put in public bids for retail space.  If \u201cyou do a deal, it\u2019s almost like they go back out and shop it,\u201d said Kazuko Morgan, vice chairman at real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield.

Amazon launched its Prime services in India in 2016 and already offers services such as video and music streaming as well as grocery delivery in many cities across the country.  The company\u2019s move comes at a time when both Swiggy and Zomato struggle in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced the two startups to cut jobs and keep a tight lid on costs.

Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods last summer shook up the grocery industry and spawned worries that the online retailing giant would disrupt the grocery business in the same way it upended books, toys and electronics.  As part of a restructuring effort underway before the acquisition, Whole Foods earlier this year began requiring suppliers to use a firm of its choosing to restock shelves and run promotions. As first reported in the Washington Post, it is charging some suppliers the equivalent of 3 to 5 percent of sales to cover the cost of those services.  Whole Foods also adopted a Costo Wholesale Corp styled model for in-store sampling and has added charges for that service, to the chagrin of some small, local brands that were a draw for some shoppers.  Those changes have caused significant heartburn for upstart brands and shoppers who were drawn to Whole Foods because it offered a unique mix of products.  \u201cThe changes we\u2019ve been making across the company directly address the feedback our supplier partners have shared over the years about the challenges of our decentralized purchasing structure and inconsistent practices across regions and stores,\u201d Whole Foods spokeswoman Robin Rehfield Kelly said in a statement.

Pop star Lady Gaga announced a line of beauty products exclusively for sale on Amazon last week, which is available for pre-order during the promotional event.  \u201cIt\u2019s Christmas in July,\u201d said Tom Caporaso, chief executive of loyalty platform Clarus Commerce, citing company research that shows roughly 50% of consumers say they search other retailers to find the best price on Prime Day.  \u201cThat\u2019s telling you that consumers are definitely in the buying mode but are not 100% loyal to Amazon,\u201d he said.  To coincide with Prime Day, more than 2,000 workers at seven Amazon sites across Germany went on strike over pay and conditions for logistics workers for at least two days, labor union Verdi said on Monday.  Other protests have been planned across Europe and the United States, including at an Amazon warehouse in Shakopee in Minneapolis, where workers have scheduled a work stoppage and are demanding improved work conditions.  Employees are also calling on the company to do more to combat climate change and cut alleged business dealings with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  \u201cEvents like Prime Day have become an opportunity for our critics, including unions, to raise awareness for their cause, in this case, increased membership dues,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.  \u201cThese groups are conjuring misinformation to work in their favor, when in fact we already offer the things they purport to be their cause \u2014 industry leading pay of $15 per hour, benefits, and a safe workplace for our employees.\u201d  Democratic presidential candidates and U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on Twitter threw their support behind the striking workers.

Companies are attempting to avoid any confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump but want to exert as much influence as they can to dissuade him from tearing up trade agreements or introducing tariffs on a wide swath of imports.  Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and cloud-computing company, which could be hurt by tariffs on items sold through its website and components for its data centers, is discussing industry-wide advertising campaigns and more extensive government lobbying, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  Amazon declined to comment.  Toyota Motor North America, a subsidiary of Japan\u2019s Toyota, which could suffer if Trump follows through on a plan to impose tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, flew workers to Washington for a rally this week in front of the U.S. Capitol while the unit\u2019s chief has met key members of Congress in recent weeks to discuss the potential impact of tariffs.  Executives from General Motors Co GM.N, which could be hurt if Trump pulls the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement or if he imposes auto tariffs, have also held meetings with the administration and Congress over the last year to raise its concerns about trade issues. Tariffs would lead to \"a reduced presence at home and abroad,\" the company said in June.  The largest U.S. automaker is set to hire Trump\u2019s former deputy director of the National Economic Council and adviser on international economic affairs. Everett Eissenstat, who left the White House earlier this month, will head GM\u2019s public policy efforts, according to sources familiar with the matter. GM told Reuters it had an opening but declined to confirm the hire. Eissenstat could not be reached for comment.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Those already suffering from the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect in June, are also pushing for relief in private.  The chief executive of Alcoa told investors on a conference call this week that the aluminum producer was in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with the Trump administration, the Commerce Department and members of Congress about the elimination of tariffs or getting an exception for Canadian aluminum.  Alcoa said this week it will incur as much as $14 million a month in extra expenses, mainly from tariffs levied on aluminum imported from Canada, its biggest supplier.  CLOUD PAIN  In addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs already imposed, the Trump administration has threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods which would affect thousands of imported products from furniture to network routers.  Seattle-based Amazon is concerned such tariffs would hit shoppers during the crucial holiday shopping season, the person familiar with the matter said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon has identified a wide range of items, some of them high-value, the tariffs would hit and is assessing the potential impact on its business, the person said.  High among its concerns is an increase in import costs for components used in data centers or other items that would make its cloud computing division less competitive, two people familiar with the matter said. Amazon Web Services is the company\u2019s most profitable unit.  Amazon is not alone in the technology industry with its worries. \"It\u2019s hard to think of many of our companies that don\u2019t have some risk and exposure as a result of the tariff,\" said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, which counts Amazon rivals Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google and others as members.  Lobbying administration officials and members of Congress can be costly with no guarantee of victory, but some have succeeded.  Apple Inc AAPL.O won guarantees from the Trump administration that its lucrative iPhones would ship from China without being subject to tariffs, the New York Times reported last month.","1255":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to block federal aid for the U.S. Postal Service unless it raises shipping rates for online companies like Amazon.com, prompting criticism that the move would hurt consumers relying more than usual on packages during the coronavirus outbreak.

Because they\u2019re handing out packages for Amazon and other internet companies, and every time they bring a package, they lose money on it,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cThe Post Office should raise the price of a package by approximately four times.\u201d  The president also accused post office officials of being \u201cvery cozy\u201d with big online merchants.  Trump made the remarks at a ceremony to sign a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill designed to help small businesses and hospitals and assist in testing for the virus, which has killed more than 50,000 Americans.  The Postal Service has said that it may not be able to continue service past September without help. The U.S. Congress has authorized the Treasury Department to lend it up to $10 billion as part of an earlier $2.3 trillion coronavirus stimulus package.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who attended Friday\u2019s signing, told reporters that his team was meeting with post office officials \u201cand actually, we are going to put certain criteria for a postal reform program as part of the loan.\u201d  Treasury officials have told top postal service officials that they may ask for changes in how the service manages its finances as part of the loan, including what it charges to deliver packages, The Washington Post reported on Thursday.  Trump told Mnuchin at the event he would not support aid unless the postal service raised its rates.  \u201cIf they don\u2019t do it, I\u2019m not signing anything and ... I\u2019m not authorizing you to do anything,\u201d Trump said.  Later on Friday, the president said that he wanted the post office to be updated but wanted to make sure it would survive.  \u201cI will never let our Post Office fail,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe people that work there are great, and we\u2019re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!\u201d  The Package Coalition, whose members include Amazon, eBay and others, said that raising prices to deliver packages would mean Americans would pay higher prices.  \u201cNow, when Americans need affordable and reliable package delivery service more than ever, Congress must fight to guarantee emergency relief for the Postal Service and stop this package tax,\u201d said coalition Chairman John McHugh in an email statement.","1256":"WASHINGTON, April 29 (Reuters) - Several of Amazon.com Inc\u2019s foreign websites have been added to the U.S. trade regulator\u2019s \u201cNotorious Markets\u201d report on marketplaces known for counterfeiting and piracy concerns.

The Federal Cartel Office said in a statement on Thursday that it had received many complaints from traders about the business practices of Amazon of late.  \u201cAmazon acts as a kind of \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 to customers.

It has faced a long-running battle with unions in the country over pay and conditions for logistics workers, who staged another round of strikes last week.

Microsoft quickly returned to its spot as the most valuable company, but Apple was on track to end the session above Amazon, up 0.4 percent, taking the No 2 spot.  Apple\u2019s stock has risen 11 percent since its quarterly report last Tuesday, with investors betting it was oversold following months of concern about a slowdown in iPhone demand, and the company\u2019s rare revenue warning on Jan. 2 related to soft demand in China.  After touching a record $1.1 trillion last October, Apple\u2019s market capitalization fell gradually, and it was overtaken in December by Amazon and Microsoft.  Apple\u2019s stock market value hit a low of $675 billion on Jan. 3 after its revenue warning, but then steadily recovered, helped in part by a quarterly report that was better than feared by investors.  While Apple has gained in recent sessions, Microsoft and Amazon\u2019s stocks have fallen after their quarterly reports. Amazon has declined about 4 percent since Thursday, when it forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates and warned over new regulations in India.

When not attending to animals, he turns to his other role: attempting to neuter the expansion ambitions of Amazon.com Inc.  Renevier leads a group of local volunteers that has succeeded in suspending construction at a site that campaigners and a senior local official say is earmarked to become a logistics hub for the online retailer. Building at the site is on hold while a legal challenge the vet helped spearhead makes its way through the courts.  In France, disparate anti-Amazon forces \u2013 including local activists, environmentalists, trade unions and members of parliament - are coming together to battle the world\u2019s largest online retailer. In some instances, they have received funding from some of the world\u2019s wealthiest philanthropists. The aim: to stop the e-commerce giant from expanding its presence arguing the U.S.-based company destroys retail jobs, exploits workers and harms the environment \u2013 arguments Amazon rejects.  Amazon opponents scored a high-profile victory in April when, following a separate legal challenge brought by trade union workers and backed by environmental lobby group Friends of the Earth, a French court ruled the firm was not adequately protecting its employees from COVID-19. Amazon, which disputed the court\u2019s findings, responded by closing its French warehouses and distribution centres for 35 days. The company has since agreed a deal with unions and re-opened the hubs, but the ruling has emboldened the company\u2019s critics elsewhere \u2013 including in the United States.  Renevier, a silver-haired 59-year old, is the unpaid head of a group of local campaigners called Fracture that along with another local group \u2013 and with backing from Friends of the Earth \u2013 is trying to stop Amazon expanding its footprint in France\u2019s south east. Before dealing with his surgical list that June morning, he stopped by the empty construction site.  The vet, who lives 14 kilometres from the site, said he was concerned about the traffic and pollution an Amazon logistics hub would cause and believed that Amazon promoted a consumerist way of life that was harmful to society.  \u201cHow are we going to reduce the pollution when you have a big operation like this, with so many vehicles that are going to be circulating around it?\u201d he said. He added that he didn\u2019t shop at Amazon.com and was trying \u2013 so far unsuccessfully \u2013 to persuade his adult son to stop doing so.  Amazon representatives declined to comment on whether the firm was connected to the Lyon site or on the activities of the company\u2019s opponents.  The representatives said the company was good for the environment because its distribution model was more efficient than traditional retail, and therefore involved fewer miles travelled and less pollution. They said the company\u2019s business model complements, rather than destroys, bricks and mortar retail and that it works closely with small French firms who use Amazon\u2019s logistics network. They also said the company generates thousands of jobs, directly and indirectly.  FACING OPPOSITION  France is particularly fertile ground for Amazon sceptics. It is a country that is historically queasy about U.S.-style capitalism, has strong trade unions, and an attachment to the kind of mom-and-pop neighbourhood stores that, in some cases, feel threatened by Amazon.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  In addition to legal action, Amazon\u2019s opponents in France are engaging in a range of tactics from direct action that has involved storming the company\u2019s sites and lobbying for legislation to impose a two-year moratorium on distribution sites of the scale that the online retailer operates. France\u2019s new environment minister, Barbara Pompili, last week said she backs a moratorium, without specifying the length.  It\u2019s not the only country where Amazon faces opposition. In Germany, the company\u2019s largest market after the United States, workers at six Amazon sites went on short-term strike over safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the United States, Amazon workers in Michigan, New York, Illinois and Minnesota staged walkouts to demand safer working conditions in the epidemic.  Amazon workers filed a case in June against the online retailer in the U.S district court for the eastern district of New York alleging the firm did not adequately protect workers from COVID-19 at a facility on Staten island, New York. Three of the French unions that were involved in the case in France have also asked the US court if they can take part in the New York case, which is ongoing.  The French ruling \u201csends a significant message to Amazon workers in the United States and everywhere,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which itself petitioned the court in the New York case to participate on the side of the Amazon workers.  Amazon has said its distribution centres in France, the United States and elsewhere are safe.  On the U.S. case, Lisa Levandowski, Amazon spokesperson said: \u201cAmazon has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation.\u201d In a June 30 court filing, Amazon\u2019s lawyers said the plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed because they were \u201cunsupported by any plausible allegations,\u201d among other reasons.  The company does have supporters in France. Christian Poiret, mayor of a district in northern France where Amazon has a distribution centre, said he fought to attract the online retailer in order to generate jobs in the area. He added that he\u2019s concerned about the actions of the anti-Amazon campaigners because of \u201cthe image we\u2019re sending to foreign investors.\u201d  An \u00c9lys\u00e9e official said French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s administration has not changed its policy: \u201cAmazon\u2019s sites have been welcome and are welcome.\u201d  BATTLEGROUND FRANCE  For Amazon, France offers potential for growth. Amazon has an estimated 19% share of the French business-to-consumer e-commerce market, significantly lower than its 42% share in Germany, according to market researcher Forrester Research.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose its French revenues but says the country is a smaller market for the company than the UK and Germany.  The company says it has in the past three years doubled the number of people it directly employs in France to 9,300. That is a faster rate than it has increased its workforce in each of the UK and Germany during the same period. And, Amazon plans to open another big distribution centre in northern France in the next few months, a company representative said.  Amazon is also planning to set up a big distribution centre in Metz, near France\u2019s border with Luxembourg, according to Jean-Luc Bohl, who until earlier this month was mayor of Metz Metropolitan area local government. Amazon representatives declined to comment.  The planned project Renevier is seeking to block is for a 160,000-square-metre logistics hub near Lyon airport.Amazon isn\u2019t named in the planning application, which was submitted by the French arm of an Australian-headquartered property developer called Goodman Group that specializes in building logistics hubs.  But Amazon would ultimately operate the site, say campaigners and David Kimelfeld, who until earlier this month was head of the Lyon Metropolitan area local government, a region that is close to the site. Kimelfeld said he had attended meetings with other local officials where Amazon\u2019s involvement with the project was discussed. Reuters was unable to independently confirm discussion of Amazon\u2019s involvement during the meetings.  Goodman France didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Parent company Goodman Group said: \u201cGiven there is a case before the courts, we are not in a position to make a comment at this time, other than to say there have been two previous rounds of litigation where we were successful both times.\u201d  Renevier\u2019s Fracture and the other local group filed suits in the Lyon administrative tribunal in 2018 and 2019 alleging irregularities in the planning application, including that Goodman is not the ultimate operator of the hub. The tribunal ruled against the groups late last year, a decision Renevier and his allies appealed in January.  SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS  The lawyer representing Renevier\u2019s group in the legal challenge is now being assisted by a lawyer seconded by the Friends of the Earth national headquarters in Paris. Friends of the Earth also campaigned in a municipal election in May against a local mayor who backed the project.  It is part of a broader campaign by the lobby group against Amazon, which it says has created an unsustainable economic model that is harmful for the planet and for humans.Some of the Amazon-related activities of Friends of the Earth are funded indirectly by the European Climate Foundation, which distributes grants on behalf of donors including a Rockefeller family philanthropic fund, Michael Bloomberg, the family foundation of computer mogul William Hewlett and the IKEA founder\u2019s foundation.  ECF\u2019s executive director of strategic communications, Tom Brookes, said the grant was to fund a range of the environmental lobby group\u2019s activities but that the foundation was aware at the time of the award that some money would be used in its Amazon campaign. Brooke added that donors weren\u2019t necessarily aware of where individual grants go.  The lead campaigner on Amazon for the French chapter of Friends of the Earth, Alma Dufour, said most of the ECF\u2019s grant goes towards broader grassroots climate initiatives and the amount spent on targeting Amazon is small. Brooke and Dufour declined to comment on the size of the grant.  The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation said it provided general support for ECF for its broad mission on climate change, but not specifically for the Amazon campaign. The IKEA foundation said it had a shared mission with ECF relating to the environment but didn\u2019t address specific questions about Amazon. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and Bloomberg Philanthropies did not respond to requests for comment.  Open Society Foundations, founded and chaired by U.S. billionaire George Soros, said it provided 9,000 euros to the French chapter of Friends of the Earth to support its campaign to protect low-wage and informal workers and small shop owners in the pandemic.  Friends of the Earth said the money was specifically for the Amazon campaign. Open Society referred questions about how the money was spent to the environmental group, but the foundation\u2019s chief communications officer Laura Silber said: \u201cLike any other workplace, Amazon must be held accountable to its workers.\u201d Soros, contacted via Open Society, did not respond to questions about Amazon.","1265":"* MSCI Asia-Pacific up 0.3 pct, Nikkei up 0.4 pct  * Amazon shares jump in after-market trade as revenue surges  * Euro steady near 3-1\/2 month low after ECB meeting  SINGAPORE, April 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares edged higher on Friday, after U.S. equities were buoyed by solid quarterly earnings and a rebound in technology stocks, while the euro languished near three-month lows after the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged.

So far, 45 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter earnings, with 79.7 percent beating consensus estimates. Analysts see 23.1 percent earnings growth for the quarter, based on a blend of actual and estimated results.  The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries closed below the 3 percent level on Thursday as buyers emerged following a sell-off fuelled by worries over growing U.S. debt issuance and rising costs.

The move came two months after the European Commission opened an investigation into the criteria the company uses to select winners of its \u201cbuy box\u201d, which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.  The probe will also examine whether the company gives preferential treatment to its own retail offers and marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services.

Amazon said the EU should absorb the Italian case for the sake of consistency and efficiency.  \u201cWhen the European Commission decides to investigate a matter, European law says that national competition authorities cannot investigate the same topic.

The Saudi giant sucks oil from Arabian sands and sells it to energy-thirsty nations, sending the proceeds back to its controlling monarchy. Amazon sells stuff online, ships it to customers rapidly and reinvests the profits to destroy the economics of every industry it enters.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May greets the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman outside 10 Downing Street in London, March 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Simon Dawson  But both corporate titans are engaged in a similar game of extraction, quite separate from their business models. In Saudi Aramco\u2019s case, the world\u2019s financial capitals are prostituting themselves to accommodate an initial public offering potentially valuing the company at $2 trillion sometime over the next year. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s request for proposals for a second headquarters in North America has U.S. municipalities bending over backwards to please the $765 billion behemoth.  Competition is a good thing. The fact that, say, Newark is trying to sell its charms to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos over Miami\u2019s is a healthy exercise for New Jersey\u2019s largest city. Even if Newark loses, the process should make the city better prepared to attract other businesses and nurture the ones it already has. Saudi\u2019s exchange-shopping could produce similar re-examinations of the strengths and weaknesses of the financial centers and their bourses in London, New York, Hong Kong and beyond.  But there\u2019s also another risk from what might be called the \u201cAramazon effect\u201d: a shortsighted race to the bottom that sticks the winners with long-term curses their leaders, communities and institutions may live to regret.  Take the wooing of Aramco, which went into high gear two weeks ago in the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May rolled out the red carpet for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the throne and the architect of Riyadh\u2019s ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d economic-reform program, for which the listing of Aramco is a key component. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson welcomed bin Salman, who also had lunch with Queen Elizabeth and later dined at Clarence House with Princes Charles and his son William \u2013 rare treatment for a 32-year old dauphin.  There are, of course, many reasons for Britain to suck up to the son of the reigning Saudi monarch, including defense, geopolitics and general business considerations. BAE Systems, for instance, bagged an order for 48 Typhoon jets from the Saudi air force following the visit. But landing the Aramco listing is critical to helping the May government contend that divorce from the European Union will not weaken the UK\u2019s pre-eminence as a global financial capital. That\u2019s especially true after $158 billion consumer-goods giant Unilever, picked Rotterdam over London as its global headquarters on Thursday.  Investors in particular have protested considerations by the London Stock Exchange and regulators to water down listing, governance or disclosure requirements to assuage the Saudis. The Investment Association, which represents fund managers overseeing nearly $10 trillion of client money, has lobbied the Financial Conduct Authority not to move forward with the creation of a so-called \u201cpremium listing\u201d category for companies controlled by sovereigns, as Aramco would be.  The worry is that by modifying the rules around related-party transactions and controlling shareholders, London\u2019s reputation for the highest standards of corporate governance will be diluted. Recent history offers the opposition some evidence. They point to the ignominious delisting of Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation five years ago. The Kazakh mining group incinerated shareholders after its London debut amid allegations of malfeasance and a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. So did Bumi, a miner controlled by an Indonesian family, which was eventually delisted after fierce infighting among its shareholders. Both were included in FTSE indices, which the special class listing proposed for Aramco would not be.  Beyond bending rules, which the Hong Kong exchange has done as part of its ambition to best London and New York for the Aramco deal, cozying up to Saudi Arabia raises bigger questions about morality. Reformer though he may be, bin Salman\u2019s recent roundup and detention of hundreds of Saudis has attracted widespread concern about human rights, due process and the rule of law. The New York Times reported this week on the possible beating, and subsequent death, of one detainee. While it\u2019s perhaps just business for the exchanges to ignore these allegations, it\u2019s uncomfortable for leaders like May and President Donald Trump - who will welcome bin Salman and his entourage on March 20 \u2013 to engage in such public bootlicking.  Amazon doesn\u2019t kidnap people and beat them in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton. But the contest to host its second headquarters has unleashed a similar fox-in-the-henhouse tizzy. The danger is that the winner of the competition, whom Amazon promises will see 50,000 new jobs and some $5 billion of capital investment, winds up fiscally constrained by piling incentives, tax breaks and other concessions that, in the end, produce no greater financial benefit. It has already provoked other companies to ask municipalities to match the sorts of goodies offered to Amazon.  That\u2019s one of the reasons Richard Florida, an urban studies expert and professor at the University of Toronto, launched a \u201cNon-Aggression Pact for Amazon\u2019s HQ2\u201d last month. The petition, which has been signed by leading economists, policymakers and urban planners, argues that tax giveaways and location incentives are wasteful and counterproductive. Worse still, they sap communities of funds that could be used for education, housing and transportation.  Moreover, Florida worries that Amazon is sowing the seeds for an even bigger backlash than the one U.S. tech giants are already weathering due to their dominance. What happens if the promises of prosperity don\u2019t come true? \u201cThere will be demonstrations and protests and accusations that \u2018you bankrupted our town,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cHow can mayors and the heads of chambers of commerce explain to the man on the street that they are giving billions of dollars to the richest man in the world? It just doesn\u2019t sound right.\u201d  The risk is one that Amazon seems prepared to tolerate in asking cities to fight it out, arguably for the benefit of its shareholders today. And, who knows, landing its new HQ might actually improve the fortunes of a downtrodden city like Richard Florida\u2019s own hometown of Newark, offsetting any expensive incentives. But whether beckoning in a tech giant or the listing of a Saudi oil producer, local and national governments ought to better consider the risks of long-term failure before handing over the keys.","1271":"(Corrects paragraphs 1, 3 and the final paragraph to show Apple has no PAC)  July 29 (Reuters) - When the CEOs of Amazon.com Inc , Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google testify before the U.S. House committee dedicated to antitrust on Wednesday, they will address lawmakers to whom their companies and employees have given a collective $67,300 in this election cycle.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, January 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Numerous other courts, including two federal appeals courts, have held that Amazon cannot be held liable as a seller of products from third-party vendors. The new ruling from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, which reversed a lower court decision, appeared to be the first to buck that trend.  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In addition to selling its own inventory, Amazon allows third-party vendors to list products for sale on its website. Such vendors may store their products in Amazon\u2019s warehouses or ship them directly to customers.  Amazon earned about $11 billion in revenue from services it provided to third-party sellers for the quarter ended in March. About half of the items sold on Amazon are from third-party companies, database firm Statista reported.  Liability for defective products is generally governed by state law, and Wednesday\u2019s decision is based on the laws of Pennsylvania, where the customer, Heather Oberdorf, lives.  \u201cIt\u2019s gratifying that the 3rd Circuit agreed with our argument and recognized that the existing interpretation of product liability law in Pennsylvania was not addressing the reality, the dominance that Amazon has in the marketplace,\u201d said David Wilk, Oberdorf\u2019s lawyer.

In Wednesday\u2019s opinion, Circuit Judge Jane Richards Roth, writing for a 2-1 majority of a three-judge panel, said Amazon may be liable in part because its business model \u201cenables third-party vendors to conceal themselves from the customer, leaving customers injured by defective products with no direct recourse to the third-party vendor.\u201d  The panel sent the case back to the lower court, which will have to decide whether the leash was actually defective.","1274":"May 10 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc:  * AMAZON.COM INC - RYANAIR IS MOVING ITS INFRASTRUCTURE TO AMAZON WEB SERVICES  * AMAZON.COM INC - RYANAIR PLANS TO CLOSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF ITS DATACENTERS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1275":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is exploring alternatives to locating part of its new headquarters in New York in case the plan should fail due to local opposition, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.  The online retailer has not yet acquired any land for the project, which would make it easy to scrap its plans, the source said. The Washington Post reported the story earlier on Friday.  The person briefed on the matter said that Amazon was still working toward winning approval from New York officials and had not given up on the proposal, but was considering potential alternatives to New York.  Earlier, the Post, which is owned by Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, reported that Amazon executives had had internal discussions to reassess the situation in New York and explore alternatives. It cited two unnamed people familiar with the retailer\u2019s thinking.  In a statement on Friday, Amazon said it was working to engage with New Yorkers, but did not discuss whether it would change its plans.  \u201cWe\u2019re focused on engaging with our new neighbors - small business owners, educators, and community leaders,\u201d it said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s building a pipeline of local jobs through workforce training or funding computer science classes for thousands of New York City students, we are working hard to demonstrate what kind of neighbor we will be.\u201d  Amazon shares closed down 1.6 percent on Friday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  In November, Amazon said it would branch out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in two new developments.  The world\u2019s largest online retailer plans to spend $5 billion on the developments in Long Island City in New York\u2019s Queens borough, and in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, D.C, and expects to get more than $2 billion in tax credits and incentives with plans to apply for more.  Amazon has mailed flyers to Queens residents touting the economic benefits of its New York expansion.  But some residents in the rapidly transforming Long Island City neighborhood across the East River from mid town Manhattan\u2019s skyscrapers have loudly opposed Amazon\u2019s plan. They say they fear more crowded subway stations, an overburdened sewage system and rent increases that would drive out long-time residents.  \u201cI would be happy not to have them,\u201d said Terri Gloyd, the co-owner of the LIC Corner Cafe. \u201cI think most of the neighborhood hasn\u2019t wanted them here.\u201d She said her neighbors may have given the prospect of Amazon a warmer welcome had the subsidy package not been so large.  A critic of the plan, Queens lawmaker Senator Michael Gianaris, was appointed to a state senate panel that has the power to block Amazon\u2019s campus, local media including the New York Times have reported.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  City council speaker Corey Johnson told local radio he is looking at subsidies for Amazon and that the plan is not yet final. One point of contention could be Amazon\u2019s opposition to labor unions.  U.S. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose district spans parts of Queens and the Bronx, has also criticized Amazon.  Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a link to the Post story on Friday and said: \u201cCan everyday people come together and effectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations? Yes, they can.\u201d  In one sign of opposition, artists spray-painted Amazon\u2019s logo - spelled \u201cAMAZNO\u201d - on streets near the proposed site.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio support Amazon\u2019s plan.  Cuomo defended the deal on Friday as the largest economic development the state had ever won and cited the Post story.  \u201cIf Amazon does not come to New York, it\u2019s because of the political opposition. Because it is so ironic for Amazon, after they spent one year with everyone seducing them, and everyone courting them, we win and then there\u2019s political opposition.\u201d  BIDDING WAR  The split second headquarters, which Amazon called HQ2, attracted 238 proposals from across North America in a year-long bidding war.  Amazon ended the frenzy by dividing the spoils between the two most powerful U.S. East Coast cities and offering a consolation prize of a 5,000-person center in Nashville, Tennessee.  At the outset of its search last year, Amazon said it was looking for a business-friendly environment. The company said it will receive performance-based incentives of $1.525 billion from the state of New York, including an average $48,000 for each job it creates.  It can also apply for other tax incentives, such as New York City\u2019s Relocation and Employment Assistance Program that offers tax breaks potentially worth $900 million over 12 years. What benefit the company would actually get was unclear.","1276":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - If Amazon.com decides to fight the Pentagon\u2019s decision to award a highly contested $10 billion cloud computing contract to Microsoft, it could act as early as next week.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  A challenge to the Defense Department\u2019s award announced Friday is widely expected by legal experts, analysts and consultants, especially after President Donald Trump publicly derided Amazon\u2019s bid for the high-stakes contract.  In July, Trump said the administration was reviewing Amazon\u2019s bid after complaints from other companies. Before then, Amazon was widely considered to be a front-runner. Trump has repeatedly taken swipes at Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post.  For over a year, the acrimonious contract-award process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract, set off a showdown among Amazon, Microsoft Corp, Oracle Corp and IBM Corp and involved conflict of interest allegations, legal challenges and intense lobbying.  In a statement, Amazon Web Services said it was \u201csurprised about this conclusion.\u201d A person familiar with the matter told Reuters the company is considering options for protesting the award. The company did not respond to requests for comment on its next steps.  Reuters spoke to several legal experts who said the company primarily has two options. It could go to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) - a legislative branch of the government that offers auditing services, which could offer an immediate stay. Amazon could also go to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which could allow it to strengthen its case through discovery.  Amazon has three calendar days to request a debriefing: a process in which the government explains to Amazon why it was unsuccessful and shares details on the evaluation process, said Michael Hordell, an attorney who works with Barnes and Thornburg LLP.  The debriefing could also get extended by a few days if the Defense Department allows additional questions after offering an explanation - a move the agency has allowed in the past, several attorneys said.  After the Pentagon has answered Amazon\u2019s questions, the company has five calendar days to file a \u201cprotest\u201d with the GAO, Hordell said.  If the company is not happy with the GAO\u2019s decision, Amazon could also go to the United States Court of Federal Claims, the attorneys said. It could even skip going to the GAO altogether, they said.  Another option for Amazon is to file a protest with the Department of Defense, but all attorneys Reuters spoke to said that is highly unlikely.  AN AUTOMATIC STAY  If Amazon goes to the GAO, it can get an \u201cautomatic stay of performance,\u201d said Franklin Turner, an attorney with McCarter & English LLP.  That gives the GAO 100 days to make a decision, Turner said.  If the company goes to the court, it does not get an automatic stay and has to file a preliminary injunction: an order that may be granted before or during trial, with the goal of preserving the status quo before final judgment.  The court, on the other hand, allows for \u201cdiscovery\u201d: a process which allows an aggrieved party to obtain evidence by requesting additional documents and depositions.  The direction of the company\u2019s legal fight could further be decided by a set of documents and evidence that the Defense Department will need to offer the company after Amazon files its protest.  If Amazon does not receive all the documents and evidence it wants, the company could either file a supplemental protest at the GAO or could go to court, the attorneys said.  Amazon is likely to fight the decision if only to show it is serious about its government contracting business, some of the attorneys and analysts said.  Down the road, the company is likely to focus on winning cloud contracts from the Central Intelligence Agency, which is looking to ramp up its reliance on the cloud, with plans to solicit tens of billions of dollars of work from tech companies next year.  Amazon already has a $600 million contract with the CIA.","1277":"(Adds details on Alphabet share price growth, projections on hitting $1 trillion level)  SAN FRANCISCO, March 8 (Reuters) - Apple Inc, the world\u2019s most valuable publicly listed company, is in danger of being beaten by Amazon.com Inc to the $1 trillion mark.  Wall Street\u2019s optimism about last year\u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple\u2019s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company\u2019s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Most Wall Street analysts are not quite that enthusiastic about the growth of Apple and Amazon. Analysts on average expect Apple\u2019s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Analysts covering Amazon on average expect its stock to rise 10 percent within the next year to reach $1,700, which would give it a market value of $823 billion.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. In an earlier response, the company had said it does not track or monitor individuals , who may be organizing, planning strikes or talking to the media.  Reuters reported in May that Amazon has long resisted unionization. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said at the time that Amazon already offers what labor groups are requesting.

Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have flushed Wall Street with cash, pushing yield-seeking investors into equities, with technology-related stocks being viewed as the most reliable to ride out the crisis.

Amazon employees on strike gather outside the Amazon distribution center warehouse in Saran, near Orleans, France, March 18, 2020. Several hundred Amazon workers in France protested at one of its sites on Wednesday, calling on the online retailer to cease operations or make it easier for employees loath to work during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak to stay away. REUTERS\/Mourad Guichard  Retailers across France were ordered to shut over the past weekend as the country stepped up measures to try to control the disease, with only stores providing food and other basic goods or services allowed to operate.  Online deliveries are still allowed, however.  At an Amazon warehouse and shipping center at Saran just outside Orleans, a city south of Paris, some 250-300 workers staged a strike, gathering outside and calling for its closure. It normally employs some 1,800 full-time staff.  \u201cWe feel really unsafe and I\u2019ve got colleagues who are coming to work feeling fearful,\u201d said Richard Vives, from the CAT union, who was demonstrating with other worker representatives.  Unions have argued that Amazon delivers very few groceries and many other goods are not essential and should therefore consider closures.  Amazon said it was adhering to all sanitary guidelines, adding that it was prioritizing and making space in warehouses for key products such as household staples and hygiene or medical supplies as online demand soars globally.  It declined to comment on the situation at Saran and in other French centers.  Julien Vincent, who represents Amazon logistics workers for France\u2019s CFDT union, estimated that 30%-40% of Amazon employees in France had now dropped out of work for fear of contagion or because they had to keep children at home after French schools closed. The company had called on temporary workers to make up for any shortages, he added.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon had also offered to negotiate salary increases for those who stayed on, he said.  Several hundred people at Amazon have now sought to exercise a French right to stop work while still receiving full pay, unions said.  Protesters at the Saran site were also demonstrating for that right, an official at the CGT union there said, saying that Amazon had contested its usage.  UNEASE SPREADS  Defining what services are vital is proving problematic in France, with the unease among staff spreading to other online retailers like La Redoute, which is still operational and where workers are pushing back too, to mail employees or those in banks and naval construction.  Some companies like carmaker Renault or luxury handbag manufacturer Hermes have moved to close their factories to protect workers.  CGT representatives for staff at Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicro - a supplier to iPhone maker Apple and electric carmaker Tesla - wrote to company bosses on Wednesday asking for its French factories to be temporarily shut.  Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said employees in key sectors still had to go to work as long as sanitary measures were in place. He did not provided an exhaustive rundown of companies and sub-sectors.  Some businesses have also hit out saying the shutdown is lopsided. Among products it will now prioritize for delivery and storage, Amazon has included books - which some smaller sellers perceived as a blow.  \u201cPeople couldn\u2019t come (to my store) on Sunday to stock up. And so they all went on Amazon instead,\u201d said Marie-Rose Guarnieri, who had to close her bookshop in Paris\u2019 Montmartre district to comply with government orders.","1287":"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)  EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 30 (Reuters) - Standing before an audience of 14,000 people last year, Walmart Inc executives described a radical plan to help it fend off Amazon.com Inc and other online delivery services from stealing its customers.  Walmart\u2019s own store employees would bring online orders directly to shoppers\u2019 homes after completing their usual shifts of up to nine hours on the sales floors. Aiming to lower the retailer\u2019s shipping costs by tapping its massive workforce, the program was part of a multi-pronged strategy to boost its $11.5 billion U.S. ecommerce business and tackle one of the biggest challenges in retail: the so-called \u201clast mile\u201d of delivering goods to online customers.  Its workers, meanwhile, could earn extra money on top of their hourly pay, which starts at $11 an hour.  \u201cJust imagine associates all over the world delivering orders to customers on their way home,\u201d Marc Lore, head of Walmart\u2019s e-commerce operations, said at its annual meeting in June 2017. \u201cThat can be a real game-changer.\u201d  But months later, Walmart quietly retreated from its original vision for the pilot program - launched in New Jersey and Arkansas - and ended it altogether in January, according to company documents obtained by Reuters and interviews with more than two dozen Walmart employees.  The story behind the foundering employee delivery initiative, which has not been reported, offers insight into Walmart\u2019s ongoing attempts to find unconventional ways to close the gap with Amazon in the game of cheap, rapid, doorstep delivery of packages. According to Walmart data, people who shop in stores and become online customers spend nearly twice as much as those who shop at one or the other.  Here in New Jersey, Walmart started the program with the idea that store employees could courier all items that would fit in a car. But the initiative failed to gain traction with skeptical employees who had to use their time after work, according to sixteen workers who participated in the trial.  Walmart is now testing a more modest service with just four Walmart employees who deliver goods from a single store in Woodstock, Georgia, Reuters has learned. In this latest initiative, Walmart is also overhauling the guidelines for employees and limiting deliveries to groceries and related items such as paper plates.  Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman confirmed that the retailer ended its first experiment early this year, without elaborating. Walmart is testing a variety of ways to deliver merchandise, she said, and is \u201cencouraged by what we\u2019re seeing\u201d in the Georgia store.  Despite having 4,700 U.S. stores within 10 miles (16 km) of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Walmart is still trying to figure out how to efficiently make deliveries and has poured billions of dollars into ecommerce in recent years.  But as recently as the last holiday season, its online sales disappointed some investors.  Walmart caters to U.S. online shoppers by having them drive up to their local store themselves to collect merchandise they ordered online. It also partners with shippers such as FedEx Corp, the United States Postal Service (USPS) for routine deliveries.  Still, Walmart aims to be able to deliver groceries to more than 40 percent of households in the country by the end of this year. Globally, Walmart is experimenting with deliveries by motorbike in Mexico and with new small supermarkets in China to make deliveries in 30 minutes or less. In Japan, Walmart is opening a new warehouse to support orders, and expanding its online offerings to include meal kits.  Earlier this year, Reuters reported the retailer\u2019s delivery partnerships with Uber and Lyft ended after the ride-hailing services struggled to deliver people and packages together. It continues to rely on third-party companies such as Postmates, Deliv and Doordash to help deliver groceries, and last week partnered with Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo.  SKEPTICAL DRIVERS  Walmart\u2019s associate delivery pilot program in the leafy, middle-class suburb of East Brunswick, New Jersey, started with store managers pitching employees an unusual new way to boost pay. Those who passed background checks could moonlight as drivers for the Walmart.com delivery service, they said.  Some staffers, who did not wish to be named fearing retribution for speaking to the media, told Reuters they balked at having to use their own cars and personal insurance policies for a program that would benefit Walmart.  To entice them to sign up, Walmart offered free TVs and iPads as gifts, they said. Eventually, about 50 of the store\u2019s more than 150 associates initially signed up, they added, though many had no prior experience as couriers with a delivery service.  Walmart declined comment on this.  Fourteen of the sixteen Walmart employees told Reuters that they were put off by the program\u2019s poor compensation. And all of them expressed concern over who would be responsible if they got into an accident or if merchandise was lost.  For example, the East Brunswick Walmart paid store associates $2 per package, with participants making three to five total drop-offs during a typical trip within a ten mile radius, participants told Reuters. It also reimbursed them 54 cents for fuel per mile, over the federal fuel reimbursement rate of 53.5 cents in 2017, and offered them an extra hour of overtime pay.  But every employee Reuters spoke to who signed up said they typically lost at least 30 minutes of time, waiting at the store after their shifts ended to collect the items and were never compensated for it.  Walmart didn\u2019t offer more than one hour of overtime even if it took more than an hour to deliver orders after finishing their 40 hour work week, former participants said. Walmart disputed this saying it paid workers overtime when they exceeded 40 hours.  All sixteen workers who had participated in the program said delivery of five packages would generally take them more than two hours to complete. If a worker drove 10 miles to drop five packages, that would earn them $15.40 in compensation per package and fuel, before overtime pay.  Rival Amazon pays independent drivers $18 to $25 an hour for deliveries, and the fuel costs belong to the driver, according to the Amazon Flex website. Amazon declined to comment on the story.  One of the Walmart employees said in only one instance did she earn an additional $100 at the end of the week \u2013 after making nearly a dozen deliveries.  \u201cThe money was never worth it... and they stopped paying mileage in the end,\u201d said an employee who did not wish to be named.  Twelve out of sixteen employees said they were not paid mileage for the final deliveries they made before the program was shut. Walmart did not comment on mileage payments that employees said were not made.  As for insurance, risk and liability for accidents and lost packages, many of the employees Reuters spoke with said they were unclear if Walmart would shoulder the responsibility or not.  DOWN TO A TEAM OF FOUR  Now, an initiative known internally as \u2018Associate Delivery 2.0\u2019 is being run with four employees hired specifically as delivery drivers in Woodstock, Georgia, according to company documents and interviews.  To build demand, Walmart will waive the fee for the first delivery order if it is for $50 or more, according to a Walmart promotional pamphlet at the store. For subsequent orders, the retailer\u2019s mobile app offered delivery on a minimum $30 order for a fee of $7.99 to $9.95.  The team of three men and one woman, working separately, load up their cars to make deliveries to shoppers within ten miles.  Maurice Thomas, who is one of the four Walmart employees, illustrates the retailer\u2019s new tack. A hybrid between a delivery driver and a store employee, Thomas\u2019s role is newly created to revive the initiative, he and other store employees in Georgia said.  Thomas took a job at the Woodstock store three years ago unloading trucks. Now he uses his own car, fuel and personal insurance to deliver 6 to 7 packages to shopper\u2019s homes every day.  \u201cI have a fixed schedule and doing this is much better than unloading trucks,\u201d said Thomas, who is 28.  Walmart pays Thomas $12.50 an hour and reimburses 54.5 cents a mile, comparable to the 54.5 federal fuel reimbursement rate in 2018, he said. If Thomas drove 10 miles within an hour to make deliveries, he would earn $18.30.  Thomas said every two weeks he is usually left with about $130-$140 dollars after buying fuel.  Walmart informed employees in Georgia they would have to use their own car insurance policies when they were hired, Blakeman said. But the retailer will cover any expenses that their personal insurance policies won\u2019t cover, she added.  An internal document seen by Reuters provides Walmart delivery workers with a specific new protocol. Among the guidelines: \u201cdo not mix orders\u201d and \u201cmake sure you have your \u2018thank you\u2019 cards ready\u201d to leave inside their deliveries.  \u201cWe\u2019re testing and learning how best to use associates,\u201d said Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason for pilots.\u201d","1288":"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday that it removed public databases containing its user data on Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud servers after cybersecurity firm UpGuard discovered millions of exposed records.

Bezos, whom Forbes lists at the world\u2019s richest person with an estimated $136.2 billion, said via Twitter on Wednesday that he and his wife of 25 years, Mackenzie, will divorce. Amazon shares were flat in midday trading on Thursday after spending most of the morning down slightly.  The split throws into question how the couple will split their fortune, which includes an approximately 16 percent ownership stake in Amazon\u2019s roughly $811.4 billion market capitalization. Divorce laws in Washington state, where they live, hold that property acquired during a marriage is generally divided equally between spouses.  Most analysts and fund managers are largely sanguine and say the divorce will not lead to any significant change in the company\u2019s leadership or its growth prospects.  Prominent short-seller Doug Kass, however, who runs hedge fund Seabreeze Partners, said he sold his stake in Amazon on news of the divorce. That was after initially buying a stake in late December and naming Amazon among his \u201cbest ideas list.\u201d  \u201cIs it premature to ask what happens to Amazon when Jeff Bezos chooses to turn over the day-to-day running of the company he founded?\u201d he said. \u201cHis announced divorce gives me pause for thought.\u201d  Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager of the Monetta fund, said that while he is not changing his investment in Amazon, he expects other growth-focused portfolio managers may trim their stakes due to concerns about the divorce\u2019s impact.  \u201cThis is such an over-owned company and this gives them an excuse to say \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll trim some back because it adds a new question mark\u2019,\u201d he said.  Bacarella, however, said he is not concerned because even if MacKenzie Bezos liquidated her expected 8 percent stake, there would be no fundamental reason behind the sale. Any impact would be short-term in nature.  \u201cUnless you worry that he will get so distracted by the divorce that he cannot manage the company, this will be a non-event,\u201d said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \u201cHe is given control of the company because shareholders like him and his vision, not because he has 50 percent of the stock.\u201d  Thomas Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said questions about the future of the company due to the divorce are legitimate due to Jeff Bezos\u2019 outsized influence on its value. Should he leave the company for any reason, its shares would likely immediately fall more than 10 percent, he said.  \u201cHis influence on the company is as a significant as if he had super-voting shares because of his track record and the way he runs the company as if he owned the whole thing,\u201d he said.

As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to \u201cquickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.\u201d  Amazon defined five categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including Baby Product, Health & Household, Beauty & Personal Care, Grocery, Industrial & Scientific, Pet Supplies.  The move follows Amazon\u2019s announcement it will hire 100,000 workers for its warehouses on Monday, as the Seattle-based giant is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.  Third-party sellers account for over half of the sales on Amazon. Amazon has been courting sellers to use its own fulfillment system, enabling many of them with faster delivery without the risks of sitting on inventories.  It is especially popular for sellers who use a dropping shipping method, meaning sellers import products from manufacturers in countries including China and directly send them to an Amazon warehouse. Amazon earns fees from managing the storage and delivery process.  Sellers supplying products that are deemed non-essential could see their products run out of stock and they will be unable to restock as a result of the measure. Still, they can use other fulfillment methods to directly mail products to customers.  Amazon did not immediately replied to request for comment.","1292":"WASHINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday granted Amazon.com Inc\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction to pause the U.S. Department of Defense and Microsoft Corp from moving forward on an up-to-$10 billion cloud computing deal.

The letters seek by Oct. 14 internal emails over the last decade from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions.  Apple shares fell about 1.8% after the market opened. While Apple had been mentioned as a potential target, the House letter offered the first concrete evidence of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation.  Apple has faced criticism that its App Store\u2019s policies and algorithms support its own products and stifle third-party applications.  On Monday, the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories in a probe of whether Google abuses its market power in advertising.  \u201cThere is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,\u201d said House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who signed the letters along with Ranking Republican Representative Doug Collins and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee and ranking Republican Jim Sensenbrenner.  \u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,\u201d Collins said in a statement.  The lawmakers seek emails from senior executives on topics including acquisitions like Amazon\u2019s purchase of AbeBooks, PillPack, Eero, Ring, Zappos and Whole Foods; and Google\u2019s acquisition of AdMob, YouTube, Android and DoubleClick.  They also seek information on various policies including Google\u2019s decision to automatically sign into Chrome any user to logs into any Google service.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google referred to a blog post this week that said its services \u201ccreate choice for consumers.\u201d  The committee requested information from the companies\u2019 executives on market share, competitors, their largest customers for specific products and documents from other investigations.  It asked Apple for information on App Store concerns such as the decision to remove some parental control apps and its policy regarding whether iPhone users can set non-Apple apps as defaults.  The committee seeks communications on Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram, WhatsApp and Onavo and its decisions to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and to cut off apps from its social graph.  The U.S. Justice Department said in July it is investigating \u201cwhether and how\u201d large tech companies in \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d are engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Google said it received a formal request for documents from the Justice Department in late August.","1296":"FILE PHOTO: Frederic Duval, director of Amazon France, poses a press visit at the Amazon fulfilment center in Bretigny-sur-Orge near Paris, France, October 22, 2019.

Shares fell 7%, as revenue growth for the company\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business also slowed down in the third quarter, missing analysts\u2019 estimates. Amazon beat expectations on overall third-quarter revenue, posting a sales rise of 24% to $70 billion.  The news underscores the big investment Amazon is making to cut delivery times to one day for its Prime loyalty members, a way to outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart Inc that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees.  Costs for that program will nearly double to $1.5 billion during the holiday season, from what Amazon spent on one-day delivery during the second quarter, the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts.  Expenses rose because the company has to move inventory closer to customers and beef up its last-mile transportation footprint to make the plan work, Olsavsky said. The company also is giving up the fees that shoppers used to pay for one-day shipping and is still learning what the long-term cost structure of the program will be, he said.  Amazon\u2019s rising headcount reflects its delivery ambitions. It hired nearly 100,000 full and part-time workers in the third quarter, bringing its staff size to over 400,000 in the United States and 750,000 globally.  \u201cBy and away the biggest driver this time is the people that we\u2019re adding for fulfillment and transportation roles,\u201d Olsavsky said.  Still, Amazon is betting that fast shipping will spark sales growth, a strategy that over years has helped it become the world\u2019s largest online retailer.  \u201cAmazon will not necessarily be spooked by the increase in costs,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail. \u201cIndeed, it sees the higher shipping expense as an investment in the Prime platform and as a way to retain the loyalty of its shoppers.\u201d  Amazon said earlier this year that it now delivers some 10% of its 100 million-plus Prime-eligible goods in one day in the United States. The Seattle-based company did not provide an updated number on Thursday.  DARKENING CLOUD?  Weak holiday quarter guidance has added to worries that the U.S.-China trade spat may be hurting the U.S. retail industry, and that one-day shipping might not be as big a boost as Amazon anticipates.  There was \u201chope that this investment would lead to a further revenue acceleration in the holiday quarter, whereas the company has guided to the opposite,\u201d said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.  Holiday sales typically generate a large share of retailers\u2019 revenue and profit. Amazon\u2019s forecast of $80.0 billion to $86.5 billion in sales came short of $87.4 billion that analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company also said it expects holiday-quarter operating income to be between $1.2 billion and $2.9 billion, while analysts were expecting $4.19 billion, according to research firm FactSet.  Olsavsky attributed some of the weakness to the timing of events outside the United States, which pushed revenue into the third quarter. For instance, the company saw customers in Japan pre-order goods before a rise in consumption tax went into effect on Oct. 1, he said.  Olsavsky declined to comment to reporters on regulatory scrutiny the company is facing over alleged foul play with merchants on its platform, saying later that the company only succeeds if its sellers succeed. Sales such as fulfillment services for merchants, as well as ad and other sales to merchants, beat analysts\u2019 estimates in the third quarter.  Olsavsky also downplayed concerns about a slowdown in growth for one of the company\u2019s profit centers, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The unit, which handles data storage and computing operations for other enterprises, increased revenue 35% to $9.0 billion, the second quarter in a row in which its rate of growth was under 40%.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are having great success, and we\u2019re adding a lot (to) the sales force.\u201d  Not all analysts saw a risk-free future, particularly as the unit\u2019s operating expenses jumped 46% to $6.7 billion in the third quarter. Operating income was $2.3 billion.  \u201cThe \u2018problem\u2019 is spending,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. There is \u201ca lot of investment in AWS infrastructure... The company makes these investments without really explaining them in detail, and investors are left on their own trying to figure out when Amazon will start delivering outsized profits again.\u201d","1298":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen on the door of an Amazon Books retail store in New York City, U.S., February 14, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Amazon.com\u2019s bid to avoid a lawsuit seeking to ensure that warehouse workers for the e-commerce giant get paid for the time it takes them to go through extensive post-shift security screenings.  The justices, on the first day of their new term, turned away an appeal by Amazon and a contractor of a lower court ruling reviving the workers\u2019 claims under Nevada state law. The decision comes five years after the Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case that barred similar claims under federal law.  A group of Amazon warehouse workers who package and ship merchandise filed a proposed class action lawsuit in 2010 against the contractor, Integrity Staffing Solutions, which provides some of the hourly employees for Amazon.  The workers sought compensation for submitting to what they called mandatory \u201cpost-9\/11 type of airport security\u201d screenings that are aimed at preventing employee theft. The workers have said the screening takes around 25 minutes to complete.  Amazon called the plaintiffs\u2019 description of the protocol \u201cgrossly inaccurate\u201d in court papers.  In its 2014 ruling in the case, the Supreme Court decided that under a 1947 law that amended the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks.  The workers subsequently pressed their allegations under state law and added Amazon as a defendant. The case was consolidated with similar ones in federal court in Kentucky.  A judge there dismissed the case, citing the 2014 Supreme Court ruling, since Nevada wage laws track their federal counterparts. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 overturned that decision.","1299":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Seattle\u2019s city council race was a toss-up between a pro-business and a progressive council on Tuesday night, despite record election campaign donations from big donors, including tech giant Amazon.com.  Amazon donated $1.5 million to a \u201cSuper PAC\u201d run by the local chamber of commerce, which endorsed candidates for the seven seats up for election in the nine-seat city council. Four years ago Amazon donated $25,000 to the political action committee.  Marilyn Strickland, president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, said late on Tuesday, \u201cTonight\u2019s initial returns are not definitive enough to call these close races.\u201d  More ballots will be counted in the coming days, although a winner might be clear after the next count on Wednesday afternoon.  The bellwether race is between incumbent socialist Kshama Sawant who faces challenger Egan Orion, a small business advocate who directs an LGBT pride festival.  Sawant trailed on Tuesday night with 28 percent of ballots counted and did not hit the minimum percentage in the first results that her campaign thought she needs to win.  \u201cWe faced an onslaught of corporate cash,\u201d Sawant said at an election night party. \u201cIf anything we underestimated the brazenness of (Amazon CEO Jeff) Bezos, corporate real estate, and big business.\u201d  Sawant\u2019s campaign raised over $508,000 through individual donations that averaged $70.  The Seattle metropolitan area\u2019s growing problem with homelessness - King County has the third-largest homeless population after New York city and Los Angeles County - has been a key point of friction between Amazon and the city.  Amazon spokesman Aaron Toso said in a statement earlier, \u201cWe are contributing to this election because we care deeply about the future of Seattle.\u201d  \u201cWe believe it is critical that our hometown has a city council that is focused on pragmatic solutions to our shared challenges in transportation, homelessness, climate change and public safety,\u201d the statement said.  In May 2018, the council approved a per-employee \u201chead tax\u201d on the city\u2019s biggest companies to pay for homeless services and affordable housing - only to scale it back a month later when Amazon said it might freeze expansion planning for Seattle.  In response to Amazon\u2019s $1.5 million donation, Council member Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez proposed a bill in October that would prohibit \u201cforeign-influenced corporations\u201d from making political contributions in Seattle elections. The bill defines that as a company which has one percent or more of its shares held by foreigners or foreign entities.  A spokesman for Amazon.com declined to comment whether or not the company would constitute a foreign-influenced corporation under the proposed law.","1300":"Amazon.com Inc on Thursday was accused of firing a disproportionate number of black and Latino delivery drivers in Massachusetts after conducting criminal background checks on them.

India has been under a strict lockdown since March 25 to battle the virus, leaving about 9,500 theatres shut and depriving Bollywood of box-office revenue.  So producers of seven films, including two Bollywood movies starring A-listers, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Vidya Balan, will stream the movies directly on Amazon Prime Video following a deal, the company said in a statement on Friday.  \u201cGulabo Sitabo\u201d, a family comedy with Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana, which was set for release in April, will now stream directly on Amazon Prime Video in June, as will \u201cShakuntala Devi\u201d, a biopic of the Indian mathematician of the same name.  Two of India\u2019s biggest cinema chains, Inox and PVR, who were meant to screen \u201cGulabo Sitabo\u201d, bemoaned the decision.  \u201cINOX will be constrained to examine its options, and reserves all rights, including taking retributive measures, in dealing with such fair-weather friends,\u201d Inox said in a statement.  The producers\u2019 guild said the comments from Inox were \u201cabrasive and unconstructive\u201d.  FILE PHOTO: A cinema goer watches a Bollywood movie inside Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai December 11, 2014. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/File Photo  PVR chief executive Kamal Gianchandani told the Indian Express on Thursday, after Amazon announced it would stream \u201cGulabo Sitabo\u201d, that he was disappointed by the news.  The other five films in the Amazon deal are productions from the prolific, southern-language film industry.  Streaming platforms like Amazon and Netflix have in the past signed deals with Indian studios for digital rights, but mainstream releases have always prioritised theatrical revenues first.  In China, regulators aim to protect the industry by enforcing rules to stop movies premiering online, in particular by strictly managing \u201ctheatrical window period\u201d requirements, a period for movies to be screened in cinemas before they can be shown elsewhere.  But analysts say the Amazon deal in India is likely the beginning of a broader trend, as lingering fears of coronavirus infection and lower discretionary spending keep people away from multiplexes and single-screen cinemas.  \u201cThere will be a reset in the way that producers and studios think about their portfolios,\u201d Vijay Subramaniam, director and head, Content, Amazon Prime Video, India, told Reuters in an interview.  Subramaniam said Amazon, which competes in India with Netflix and Disney\u2019s Hotstar, did not see acquisition costs going up for the streaming platform.  Bollywood is a huge draw for India\u2019s burgeoning online audiences, who - driven by cheap data and smartphones - are spending more time watching content online than ever before.  Media reported that more producers in Bollywood and the southern-language industry were in talks with streaming platforms for direct-to-digital releases.  Last month, theatre owners in the southern state of Tamil Nadu threatened to boycott well-known actor Suriya over his decision to stream his film on a digital platform.  That film, \u201cPonmagal Vandhal\u201d is part of the seven-film slate that Amazon announced on Friday.","1302":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at their new warehouse during its opening announcement on the outskirts of Mexico City, Mexico July 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Wednesday it is developing a longer-range equivalent to Bluetooth and WiFi wireless protocols that the largest U.S. online retailer hopes third parties will eventually use in smart devices.  The Amazon Sidewalk, announced alongside a new range of Echo speakers and a multilingual mode for its Alexa virtual assistant, underscores the firm\u2019s growth expectations for the internet of things (IoT) - where devices and appliances are controlled over networks.  The company sees Sidewalk\u2019s use in devices as varied as garden water sensors and mailboxes that would alert the owner to new mail.  Sidewalk uses the low bandwidth 900 megahertz spectrum to extend the distance at which IoT devices can be controlled, and requires less power than needed for WiFi, Amazon said.  \u201cPeople don\u2019t even realize yet how important that intermediate range is going to be, for things like lights in your yard, controlling your lights on your sidewalk in the street,\u201d Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said about Sidewalk\u2019s range at Amazon\u2019s annual Alexa devices launch in Seattle.  Amazon, which started out selling books, has a history of exploring new ventures, such as making original TV shows for subscribers to its Amazon Prime service. It has emerged as one of the Big Four technology companies along with Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc, and is a leading cloud services provider.  It plans to publish the new network protocol - rules that govern communication between connected devices - so developers can use it for new products.  Amazon said it has tested Sidewalk to connect devices across Los Angeles. It did not say when it would be available for wider use.  The company said it would release a dog tracker in 2020 as a reference design for developers that will use the network to alert a pet-owner when their dog leaves a certain perimeter.","1303":"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it would offer free shipping with no purchase minimum for the first time this holiday season, heating up the competition with Walmart Inc and other rivals vying for customers\u2019 Christmas shopping sprees.  The U.S.-only promotion, effective from Nov. 5, waives the $25 minimum that customers outside Amazon\u2019s loyalty club Prime must hit for free shipping. The deal lasts until Amazon can no longer promise items in time for Christmas with free delivery, which typically takes five to eight business days.  The announcement could help Amazon sustain its rapid sales growth. Shares of the world\u2019s largest online retailer were hammered last month after it forecast the slowest rise in revenue at least since the start of 2016. The current quarter typically is Amazon\u2019s biggest.  Amazon cut its order minimum for free shipping to $25 from $35 indefinitely in May 2017.  Monday\u2019s news will pile pressure on Walmart and Target Corp , which in recent years have chipped away at Amazon\u2019s lead with their own offers of free two-day shipping. While Walmart has maintained its $35 order threshold this holiday, Target has scrapped its minimum until Dec. 22.  Just over half of all U.S. households have a Prime subscription, analysts estimate. Prime remains the cornerstone of Amazon\u2019s business because shoppers buy more from the retailer once they pay $119 for the year-long membership. Perks include same-day shipping and video streaming.  Amazon is now courting those outside the club, hoping its brand and wider selection will set it apart. Free shipping can apply to hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, versus hundreds of thousands on Target. Target promises to deliver the items faster, however.  It was unclear how free delivery on small-ticket items would impact net income for Amazon, which last month touted improvements in efficiency.  According to the Seattle company\u2019s latest annual filing, shipping costs nearly doubled from 2015 to 2017, reaching $21.7 billion.

REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol  The announcement follows the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s approval of the plan, called \u201cProject Kuiper\u201d, for the constellation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites that will compete with the Starlink network being built out by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX. It also comes on the heels of Amazon posting its biggest profit in its 26-year history. [nL3N2F15PH]  \u201cA project of this scale requires significant effort and resources, and, due to the nature of LEO constellations, it is not the kind of initiative that can start small. You have to commit,\u201d the company said in a blog post.  The project will also benefit wireless carriers deploying 5G and other wireless service to new regions, Amazon said.  By comparison, SpaceX has launched over 500 satellites of the roughly 12,000 expected for its Starlink constellation in low Earth orbit and plans to offer broadband service in the United States and Canada by the year\u2019s end. The FCC approved SpaceX\u2019s request in 2018.  SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell, who in February floated the idea of spinning Starlink off for an IPO in the coming years, has said the Starlink constellation will cost the company roughly $10 billion.  While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide high-speed internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fiber optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology could also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupts communication.  The FCC authorization, adopted with a 5-0 vote, requires Amazon to launch half of its satellites no later than mid-2026 and build out the rest of the constellation by mid-2029.  Amazon said it would begin to offer broadband service once 578 satellites are launched.  It had 110 open positions for its \u201cProject Kuiper\u201d posted on its website Thursday.

Still, Amazon doesn\u2019t appear to be left out of the White House since Trump took office; an official from its Washington, D.C. office participated in an event hosted last week by First Lady Melania Trump to discuss cyber safety and technology.  Disclosures from Amazon indicate they have lobbied the White House on several topics, including immigration, cyber security and drones.  Keeping a cadre of lobbyists has become routine for large companies that risk having their entire business upset by possible congressional or regulatory action.  Amazon employs about 15 lobbyists, according to disclosures submitted to the U.S. Senate. Additionally, the company works with about 15 outside lobbying firms who each assign more lobbyists to work on behalf of the company.  Amazon has wide exposure to various parts of the government capable of regulating their business operations - from federal aviation rules affecting drones to oversight of anti-trust.  The largest online retailer, Amazon is also working aggressively to obtain government contracts to provide services to federal agencies to save data online for them, known as cloud services. Currently, Amazon has a $600 million contract to host data for the Central Intelligence Agency.  The e-commerce giant spent $15.4 million in 2017, up from $12 million a year earlier, on lobbying in Washington.  The company\u2019s lobbying effort more than doubled in 2015 compared with prior years, spending $10.5 million.  Amazon also maintains a corporate political action committee (PAC), a fund that allows the company to collect political donations from employees and then give donations to lawmakers and other politicians running for office.  By the end of February, Amazon\u2019s PAC had $1.1 million in cash. The committee spent more than $718,000 in 2017 and the first two months of 2018.

Costco, which sells everything from personal computers to groceries, has been adding more organic and fresh food products as it takes on Walmart's WMT.N Sam's Club, which after shutting some stores last year has amped up competition.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a little bit more margin pressure as there\u2019s been a little bit more retail competitive pressure out there, not only from supermarkets but Sam\u2019s as well,\u201d Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said, referring to its grocery business.  Costco also raised hourly minimum wages for about 130,000 store employees by $1 to between $14 and $14.50 in June, as it becomes harder to find workers in a tight job market.  The wage increase in part drove overall, selling, general and administrative expenses up 11 percent.  Still, total revenue rose 10.2 percent to $35.07 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $34.80, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Sales at established stores, excluding the impact of fuel and currency changes, rose 7.5 percent, well above estimates of 5.8 percent.  \u201cCostco\u2019s Q1 results reflect the company\u2019s prudent strategy of short-term investments for long-term benefit,\u201d said Moody\u2019s retail analyst Charlie O\u2019Shea.

FILE PHOTO: A video sign displays the logo for Roku Inc, a Fox-backed video streaming firm, in Times Square after the company's IPO at the Nasdaq Market in New York, U.S., September 28, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Chinese manufacturer Hisense will market televisions with Roku TV in the United Kingdom from the fourth quarter, with other European markets to follow, Roku\u2019s founder and chief executive Anthony Wood told Reuters in an interview.  Roku started out offering players for services like Netflix, branching into licensing its operating system to makers of internet-enabled TVs who have found it harder to keep their software fresh and make money in a cut-throat market.  The company floated in 2017 and its shares have since risen more than tenfold as it grew to reach 30.5 million U.S. households; struck licensing deals with nearly a dozen TV makers and served as an aggregator for more than 7,000 channels.  \u201cWe\u2019re the leader by a wide margin in the U.S., and we\u2019re just starting to get serious about international markets,\u201d Wood said on the sidelines of the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin.  The Hisense deal in the UK \u201cis a stepping stone to the rest of Europe\u201d, he added.  TALKING TV  In Europe, Roku faces the might of Amazon, which unveiled a string of deals a IFA to bring its Fire TV platform to living rooms, partnering with Grundig, JVC and Toshiba.  One of the Grundig models will run on Alexa, Amazon\u2019s digital voice assistant, making it possible to dispense with a remote control and instead select programming by \u2018talking\u2019 to the TV.  Some high-end TV makers, like Samsung, still run their own operating systems but for mid-range flatscreens a platform contest between Roku and Amazon is emerging that echoes the David-and-Goliath battle in music streaming between Spotify and Apple.  Tech and media analyst Paolo Pescatore said there was no guarantee that Roku\u2019s platform would prosper on the international stage, because there are other ways to stream TV in an increasingly mobile world.  \u201cRoku is at a crossroads,\u201d said Pescatore. \u201cIf you want to watch YouTube or Netflix, you just need a device.\u201d  CHANNELING CONTENT  Thanks to its control of the user interface, Roku TV has struck aggregation deals with a roll call of content providers - including new arrivals Apple+ and Disney+.  It is also making more money from digital advertising as marketers shift budgets from commercial TV to streaming, reflecting the cord-cutting trend among viewers.  Revenues grew by 59% in the second quarter to $250 million at Roku, which roughly broke even at the bottom line. The company forecasts revenues of just over $1 billion this year.  With Roku now aggregating more than 7,000 channels, it is promoting its own Roku Channel that offers a recommendation engine to help viewers filter the vast amount of programming on offer to find what they want to watch.  \u201cOur goal is to be the leading streaming platform for households,\u201d said Wood, seeing a future in which there will be a few mega-streaming apps, like Disney, and much other content will be syndicated into the platforms directly.","1314":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is expected to file a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Tuesday in what could be just the first in a series of legal salvos against high-profile tech companies.

It has been known for more than a year that Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc also face an array of antitrust probes on both the federal and state levels.  While Democrats may be viewed as tougher on antitrust regulation, traditional Republican concerns about regulatory overreach appear to be outweighed by anger on the political right over claims that Big Tech tries to stifle conservative voices.  The following are other inquiries now under way.  Justice Department on Apple: This probe, revealed in June 2019, appears to focus on Apple\u2019s app store. Some app developers have accused Apple of introducing new products very similar to pre-existing apps created by other developers and sold in the Apple Store, and then trying to banish the earlier apps from the store because they compete with Apple\u2019s new product. Apple says it seeks to have only the highest-quality apps in the app store.  Justice Department on Facebook and Amazon: In July 2019, the Justice Department said it was expanding its Big Tech probes to include \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d - an apparent reference to Facebook and Amazon.  Federal Trade Commission on Facebook: FTC officials probing Facebook have asked about past acquisitions, such as those of Instagram and WhatsApp, and how Facebook treats app developers on its platform. The FTC told Facebook in June 2019 it was probing whether the company has engaged in unlawful monopolistic practices.  Federal Trade Commission on Amazon: In its investigation of Amazon, the FTC is likely looking at the inherent conflict of interest of Amazon competing with small sellers on its marketplace platform, including allegations that it used information from sellers on its platform to decide what products it would introduce.  State attorneys general probe Google: A group of state attorneys general led by Texas is expected to file a lawsuit focused on digital advertising, perhaps as early as November. Meanwhile, a group led by Colorado is contemplating a more expansive lawsuit against Google that may also include concerns about its Android business.  State attorneys general probe Facebook: New York Attorney General Letitia James, who leads the state attorneys general probing Facebook, has said the investigation would examine whether the company\u2019s actions endangered consumer data, reduced consumer choice or increased the price of advertising.","1315":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O said on Friday it had ordered 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz for its European delivery fleet, as part of the online retailer's plans to run a carbon neutral business by 2040.

The company is advertising dozens of jobs in Cape Town, which played a key role in the early development of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing business.  The adverts include one for a software development engineer that says Amazon is assembling a team for a \u201cgreen-field project\u201d dealing with machine learning, big data analysis and cloud computing, which are among the fastest-growing areas in the technology industry.  The company\u2019s expansion shows how fierce competition in the cloud business and rising demand for computing power are driving activity even in relatively undeveloped corners of the technology universe.  AWS is the global leader in cloud computing with 32 percent of the market, versus 16 percent for second-placed Microsoft in the first quarter of 2018, according to research firm Canalys. Microsoft has been growing faster.  The global cloud infrastructure services market was worth nearly $55 billion in 2017 and is expected to exceed $155 billion by 2020, Canalys said. AWS accounted for 73 percent of Amazon\u2019s $1.9 billion operating profit in the first quarter, but just 11 percent of its revenue.  Amazon\u2019s new Cape Town building is due for completion in August, according to a source familiar with the matter. It sits near an existing Amazon technical center and customer support operation.  Amazon did not offer details about the new building in Cape Town, or what its function might be.  \u201cAs more South African customers and partners continue to choose AWS as their cloud provider we continue to hire more staff into our offices in Cape Town and Johannesburg,\u201d Geoff Brown, AWS\u2019 Sub-Saharan Africa regional manager, told Reuters in a statement.  In another sign of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing drive in South Africa, it is offering start-ups free cloud trials for one year, according to local entrepreneur Tumi Menyatswe - a deal that prompted her to switch to AWS from Google\u2019s cloud.  \u201cThis allows me to focus on my business and to grow until I can pay them,\u201d said Menyatswe, CEO of two-year-old business Minderz, which pairs pet owners with people able to look after cats and dogs during holidays.  EDGE IN AFRICA  It is difficult to measure the relative success of the big cloud-computing players in Africa, as they do not break out financial results for the continent. However, according to analysts, data centers are one measure of growth.  Despite its history on the continent, Amazon has yet to build a data center in Africa. Microsoft, by contrast, announced last year that it was building two data centers in South Africa, one in Cape Town and one in Johannesburg, both due to launch later this year.  Microsoft said in a statement that the plans were on track but would not specify when the data centers would be launched in 2018.  Local data centers offer advantages, in part by reducing \u201clatency\u201d, or delays, in data transmission. \u201cCloser is almost always better,\u201d said Carl Brooks, an analyst at 451 Research.  Clifford De Wit, former chief innovation officer at Microsoft South Africa, said a local data center was a big advantage.  \u201cHaving the actual data center close has so many implications,\u201d said De Wit, now chief technology officer at start-up Dexterity Digital. He cited privacy regulations that require banks and some other companies to store data locally, among other benefits.  Amazon\u2019s Brown told Reuters that South Africa was \u201cone of the many possibilities that we are currently looking at\u201d globally for opening a new data center.  He said the company launched new \u201cEdge\u201d locations -infrastructure that boosts transmission speeds from primary data centers outside the continent - in Johannesburg and Cape Town in the past two months. This will reduce latency for South African customers and bring other benefits, he said.  Famous for its Table Mountain and sandy beaches, Cape Town is emerging as a continental tech hub, with some 35,000 people employed in the sector, according to Wesgro, a trade and investment agency. The city boasts one of the largest publicly available fiber optic networks in Africa, local economic development officials say.  Amazon has played a key role in the city\u2019s internet industry from the start. Two South Africans, Chris Pinkham and Willem van Biljon, led a small Cape Town-based team that developed the key technical underpinnings of AWS, a software architecture known as EC2, and helped build the business plan for the service.  \u201cWe knew it was going to have a large impact,\u201d Van Biljon, who left Amazon more than a decade ago and still lives in Cape Town, told Reuters. \u201cThe rate at which the growth occurred outstripped even our best expectations.\u201d","1329":"LOS ENCUENTROS, Ecuador (Reuters) - Canadian miner Lundin Gold Inc LUG.TO inaugurated its Fruta del Norte gold mine in the Ecuadorean Amazon on Thursday, as market-friendly President Lenin Moreno seeks to attract mining investment to diversify the stagnant oil-dependent economy.  The mine, whose proven reserves include some 4.8 million ounces of gold and 6.3 million ounces of silver, is expected to produce some 310,000 ounces of gold and 400,000 ounces of silver during its 15-year life span. It is expected to involve some $2.7 billion in investment, Ecuadorean government data show.  The Andean country, which borders the world\u2019s No. 2 copper producer Peru but is just starting to develop its own vast mineral resources, in July inaugurated its first large-scale copper mine, the Mirador project owned by Chinese consortium CRCC-Tongguan.  Moreno, seeking to spur growth and close the OPEC member\u2019s fiscal deficit, has eliminated a windfall tax on miners to try to court investment from the sector.  His push has faced obstacles from communities concerned about mining\u2019s environmental impact and from wildcat miners reluctant to cede informal operations to formal concessions.  Ecuador also experienced its worst political violence in decades last month as widespread protests against Moreno\u2019s austerity measures paralyzed the capital Quito. Mirador temporarily limited operations to protect its workers.  Lundin Gold is expected to pay some $1 billion in taxes during the mine\u2019s 15-year lifespan, company president Ron Hochstein said at the mine\u2019s inauguration.","1330":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A U.S. lobby group which represents firms including Amazon.com and Walmart has urged India not to tighten foreign investment rules for e-commerce companies again, according to a letter seen by Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: A shipment moves on a conveyor belt at an Amazon Fulfillment Centre (BLR7) on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India, September 18, 2018. REUTERS\/ Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  India is considering revising the rules after traders in the country accused Amazon\u2019s Indian division and Walmart\u2019s Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass investment regulations, Reuters reported this month.  The U.S. companies deny any wrongdoing.  India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers but local traders say the U.S. giants promote select sellers and offer deep discounts, which hurts business for smaller local retailers.  In 2018, India changed its foreign direct investment (FDI) rules to deter foreign firms offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.  The government is now considering tightening those rules again to include sellers in which a foreign e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake through its parent, Reuters reported.  Such a change could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India, Cloudtail and Appario.  Citing the Reuters story in a Jan. 28 letter, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged the Indian government not to make any more material restrictive changes to e-commerce investment rules.  \u201cAny further changes in FDI rules would limit e-commerce firms from leveraging their scale,\u201d USIBC said in the letter seen by Reuters.  USIBC also asked India\u2019s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) to engage in substantive consultation with companies on e-commerce regulation.  USIBC and DPIIT did not respond to a request for comment.  After the Reuters story was published last week, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represents millions of brick-and-mortar retailers, said it has received assurances from India\u2019s commerce minister that policy changes were in the offing.  On Saturday, CAIT in a statement said the USIBC letter was an \u201cuncalled for intervention\u201d which runs against the interest of 85 million traders. \u201cSuch a hue and cry is not understandable,\u201d CAIT said, adding that it had also written a letter in protest to the USIBC President.  The government is also considering prohibiting online sales by a seller who, for example, purchases goods from an e-commerce entity\u2019s wholesale unit, or any of its group firms, and then sells them on the entity\u2019s websites, Reuters has reported.  The 2018 rule changes soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy changes favoured local e-commerce retailers over U.S. companies.  Industry sources told Reuters on Friday that the prospects of such frequent policy changes in India have alarmed Amazon, which has committed $6.5 billion in investments in India, and Walmart, which invested $16 billion in Flipkart in 2018.  The USIBC letter said \u201cinvestments require reasonable policy predictability and fair treatment\u201d.  \u201cUSIBC is concerned that material changes to the FDI policy creates uncertainty and impacts investor confidence, as well as business continuity of existing investments,\u201d it said.  Amazon declined to comment on the USIBC letter. Walmart and Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment.","1331":"May 21 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is scheduling its annual Prime Day shopping promotion for September and allowing unlimited shipments of non-essential goods to warehouses, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  Amazon in August agreed to acquire a 49% stake in a unit of India\u2019s Future Group which owns 7.3% of Future Retail, giving the U.S.-based company a 3.58% stake in the retailer which operates more than 1,500 stores in the country.  The deal would help Amazon tap into the booming retail market in India, as it separately boosts its e-commerce operations, offering everything from electronics to groceries on its Indian website. Future Retail runs 290 budget department and grocery stores branded \u201cBig Bazaar\u201d.  In a notice to Amazon last month, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said \u201cin certain overlapping segments and areas of operation of the parties, the combined market share exceeds the threshold specified in the combination regulations\u201d, one of the sources told Reuters.  The CCI also queried the procedure Amazon adopted to seek approval. Amazon had notified the CCI through a so-called Form I, instead of a Form II that is more onerous and is required when parties assess the combined entity will exceed a pre-defined market share threshold.  The CCI sought justification from Amazon on why it chose to file a Form I, the source added, which could potentially delay approval of the deal. A Form I filing typically takes 2-3 months compared with three to six months for a Form II.  Amazon and Future Retail declined to comment for the story. A source at Future group said it had recently answered the CCI\u2019s questions related to the deal, but did not elaborate.  The CCI did not respond to Reuters queries.  Additionally, the competition watchdog has asked Amazon more than 40 questions related to the deal and its businesses, the first source with knowledge of the matter said.  A second source confirmed to Reuters that the CCI had sent additional queries to Amazon, calling it part of the regular deal approval process by the watchdog.  \u201cThere are questions about e-commerce ... the CCI needs to assess whether there is any adverse impact on competition or not,\u201d the source said.  Amazon\u2019s notification available on the CCI\u2019s website says the company believes the deal is \u201cnot likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition\u201d in India.  \u201cSuch queries mean the deal is being closely scrutinized and could face potential delays, but it can eventually sail through if no antitrust concerns are found,\u201d said Karan Singh Chandhiok, an antitrust partner at Indian law firm Chandhiok & Mahajan who is not involved in the proposed stake purchase.  Typically in such cases, the company needs to defend its decision and, if the watchdog disagrees, has no choice but to give more details in a Form II filing, Chandhiok added.","1333":"PARIS, April 21 (Reuters) - A verdict in a case involving U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon will be issued by the Court of Appeal in Versailles on April 24, a French judge said on Tuesday.

Larrilou Carumba, a cleaner who works in hotels, takes a selfie with her family as they shelter in a place in San Francisco, California, U.S., that is currently in lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the city March 17, 2020. Larrilou Carumba\/Handout via REUTERS  Since then, Ismahan Ali and other janitors who clean the tech giant\u2019s offices say they have been getting paid to work overtime to wipe down stairwells, conference rooms and other high-traffic areas.  Ali, 29, doesn\u2019t clean the building where the infected Amazon employee worked, but she shares a break room with some janitors who do. So every cough or sneeze is a reminder that coronavirus could be lingering on a surface they\u2019ve cleaned, or that one may already have been exposed, she said.  \u201cEveryone is scared,\u201d said Ali, who works for ABM, a maintenance and cleaning firm that employs more than 140,000 people. \u201cWe just keep going, let\u2019s do what we can.\u201d  For the three million janitors, housekeepers and maids across America, remote working is not an option. They are on the front line of the war against the virus, often working overnight and weekends to deep clean offices, airports and hotels.  Ali said at first she was not used to the stronger cleaning product she was asked to use as part of an enhanced cleaning protocol put in place because of the virus. The chemical irritated her eyes, throat and skin, but she has since been provided with goggles and a mask, which she said is helping.  ABM did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.  A spokeswoman for Ali\u2019s union, Service Employees International Union Local 6, said ABM had been responsive to its concerns and has committed to providing janitors with more protective gear and training. A janitor with experience of using stronger chemicals is also now providing guidance to other staff at Amazon, the union representative said.  Amazon said safety was a top priority and that it had notified employees and service providers, including janitors, who may have been in close contact with its employee who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Amazon also said it was committed to paying hourly workers who cannot come to work because of coronavirus.  \u201cWe continue to pay all hourly employees that support our offices around the world \u2013 from food service, to security guards to janitorial staff \u2013 during the time our employees are asked to work from home,\u201d an Amazon representative said in a statement.  \u2018PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK\u2019  Other cleaning professionals have seen demand for their services dry up as major events are canceled, malls and movie theaters close, and business travel is put on hold.  Those working in the hospitality and entertainment industry have been hit hard, with lost wages adding a new layer of uncertainty to their already precarious financial lives.  Earlier this month, Larrilou Carumba, a 47-year-old housekeeper at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis hotel, applied to rent a two-bedroom apartment.  But then she got her work schedule: she wasn\u2019t needed for at least two weeks. Suddenly unsure of when her next paycheck would land, she withdrew her application.  \u201cI\u2019m more afraid about my bills than the coronavirus,\u201d she said, adding that she would struggle to afford groceries, her car payments and insurance, and other outgoings. \u201cBeing a single mom, you live paycheck to paycheck.\u201d  Janitors earned a median hourly wage of $12.55 in 2018 while housekeepers made $11.43. Low-wage workers without unions are also less likely to have fundamental health benefits, including health insurance or sick leave, according to surveys from the Economic Policy Institute.  Think-tank Pew Research Center estimates here more than a third of cleaners and maintenance workers in America are immigrants.  \u201cI\u2019m going to keep cleaning because I have to help my family,\u201d said Ali, who is studying to become a nurse and sends money to her family in Somalia. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice to stay home. I have to go.\u201d  \u2018FALLING OFF A CLIFF\u2019  Hotel companies are reeling from a sharp drop in business over the past couple of weeks as conferences are canceled, vacations scrapped and casinos shut down.  Occupancies in the second week of March were 24.4% lower than the same week last year, according to data firm STR. Of the 25 markets it studied, the San Francisco region reported the second biggest hit to occupancy, which fell by 51.6% from 2019.  \u201cOur industry is falling off a cliff,\u201d said D. Taylor, president of the UNITE HERE, a union that represents about 300,000 members in the hotel, gaming, food, transport and other service industries in the United States and Canada.  Taylor said hospitality workers were under significant pressure as schools close, and traffic at hotels, casinos and airports plummets. He is advocating for more workers to receive paid sick leave so they can afford to stay home if they are unwell, or need to be quarantined.  For people who are laid off, the union is pushing for fast access to unemployment benefits and extended access to health insurance. \u201cThe coronavirus is a pretty scary thing and often our folks are on the front lines,\u201d Taylor said.  Marriott International MAR.O said a significant drop in demand worldwide was forcing it take remedial measures.  \u201cUnfortunately, occupancy dictates staffing levels - we are adjusting global operations accordingly and working quickly to mitigate the impact to our business,\u201d it said in a statement.  U.S. regulators and lawmakers are considering different options that could provide relief to low-income workers affected by the pandemic, including leniency with loans, expanding unemployment benefits and providing other financial assistance.  After withdrawing her bid for the apartment, Carumba submitted a different application - for unemployment benefits.  She is still waiting to hear whether she will get any assistance until she can return to work.  \u201cI have a strong faith that this will end,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know when.\u201d","1335":"(Reuters) - The following are some hot stocks including the so-called FAANG technology stocks - Facebook Inc FB.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O - as well as other companies in which hedge fund managers either took new stakes, adding to or exiting existing positions in the first quarter, filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed on Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Danny Moloshok\/File Photo  Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife, or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares.  \u201cIf she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,\u201d she said.  It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, according to New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who represents Judith Giuliani in her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump.  \u201cThese two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,\u201d Clair said, referring to Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos.  Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce.  \u201cJeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon,\u201d said Drew Herdener, vice president of communications for the company. He declined to comment on how the divorce might affect the ownership stake.  MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue.  The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine. They have four children.  Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said his wife\u2019s support was instrumental when he founded Amazon.  \u201cWhen you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,\u201d he said.  Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.  Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.  In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.  From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Walmart Inc.  In November, Amazon picked America\u2019s financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C.  Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling more than $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production.  He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of criticism from Trump.","1342":"Feb 20 (Reuters) - Dariohealth Corp:  * DARIOHEALTH LAUNCHES SALES OF DARIO\u2122 BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM ON AMAZON PRIME  * DARIOHEALTH CORP - LAUNCH AND FIRST SALES OF DARIO BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEM ON AMAZON Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1343":"Feb 3 (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos\u2019 surprise move to step down as chief executive of Amazon.com Inc quashed Wall Street optimism about bumper quarterly results, but analysts were upbeat on the promotion of its cloud computing head to the top job.

Analysts noted that Bezos, now among the world\u2019s richest men after starting Amazon as an internet bookseller in a garage 27 years ago, had already stepped back from much of the company\u2019s day-to-day operations.  J.P.Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth dismissed some concerns around Jassy\u2019s lack of experience in retail, saying that Jassy would continue Bezos\u2019 same core values and beliefs given similar operating cultures between the consumer and AWS businesses.  \u201cAs part of Amazon\u2019s S-team for years, Jassy has still been close to the Consumer business in which he originally started at Amazon,\u201d Anmuth said.","1344":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon.com Inc is seen in Sao Paulo, Brazil October 17, 2017.

Operating margin in the FedEx Ground segment tumbled to 6.4% from 11.5% a year ago, largely related to the cost of adding Sunday, or 7-day, delivery.  At Express, its plane-focused fast delivery service, operating margin fell to 2.6% from 6.6% a year ago, after weak industrial production contributed to softness in its higher-profit commercial business.  In September, FedEx lowered its earnings forecast for the year ending May 2020, to $11 to $13 per share. On Tuesday, it cut that to $10.25 to $11.50 per share, citing missed revenue targets in all transportation segments and higher residential delivery costs.  This holiday season is six days shorter than last year, pressuring package delivery firms at a time when retailers are demanding speedier deliveries.  Sriram Sridhar, CEO of LateShipment.com, tracks last-mile deliveries and said data culled from clients suggest that FedEx is lagging rival United Parcel Service Inc\u2019s on-time performance in large cities like Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston and New York.  Up to 15% of FedEx ground packages are delayed in some of the worst-hit areas, said Sridhar, forecasting that by the end of the season FedEx could have 1%-2% more delays than UPS.

It said the Postal Service had lost $65 billion since the 2007-2009 recession.

The order did not mention Amazon, which Trump has regularly criticized in recent weeks.  However, the order asked the task force to evaluate \u201cthe expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS\u2019s role in competitive markets,\u201d among other issues.  Deliveries for Amazon and other online retailers have been the fastest-growing part of the U.S. Postal Service business, helping offset a sharp decline in regular first-class mail.

Wall Street analysts have estimated it pays USPS roughly half what it would to United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N or FedEx Corp FDX.N to deliver a package.

Amazon declined to comment. Though the company is one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, it is increasingly growing its own delivery capacity, which could help it stem any impact from changes to USPS.

REUTERS\/Gus Ruelas\/File Photo  The documents, dated between 2012 and 2019, are reported here for the first time.

Indian traders, who are a crucial part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s support base, have long alleged that Amazon\u2019s platform largely benefits a few big sellers and that the e-commerce giant engages in predatory pricing that harms their businesses.  In a written statement, Amazon said that it \u201chas always complied with the law\u201d in India and that \u201cas government policies have continued to evolve, we have consistently made the necessary changes to ensure compliance at all times.\u201d  Amazon also said it \u201cdoes not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace,\u201d and that it \u201ctreats all sellers in a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner, with each seller responsible for independently determining prices and managing their inventory.\u201d  Here are more key findings from the special report:  * The documents reveal that the American e-commerce giant helped a small number of sellers prosper and gave them discounted fees, using them to bypass India\u2019s regulatory restrictions on foreign investment aimed at protecting small traders.  * Some 33 Amazon sellers accounted for about a third of the value of all goods sold on the company\u2019s website in early 2019, the documents show. Another two big sellers \u2013 merchants in which Amazon had indirect equity stakes \u2013 accounted for around 35% of the platform\u2019s sales revenue in early 2019. That meant some 35 of Amazon\u2019s more than 400,000 sellers in India at the time accounted for around two-thirds of its online sales.  * Amazon exercised significant control over the inventory of some of the biggest sellers on Amazon.in, the documents show, even though it says publicly that all sellers operate independently on its platform.  * Amazon helped Cloudtail, a seller in which it has an indirect equity stake, cut special deals with big tech manufacturers such as Apple Inc, the documents show.  * One document contains a frank appraisal of Modi. \u201cPM Modi is not an intellectual or an academic but believes that strong administration and governance is the key to running a successful government,\u201d it said.  Amazon says it is helping small and medium businesses in India grow and that it now has over 700,000 sellers on its platform. During a visit to India in January last year, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos announced that the company would spend $1 billion to bring small businesses online in the country. That would take Amazon\u2019s total committed India investment to $6.5 billion.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Walmart is seen outside of a new Walmart Store in San Salvador, El Salvador, August 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Jose Cabezas\/File Photo  Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, also lowered its earnings forecast for its current fiscal year and said e-commerce growth next year would be slower than in the current year ending in January.  \u201cI want to challenge your thinking about Walmart,\u201d Chief Executive Doug McMillon told the company\u2019s annual investor meeting, which was webcast. \u201cThere is a change within the company that is related to mindset, culture behavior, and we are inventing again.\u201d  McMillon highlighted Walmart\u2019s patents in last-mile delivery, biometrics and augmented reality, as well as investments in machine learning in areas like merchandising, blockchain to improve food safety, and traceability. He also cited pickup towers in stores to boost online sales and various e-commerce delivery options.  Grocery sales make up 56 percent of Walmart\u2019s revenue, and McMillon emphasized Walmart\u2019s advantage in the food category, an area that Amazon is trying to crack, particularly following its acquisition last year of organic grocer Whole Foods. He said Walmart can offer fresh food within 10 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population.  Walmart is doubling down on online grocery delivery and pickup options. By the end of the year, 800 U.S. stores will offer grocery delivery and more than 2,000 will offer a pickup service.  The company also said it has brought more merchandise in the toy category this year and has permanently expanded space to stock toys in 235 stores in order to win the category after the collapse of Toys R Us.  \u201cThere is a lot of toy volume up for grabs this year,\u201d Walmart\u2019s chief merchandising officer, Steve Bratspies, said.  Walmart\u2019s shares were up 1.99 percent at $95.69 per share in afternoon trading.  E-COMMERCE GROWTH TO SLOW  Walmart\u2019s earnings next year will be eroded by its $16 billion acquisition of Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart in May, its largest-ever deal, to compete with Amazon in an important growth market. Walmart at the time had indicated the deal would lead to a per-share earnings hit of 25 to 30 cents this fiscal year and 60 cents next fiscal year.  The lower forecasts for earnings and online sales come after Walmart posted its best quarterly U.S. sales growth in a decade for its second fiscal quarter ended July 31, helped by lower unemployment and tax cuts that boosted consumers\u2019 spending power.  Walmart now expects to earn between $4.65 and $4.80 per share for fiscal 2019, down from an earlier forecast of $4.90 to $5.05 per share.  Walmart estimates a 35 percent growth rate for its online business in the fiscal year ending in January 2020, against expectations for 40 percent growth in the current fiscal year. Walmart said the 35 percent growth rate will be off a bigger base. The company\u2019s e-commerce business is also expected to post a slightly greater operating loss next year, Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said.  The company has made several efforts in the past year to boost online traffic. These include a website redesign, more online grocery offerings and acquisition of fashion brands to improve its appeal to millennial shoppers, who typically have avoided purchasing on the retailer\u2019s websites.  Walmart has been on an acquisition spree in the U.S. online fashion space, buying lingerie retailer Bare Necessities last week after purchasing plus-sized clothing startup Eloquii a week earlier.  Over the years, Walmart has worked to use physical locations as distribution points for online orders of groceries and other goods in order to retain buyers who increasingly expect quick, cheap shipping.  With a steady rise in online shopping, Walmart\u2019s e-commerce sales growth has been outstripping brick-and-mortar sales, leading the company to slash new store openings. The retailer plans to open fewer than 10 U.S. stores in the next fiscal year.  For fiscal 2020, Walmart expects comparable sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. That follows expected growth of about 3 percent this year, which would be the fastest pace since 2008.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Berkshire said it ended June with 537,300 Amazon shares worth about $1.02 billion, up from 483,300 shares three months earlier.  It made the disclosure in a regulatory filing detailing the $208.1 billion of U.S.-listed stocks it owned as of June 30.  Buffett, the world\u2019s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine, also drew attention in the quarter from fellow billionaire William Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management revealed a $749 million Berkshire stake.  Berkshire\u2019s stock price is more than 12% below its record high set in October.  The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.  Berkshire had disclosed earlier this month that it sold more stocks than it bought during the quarter, suggesting possible concern among Buffett and his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler about valuations.  Wednesday\u2019s filing includes investments by all three without saying who bought and sold what, though Buffett has said Combs or Weschler made the initial Amazon investment.  It was unclear whether Berkshire did any buying or selling on other exchanges during the quarter. Buffett\u2019s assistant did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The biggest investment to exit Berkshire\u2019s portfolio was a roughly $1.7 billion stake in USG, a wallboard maker acquired by Germany\u2019s Knauf KG in April.  Berkshire had agreed to sell its roughly 31 percent stake in USG, a nearly two-decade old investment that Buffett had labeled disappointing, as part of that merger.  The net selling contributed to Berkshire\u2019s ending June with a record $122.4 billion of cash and equivalents.  Berkshire invested $10 billion of that cash this month in Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N, which completed its takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.  Berkshire's biggest stock market commitment remains in financial services, where it is the largest shareholder in American Express Co AXP.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and has a significant stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, where Combs is a director.

The Audi e-tron midsize SUV will be offered in the United States next year at a starting price of $75,795 before a $7,500 tax credit. It is one of a volley of electric vehicles coming from Volkswagen AG VOWG.DE brands, as well as other European premium brands including Daimler-owned DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz, BMW BMWG.DE, Volvo Cars and Jaguar Land Rover.  All aim to expand the market for premium electric vehicles and also to grab share of that market from Palo Alto, California-based Tesla, which has had the niche largely to itself.  \u201cI want Audi to be the number-one electric vehicle seller in America over the long term,\u201d Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  Audi dealers, particularly those from California where Tesla has made significant inroads, cheered the e-tron at Monday night\u2019s crowded event. Analysts on Tuesday expressed concern that the vehicle\u2019s driving range may not measure up to the Tesla Model X.  Audi officials said they do not have official range estimates for the e-tron SUV under U.S. testing procedures. They said the vehicle should achieve a range under less rigorous European testing standards of roughly 250 miles or 400 km.  Keogh told attendees at Monday\u2019s event that an e-tron had made a 175-mile journey over the mountains east of San Francisco with range to spare. He also emphasized that the e-tron is designed to recharge more rapidly than rival electric vehicles.  UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said in a note on Tuesday that the e-tron \"fails to set new benchmarks in the premium EV segment, even though we consider it better than the Mercedes EQC.\" The EQC is a rival electric SUV the Daimler AG DAIGn.DE brand plans to launch in 2020.  The e-tron\u2019s 95 kWh battery has less capacity than the 100 kWh battery used in the Tesla Model X 100D model, but more than the base Model X 75D.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The Model X 100D is rated at 295 miles (475 km) of range by the U.S. government.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is also head of rocket company SpaceX, marked the e-tron launch by staging a SpaceX event in Los Angeles at roughly the same time on Monday evening as Audi\u2019s unveiling. At the SpaceX event, the company named its first private passenger on a planned voyage around the moon in 2023.  RECHARGING  Audi and parent Volkswagen are using the U.S. launch of the e-tron SUV in mid-2019 to take aim at one obstacle to expanding electric vehicle sales - the lack of convenient ways to recharge their batteries.  Audi will partner with online retailer Amazon to sell and install home electric vehicle charging systems to buyers of the e-tron, the companies said on Monday. Amazon will deliver the hardware and hire electricians to install them through its Amazon Home Services operation.  Amazon\u2019s partnership with Audi to provide home charging systems is the first time the online retailer has struck such a deal with an automaker, and signals a new front in Amazon\u2019s drive to expand its reach into consumers\u2019 homes beyond the presence of its Alexa smart speakers in living rooms and kitchens.  \u201cWe see charging installation as a very important business,\u201d Pat Bigatel, director of Amazon Home Services, told Reuters at Audi\u2019s launch event in San Francisco\u2019s Bill Graham Civic Center.  Audi executives said home charging stations would cost about $1,000, depending on the home\u2019s electrical system.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Tesla offers wall connectors for home charging at a $500 list price, and will arrange for installation, according to the company.  At the same time, Electrify America, a company funded by Volkswagen as part of its settlement of U.S. diesel emission cheating litigation, plans to launch next year the next round of installations of public charging stations, Electrify America executives told Reuters.  Tesla has developed its own network of Supercharger charging stations with more than 11,000 chargers in North America. Electrify America plans to have 2,000 chargers installed by mid-June next year. Those will be open to any vehicle, and customers can swipe a credit card to recharge.  \u201cWe want to work with all\u201d automotive brands, said Giovanni Palazzo, Electrify America\u2019s chief executive.  LIFTING THE CURTAIN  Audi has been heralding the launch of the e-tron SUV for some time, but until Monday it had not shared many details of the vehicle.  The e-tron is electric, and has two electric motors - one in the front and one in the rear - driving all four wheels. The Hungarian factory building motors for the e-tron will start with a production pace equivalent to 200 vehicles a day, Audi officials said.  In Europe, the vehicle will use cameras instead of conventional mirrors to give drivers a view to the rear. That feature is still not approved by U.S. regulators.  However, in many other respects the e-tron is a conventional, mainstream luxury SUV. It offers seating for five, and its length and wheelbase position it in the center of the market for midsize, five-passenger luxury SUVs such as the BMW X5. The e-tron is 5 inches (13 cm) shorter than the Tesla Model X, and it has conventional doors. The Model X uses vertically opening \u201cfalcon wing\u201d doors.  The e-tron will have an advanced cruise-control system that can keep the car within a lane and maintain a set distance behind another vehicle, but the system will be designed so that drivers must keep hands on the wheel.","1367":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, April 22, 2020.

It said the new hires will work out of a temporary space on Crystal Drive in June, as the company aims to open its first building in the fall. The drive is in Crystal City, part of Arlington.  The move comes after Amazon cleared a key funding vote in Arlington in March, when local officials approved a financial package worth an estimated $51 million amid a small but vocal opposition. The $51 million is a small fraction of the $481 million promised by the county and a $750 million package offered by the state.  Detailing Amazon\u2019s plans in the region in March, Holly Sullivan, the company\u2019s worldwide head of economic development said the internet retailer will invest approximately $2.5 billion, create more than 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000, which will generate more than $3.2 billion in tax revenue.  The company has said it will lease 45,500 square feet (4,227 square meters) of space from real estate company JBG Smith, which has finalized three leases and two sale agreements for buildings in the region with Amazon.

REUTERS\/Issei Kato  As bricks-and-mortar retailers lower prices to remain competitive with online shops, core consumer prices are being pushed down by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point, the Bank of Japan said in a research paper on Monday.  Online retailers are able to charge lower prices because of the money they save by not operating physical stores, the BOJ said, citing research comparing prices in Japan and nine other countries.  Japan\u2019s consumer price index does not measure prices at online retailers, but it does capture prices charged at retailers with physical stores, and some of these retailers may be lowering prices to compete with their online peers, the BOJ said.  BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week said the \u201cAmazon effect\u201d may place downward pressure on prices in advanced economies, because consumers can easily compare prices and buy the cheapest items available.  Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), the world\u2019s largest online retailer, has increased its number of shipment centers in Japan over the past 10 years, which has lowered average distances and likely decreased shipping costs, the central bank said in its report.  Core consumer inflation decelerated to a 0.7 percent annual increase in April, disappointing economists inside the BOJ who expected inflation to accelerate toward the central bank\u2019s 2 percent inflation target.  Despite over five years of massive stimulus, inflation has remained stubbornly low in Japan with policy makers increasingly nervous about the de-merits of the prolonged easy policy.  The BOJ is expected to downgrade its consumer price forecasts at its next meeting in July, and economists say the central bank is already laying the groundwork for such a move.  \u201cThe impact of online shopping may become the BOJ\u2019s next talking point, but it sounds more like an excuse to me,\u201d said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.  \u201cThis is not a sufficient explanation for why prices in Japan have been rising less compared with other countries.\u201d  Japanese consumers have been buying more clothes and daily goods online in the past few years, partly because more dual-income households are using e-commerce to save time, the BOJ said, citing government data.  The consumer price index shows prices for these goods are lower than prices charged for other items, which suggests that existing retailers are keeping prices low to avoid losing customers to Internet shopping.  The BOJ did caution that its calculation for how much downward pressure online shopping places on core CPI is based on limited data, and that it is important to closely monitor the trend in the future.","1372":"* ITW slumps after cutting profit forecast on strong dollar  * Dollar\u2019s strength, trade war fears weigh on sentiment  * Amazon falls after Trump latest attack  * Hasbro top of S&P after results, Halliburton at bottom  * Dow down 0.07 pct, Nasdaq dips 0.03 pct; S&P up 0.03 pct (Changes comment; adds details, prices)  By Amy Caren Daniel  July 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes treaded water on Monday, as gains in financials were offset by losses in Amazon and industrials, as investors waited for earnings reports from marquee corporations to assess the impact of an escalating U.S.-China trade conflict.

It is a growing rival.  Here are key features of Amazon\u2019s on-the-ground delivery in its biggest international market, Germany, compared with DHL, one of the world\u2019s largest logistics firms. Amazon runs its delivery business in a similar way around the world.  * Same day option  Amazon offers same-day deliveries in 20 metropolitan areas in Germany if customers order before midday. Prime members, who pay a monthly fee, get free delivery for articles which qualify.  DHL offers same-day deliveries with a latest time of 4 p.m. for pickups close to a destination. Prices are set individually.  *Hand sorting, preparing for delivery using an app:  Amazon relies on hand-sorting at its distribution center. Employees use an app that then dictates the order in which the parcels are loaded and delivered. Amazon says each van is loaded with 100 to 200 parcels. Five waves of vans, 250 in total, can be sent on their way before midday.  Sorting is automated at many of DHL\u2019s distribution centers and vans are much bigger. Drivers load them as they see fit, a process that takes about 90 minutes, or longer at less automated centers. One Berlin center sends out 40 vans a day in two waves.  *Independent contractors provide vans and drivers:  Amazon mostly works with contractors, which provide vehicles and drivers, whereas DHL says it almost exclusively uses employee drivers in Germany. Drivers working for Amazon contractors or subcontractors use Amazon\u2019s app, which plans their route at the last minute to account for traffic.  One subcontracting firm said Amazon pays it 211 euros for a \u201cgate\u201d or area where deliveries are expected to take eight hours, rising to 229 euros for those requiring 10 hours work, plus a fuel surcharge. Amazon declined to comment.  Amazon has begun hiring some staff drivers in the southern city of Munich, who it will pay 12.80 per hour.  At DHL, delivery staff are covered by a collective wage agreement. The company says they get between 13.37 euros and 17.21 euros per hour, plus holiday pay and a 13th month salary.  A DHL driver in Berlin delivers an average of 160 parcels a day, but many are for business customers, where 5-10 might be dropped on one stop and as many as 150 parcels may be picked up along the way. Shifts last eight hours, with a maximum of 10.DHL drivers largely stick to the same areas and report back on congestion to their colleagues.  The company is testing a navigation tool to allow it to advise customers when their parcels are likely to arrive.  *Leaving parcels if low risk:  Amazon encourages drivers to leave parcels in a safe place if a customer is not at home and says this means less than 1% are brought back to the depot. The company knows what is inside each parcel and calculates whether leaving it is worth the risk.  At DHL, packages are taken to local post offices or parcel shops for later collection if a driver cannot find someone to sign for them.  Both Amazon and DHL are expanding their use of lockers and local shops, where drivers can usually drop multiple parcels.","1374":"(Repeats story first published on Friday)  SAN FRANCISCO\/WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Big companies in the United States from Amazon.com Inc to Toyota Motor Corp and Alcoa Corp are working to counter the effect of the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies and to head off new tariffs.  Companies are attempting to avoid any confrontation with U.S. President Donald Trump but want to exert as much influence as they can to dissuade him from tearing up trade agreements or introducing tariffs on a wide swath of imports.  Amazon, the world\u2019s largest online retailer and cloud-computing company, which could be hurt by tariffs on items sold through its website and components for its data centers, is discussing industry-wide advertising campaigns and more extensive government lobbying, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity.  Amazon declined to comment.  Toyota Motor North America, a subsidiary of Japan\u2019s Toyota, which could suffer if Trump follows through on a plan to impose tariffs on imported vehicles and parts, flew workers to Washington for a rally this week in front of the U.S. Capitol while the unit\u2019s chief has met key members of Congress in recent weeks to discuss the potential impact of tariffs.  Executives from General Motors Co, which could be hurt if Trump pulls the United States out of the North American Free Trade Agreement or if he imposes auto tariffs, have also held meetings with the administration and Congress over the last year to raise its concerns about trade issues. Tariffs would lead to \u201ca reduced presence at home and abroad,\u201d the company said in June.  The largest U.S. automaker is set to hire Trump\u2019s former deputy director of the National Economic Council and adviser on international economic affairs. Everett Eissenstat, who left the White House earlier this month, will head GM\u2019s public policy efforts, according to sources familiar with the matter.  GM told Reuters it had an opening but declined to confirm the hire. Eissenstat could not be reached for comment.  Those already suffering from the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which went into effect in June, are also pushing for relief in private.  The chief executive of Alcoa told investors on a conference call this week that the aluminum producer was in \u201cactive discussions\u201d with the Trump administration, the Commerce Department and members of Congress about the elimination of tariffs or getting an exception for Canadian aluminum.  Alcoa said this week it will incur as much as $14 million a month in extra expenses, mainly from tariffs levied on aluminum imported from Canada, its biggest supplier.  CLOUD PAIN  In addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs already imposed, the Trump administration has threatened 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods which would affect thousands of imported products from furniture to network routers.  Seattle-based Amazon is concerned such tariffs would hit shoppers during the crucial holiday shopping season, the person familiar with the matter said.  Amazon has identified a wide range of items, some of them high-value, the tariffs would hit and is assessing the potential impact on its business, the person said.  High among its concerns is an increase in import costs for components used in data centers or other items that would make its cloud computing division less competitive, two people familiar with the matter said. Amazon Web Services is the company\u2019s most profitable unit.  Amazon is not alone in the technology industry with its worries. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of many of our companies that don\u2019t have some risk and exposure as a result of the tariff,\u201d said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, which counts Amazon rivals Microsoft Corp , Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and others as members.  Lobbying administration officials and members of Congress can be costly with no guarantee of victory, but some have succeeded.  Apple Inc won guarantees from the Trump administration that its lucrative iPhones would ship from China without being subject to tariffs, the New York Times reported last month.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics centre in Boves, France, August 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  The Seattle retail and cloud services powerhouse plans to use the annual technology show in Las Vegas to unveil its plan to be a major player in self-driving vehicle technology, connected cars, electric vehicles and management of the torrents of data generated by automakers and drivers, company executives told Reuters.  Amazon Web Services, which provides large-scale cloud computing and data management services, is central to Amazon\u2019s strategy.  \u201cWe really are extending ourselves more and more out in the ecosystem from manufacturing to connected car,\u201d Jon Allen, head of professional services in Amazon Web Services\u2019 automotive practice, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe takeaway message on this is if you go to CES this year we really are taking it as a \u2018One Amazon\u2019 view.\u201d  Until now, Amazon has shown its transportation strategy to investors - and rivals - one piece at a time. Amazon has invested in self-driving software startup Aurora. It also has signed deals with automakers to deliver packages to vehicle trunks, help develop electric vehicle charging networks and use AWS to network their factories.  The Seattle company will share the CES stage with partners such as virtual reality firm ZeroLight, electric vehicle startup Rivian, Canada's BlackBerry Ltd BB.TO and video game software development company Unity Technologies.  \u201cIt\u2019s our attempt to weave everything together in a single experience for our customers,\u201d Dean Phillips, AWS\u2019 automotive technical leader, told Reuters. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t distinguish AWS from Alexa from Amazon.com. It\u2019s Amazon.\u201d  At CES, ZeroLight and General Motors Co's GM.N Cadillac will demonstrate how they are partnering to develop an online vehicle configuration experience that will allow high-fidelity images of vehicles that consumers build online to be taken with them on visits to dealers, Phillips said.  The process can open the door to dealers better meeting customer needs by knowing what users focused on when building their dream car. It has already boosted profit per vehicle at Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE Audi brand by an estimated 1,200 euros ($1,340), he said.  Rivian, in which Amazon has twice invested, will demonstrate Alexa in the R1T electric pickup truck it will begin building this fall, as well as the companion R1S SUV that will follow, Phillips said. Rivian will begin building 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon starting in 2021. Alexa will be integrated into all of those vehicles, Amazon said.  BlackBerry and Karma Automotive, using AWS back-end services, will demonstrate how to better predict an electric car\u2019s battery health, allowing automakers to train drivers on how to drive in ways that will extend the battery\u2019s lifetime, he said.  Unity will show how its gaming simulations are used by automakers to create virtual worlds to allow self-driving vehicle developers to speed the training of the software used in those cars, Phillips said.  Some industry officials fear the loss of profits to technology companies, but Amazon has worked to woo the sector by showing greater flexibility to company needs. For instance, when Alexa is launched in GM cars in the U.S. market next year, it will be push-button activated and not use the wake word, \u201cAlexa,\u201d Amazon officials said.  A new in-car feature, using the voice command \u201cAlexa, pay for gas,\u201d will enable users to buy fuel at 11,500 Exxon and Mobil gas stations, Amazon said.  A new version of Fire TV will be available this year on in-vehicle entertainment systems from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, Amazon said.

In a proposed class action filed in Brooklyn federal court, Christian Smalls accused Amazon of failing to provide needed protective gear to its \u201cpredominantly minority\u201d workforce, subjecting them to inferior working conditions than its mainly white managers.  Citing a leaked memo from Amazon\u2019s general counsel to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Smalls also said Amazon fired him after concluding that as a Black man he was a \u201cweak spokesman\u201d for workers.  He also said Amazon tried to drum up public support by making him the \u201cface\u201d of workers criticizing its pandemic response.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages for Black and Hispanic workers at the Staten Island facility.  Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  In March and April, Amazon fired Smalls and at least three other workers critical of its pandemic response, citing various alleged workplace violations.  It said Smalls was fired after violating his paid quarantine by joining a protest at the Staten Island facility.  A few weeks after the firing, New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote to Amazon, expressing \u201cserious concern\u201d it was trying to silence critics of its health and safety measures.  The Seattle-based company has benefited from the pandemic as consumers shopped online more often.  Amazon has said it expects to invest $10 billion this year on COVID-19 initiatives to deliver products and keep employees safe, including by distributing masks to workers and employing disinfectant spraying and temperature checks worldwide.  On Oct. 1, Amazon said 19,816 of its 1.37 million front-line U.S. workers between Mar. 1 and Sept. 19 had tested positive or were presumed positive for the coronavirus.  It said that was 42% fewer than if the infection rate had mirrored the rate for the general population.  Last week, a Brooklyn federal judge dismissed a separate lawsuit accusing Amazon of creating a public nuisance at the Staten Island facility.

A second proposal that called for a study of the extent to which Amazon\u2019s \u201cRekognition\u201d service harmed civil rights and privacy garnered 27.5% support.  Amazon\u2019s sale of the technology to law enforcement in Oregon and Florida has put the company at the center of a growing U.S. debate over facial recognition, with critics warning of false matches and arrests and proponents arguing it keeps the public safe.  Amazon has defended its work and said all users must follow the law.  These and other Amazon resolutions by shareholders faced an uphill battle to winning majority support, with Amazon\u2019s board recommending against them and founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos controlling 16% of the stock and voting rights.  Calculation of support was based on the total votes for, against and abstaining. The tallies excluded broker non-votes.  Law enforcement in the United States have used facial recognition for years, and vendors of the technology have abounded, including France\u2019s Idemia, Japan\u2019s NEC Corp and newer entrants like Israel\u2019s AnyVision and Microsoft Corp, which has called for regulation in recent months.  Now, members of the U.S. Congress are looking into the rights impact of the technology. Amazon\u2019s marketing of facial recognition has resulted in intense scrutiny, and researchers have said its technology struggled to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, prompting fears of unjust arrests.  Among other issues shareholders considered before Amazon\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday was a request to make it easier for investors to call a special meeting, which garnered 35.3% of votes.  A proposal that the company report how it plans to deal with climate change received 29.8% of votes. Nearly 7,700 employees had signed a letter of support of the climate resolution, in a sign of rising worker activism at Amazon.","1379":"LOS ANGELES, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc wants to hire thousands of seasonal delivery drivers to supplement services provided by the U.S. Post Office, United Parcel Service Inc, FedEx Corp and its own delivery partners, the company said on Monday.  The move comes as the online retailer is recruiting new delivery service partners, or DSPs, to help reduce delivery costs that more than tripled to $21.7 billion between 2013 and 2017.  Amazon is recruiting across the United States and will provide vans for the seasonal delivery workers, a company spokeswoman said.  Advertisements on the job listing site Indeed.com offered pay of $16.25 per hour in El Monte, California, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles; $15.50 per hour in Gary, Indiana; and $18.25 in the Long Island hamlet of Bethpage, New York.  Drivers will work four, 10-hour shifts per week, according to the job listings.  Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix, which sells technology that tracks and manages deliveries, expects Amazon to send 8.5 million to 9 million packages per day during the peak season that runs from the end of November through Christmas.  He said the final result could be on the high end of that forecast because Amazon also said on Monday it would temporarily waive a $25 minimum purchase requirement to qualify for free holiday shipping.  That promotion, which promises to intensify competition with rivals such as Walmart Inc, could help Amazon reduce shipping costs since it does not come with a guarantee for pricey one- or two-day delivery, Jindel said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  King, who joined the company in 2011, led a revamp of Walmart\u2019s U.S. e-commerce technology platform by making it faster, more competitive and customer-friendly, all of which have been key to the retailer\u2019s fight against its e-commerce rivals.  Under King, Walmart integrated its massive stores and online systems and began offering shoppers services such as in-store pickup of online orders, easy returns and online grocery pickup, among other benefits.  King also led the company\u2019s technology arm, Walmart Labs, through more than 10 acquisitions and was key in moving the company\u2019s operations to the cloud, which gave the retailer more resources to compete with Amazon. He also oversaw the opening of four new tech offices.  In the past two years, King oversaw the tech transformation of Walmart\u2019s roughly 4,700 U.S. stores.  Fiona Tan, senior vice-president of customer technology, Walmart Labs, will take on more responsibility as King\u2019s replacement is found. She has been asked to become a liaison for the technology team, Walmart U.S. and the U.S. ecommerce leadership team, according to the memo, a copy of which Reuters has seen.  King\u2019s departure comes at a time when Walmart is in the middle of making massive investments in its e-commerce business to compete more effectively. In February, the company said it expects its e-commerce losses to increase this year due to ongoing investments and it is focused on increasing return customer visits and strengthening its online product assortment.  The retailer\u2019s ecommerce success has been erratic over the years but sales growth in the past few quarters has shown signs of consistency.  In the most recent quarter, online sales grew 43 percent and matched the previous quarter\u2019s increase.

Energized by protests at Amazon\u2019s U.S. warehouses and a more labor-friendly administration assuming office, unions are campaigning at the world\u2019s largest online retailer to see if its warehouse or grocery workers would like to join their ranks.  A major test is expected early next year when workers at one warehouse decide whether to unionize. The company has not faced a union election in the United States since 2014, and a \u201cyes\u201d vote would be the first ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.  Amazon, America\u2019s second-biggest private employer behind Walmart Inc, has told workers it already offers the pay and benefits unions promise, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. Its operation in France offers a picture of what the company would avoid: strong unions there precipitated a month-long closure of its warehouses this year.  The upcoming vote is for associates in Amazon\u2019s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama; they will weigh whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The organizing committee has launched a social media campaign, shared union authorization cards and collected enough to hold the election.  This week and last, the RWDSU and Amazon negotiated the election terms. By Tuesday they agreed to have seasonal workers in the bargaining unit, as well as process assistants, whose inclusion the union had questioned for their supervisory authority, according to the election hearings presided by a government labor board. That board will set the election date.  The larger the bargaining unit\u2019s size - now expected to be over 5,700 - the more votes the union needs to win.  In a statement, Amazon said, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this group represents the majority of our employees\u2019 views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire.\u201d Average pay at the Bessemer facility is $15.30 per hour, and jobs come with health and retirement benefits, it said.  Precedent shows the RWDSU faces an uphill battle. Union membership has fallen to 10% of the eligible workforce in 2019 from 20% in 1983, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Employees at the Alabama facility did not answer requests for an interview.  VOTE \u2018WOULD PASS\u2019  Amazon workers are organizing elsewhere, too. Alexander Collias, a cashier for Amazon\u2019s subsidiary Whole Foods, said he has been participating in walkouts because the pandemic has put workers\u2019 health at risk and he claims management has brushed off others concerns.  \u201cWe\u2019re definitely extremely pro-union,\u201d he said of his Whole Foods store in Portland. \u201cIf we had a vote today, I think it would pass.\u201d  Courtenay Brown, a process assistant at an Amazon warehouse in New Jersey, said work has increased 10-fold in her building during the pandemic, and colleagues have fallen ill. So she\u2019s started circulating work-related petitions via Facebook.  \u201cWe need to be able to have a voice,\u201d said Brown, 30, adding she was neutral about the impact a union could have at her facility.  Reuters was introduced to both Brown and Collias via pro-labor groups campaigning at Amazon. One of them was Whole Worker, a group of current and former Whole Foods staff looking to organize the grocery chain.  Its strategy is to focus outreach and actions at the half dozen Whole Foods stores, including in Portland and Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, where it already has secured majority staff support, said Katie Doan, one of the group\u2019s directors.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWe\u2019d rather focus on little stores here and there who are for sure going to fully unionize, rather than fail nationally,\u201d said Doan, who worked for Whole Foods in California until earlier this year.  Likewise, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International have reached out to discuss unionization, hazard pay and other issues with Whole Foods staff, according to interviews and copies of the communication shared with Reuters.  Seattle-area unions are meeting with Amazon tech workers, too, their coalition leader said. One local is helping corporate whistleblowers whom Amazon fired contest their termination as a violation of U.S. labor law, according to a public record obtained by Reuters. Amazon said it supports workers\u2019 right to criticize the company, but the employees in question violated internal policies.  Labor advocates say the administration of President Joe Biden is poised to help with union efforts, making the U.S. National Labor Relations Board less beholden to corporate interests and supporting the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.  That bill passed the U.S. House in February and would add penalties for companies that hinder organizing; Senate approval is far from guaranteed. Its passage would help level the playing field for workers, said Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU president whose Mid-South Council is behind the Alabama union drive.  \u201cWith a change in administration, Amazon workers are going to have a much better chance of coming together,\u201d he said.","1386":"Reuters, the world\u2019s largest multimedia news provider, announced today that it is collaborating with Amazon to deliver trusted news content to help Alexa answer even more customer questions.

Major chains have launched a raft of early promotions ahead of the Thanksgiving and Christmas period, which is six days shorter this year than last, worried about the impact of cut-throat competition and the shift to disruptive online players.  The ongoing U.S.-China trade war has also raised the cost of imported goods for many sellers as they fight to keep prices competitive, putting pressure on margins.  The No.1 U.S. home improvement chain HD.N cut forecasts for full-year sales and same-store sales, while department store operator Kohl's KSS.N cut annual adjusted profit forecast range by at least 40 cents and blamed weakness at its women's apparel business for missing quarterly profit estimates.  After the market close, smaller apparel retailer Urban outfitters URBN.O reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, due to deeper price cuts for its women's apparels under its namesake brand, sending shares down 12%.  Home Depot shares closed down 5% and Kohl\u2019s nearly 20%, dragging down sector peers and weighing on Wall Street.  \u201cThere\u2019s intense competition and it\u2019s extremely dynamic.

POCKETS OF WEAKNESS  While the U.S. economy continues to expand, doubts about the risk of recession have dogged financial markets all year and a Commerce Department retail report last week suggested consumer spending was slowing faster than economists had expected.  The report also pointed to more weakness in some sectors than others, and results from retailers so far have told a similar story.  Food sales rose 0.5% in October and one of the country's biggest grocer, Walmart WMT.N, last week said consumer spending was healthy as it raised its earnings forecast.  Graphic: Retail sales are up but not across the board,  The Kohl\u2019s numbers, however, chimed with a 1% drop in clothing and apparel sales nationally. Sales of appliances and garden equipment, in which Home Depot specializes, were both down around half a percent in the Commerce Department numbers, although the chain said its garden equipment and appliances sales rose.  \u201cConsumers are thinking a bit more carefully about what they buy. That means the holiday quarter won\u2019t be perhaps as robust as retailers hope it will be,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.  Another hint of the direction of travel was results from off-price retailer TJX Cos Inc TJX.N, which turned in a strong quarter of growth in customer traffic and sales as shoppers were drawn by the promise of its hefty discounts on upscale but off-season products.  \u201cIn a soft economic environment, people are looking for bargains in retail,\u201d Yanushevsky said.","1389":"Amazon Fulfillment Centre (YVR3) is pictured in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada April 30, 2018.

Amazon last month won an injunction to halt Future\u2019s deal with Reliance from a Singapore arbitrator both sides had agreed to use in case of disputes. Future later said the order wasn\u2019t binding, prompting Amazon to lodge a complaint with India\u2019s market regulator.  The Delhi High Court was asked on Saturday to block Amazon from \u201cmisusing\u201d the arbitration order to interfere in the Reliance deal, Future said in a filing to the stock exchange.  While further details about the challenge were not disclosed, the filing said it had made all entities who were part of the arbitration proceedings as parties to its latest suit, but was seeking relief only against Amazon.  Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The dispute has strained Amazon\u2019s ties with one of India\u2019s leading retailers as well as with Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man, and his Reliance group, which is fast expanding its e-commerce business and is a potential rival to Amazon.  Amazon says its 2019 deal in which it invested nearly $200 million in a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group could not sell its retail assets to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list, which included Reliance.  Future has said the deal with Reliance was critical to rescue its ailing retail business which has been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.","1391":"The company logo for Salesforce.com, Inc. is displayed on a screen on on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 7, 2019.

The partnership brings Salesforce and Amazon into more direct competition with call center technology providers such as RingCentral Inc. RingCentral has built out cloud technology for call centers and recently executed a deal to supply Avaya Holdings Corp, which was evaluating sale or merger options after struggling to build out similar technology on its own.  Artificial intelligence is a closely fought front in the battle to provide cloud services. Amazon and Microsoft Corp are the biggest players and others are mounting challenges.  Last week, Salesforce announced it would use Microsoft\u2019s Azure for some of its marketing services.  For Salesforce, Amazon Web Services will turn the customer\u2019s spoken words into text, where it can be translated into different languages or analyzed to determine whether the customer is angry or satisfied.  From there, Salesforce\u2019s software can recommend answers to the customer\u2019s questions.  Bret Taylor, Salesforce\u2019s president and chief product officer, said the practical effect of the software could be as simple as not having to put a customer on hold.  For instance, he said, when a customer calls an insurance company to ask the size of a policy\u2019s deductible, the software can fish it out of the system automatically.","1392":"FILE PHOTO: Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016.

Wilke did not say where customers might see the drone in action, but Amazon made its first customer delivery by drone in the United Kingdom in 2016.  For years, the world\u2019s largest online retailer has promised that packages would be landing on shoppers\u2019 doorsteps via these small aircraft, but hype around the service has long outpaced reality. The company has worked to ensure that hard-to-see wires would not trip up its vehicles, for instance, and it has faced tough regulations limiting commercial flights, particularly in the United States.  The company\u2019s announcement indicates its ambitions have hardly shrunk. Wilke said Amazon has been working to build fully electric drones. These can fly up to 15 miles (24 km), and Amazon is adding facilities closer to urban areas. They also can carry goods that weigh under 5 pounds (2.3 kg), which represent the majority of the items it sells.  At the conference, Amazon also formally introduced \u201cStyleSnap\u201d, a feature on its smartphone app that lets shoppers upload a picture of an outfit they like and get recommendations for similar items to buy. The feature launched in April, Wilke said, noting that shoppers had struggled to find styles that they could not describe in words.

Other announcements included a new warehouse sorting system already live in Denver, Colorado that relies on small robotic vehicles topped with miniature conveyor belts that take packages to the correct chutes for delivery.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen on the door of an Amazon Books retail store in New York City, U.S., February 14, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Amazon.com Inc, seeking to stem slowing sales growth, is plowing $800 million this quarter alone into its next-day package delivery project, something even Walmart Inc, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, will be hard-pressed to duplicate.  But there is another battle brewing behind the scenes, with Amazon racing to reproduce the assets of the businesses it aims to upend. The move to expedite shipping is a sign of growing pressure from such brick-and-mortar competitors, experts said.  The e-commerce giant, which has a mixed record with brick-and-mortar retail projects, is racing to open shops that sell top-selling items ranging from books to cell phones; rolling out same-day curbside grocery pickup \u2013 a service popular with time-crunched suburban Walmart and Target Corp shoppers; and gearing up to accept returns at all U.S. Kohls Corp department stores.  \u201cThis is a sign Amazon needs to compete with its rivals, who now offer free two-day shipping, free pickup, free returns and are using their stores to pose a serious challenge,\u201d said Frank Poore, chief executive of CommerceHub, a technology company that works with retailers like Walmart, Best Buy and Macy\u2019s Inc, helping them manage e-commerce inventory and increase product assortment.  The ability of brick-and-mortar rivals to catch up with Amazon using their stores indicates the e-commerce giant could be vulnerable as it invests billions of dollars to build out the service.  A source with knowledge of Walmart\u2019s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Walmart\u2019s current infrastructure will not allow it to match Amazon\u2019s one-day shipping in every market but that it is aggressively building up its own network.  \u201cI will not make the assumption that we can\u2019t do it as quickly as they can,\u201d said the source, referring to Amazon, which already offers free one-day shipping to Prime members in more than 10,000 cities and towns.  That confidence pushed the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company to take a jab at Amazon\u2019s $119 annual prime service. \u201cOne-day free shipping... without a membership fee. Now THAT would be ground breaking. Stay tuned,\u201d Walmart tweeted on Friday.  Walmart already offers free, two-day shipping around the country for purchases of $35 and up. Its existing network of 156 distribution centers in densely populated urban areas will make it easier to build out a one-day service, Brandon Fletcher, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a note.  \u201cOne-day shipping is neither shocking nor difficult for retailers at scale,\u201d Fletcher said.  Walmart declined to comment on Amazon\u2019s next-day shipping plans. Target said its shoppers can shop same-day and receive their purchases within hours, including grocery delivery, curbside pickup and order pickup. The last two services are free and require no membership.  Walmart is also moving faster on what the source with knowledge of its plans called the \u201cnext wave\u201d in delivery \u2013 fresh food \u2013 as well as same-day pickup for general merchandise orders and groceries. It has enlisted delivery services like DoorDash to drop shopping bags on customer doorsteps and tapped drive-thru-trained suburbanites to pick up their own online orders.  As of Jan. 31, Walmart offered same-day grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and same-day grocery delivery from nearly 800 stores. It runs nearly 4,700 U.S. stores.  Such efforts are a cost-effective way to fight Amazon, which is building a shipping network to contain costs. But they depend on investors continuing to funnel millions of dollars into unprofitable delivery startups, said Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix and SJ Consulting Group.  There is also the risk that next-day shipping could woo fans of order pickup programs.  \u201cMost people didn\u2019t need two-day delivery until Amazon made it \u2018necessary.\u2019 The same is likely to happen with one-day,\u201d said John Bonno, a managing director in the retail practice at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.","1410":"(Reuters) - Four Democratic U.S. senators on Friday expressed concern in a letter to Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos that the world\u2019s largest online retailer has not given enough support to warehouse staff during the coronavirus outbreak, according to a copy of the message seen by Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos speaks during an event about Blue Origin's space exploration plans in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  The lawmakers, led by Cory Booker and including presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, pointed to a news report that said disinfectant wipes and sanitizers were in low supply at Amazon facilities. The letter said workers risked poor performance ratings if they took sufficient time to wash their hands after coughing or sneezing on the job, also citing a news report.  \u201cAny failure of Amazon to keep its workers safe does not just put their employees at risk, it puts the entire country at risk,\u201d the letter said, noting the virus could survive up to 24 hours on cardboard such as Amazon packaging, according to media.  Amazon said the allegations about its practices \u201care simply unfounded.\u201d  The senators\u2019 letter reflects the intense pressure Amazon is under to keep warehouses, workers and the public safe while it delivers goods to consumers around the world, some of whom are under lockdown. It also reflects ongoing tensions between a company whose chief is the world\u2019s richest person and Democrats who have long criticized its working conditions and pay.  The other signatories were Senators Robert Menendez and Sherrod Brown.  Seattle-based Amazon has seen a rush of business as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier this week it said it would receive only vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, in order to free up inventory space for medical and household goods in high demand.  Amazon said it was helping communities in need while protecting its staff. It has staggered work times, ended stand-up meetings during shifts and required hand-washing after someone sneezes or coughs. Employees have allotted time to wash their hands whenever they desire, without hurting their performance, the company said.  \u201cWe have taken extreme measures to keep people safe, tripling down on deep cleaning, procuring safety supplies that are available, and changing processes to ensure those in our buildings are keeping safe distances,\u201d Amazon said.  The senators\u2019 letter asked the company to answer several questions in writing by March 26, including whether it would agree to cover employees\u2019 COVID-19 test costs and whether it would offer paid sick leave to workers who are not diagnosed with the virus.  The company has announced other benefits for employees fearful of contagion, such as unlimited unpaid time off for hourly workers through the end of March.  The coronavirus has led to at least 11,311 deaths globally, largely in Italy and China. There have been employees at Amazon\u2019s headquarters who have contracted the disease, as well as employees in Europe, where more than 200 workers staged a strike on Wednesday calling for the closure of a shipping center in Saran, south of Paris.  Amazon said this week it was closing a New York City delivery station for a period of cleaning after a worker there tested positive for the virus. The senators asked if Amazon would pledge similar temporary shutdowns should the same circumstance arise at facilities in the future.  One of the biggest U.S. employers, Amazon has opened more than 500,000 full- and part-time jobs in the country, many of them for fulfillment and delivery roles. It said this week it would hire 100,000 more U.S. warehouse and delivery workers to deal with the surge in online orders during the outbreak.","1411":"Amazon.com Inc is trying to convince the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a decision that said the online retail giant must face claims that it misclassified local delivery drivers across the country as independent contractors in court rather than in individual arbitration.

Future cooperation could extend beyond France. A source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday that Amazon and Casino were negotiating a deal in Brazil either partnering or selling Casino's local appliance and electronics chain Via Varejo SA VVAR3.SA.  Casino said the process of selling Via Varejo was continuing in Brazil with no new element to report and there was no partnership.  The French move, which is set to shake up the competitive local food retail market, lifted Casino shares as much as 9.7 percent in morning trade amid speculation that it could lead to a bigger deal later on.  Amazon's purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons MRW.L, raised expectations that it would bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.  Casino and Amazon said late on Monday that groceries sourced from Monoprix would be available in the Amazon Prime Now app and website through a dedicated virtual store.  The deal is limited to the lucrative Paris market and its suburbs, though Monoprix CEO Regis Schultz told a conference call that an extension to other parts of France could not be ruled out.  Asked if the partnership paved the way to other deals with Amazon, Schultz said: \u201cWe do not discuss the future.\u201d  Monoprix is one of France\u2019s best-known store chains, with a network of nearly 800 upmarket stores in more than 250 cities. It has a strong focus on quality and fresh products in the mould of Whole Foods, and is a key contributor to Casino group profit.  \u201cWe consider the Monoprix product selection as exceptional,\u201d Amazon France CEO Frederic Duval said during the call.  Financial terms were not disclosed, but Schultz said a model where Monoprix does the picking of the order in store and Amazon takes care of delivery was a \u201cprofitable\u201d one for Monoprix.  COMPLEMENTS OCADO DEAL  Casino already has a delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado OCDO.L, signed last year.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The two deals were complementary as the Ocado technology will allow Monoprix to address the needs of its traditional clients with a bigger basket and seeking next-day delivery. Clients of Amazon Prime, set up in Paris in 2016, are looking for fewer items and want express delivery.  Since the purchase of Whole Foods Market, expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred French retailers to try to improve their own online offerings.  Carrefour CARR.PA announced in January that it would invest 2.8 billion euros in digital commerce over the next five years, six times its current investment.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Leclerc, France\u2019s biggest food retailer by market share, privately held operator Systeme U and Casino have all been linked in recent months with Amazon, which has steadily been building its presence in France.

The company gave no details on the impact of technical glitches on the day.

The letter\u2019s signatories include U.S. Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, former UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Vice President of the European Parliament Heidi Hautala, co-convenors Progressive International and UNI Global Union said.  \u201cWe urge you to act decisively to change your policies and priorities to do right by your workers, their communities, and our planet,\u201d the letter said.  \u201cWe stand ready to act in our respective legislatures to support the movement that is growing around the world to Make Amazon Pay.\u201d  Amazon, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, has faced criticism for its tax practices before, including in the UK and the EU. It says its profits remain low given retail is a highly competitive, low margin business and it invests heavily.  It said on Thursday that while it accepted scrutiny from policymakers, many of the matters raised in the letter stemmed from misleading assertions.  \u201cAmazon has a strong track record of supporting our employees, our customers, and our communities, including providing safe working conditions, competitive wages and great benefits,\u201d it said, adding it was \u201cpaying billions of dollars in taxes globally.\u201d  Amazon grew rapidly during the pandemic, with sales soaring as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus closed bricks-and-mortar shops and sent consumers online.  Governments worldwide are considering tougher rules for big tech to assuage worries about competition.  The European Union, for example, last month charged Amazon with damaging retail competition, alleging it used its size, power and data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller merchants that sell on its online platform.  Amazon disagreed with the EU assertions, saying it represented less than 1% of the global retail market and there were larger retailers in every country in which it operated.","1426":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday independent businesses selling on its platform crossed $4.8 billion in worldwide sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, an increase of more than 60% from a year earlier.  In its first indication of performance for the year's peak online shopping days, Amazon said more than 71,000 small- and medium-sized businesses worldwide had surpassed $100,000 in sales this holiday season to date. (bit.ly\/2JePBBn)  The Seattle-based company did not, however, give a breakdown of U.S. sales or its own numbers for the weekend, nor for either of the two big shopping days, saying only that the holiday season overall had been its biggest ever.  Latest industry estimates overnight showed Cyber Monday on course to be the biggest online shopping day ever for the United States, garnering up to $11.4 billion as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted consumers to stay at home and turn to the internet for their holiday shopping needs.  The robust performance comes despite nearly two months of offers since Amazon held its Prime Day sales event in October, with retailers seeking to recoup business lost during this year\u2019s coronavirus-driven closures of malls and stores.  Meanwhile, Ottawa, Canada-based Shopify Inc said on Tuesday total Thanksgiving weekend sales soared 76% to $5.1 billion, beating the previous record of more than $2.9 billion by Saturday evening.  \u201cThe record sales ... demonstrate the power of the independent and direct-to-consumer businesses,\u201d Shopify President Harley Finkelstein said.  Estimates from Adobe Analytics showed this year\u2019s conclusion to Thanksgiving weekend sales would come in between $10.8 billion and $11.4 billion.  While that was down from an earlier estimate of as much as $12.7 billion, it still easily surpasses this year\u2019s Black Friday figure of $9 billion, the strongest online sales result for the day ever, as well as last year\u2019s Cyber Monday total of $9.4 billion.","1427":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru, India.

The logo of India's e-commerce firm Flipkart is seen in this illustration picture taken January 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Danish Siddiqui\/Illustration  In late December, India modified rules around foreign direct investment (FDI) in e-commerce, creating additional hurdles for the retail giants. The rules, which kick in on Friday, do not allow e-commerce sites to \u201cexercise ownership or control over the inventory\u201d of sellers.  India does not allow foreign investors to control and market their own inventory on their e-commerce platforms. They are only allowed to operate marketplace platforms where others sell goods to retail consumers.  Traders and rivals say companies such as Amazon and Flipkart have been violating the spirit of these rules by creating proxy sellers or vendors in which they have direct or indirect stakes, allowing firms to give deep discounts that upset off-line trade.  The All India Online Vendors Association, a group of about 3,500 online sellers, has accused both Flipkart and Amazon of using their dominant position to favour selected sellers. Amazon and Flipkart deny the accusations.  Both Amazon and Flipkart sought more time to comply with the new rules. But India said on Thursday, it had, after \u201cdue consideration\u201d decided not to extend beyond Feb. 1 the deadline for the implementation of the modified FDI norms.  In a letter to India\u2019s industries department earlier this month, Flipkart Chief Executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy said the rules required it to assess \u201call elements\u201d of its business operations, a source told Reuters previously.  Flipkart and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on their plans for complying with the new regulations.  EQUITY STAKES  The new rules, meant to close loopholes in the regulations, state that if any seller purchases more than 25 percent of its inventory from the wholesale units or other group companies of an e-commerce firm that runs an online marketplace, then that vendor\u2019s inventory will be deemed to be controlled by the e-commerce company.  That could disrupt the models of Amazon and Flipkart, whose wholesale units buy products in bulk and sell to thousands of vendors on their platform, who in turn sell to consumers.  Flipkart was likely to create a so-called \u201cmiddle layer\u201d firm - in which it would have less than a 25 percent shareholding - between its wholesale arm and vendors on its marketplace, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  This company, which would be classified as a non-group company under Indian law, would be able to freely sell to vendors without the 25 percent sourcing restriction, the sources added.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Another rule blocks entities in which an e-commerce firm, or any of its group companies, owns a stake from selling its products on that firm\u2019s marketplace.  This creates a barrier for India\u2019s Shopper\u2019s Stop to sell on Amazon India, as Amazon\u2019s investment arm has a minority stake in the department store chain.  Cloudtail and Appario, among the top sellers on Amazon India, could also face similar restrictions, because Amazon owns minority stakes in their parent firms.  \u201cBy the letter of the regulation it will not be considered to be an entity in which Amazon has an equity stake, but if the government is wanting to implement the spirit of this rule they might say this doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d one of the sources said.  E-commerce players may also be forced to give up the word \u201cexclusive\u201d when they launch products such as smartphones on their platforms, as the rules mandate that an online retailer cannot push vendors to \u201csell any product exclusively on its platform only\u201d.  Contracts between a brand and e-commerce firms would be reworded to say a brand would not sell to a direct rival, giving it freedom to sell elsewhere, one of the sources said.","1431":"MILAN (Reuters) - Amazon is set to secure exclusive rights to screen top European Champions League matches in Italy for the 2021-2024 seasons, three sources close to matter said, in what would be its first foray into broadcasting sports events in the country.

Final sale results of the deal are expected to be announced by the end of this week, the sources said.  One source said a separate tender to sell Europa League streaming rights might be held in January, as SKY was unable to buy those rights due to an Italian antitrust ruling preventing the pay-TV from securing exclusive contents for its video-streaming platform.  In 2017 SKY bought exclusive rights to broadcast Champions League and Europe soccer matches in Italy for an estimated 270 million euros per season.  SKY and Amazon declined to comment.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is cutting hundreds of jobs in its consumer business in Seattle, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday, as the company shifts resources into fast-growing areas like its work on voice assistant Alexa.  The job cuts, rare for the world\u2019s largest online retailer, are in the low hundreds, the person said on condition of anonymity. Amazon determined through planning for 2018 that certain mature areas of its business no longer required as much staff for the results it was seeking, the person said.  It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon\u2019s consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.  Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.  But many of the corporate jobs are going to areas of soaring profit, like cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, or areas where Amazon sees potential, like voice-controlled computing.  \u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a statement earlier this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201d  Amazon hopes Alexa will become a regular part of consumers\u2019 lives and will spur shopping orders by voice.  The company currently has 3,900 jobs open in Seattle, and staff facing job cuts can apply for them. The company has contracts for 1 million square feet or more of new office space in the city to hire still more employees.  The Seattle Times earlier reported the job cuts.","1433":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc took its legal challenge against partner Future Group\u2019s $3.4 billion retail assets sale to India\u2019s Supreme Court on Thursday, as the U.S. firm tries to stop a major rival buying the assets.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru, India, April 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Abhishek N. Chinnappa\/File Photo  Amazon alleges that Future Group violated contracts by agreeing to sell the retail assets to market leader Reliance Industries last year. Future denies any wrongdoing.  A New Delhi court this week dealt a blow to the U.S. firm by revoking a previous court decision that effectively blocked the deal, and Amazon has now filed an appeal against it in the Supreme Court in the capital city.  Amazon said in its court filing the order by the Delhi court was \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d and the company would face \u201cirreparable harm\u201d if the top court did not intervene.  \u201cThe greater the progress made towards the completion\u201d of the deal, \u201cthe harder it will be to unravel it,\u201d Amazon said in the filing seen by Reuters.  Amazon and Future did not respond to requests for comment.  The legal fight over Future\u2019s assets has embroiled two of the world\u2019s richest men - Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Reliance\u2019s Mukesh Ambani. The final outcome is seen shaping India\u2019s pandemic-hit shopping sector and will determine if Amazon is able to dent the dominance of Reliance.  Amazon will argue in its Supreme Court appeal that an arbitration order in October that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold remains valid, one of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  The dispute arose when Future Group agreed in August to sell its retail, wholesale and some other businesses to Reliance.  Amazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit included clauses saying the Indian group couldn\u2019t sell its retail assets to anyone on a \u201crestricted persons\u201d list, including Reliance.  Future, India\u2019s second-largest retailer with over 1,700 stores, has said it will be pushed towards liquidation if the deal falls through.","1434":"FILE PHOTO: A truck with the logo of Amazon Prime Delivery is seen at the Amazon logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, April 22, 2020 after Amazon extended the closure of its French warehouses until April 25 included, following dispute with unions over health protection measures amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.

Prime Day, a marketing event Amazon started in 2015 to drum up sales during the summer shopping lull, has previously occurred in July, though the company never publishes the date far in advance.  The decision to delay it means Amazon will have about 5 million extra devices it would have expected to sell sooner, items like its suite of voice-controlled Echo speakers that have been popular orders during the event.

Bezos was speaking in Berlin, where he received an award from German media company Axel Springer, and was responding to a question about how seriously he took recent criticism of Amazon by U.S. President Donald Trump.  \u201cAll large institutions should be scrutinised or examined,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cIt is not personal.\u201d  \u201cWe have a duty on behalf of society to help educate any regulators without cynicism or scepticism. We will work with any set of regulations that we are given... we will follow those rules and find a new way to delight customers.\u201d  Trump has said he would take a serious look at policies to address what he says are the unfair business advantages of Amazon, accusing the firm of not operating on a level playing field and not paying enough sales tax.  \u201cWe humans, especially in the western world, especially inside democracies, are wired to be mindful of big institutions... it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t trust them or they are evil or bad,\u201d Bezos said.  Amazon has also come in for criticism elsewhere over its tax policies and treatment of warehouse staff, with hundreds of European workers protesting on Tuesday outside the building where Bezos was speaking over pay and conditions.  \u201cI\u2019m very proud of our working conditions and I\u2019m very proud of the wages we pay,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe we need a union to be an intermediary between ourselves and our workers.\u201d  AN INDEPENDENT POST  Bezos also defended his ownership of the Washington Post, which Trump has called the \u201cchief lobbyist\u201d for Amazon. The Washington Post is privately owned by Bezos, not Amazon.  Bezos said the need to scrutinise large organisations was one of the reasons why the Post\u2019s work was so important, adding he had no problem with the newspaper pursuing critical reporting about Amazon and said he would never meddle in the newsroom.  \u201cI would be humiliated to interfere. I would turn bright red. I don\u2019t want to. It would feel icky, It would feel gross. Why would I? I want that paper to be independent,\u201d he said.  Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person with a fortune of more than $100 billion, added that he was not interested in buying other newspapers, despite receiving monthly requests to bail out other struggling media organisations.  He said he would keep liquidating about $1 billion of Amazon stock a year to fund his Blue Origin rocket company, saying he hoped to test a tourism vehicle with humans at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.  Asked about the scandal over the alleged misuse of the data of nearly 100 million Facebook users, Bezos said Amazon had worked hard on security: \u201cIf you mistreat your data, they will know, they will work it out.

Amazon\u2019s interest in delivering alcohol in West Bengal marks a bold move to make inroads into a market that is worth $27.2 billion, according to estimates by IWSR Drinks Market Analysis.  Over the years, Amazon has expanded its e-commere operations in India as more and more people go online to shop for everything from groceries to electronics. The company has committed $6.5 billion in investments in India, one of its key growth markets.  India\u2019s top two food-delivery startups, Swiggy and Zomato, started delivering alcohol in some cities last month, as they looked to cash in on the high demand for booze as many states come out of a lockdown aimed at tackling the coronavirus.  India restricted liquor sales when it announced a nationwide lockdown in March. Hundreds of people queued up at liquor stores in May when some restrictions were eased, and the liquor industry had been lobbying with many states to allow online deliveries.  Each state sets its own alcohol sales policy.

REUTERS\/Lisa Baertlein  The coronavirus pandemic should be Amazon's moment to shine. Some 90% of U.S. shoppers are under stay-at-home orders and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O offers grocery delivery through its 487 U.S. Whole Foods stores.  Instead, Whole Foods has been overwhelmed. Amazon Prime subscribers, who pay $119 a year for free delivery, are having difficulty finding Whole Foods delivery windows, according to interviews with a dozen customers and numerous posts on social media. And when their orders do arrive, many desired products are unavailable, they say.  \u201cI\u2019m really surprised that they weren\u2019t able to scale for this. I was expecting them to perform better. It seems like more than anything Amazon is a supply-chain company,\u201d said Ellen Sullivan, 37, a Chicago-based office manager.  Sullivan was a regular Amazon food delivery user before COVID-19 spread widely in the United States. Her last successful order was March 12, and even then, 10 of the 27 items were sold out and had to be replaced.  \u201cNow I\u2019m sitting on 6 pounds of frozen corn,\u201d Sullivan said.  Amazon told Reuters the setbacks are due to the spike in demand and social distancing constraints in its facilities and stores.  Amazon has said it would hire an additional 75,000 people for jobs ranging from warehouse staff to delivery drivers and switched a California Amazon grocery store and a Manhattan Whole Foods to online-only as demand for orders surges.  Whole Foods said its distribution network is strong and that it is working with suppliers to overcome increased demand and supply chain constraints without compromising quality standards that \u201cfurther limit the number of products we can source\u201d.  DISRUPTOR DISRUPTED  The world's biggest online retailer sent a shock through the stodgy U.S. supermarket business in 2017, when it bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Some experts predicted that Amazon would hasten the move to online grocery shopping and doom traditional operators like Walmart Inc WMT.N and Kroger Co KR.N.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  But now Amazon is buckling under unprecedented COVID-19 supply-and-demand disruptions that sent the entire grocery industry scrambling to adapt. After expanding and speeding up Whole Foods delivery, the company is retrenching.  On Sunday Amazon told Reuters it would put new grocery delivery customers on a wait list and curtail shopping hours at some Whole Foods stores to focus on orders from existing online customers.  The company - which also delivers food from its own warehouses through Amazon Fresh - last month suspended its Prime Pantry delivery service for non-perishable groceries.  \u201cThey were separating themselves from the pack and that\u2019s not happening anymore. This doesn\u2019t happen to Amazon ... they don\u2019t screw up like this,\u201d said Bill Bishop, co-founder of supermarket consultancy Brick Meets Click. Amazon inherited - and failed to address - many of the problems that are now plaguing its grocery business, a half dozen experts told Reuters.  In particular, they said the e-commerce giant with $55 billion on its balance sheet did not fortify Whole Foods\u2019 foundation, which relies on outdated technology, outside suppliers and real estate unsuited for the unprecedented surge in demand.  As a result, the chain\u2019s systems \u201ccreak very badly under the strain,\u201d Bishop said.  Walmart and Kroger are also fighting to keep in-demand products like flour, toilet paper and cleaning supplies on shelves, but their regular technology investments and tight control over supply chains have been a competitive advantage over Amazon and Whole Foods, experts said.  Those companies - the top two U.S. grocery sellers - operate fleets of trucks and own dozens of large warehouses, while Amazon is more apt to outsource.  Whole Foods depends on United Natural Foods (UNFI), a debt-laden grocery distributor, to supply dry grocery items like canned goods and toilet paper.  UNFI UNFI.N told Reuters it has \"greatly increased\" routes and hired over 1,000 employees to support clients.  REAL ESTATE RISKS  Whole Foods has 10 small regional warehouses for perishables like fruit, vegetables and meats. UNFI has a network of 59 distribution centers, which average about 500,000 square feet.  Walmart and Kroger, which have significantly more stores, have bigger distribution centers designed to swiftly move pallets of goods.  While a Walmart distribution center can deliver two full truckloads of goods to a store from a single driver, Whole Foods has difficulty digesting even one truckload, Strategic Resource Group managing director Burt Flickinger said.  Whole Foods\u2019 \u201ccenter store was never the big money generator for them,\u201d supermarket analyst David Livingston said, referring to the area where dry groceries are sold.  Indeed, many stores have wine bars, hot food stations and cafes that made them popular gathering places but are of little use right now.  \u201cThey\u2019re (Whole Foods) a restaurant alternative.

LensDirect.com Chief Executive Ryan Alovis said UPS\u2019s expanded weekend service means sunglass and contact lens orders that ship on Thursday or Friday hit customer doorsteps on Saturday instead of Monday, helping online retailers compete against Amazon.  \u201cIt has leveled the playing field,\u201d Alovis told Reuters.  EXPENSIVE  Weekend operations are more expensive because they skew toward one-off, far-flung residential deliveries - so UPS is attacking the costs, industry experts said.  Amazon, which itself delivered 3.5 billion packages globally last year, has cherry-picked desirable urban deliveries and left the costlier rural business to UPS, USPS and other providers.  The top hourly wage for UPS\u2019s unionized weekend drivers is around $32 per hour, about 15% less than weekday drivers\u2019 top rate but still well above the roughly $15 per hour that Amazon delivery drivers make.  UPS and FedEx need to add more packages per delivery to boost profits on residential shipments, said Dean Maciuba, a director at Logistics Trends & Insights. \u201cThe thing preventing that from happening more quickly is Amazon,\u201d Maciuba said. Recent results from FedEx offered a cautionary tale.  The Memphis company in December slashed its 2020 profit forecast, blaming in part higher-than-expected startup costs for its residential service that delivered nearly 8 million packages on Sundays between Black Friday, which last year fell on November 29, and Christmas.","1439":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc\u2019s planned second headquarters in northern Virginia cleared a key test on Saturday when local officials approved a proposed financial package worth an estimated $51 million amid a small but vocal opposition.  People move about in front of the rostrum before a news conference about the announcement that Crystal City has been selected as home to Amazon's new headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., November 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque  Amazon in November picked National Landing, a site jointly owned by Arlington County and the city of Alexandria, just outside Washington, along with New York City for its so-called HQ2 or second headquarters. That followed a year-long search in which hundreds of municipalities, ranging from Newark, New Jersey, to Indianapolis, competed for the coveted tax-dollars and high-wage jobs the project promises.  Amazon in February abruptly scrapped plans to build part of its second headquarters in the New York borough of Queens after opposition from local leaders angered by incentives promised by state and city politicians.  The five-member Arlington County Board voted 5-0 in favor of Amazon receiving the financial package after a seven-hour meeting held in a room filled with up to about 150 citizens and representatives from local unions and minority advocacy groups.  There was strong opposition from some residents and labor groups, many of whom chanted \u201cshame\u201d and waved signs with slogans including \u201cDon\u2019t be the opposite of Robinhood,\u201d \u201cAmazon overworks and underpays,\u201d and \u201cAdvocate for us and not Amazon.\u201d One protester was escorted out of the meeting by police.  A few dozen protesters outside the county office chanted, \u201cThe people united will never be defeated.\u201d  Danny Candejas, an organizer for the coalition \u201cFor Us, Not Amazon,\u201d which opposes the company\u2019s move into the area, said: \u201cWe are fighting to make sure people who live here are not priced out by wealthy people.\u201d  Some supporters in the meeting held up signs saying \u2018vote yes\u2019 and \u2018Amazon is prime for Arlington\u2019.  One hundred and twelve people were registered to speak, an unusually high number for a local county meeting, forcing board chair Christian Dorsey to cut the talking minutes to two minutes, from three, for every regular speaker, and to four minutes, from five, for representatives of organizations.  Many speakers who were opposed to the Amazon headquarters especially opposed direct incentives, citing rising housing costs, the likely displacement of low-income families, accelerated wage theft for construction workers, and lack of investment guarantees in affordable housing funds.  \u201cSpeculators are already driving up home prices, landlords are raising rents and general contractors are raising their quotes for home improvement projects,\u201d said one resident, Hunter Tamarro.  Unions including the AFL-CIO objected to Amazon not signing a project labor agreement with wage and benefit safeguards for workers hired to construct the new buildings.  But supporters such as resident June O\u2019Connell said Amazon\u2019s presence would ensure Arlington is allocated state funds for investments in transportation and higher education. \u201cI want that money from the state,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cWithout Amazon, we wouldn\u2019t get a penny of it.\u201d  Holly Sullivan, Amazon\u2019s worldwide head of economic development, spoke briefly and said the company will invest approximately $2.5 billion, create more than 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000, which will generate more than $3.2 billion in tax revenue.  \u201cRegarding incentives, Amazon is only eligible for the financial incentive after we make our investments and occupy office space in the community,\u201d she said.  Dorsey, the board chair, had said before the vote that he expected the measure to pass. He said that rejecting Amazon would not solve the community\u2019s problems and concerns, and that this was the first deal the county has struck where new revenue growth will be used to fund it.  To be sure, the vote approved an estimated $51 million, a fraction of the $481 million promised by the county. Only 5 percent of the incentives are direct. Also, Amazon has been offered a $750 million package by the state that the Virginia General Assembly approved with little opposition.  The $51 million includes a controversial direct financial incentive or cash grant of $23 million to Amazon over 15 years, which will be collected from taxes on Arlington hotel rooms. The grant is contingent upon Amazon occupying six million square feet of office space over the first 16 years.  Arlington has also offered to invest about $28 million over 10 years of future property tax revenue in onsite infrastructure and open space at the headquarters site.  A filing on the county board\u2019s website says the $23 million grant and the $28 million in strategic public infrastructure investments were \u201cinstrumental in Amazon choosing Arlington for its headquarters.\u201d","1440":"FILE PHOTO: The new Amazon Fire TV is displayed during a media event introducing new Amazon products in San Francisco, California September 16, 2015.

It wants to know whether Amazon\u2019s dual role as both a marketplace hosting third-party merchants and as a powerful retailer in its own right on the same platform, often selling the same products, gives it an unfair competitive advantage.  The probe is examining two main areas: the standard agreements between Amazon and marketplace sellers, and the role of data in the selection of the winners of Amazon\u2019s so-called \u201cBuy Box\u201d, a prized button that drives four-fifths of sales.  The Commission believes Amazon may be in breach of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which prohibits agreements that prevent, restrict or distort competition within the EU single market, or Article 102, which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position.  Below is an explanation of the issues.  WHAT IS AMAZON\u2019S STANDARD AGREEMENT?  Amazon has a standard agreement with third-party retailers who use its platform to sell their products, which gives it wide-ranging access to those merchants\u2019 data, technology and product information.  The concern is that Amazon could use that information to hone its own competitive pricing strategy, gain information about consumers to make its own marketing more effective, and give its own goods an advantage in search results.  \u201cYou\u2019re controlling the whole interface while you\u2019re trying to compete within it,\u201d says Joseph Evans, senior research analyst at London-based media research firm Enders Analysis.  The Amazon standard agreement stipulates: \u201cYou grant us a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable right and licence to use, reproduce, perform, display (public communication), distribute, adapt, modify, re-format, create and exploit derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any manner, any and all of Your Materials\u201d - with some exclusions for trademarks.  \u201cMaterials\u201d are defined as \u201call Technology, Your Trademarks, Content, Your Product information, data, materials, and other items or information provided or made available by you or your affiliates to Amazon or its affiliates.\u201d  WHAT IS AMAZON\u2019S BUY BOX?  The Buy Box is the clickable box that appears on the right of a product-detail page on Amazon saying \u201cBuy now\u201d or \u201cAdd to basket\u201d. It is estimated that more than four in five of all Amazon sales happen through this box.  Every product has just one Buy Box, for which multiple sellers offering the same product, including Amazon, must compete. It may rotate between sellers. Sellers without the box appear far less prominently.  Amazon, which does not disclose what share of the Buy Box it wins, says this competition is aimed at providing the best customer experience.  It uses a proprietary algorithm to determine the winner using criteria including price and customer reviews.  Some merchants fear this can be manipulated to show biased results, echoing a previous EU case in which Google was found to have given illegal advantage in search results to its own comparison shopping service.  Advisers to Amazon merchants say fulfilment, including ability to fulfil Amazon\u2019s super-fast Prime delivery service, is an increasingly important factor in winning the Buy Box.

Trump has repeatedly attacked Amazon on Twitter for treating the Postal Service as its \u201cdelivery boy\u201d by paying less than it should for deliveries and contributing to the service\u2019s $65 billion loss since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, without presenting evidence.  The president ordered a task force in April to study the Postal Service, an independent establishment of the executive branch of the U.S. government, looking at its financial health and what it charges customers such as Amazon for package deliveries, in a report due Aug. 10.  However, the White House has decided it will not yet release the report, forcing the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to postpone a hearing on postal reform that was planned for Sept. 5, the sources said. One said the hearing was postponed \u201cindefinitely.\u201d  That means any legislation that raised the Postal Service\u2019s rates on Amazon and other shippers has been kicked further into the future.  The task force briefed the president on its preliminary findings and recommendations earlier this month, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which is in charge of the task force, told Reuters.  \u201cThe task force will continue our work to identify solutions to strengthen the USPS business model driving toward a public report before the end of the year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is clear that the governance of USPS must be fixed and we encourage Congress to take actions towards that goal.\u201d  The rates the Postal Service charges Amazon and other bulk customers are not made public. Federal regulators that review contracts made by the service have not raised any issues with the terms of its deal with Amazon.  Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon have gone hand-in-hand with attacks on its founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who privately owns the Washington Post, which has published several articles critical of Trump\u2019s campaign and presidency.  Trump has described the newspaper as Amazon\u2019s \u201cchief lobbyist.\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s top editor has said Bezos has no involvement in its news coverage.  The president's tweets attacking Amazon temporarily knocked down its stock earlier this year on fears that government action prompted by Trump might hurt the company's profits. The shares have since recovered and Amazon is on track to become only the second U.S. publicly traded company with a stock market value of more than $1 trillion, alongside Apple Inc AAPL.O.  Amazon did not return a request for comment.  The retailer and cloud-computing firm is only one of several that have attracted Trump's ire. He attacked Boeing Co BA.N over a previous Air Force One deal. Earlier this week, he accused Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O subsidiary Google's search engine of promoting negative news articles and hiding \u201cfair media\u201d coverage of him, without presenting evidence.","1446":"April 17 (Reuters) - KBS Fashion Group Ltd:  * KBS FASHION GROUP LIMITED ANNOUNCES SIGNING OF COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT TO OPEN AMAZON AND ALIBABA EXPRESS ONLINE STORES  * KBS FASHION GROUP LTD - ONLINE STORES ARE EXPECTED TO BE LAUNCHED IN JUNE OF 2018  * KBS FASHION GROUP - CHINA-BASED UNIT, HONGRI (FUJIAN) SPORTS GOODS CO.

Wall Street\u2019s optimism about last year\u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple\u2019s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been closing the gap.  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Most Wall Street analysts are not quite that enthusiastic. Analysts on average expect Apple\u2019s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Analysts covering Amazon on average expect its stock to rise 10 percent within the next year to reach $1,700, which would give it a market value of $823 billion.

Shares rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trade. The report was a relief to investors in the U.S. technology sector, still reeling from a profit warning by Facebook Inc FB.O Wednesday that plunged its stock 19 percent.  Amazon\u2019s report shows how the world\u2019s largest online retailer has increasingly learned to compensate for the high costs of fast package delivery and video streaming by controlling expenses and building up higher-profit businesses. It was the first mover in the business of selling data storage and computing power in the cloud, a bet that continues to reap rewards and give it the leeway to invest in grand projects.  For instance, the company is working to ship food from Whole Foods Market stores across the United States, in an ambitious attempt to bring groceries into the age of online retail.  Amazon\u2019s spending typically climbs in the summer quarter, pressuring profits as the company prepares for Christmas and the winter holidays, its peak sales period each year.  Yet the company said it expects an operating profit between $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion, up from $347 million a year earlier. The company also reported a second-quarter profit of $2.5 billion, its largest ever.  \u201cA big contributor to the quarter and the last few quarters obviously has been strong growth in our highest profitability businesses and also advertising,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said on a call with media. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a greater-than-expected efficiency in a lot of our spend in things like warehouses, data centers, marketing.\u201d  The Seattle-based company cut hundreds of consumer jobs in its headquarters earlier this year, in a move that may have lowered costs and freed up resources for fast-growing areas like Amazon\u2019s voice aide Alexa.  Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter called the expansion in the company\u2019s gross profit margin \u201cremarkable,\u201d citing impressive results from cloud sales and services to third-party merchants on Amazon.  \u201cThat drove the bulk of the earnings beat,\u201d he said.  CFO Olsavsky noted that third-party sales were changing the profit equation for Amazon, too. The company for years was notorious for roller-coaster results.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City,U.S., January 29, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  More lucrative than sales of goods that Amazon owns, third-party transactions offer the company a commission that increases significantly when merchants choose to hand over fulfillment and advertising to Amazon, as many do. Half of all units sold through Amazon are from these sellers, and these sales keep growing.  ANGLING FOR ADVERTISERS  Highly profitable ad sales were a bright spot last quarter. The company said revenue from the category and some other items grew 132 percent to $2.2 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company is working to automate tasks for advertisers and to help media buyers measure the results, Olsavsky said.  Key to its allure has been that advertisers' placements result directly in sales, reaching customers on Amazon with an intent to shop. That contrasts with ads reaching users who are on industry leaders Facebook and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google for a range of purposes.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company\u2019s must lucrative unit, saw its operating profit margin expand from a year earlier. Sales picked up speed from the year prior, too, rising 49 percent to $6.1 billion and beating the average estimate of $6 billion.  The unit\u2019s success has helped make Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the richest person in the world.  \u201cIt\u2019s really becoming the crown jewel of Bezos\u2019 empire,\u201d said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives. \u201cThey\u2019ve invested significant dollars in building out the infrastructure, sales force and AWS partner ecosystem worldwide that I think now is starting to pay just massive dividends.\u201d  While cloud rivals are gaining ground, AWS remains far in front with 31 percent of the fast-expanding market, versus 18 percent for Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and 8 percent for Google in the second quarter, research firm Canalys said Thursday. Amazon shares, up 55 percent this year versus 6 percent for the S&P 500 .SPX as of Thursday's close, trade at a premium, too. The stock's price-to-earnings ratio is more than 10 times that of Microsoft. Cloud and ad sales, along with a July event that Amazon created to drum up revenue during the summer shopping lulls, are helping the company overcome high costs in the third quarter.  During the event, called Prime Day, Amazon sold more than 100 million products and signed up more people to its Prime loyalty club than on any other previous day in its history.  Prime members spend above average on Amazon. The company said it now expects third-quarter sales of between $54 billion and $57.5 billion, up from $43.7 billion a year earlier.  Hiking the annual U.S. price of Prime 20 percent in the second quarter appeared to have few negative consequences: Amazon said subscription revenue increased 57 percent to $3.4 billion.  Total net sales for the second quarter rose 39 percent to $52.9 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $53.4 billion.","1451":"Customers shop at a Whole Foods store in New York City, U.S., August 28, 2017.

Telia pledged to offer rivals fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to its free-to-air and basic pay TV channels, as well as to premium pay TV sports channels in Sweden and Finland, the EU competition enforcer said.  The company also agreed not to discriminate against rival telecom providers and TV distributors in the sale of TV advertising space on the merged entity\u2019s channels.  In addition, users will get access to the merged company\u2019s streaming services over the internet, namely its AVOD and SVOD services. The pledges are valid for 10 years.  Citi analysts said Bonnier\u2019s traditional linear viewing model - where programs are viewed at set times - was under pressure from the rise of video-on-demand services.  \u201cTelia, itself, is in need to return the business to underlying growth. Given the investments required, dividend risk remains to the downside in our view,\u201d they said in a research note.  Telia, which expects the transaction to close on Dec. 2, said it still expected synergies from the deal from 2020, with a full run-rate of 600 million Swedish crowns ($61.8 million) in 2022.  It also expects integration costs of 400 million crowns in 2020-2021, and an impact on operational free cash flow in 2020 of around 500 million.  The deal is politically sensitive since the Swedish government - owner of 38.35% of Telia\u2019s shares - already controls Sweden\u2019s public service television network SVT.  Bonnier\u2019s brands include Sweden\u2019s biggest commercial broadcaster TV4, streaming service C More and Finland\u2019s MTV.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Future Retail - one of country\u2019s top retailers - has been locked in a bitter dispute with Amazon over its $3.4 billion retail assets deal with Reliance Industries. Amazon is a business partner of Future and argues the Indian firm\u2019s asset sale breached some of their pre-existing agreements.  Amazon had complained to stock exchanges, accusing Future of misleading public by making incorrect market disclosures, allegations the Indian group denies.  The complaint came after Amazon on Oct. 25 won an injunction from an arbitrator to halt the Future-Reliance deal.  Previously unreported e-mails exchanged between the NSE and Future show the stock exchange repeatedly requested the company submit more details of the arbitration order, seeking details of possible impact on financials, lenders and the Reliance deal.  On Oct. 27, NSE asked Future why it had not disclosed the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and not shared the impact of the order. Future in response said it believed a disclosure wasn\u2019t required.  NSE\u2019s listing compliance division rejected that argument. It demanded a series of disclosures be made within hours, \u201cfailing which appropriate actions may be initiated\u201d, the emails showed.  Future Retail\u2019s Company Secretary, Virendra Samani, answered most of NSE\u2019s queries in a late night e-mail on Oct. 30, saying it was doing so \u201cin the best interest of all stakeholders\u201d, the communications showed.  Many of those responses were made public on directions of the NSE two days later in a six-page exchange filing by Future.  Before that, Future had only submitted a disclosure on Oct. 26 in which it attached a media release saying it would ensure its deal with Reliance proceeded unhindered and that it was reviewing the arbitration order.  The NSE and Future Retail did not respond to requests for comment.  The legal dispute has now reached the Delhi High Court, where Future Retail has urged the court to stop Amazon from writing letters to regulators to block its Reliance deal, which is pending approvals from the market regulator and stock exchanges. The judge is expected to rule on the plea in the coming days.  Amazon had separately asked India\u2019s market regulator to investigate Future for insider trading, saying it disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of the arbitration order before its exchange filing in late October.  Future has said its communications with Reliance, which is led by Asia\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani, were for a \u201clegitimate purpose\u201d.  NSE in e-mails at least twice asked Future Retail to provide a copy of the arbitration order to vet the disclosures, and also why it should not be disclosed as material price-sensitive information, emails between Oct. 27 and Oct. 30 showed.  Future\u2019s Samani at first declined the request, stating in an e-mail that the order was \u201cconfidential in nature\u201d and sharing further information could be \u201cdeterimental\u201d to the company.

Amazon has regularly beaten Wall Street\u2019s quarterly operating income estimates by around 50%, the analysts said.  Amazon remains the go-to site for online shoppers, but challenges are mounting. Novel coronavirus infections are raging in the United States, a market that accounts for about 70% of its retail business, and a $600 weekly pandemic unemployment payment could expire and crimp consumer\u2019s spending.  Amazon increased investment after the pandemic-fueled spike in online shopping caused disruptions ranging from unavailable merchandise to long wait times - sending shoppers into the arms of rivals Walmart Inc and Target Corp.  When Jefferies surveyed more than 500 consumers in late April, 69% of respondents said they were experiencing delays or out of stock issues on Amazon. Among them, 62% said they were buying more from other online sellers - primarily Walmart and Target. And, 28% of the shoppers who increased purchases from other sites said they planned to continue doing so after the health crisis ends.  Betting against Amazon has been risky in the past, said Morningstar consumer analyst RJ Hottovy. \u201cWe believe the market has moved back to a \u2018growth-over-profitability\u2019 mindset,\u201d he said.

I want a government that\u2019s here to work for the people.\u201d  Amazon abruptly scrapped plans in February to build a major outpost in the neighborhood that could have created 25,000 jobs, blaming opposition from local leaders.  In an event held not far from the proposed Amazon site, Warren said that big tech companies come into towns, cities and states and \u201cbully everyone into doing what they want\u201d and \u201croll right over\u201d small businesses and startups that are a threat.  \u201cGiants are not allowed to buy out the competition. The competition needs the opportunity to thrive and grow,\u201d she said.  Some of those in attendance said they didn\u2019t know enough about Warren\u2019s proposal to back it fully but they trusted her policy expertise.  \u201cWhat I like is that she\u2019s proposing big ideas. I think that\u2019s important,\u201d said lawyer Kate Aufses, 32, who said she was undecided about which Democratic candidate she would support.  Earlier in the day, Warren said in a post here on Medium that she would nominate regulators to unwind acquisitions such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's purchases of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Shares of Facebook Inc FB.O closed up 0.3 percent on Friday, while Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O fell 0.08 percent and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O lost 0.3 percent.  Warren also proposed legislation that would require tech companies like Google and Amazon that offer an online marketplace or exchange to refrain from competing on their own platform. This would, for example, forbid Amazon from selling on its Amazon Marketplace platform.  Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined comment.  It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal. The most famous case in recent memory is the government\u2019s effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.  \u201cAN ARCHAIC IDEA\u201d  U.S. Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies and their role in displacing or swallowing up existing businesses, among other things.  Amazon\u2019s business model has displaced brick-and-mortar stores and the company has been criticized for poorly paying its warehouse workers.  Facebook has angered lawmakers for losing track of users\u2019 data and for not doing more to stop foreign meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Google has clashed with smaller companies, like Yelp, over search placements and has raised concerns it would comply with China\u2019s internet censorship and surveillance policies if it re-enters the Asian nation\u2019s search engine market.  NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group whose members include Facebook and Google, said Warren\u2019s plan would lead to higher prices.  \u201cSenator Warren is wrong in her assertion that tech markets lack competition. Never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services and opportunities online,\u201d said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice.  In Washington, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, said breaking up the big tech companies would \u201ctake us back to the Stone Age.\u201d  \u201cThis is not a vision for the future, but an archaic idea that should be dumped in your computer trash can,\u201d he said.  Public Knowledge, a tech policy group, called Warren\u2019s plan a step toward protecting the next generation of businesses, but stopped short of full-throated support for breaking up the tech giants.  Tim Wu, a professor of law, science and technology at Columbia Law School who coined the term \u201cnet neutrality\u201d and has warned against an economy dominated by a few giant firms, said in a tweet that it was \u201cheartening\u201d to see the idea of breaking up the tech giants gaining some traction.  Tech companies are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $12.62 million, according to their filings to U.S. Congress.  Angering a deep-pocketed industry could hurt Democrats, but that is not likely to be a big concern for Warren, who made her political mark and plenty of enemies by going after big banks after the 2007-09 financial crisis. In the Senate, Warren continues to be an outspoken critic of Wall Street and is a leader of her party\u2019s progressive wing.  Other Democratic candidates have also weighed in on the issue.  Senator Amy Klobuchar used her campaign launch speech to vow action on digital issues like privacy, saying \u201cbig tech companies\u201d misuse personal data.  Senator Bernie Sanders in 2018 even named a bill after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the Stop BEZOS Act, which would tax big companies if their employees receive public benefits.","1475":"(Reuters) - Amazon AMZN.O Chief Executive Jeff Bezos topped Forbes' list of richest Americans for the third year in a row, while U.S. President Donald Trump's ranking dropped as the coronavirus pandemic slammed his office buildings, hotels and resorts, the magazine said Tuesday.  The aggregate wealth of the Forbes 400 list rose to a record $3.2 trillion, as the richest Americans continued to do well even though the pandemic has devastated the economy, which is short about 11 million jobs compared to where it was in February.  Eric Yuan, chief executive officer of Zoom Video Communications, which has become ubiquitous in the work-from-home era, was one of 18 newcomers on the list with a net worth of $11 billion.  Trump\u2019s ranking dropped to No. 352 from 275 last year and his net worth fell to $2.5 billion from $3.1 billion, as office buildings, hotels and resorts, have suffered during the pandemic. His business, the Trump Organization, owns property in all three categories.  Trump has long refused to release his tax records, and has been locked in a battle with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who subpoenaed Trump for eight years of personal and corporate returns.  The annual list can serve as a way to track the wealthiest people in the country who hold the most power, said Kerry Dolan, assistant managing editor of wealth at Forbes, in an interview with Reuters TV.  \u201cAs a society, we all should know who is behind the biggest companies and what they\u2019re doing with their money,\u201d she said.

But the joint venture faced hurdles last year when its Chief Executive Officer Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and author, stepped down to take the role of chairman.

Haven said on Monday the three companies would in the future collaborate informally to design programs tailored to address the specific needs of their own employees.  CNBC, which first reported the company was winding down, said many projects designed by Haven were executed separately by the three companies, eliminating the need for a joint venture.  Despite a premature end to Haven, Amazon\u2019s ambition to disrupt healthcare remains, Evercore ISI analysts said in a client note.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon.com Inc is seen in Sao Paulo, Brazil October 17, 2017. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker\/File Photo  The talks with Azul, which serves over 50 percent more Brazilian airports than its nearest rival, are the strongest signal yet that Amazon is lining up distribution to sell products directly to consumers throughout the country.  It also shows that the U.S. e-commerce company is serious about overcoming the nation\u2019s notorious logistical challenges, including shoddy roads, security problems and a national territory greater than the continental United States.  Representatives for Azul declined to comment on the talks.  Amazon said it did not comment on \u201crumors or speculation.\u201d  The Seattle-based online retailer has so far waded slowly into Brazil\u2019s highly competitive e-commerce market, starting with e-book sales in 2012, adding physical books two years later and offering third-party sales of electronics in October.  E-commerce accounts for around 5 percent of Brazil\u2019s roughly $300 billion retail market, about half its share in the United States. Yet Brazil\u2019s online sales have doubled in four years and are expected to grow at a double-digit pace in coming years.  Currently, Amazon relies on third-party vendors to ship their own goods sold on its Brazilian website, but that appears to be changing.  In February, Reuters reported that Amazon was looking to lease a 50,000-square-meter warehouse just outside Sao Paulo, in a sign the retailer may bring storage and distribution in-house.  In March, Reuters reported that the company met with an array of manufacturers in Sao Paulo to discuss plans to stock and sell products directly.  Both developments drove down shares in Brazilian e-commerce competitors, such as Magazine Luiza SA MGLU3.SA and B2W Companhia Digital SA BTOW3.SA. MercadoLibre Inc MELI.O has also fought Amazon tooth-and-nail in Mexico and Brazil.  By partnering with Azul, Amazon would immediately gain access to a network of more than 100 airports in Brazil, implying its ambitions go far beyond metropolitan Sao Paulo.  Azul has built up an 18 percent share of Brazil\u2019s domestic air travel market over the past decade by flying regional jets and turboprop planes into second- and third-tier cities underserved by other carriers.  Azul\u2019s cargo unit, Azul Cargo Express, takes advantage of excess cargo capacity in its passenger flights to offer rapid delivery to locations ranging from far-flung Amazonian outposts to Brazil\u2019s major metropolitan centers.  The company offers shipping to more than 3,200 municipalities, as well as a specialized e-commerce service known as Azul Cargo E-Commerce. Azul\u2019s hub, Viracopos International Airport, is about a 45-minute drive from the warehouse Amazon has been eyeing northwest of Sao Paulo.  The sources, who requested anonymity as the negotiations are confidential, did not specify how advanced conversations were, nor did they say if the retailer has also engaged Azul\u2019s rivals.  Competing airlines with Brazilian cargo operations include Latam Airlines Group SA LTM.SN and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA GOLL4.SA. Neither responded immediately to requests for comment.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Trump has talked about using antitrust law to \u201cgo after\u201d the company because he is worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business by Amazon, Axios reported, citing five sources it said had discussed the issue with him.  Trump also wants to change Amazon\u2019s tax treatment, the Axios report said, an issue the president raised publicly last year when he called for an internet tax for online retailers, even though Amazon already collects sales tax on items it sells direct to customers.  \u201cThe president has said many times before he\u2019s always looking to create a level playing field for all businesses and this is no different,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, when asked about the Axios report. \u201cHe\u2019s always going to look at different ways, but there aren\u2019t any specific policies on the table at this time.\u201d  Trump has been complaining about Amazon in private, believing the company has become too powerful, another administration official confirmed to Reuters.  The official said Trump links this to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos\u2019 private ownership of the Washington Post, which he has called \u201cfake news\u201d for its critical coverage of his administration. Trump regards the newspaper as a mouthpiece for Bezos\u2019 business interests, calling it #AmazonWashingtonPost on Twitter.  Amazon did not reply to a request for comment on the Axios report.

The detail offers an early glimpse at how the store, known as Amazon Go, is faring two months after opening its doors to the public. Shopping frequency, sales and other metrics reviewed by Amazon will likely inform how it thinks about expanding the concept elsewhere in the United States, if at all.  Amazon Go is fashioned after small grocery stores, with a crucial difference: it has no cashiers. Customers scan a smartphone app to enter the store, and then cameras and sensors track what they remove from the shelves and what they put back.  Amazon then bills shoppers\u2019 credit cards on file after they leave.  Puerini said store associates spend the vast majority of their time restocking shelves - another indication of the shop\u2019s popularity.  Research-focused venture capital firm Loup Ventures wrote of Amazon Go last month: \u201cOur experience was flawless, leaving us increasingly confident that Amazon is best positioned to own the operating system of automated retail. Eventually, we expect Amazon to make this technology available to other retailers.\u201d  The world\u2019s biggest online retailer first announced a test of Amazon Go in December 2016, in a challenge to brick-and-mortar rivals that are working to keep their own stores up to date.  However, old practices die hard.  \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t necessarily expect is how many people would stop at the end, on their first trip or two, and ask, \u2018Is it really OK if I just leave?\u2019,\u201d Puerini said.  She declined to discuss specific expansion plans and said there were no plans to add the technology to Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain Amazon bought last year. Analysts have speculated otherwise.  In any case, Amazon is still researching how to improve technology at the store.  \u201cIf you show a child a can of Coke, you have to show it to them maybe once or twice, and it\u2019s very easy for them to be able to recognize it,\u201d Amazon Vice President Dilip Kumar said in the same interview with Reuters. \u201cNot so much with computers.\u201d  The company is working to teach computers to recognize items or activities with as little information as possible - a problem that some of Amazon\u2019s thousands of experts are addressing, Kumar said.

REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  Scott Anderson, director of Amazon Robotics Fulfillment, said technology is at least 10 years away from fully automating the processing of a single order picked by a worker inside a warehouse.  There is a misperception that Amazon will run fully automated warehouses soon, Anderson said during a tour of Amazon\u2019s Baltimore warehouse for reporters on Tuesday.  The technology for a robot to pick a single product from a bin without damaging other products or picking multiple products at the same time in a way that could benefit the e-commerce retailer is years away.  Amazon is exploring a variety of technologies to automate the various steps needed to get a package to shoppers, Anderson said.  \u201cIn the current form, the technology is very limited. The technology is very far from the fully automated workstation that we would need,\u201d Anderson said.  The tour came at a time when the company has come under fire from labor groups and other Amazon critics for allegedly poor working conditions in its warehouses and for increasingly automating jobs and reducing its dependence on human labor.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The largest online retailer is also not employing robots in its warehouses that handle fresh food, said Derek Jones, global director of environment, health and safety, who oversees Amazon\u2019s fresh food offerings like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Pantry.  \u201cJust imagine if you want bananas. I want my bananas to be firm, others like their bananas to be ripe. How do you get a robot to choose that?\u201d he said.  Amazon runs 110 warehouses in the United States, 45 sorting centers and about 50 delivery stations. It employs 125,000 full-time warehouse workers in the country.  The warehouses that employ robots mostly handle general merchandise, which includes everything from lamps and clothing to kayaks and bikes.  The company said it is not changing the level of productivity at its warehouses to catch up with its recent one-day shipping announcement. It is instead making changes to the transportation and delivery process.  Last month, Amazon said it plans to deliver packages to members of its loyalty club, Prime, in just one day instead of two.  Anderson said Amazon\u2019s current target is four hours from the time a product is ordered to the time it leaves the warehouse, and the company is sticking with that.  The e-commerce company did not share details on how the decision to raise its minimum wage to $15 had impacted workforce turnover.  However, it said applications for seasonal jobs doubled to 850,000 at the end of October last year from the record number of applications the company received in August 2017, when it held a national job fair.  Amazon raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour for U.S. employees in November, giving in to critics of what they said was poor pay and working conditions.","1486":"Dec 13 (Reuters) - Instacart said on Thursday it would start winding down its delivery services for Whole Foods Market, ending a partnership that has been under stress since last year when Amazon.com Inc acquired the grocer.

Chinnappa\/File Photo  #BoycottAmazon was one of the top trending topics on Twitter in India, with users sharing screenshots of Amazon listings of doormats and underwear emblazoned with insignia including the elephant god Ganesha and other symbols, which Hindus consider sacred.  \u201cWe are taking down the products in question,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cAll sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.\u201d  To be sure, several of the product listings on Amazon\u2019s websites are controlled by sellers and not directly by the company.  But episodes such as this threaten to disrupt business and sour public sentiment in India for global firms such as Amazon.  In 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government` threatened to rescind visas of Amazon\u2019s employees in the country if it did not stop the sale of doormats resembling India\u2019s tri-colour flag on its Canadian website.  The retail giant enraged Indian customers again in 2019 after toilet seat covers and other items emblazoned with images of Hindu gods were spotted on its U.S. website.  On both those occasions, it took down the product listings.  \u201cDear Indians, if your religious feeling have been hurt, register a complaint with cyber police or with local police station,\u201d Gaurav Goel, a spokesman for India\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party tweeted on Tuesday.

The deal is for new installations of the Amazon Assistant, a comparison-shopping tool that customers can add to their web browsers. It fetches Amazon\u2019s price for products that users see on Walmart.com, Target.com and elsewhere.  In order to work, the assistant needs access to users\u2019 web activity, including the links and some page content they view. The catch, as Amazon explains in the fine print, is the company can use this data to improve its general marketing, products and services, unrelated to the shopping assistant.  The terms underscore the power consumers routinely give to Amazon and other big technology companies when using their free services. In this case, Amazon gains potential insight into how it should tailor marketing and how it could stamp out the retail competition.  \u201cThis data is often used for training machine learning models to do better ad targeting,\u201d said Bennett Cyphers, a technologist at the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cBut in the U.S., there aren\u2019t really restrictions on what you can do with this kind of data.\u201d  Amazon already has more than 7 million customers using its assistant via Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, according to data published by those web browsers. Other companies offer similar shopping tools.  While another technology known as tracking pixels shows Amazon information from visitors to roughly 15 percent of the top 10,000 websites, the assistant lets Amazon follow a smaller set of users from page to page, Cyphers said.  Amazon\u2019s combination of tools still pales in comparison to data collection by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which has tracking pixels on most web pages.  Amazon did not discuss how it uses the data it gathers via the assistant for any unrelated purposes, but a job listing for an affiliated team known as Browser Integration Technologies says the group\u2019s influence \u201cspans across advertising and marketing, pricing and selection.\u201d  \u201cCustomer trust is paramount to Amazon, and we take customer privacy very seriously,\u201d a company spokeswoman said, noting compliance with the assistant\u2019s privacy policy, which says data collection is for websites that users visit \u201cwhere we may have relevant product or service recommendations.\u201d  The policy also notes that customers can disable certain features of the assistant, and that Amazon only links browsing data to an individual\u2019s account when the assistant is in active use.  U.S. lawmakers have recently increased their scrutiny of Silicon Valley\u2019s data collection practices. A bill introduced in the Senate last month proposed requiring that big platforms disclose what information they gather from users and how much that is worth.  \u201cWhen a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold. These \u2018free\u2019 products track everything we do,\u201d said Republican Senator Josh Hawley in a statement announcing the bill.  Amazon\u2019s Prime Day promotion offers a window into what it will pay for browsing data. For Prime Day 2018, it offered $5 off to new Amazon Assistant users who spent at least $25. This year it offered $10 off to those spending at least $50.  Amazon is also fine paying nothing for the data: New customers only get the $10 credit if they install the assistant from a particular landing page, if they are Prime members, and if they make their purchase via the assistant by Aug. 2.","1491":"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N is in talks to buy a stake of more than 40 percent in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, a direct challenge to Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in Asia's third-largest economy, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.  In what would be one of its biggest overseas deals, the U.S. retailer is looking at buying new and existing shares in Flipkart and due diligence is likely to begin as early as next week, the sources said. They declined to be named as the talks were private.  Terms under discussion were not immediately available, but Flipkart would be valued at more than the $12 billion figure given when Japan's SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T Vision Fund took roughly a fifth of the firm last year for $2.5 billion, they added.  A spokesman for Flipkart said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. An India-based representative for Walmart declined to comment.  A deal with Walmart would give Flipkart much-needed muscle in its fight against Amazon, which has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands aggressively, including into online grocery deliveries, which analysts tip as the next big battleground for the country\u2019s e-commerce sector.  Besides its own e-commerce site, Flipkart owns fashion portals Myntra and Jabong, and controls nearly 40 percent of India\u2019s online retail, ahead of Amazon, according to estimates by research firm Forrester. It is also looking into expanding into grocery deliveries.  \u201cWalmart\u2019s expertise in selling groceries and low-cost apparel could help Flipkart remain ahead in India\u2019s e-commerce market,\u201d said Satish Meena, senior analyst at Forrester.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  For Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart, a deal would open a new front in its efforts to take on Amazon, giving the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that Morgan Stanley has estimated will rapidly grow to be worth $200 billion in a decade.  It would be part of a huge e-commerce push that has seen Walmart acquire a slew of start-ups including paying roughly $3 billion for online retailer Jet.com. Last month it also said it was partnering with Japan's Rakuten Inc 4755.T in online grocery deliveries.  \u201cAs large as they are, Amazon has eaten away a significant chunk of their revenues and I think... they view India as the largest market possibly for this (taking on Amazon),\u201d one of the sources said.  Walmart has for years tried to enter India but has remained confined to a \u2018cash-and-carry\u2019 wholesale business amid tough restrictions on foreign investment. It currently operates 21 such stores in India.  Walmart's push into e-commerce comes as Amazon has embraced offline retail, with an affiliate of the Seattle-based company picking up a $27.6 million stake in Indian retailer Shopper's Stop Ltd SHOP.NS.  In the United States, Amazon also bought high-end grocer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year.  Former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 in India\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru.  Like Amazon\u2019s founder Jeff Bezos, they began by selling books, but have diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones such as China\u2019s Xiaomi and Motorola through exclusive flash sales, and now compete with Amazon on almost all product categories.  Flipkart's success has attracted a bevy of deep pocketed and tech-savvy investors including U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management, China's Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK, online marketplace eBay Inc EBAY.O and software giant Microsoft Corp MSFT.O.","1492":"FILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is seen during a visit at the Amazon fulfilment center in Bretigny-sur-Orge near Paris, France, October 22, 2019.

The lawsuit regards the Valentino Garavani Rockstud shoes and the fashion group will receive any proceeds from the case, the companies said in a statement.  Kaitlyn Pan did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  Amazon has long been rumoured to be readying a new luxury fashion site to rival Alibaba\u2019s Tmall Luxury Pavilion, but LVMH and other top luxury groups say the risk of counterfeiting is high on such platforms.  Amazon said it had shut down Kaitlyn Pan\u2019s seller account on its platform in September 2019.  \u201cDespite multiple notices of infringement and a cease and desist order, Kaitlyn Pan continues to import, distribute, sell, and offer infringing products on kaitlynpanshoes.com,\u201d the companies said.

The company was likely not surprised when Trump criticized it via a post on Twitter on Thursday; he has slammed it in a similar manner previously. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s decision to purchase The Washington Post has also stoked Trump\u2019s ire.  Still, Amazon doesn\u2019t appear to be left out of the White House since Trump took office; an official from its Washington, D.C. office participated in an event hosted last week by First Lady Melania Trump to discuss cyber safety and technology.  Disclosures from Amazon indicate they have lobbied the White House on several topics, including immigration, cyber security and drones.  Keeping a cadre of lobbyists has become routine for large companies that risk having their entire business upset by possible congressional or regulatory action.  Amazon employs about 15 lobbyists, according to disclosures submitted to the U.S. Senate. Additionally, the company works with about 15 outside lobbying firms who each assign more lobbyists to work on behalf of the company.  Amazon has wide exposure to various parts of the government capable of regulating their business operations - from federal aviation rules affecting drones to oversight of anti-trust.  The largest online retailer, Amazon is also working aggressively to obtain government contracts to provide services to federal agencies to save data online for them, known as cloud services. Currently, Amazon has a $600 million contract to host data for the Central Intelligence Agency.  The e-commerce giant spent $15.4 million in 2017, up from $12 million a year earlier, on lobbying in Washington.  The company\u2019s lobbying effort more than doubled in 2015 compared with prior years, spending $10.5 million.  Amazon also maintains a corporate political action committee (PAC), a fund that allows the company to collect political donations from employees and then give donations to lawmakers and other politicians running for office.  By the end of February, Amazon\u2019s PAC had $1.1 million in cash. The committee spent more than $718,000 in 2017 and the first two months of 2018.  The cash spent by Amazon was divided between Republicans and Democrats. For example, in 2017 the PAC gave both the Democratic and Republican congressional committees $15,000.

Scheduled to begin on Monday\u2019s night shift and finish at the end of Tuesday\u2019s late shift, the strike follows on from a three-day walkout between Thursday and Saturday last week in which more than 500 workers took part, Verdi said..  Verdi has been organising strikes at Amazon in Germany - the company\u2019s biggest market after the United States - since 2013, along with other unions hoping to force the e-commerce company to recognise collective bargaining agreements that apply to retail employees at other firms.  An Amazon spokesman said last month that the company offered \u201cexcellent\u201d salaries, with benefits and working conditions comparable with other major employers.  The U.S. retail giant has seen sales soar globally as restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus sent consumers online, making it difficult for some bricks-and-mortar shops to compete.  Verdi argues this has strengthened the case for higher wages, adding workers were not sufficiently protected against the spread of the coronavirus.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person, also said on Saturday, \u201cMy own time and thinking is now wholly focused on COVID-19 and on how Amazon can best play its role,\u201d according to a message posted on a company website.  Hourly workers at Amazon\u2019s U.S. warehouses will receive double pay after 40 hours for overtime, up from the 1.5-times rate, from March 15 through May 9, the rate increase announcement said.  This is the second time the e-commerce giant announced an increase in pay for its workers in a week. On Monday, Amazon hiked the minimum hourly rate for associates to $17 from $15 and announced plans to hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States as the virus outbreak boosts online orders.  As the virus spreads across the U.S., Amazon has offered unlimited unpaid time off to encourage employees to stay home if they do not feel well. It has also staggered workers shifts and prohibited employees from sitting next to each other in the lunchroom to limit contact.  But four Democratic U.S. senators, including Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders on Friday expressed concern in a letter to Bezos that Amazon has not taken enough measures to protect its warehouse staff. They specifically asked if the company would provide \u201ctime-and-a-half\u201d hazard pay for its workers.  In response to Saturday\u2019s wage news, one of the letter\u2019s signatories, Senator Robert Menendez said he applauded the decision but that Amazon still had work to do to protect employees.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Bezos said in Saturday\u2019s online post that Amazon has ordered \u201cmillions\u201d of face masks for its on-site staff, but few have been filled because the masks are in low supply and are first going to hospitals at governments\u2019 directions.  \u201cWhen our turn for masks comes, our first priority will be getting them in the hands of our employees and partners working to get essential products to people,\u201d he said.  Amazon on Thursday reported its first warehouse employee in the United States tested positive for the virus, forcing the company to temporarily shutter the facility in New York.  As the virus spreads across the United States, several clothing retailers and department-store chains have shut stores, and cafe and restaurant operators have closed down or limited services to delivery and take-away.  Online retailers and grocery stores are trying to capture rising demand as more Americans are ordered to stay at home to reduce the spread of the outbreak.  Rival retailer Walmart Inc said on Thursday it plans to hire 150,000 hourly associates in the U.S. and announced $550 million in cash bonuses to reward workers.  The highly contagious coronavirus has infected more than 274,800 people across the world and led to more than 11,300 deaths globally, forcing governments across the world to issue mass lockdowns of people in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.","1500":"(Reuters) - Shares of a number of specialized beauty retailers fell on Monday after Amazon.com Inc said it had started selling beauty products used by licensed stylists, barbers and beauticians.

Amazon said it would have to relegate all new online grocery customers to a wait list starting Monday while working on adding capacity each week.  In recent weeks, it increased the number of Whole Foods stores offering grocery pickup to more than 150 locations, up from 80 previously.  Amazon also plans to shorten some Whole Foods stores\u2019 hours for the public so its employees can more quickly fulfill online grocery orders, the company said.  The moves illustrates how the world\u2019s largest online retailer, which showed its ambition to enter the grocery industry by acquiring Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017, is now leveraging its presence both online and in physical stores to handle high demand from consumers who are stuck eating at home, with many restaurant dining rooms closed to the public.  Amazon offers grocery delivery services Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime Now from its own warehouses and Whole Foods stores. It typically touts ultra-fast delivery within hours, with shoppers able to choose a delivery window. Last month, Amazon temporarily suspended the Prime Pantry delivery service, which sells non-perishable groceries.  Amazon said its online grocery order capacity has increased by more than 60% during the outbreak. Some netizens who said they used Amazon Prime, its $119-a-year subscription service for U.S. shoppers, have nevertheless complained on social media about the scarcity of delivery windows.  The company said it is hiring more workers to expand capacity and that it plans to launch a new feature that will help customers secure a virtual \u201cplace in line\u201d to distribute the delivery windows on a first come, first served basis. It also offered higher pay to encourage its warehouse workers to work for its grocery delivery service.  Currently, Amazon runs 487 Whole Foods stores in the United States. These stores have been limiting the number of customers allowed at once, and Amazon has said it conducts daily employee temperature checks and sends masks and gloves to protect workers.  The first store of Amazon\u2019s much-anticipated new grocery chain, which is scheduled to open this year in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, has been temporarily transitioned into a warehouse for online orders, the company said.

(Reuters) - One of Walmart Inc\u2019s best chances at taking on Amazon.com Inc in e-commerce lies with six giant server farms, each larger than ten football fields.  These facilities, which cost Walmart millions of dollars and took nearly five years to build, are starting to pay off. The retailer\u2019s online sales have been on a tear for the last three consecutive quarters, far outpacing wider industry growth levels.  Powering that rise are thousands of proprietary servers that enable the company to crunch almost limitless swathes of customer data in-house.  Most retailers rent the computing capacity they need to store and manage such information. But Walmart\u2019s decision to build its own internal cloud network shows its determination to grab a bigger slice of online shopping, in part by imitating Amazon\u2019s use of cloud-powered big data to drive digital sales.  The effort is helping Walmart to stay competitive with Amazon on pricing and to tightly control key functions such as inventory. And it is allowing the company to target shoppers with more customized offers and improved services, two top executives told Reuters in interviews at Walmart\u2019s San Bruno and Sunnyvale campuses in California.  \u201cIt has made a big difference to how fast we can grow our e-commerce business,\u201d said Tim Kimmet, head of cloud operations for Walmart.  He said Walmart, for example, is using cloud data to stock items frequently ordered by customers via voice shopping devices such as Google Home.  The network is helping the retailer improve its in-store operations as well. Using data gleaned from millions of transactions, the company sped up the process by which customers can return online purchases to their local stores by 60 percent. And Walmart can adjust prices at its physical locations almost instantly across entire regions.  \u201cWe are now able to execute change faster,\u201d Jeremy King, Walmart\u2019s chief technology officer, told Reuters. He added that Walmart can now make over 170,000 monthly changes to software that supports its website, compared to less than 100 changes previously.  Jae Evans (C), vice president, Global Technical Engineering and Operations, Walmart e-commerce, looks on as Walmart employees work at the company\u2019s network operations center in Sunnyvale, California, U.S. October 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Nandita Bose  To be sure, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer, holds just a 3.6 percent share of the U.S. e-commerce market compared to Amazon\u2019s 43.5 percent, according to digital research firm eMarketer.  Still, Walmart\u2019s cloud effort is significant at a time when U.S. retail is undergoing immense disruption, and data-based decision making has become more important than ever to understand how shoppers make purchases.  Walmart\u2019s online revenue climbed 50 percent year-over-year during the third quarter, helping it post its strongest-ever quarterly growth since 2009.  \u201cThe battle between Walmart and Amazon has been playing out on all fronts and the cloud is the latest frontier,\u201d said Kerry Liu, chief executive of Rubikloud Technologies, which offers artificial intelligence technology services to retailers.  EXCESS CAPACITY  The cloud initiative is but one of several steps Wal-Mart is taking to boost its e-commerce business. The company has expanded its online selection and acquired smaller e-commerce retailers. Walmart is offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more, and it recently asked vendors to supply it with merchandise priced at $10 and up to help it turn a profit online.  Walmart has stored information in smaller internal data centers for years. And it uses public cloud storage for non-critical data. Most retailers rent server capacity offered by companies such as Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Microsoft Corp and IBM.  (For a graphic on big players in the cloud market, see tmsnrt.rs\/2EYe9Ii)  But Walmart\u2019s decision to build a network that is not reliant on a single third-party cloud technology provider has transformed its ability to understand shoppers, who now move between store, desktop, mobile and app to make purchases. About 80 percent of Walmart\u2019s cloud network is now in-house.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said security was another big factor behind the effort, enabling the retailer to better protect customer data. That secrecy extends to the locations of its six \u201cmega clouds\u201d or giant server farms, and 75 \u201cmicro clouds\u201d whose locations the company declined to disclose publicly.  Walmart shareholders so far appear supportive of its cloud strategy. The company\u2019s shares have risen 49 percent in the last 12 months, defying the broader retail sector downturn and outperforming the wider S&P 500 index, which has risen 14 percent over the same period.  Still, some investors have expressed concerns that Walmart\u2019s approach will make it harder for the retailer to downsize if market conditions change significantly. A few of them told Reuters they would like to see Walmart commercialize its excess capacity, much as its rival Amazon has done.  Amazon Web Services (AWS) generated $18.34 billion in revenue in 2017 and has garnered 26 percent of the cloud market, according to estimates from Jefferies Group LLC.  \u201cWalmart is very good at following Amazon\u2019s innovations. Now they must find a way to monetize the cloud business they are building the way AWS did,\u201d said Charles Sizemore, founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC, who owns shares of Walmart.  Walmart\u2019s Kimmet said the retailer has no immediate plans to provide cloud services for other companies. But he did not rule it out as a future revenue driver.","1513":"A federal appeals court on Friday cleared the way for UnitedHealth Group Inc to try to block a former executive from working at the new healthcare venture launched by Amazon.com Inc, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase.

The website is a re-branding for Saudi customers of Souq.com, a Middle East e-commerce platform that Amazon acquired in 2017. Shoppers\u2019 account information with Souq automatically transferred to the new address, amazon.sa, Amazon said on the site.  Amazon spokespeople did not immediately answer a request for comment on what prompted the move. The company last year similarly converted Souq\u2019s website in the United Arab Emirates to a re-branded Amazon portal, amazon.ae.  The news indicates that a conflict involving Bezos and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman did not fully derail Amazon\u2019s investment plans for the kingdom.  Bezos last year said the corporate owner of a U.S. tabloid that had published texts between him and his girlfriend was being investigated for alleged work on Saudi Arabia\u2019s behalf.  The text leak kicked off a saga culminating in January of this year, when United Nations experts said they had information pointing to the \u201cpossible involvement\u201d of Crown Prince Mohammed in an alleged plot to hack Bezos\u2019 phone. Saudi Arabia called the suggestion \u201cabsurd.\u201d  Bezos privately owns the Washington Post, which employed Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi columnist who was a critic of the crown prince and who was murdered in October 2018. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency believes Crown Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, sources previously told Reuters, while the crown prince last year denied the claim and said rogue operatives carried out the act.  The saga has fueled speculation that Amazon would pull back from doing business in Saudi Arabia. Reuters had reported in 2017 that Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit was leading discussions with Riyadh about an investment in the country. (Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco)","1515":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - One of Amazon.com Inc\u2019s longtime executives is leaving the company to join Airbnb Inc, filling a key position as the home-renting business focuses on growth in Latin America and Asia.  Greg Greeley, who was vice president of Amazon Prime and is credited with building the delivery service into one of the e-commerce industry\u2019s most successful programs, with an estimated 90 million members in the United States, is joining Airbnb, it said on Tuesday. In his new role, as president of homes, Greeley will oversee the daily operations and strategy of Airbnb\u2019s core home-renting business.  Airbnb has four business units, and the homes unit was the only one without a permanent boss. Chief Executive Brian Chesky had been filling in temporarily.  The home-renting business, which is profitable, includes more than 4.5 million listings in 81,000 cities.  Greeley starts this month at Airbnb\u2019s San Francisco headquarters.  Most recently, Greeley was tasked with making Prime the loyalty program of Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocer that Amazon acquired last year. It was not clear how his departure from Amazon might affect the Whole Foods integration, if at all.  \u201cWe thank Greg for his contributions to Amazon and wish him the best in his new role,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said.  In his more than 18 years at Amazon, Greeley helped lead the company\u2019s international expansion, running European operations and opening offices in India and Brazil.  That experience may bode well for Airbnb\u2019s ambitions in emerging markets. Faced with regulatory restrictions in the United States and Europe that have limited home-renting, Airbnb has increasingly turned to Latin America and Asia, markets Chesky has said will more than make up for revenue losses in more regulated cities.  About 81 percent of Airbnb\u2019s business is outside of North America, according to the company.  While Greeley was living in Europe and working for Amazon, travel aggregator site Booking.com tried to hire him to be CEO, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. He declined.  Greeley helped create and grow Amazon\u2019s Prime business, which launched in 2005. While Airbnb does not have a loyalty program near the scale of Prime, it has similar aspirations. Last month the company announced new perks and rewards for home renters and hosts in a bid to encourage more loyalty and spending among its top users.  Airbnb is still recruiting for two top executive positions -- chief marketing officer and chief financial officer.","1516":"FILE PHOTO: A worker in a face mask walks by trucks parked at an Amazon facility as the global coronavirus outbreak continued in Bethpage on Long Island in New York, U.S., March 17, 2020.

The action involves more than 350 of Amazon\u2019s staff from 40 facilities, according to the coalition. The world\u2019s largest online retailer has faced several worker protests and demands by unions for it to close warehouses down.  The virus has infected more than 2.4 million people globally including Amazon warehouse staff, and it has given voice to labor activists at the retailer. However, organizing has remained limited and has not hampered operations at a company with more than 590,000 employees in the United States.  Reuters was unable to verify the numbers shared by the coalition, known as Athena. Amazon said reports of workers\u2019 participation were \u201cgrossly exaggerated.\u201d  In a video that Athena posted on Twitter, worker Phillip Anthony Ruiz said, \u201cI am not going in today because Amazon is putting our lives at risk.\u201d  Facility closures would hinder Amazon\u2019s ability to deliver essential goods during the pandemic, with the vast majority of the U.S. population under government stay-at-home orders. The company has focused on preventive health measures to keep work sites open: increasing sanitation, mandating social distancing, giving employees face masks and taking their temperatures.  \u201cMore than 250,000 people have come to work today, even more than last week to serve their communities,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage anyone to compare the health and safety measures Amazon has taken, and the speed of their implementation, during this crisis with other retailers.\u201d  Cases of the virus have been reported among staff from more than 50 of Amazon\u2019s U.S. warehouses, according to the New York Times.

Chinnappa\/File Photo  NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has filed an appeal with an Indian court in an ongoing dispute against local partner Future Group\u2019s plan to sell its retail assets to Reliance Industries, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.  Future Group, which operates supermarkets and high-end food stores across India, agreed to sell its retail assets to oil-to-clothes conglomerate Reliance in August for $3.4 billion but Amazon has alleged the deal breached agreements Future had made with the U.S. company in 2019.  The outcome of the dispute has implications for the future shape of India\u2019s retail landscape, especially in deciding who will have an upper hand in the groceries market expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.  Amazon also took Future to a Singapore arbitrator, which passed an interim order in October saying the Reliance deal should be halted. The Indian retailer has maintained that order is not binding and has instead mounted another legal challenge in a New Delhi court.  In December, the Indian court left it to regulators to decide the fate of Future Group\u2019s retail deal with Reliance, but allowed Amazon to raise objections to the sale.  In its appeal, Amazon is arguing that certain observations made by the judge in relation to the terms of the U.S. company\u2019s 2019 agreement with Future were inconsistent with the Singapore arbitrator\u2019s order, which favoured Amazon, the source said.  The source also said Amazon is arguing in its appeal that this has allowed Future to effectively bypass the arbitration order. The appeal is due to be heard on Jan. 13.  Future Group and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The appeal comes after Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani told Reuters in an interview over the weekend he expects swift regulatory approval for the deal.","1518":"BENGALURU\/PARIS\/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - When Karan Mehrotra booked a flight from Delhi to Guwahati, he did not go to a travel agent or an airline website.

For years, airlines have found it difficult to compete with online travel agencies like Expedia Group Inc and corporate travel agents that control a large number of customers, Travelport Chief Executive Gordon Wilson said.  \u201cThey have nothing left if Google is in that position, or Amazon,\u201d he said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation conference this month. \u201cI think the airlines are being very watchful over this.\u201d  Some carriers, like AirAsia and Easyjet are building digital travel businesses to help boost profits and keep passengers loyal beyond flying.  AirAsia\u2019s website and app offers an all-in-one travel and lifestyle marketplace selling flights, hotels, activities and retail products. It has launched a digital wallet business called BigPay.  \u201cThe volume that we generate from our ticket sales is huge - bigger than a lot of other travel agents would sell. So we might as well do it ourselves, and probably sell a lot more,\u201d AirAsia Executive Chairman Kamarudin Meranun told Reuters at the Paris Airshow.  Europe\u2019s easyJet is signing direct booking contracts with hotels to give it more flexibility in pricing packaged holidays on its website. The easyJet Holidays product should be available for summer 2020 bookings by the end of the year, the airline said in a results presentation last month.  But companies like Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s Google have the upper hand because their broader knowledge of purchasing habits might give them an edge over airlines in presenting attractive offers, travel industry executives said.  AMAZON ADVANTAGE  In India, Amazon has teamed up with local online travel agency Cleartrip to offer domestic airline bookings, with bigger discounts for members of its loyalty club Prime.  \u201cThey have an edge in that booking flights is, for most people, a low frequency purchase but most other products on Amazon are purchased with higher frequency,\u201d said Seth Borko, a senior research analyst at Skift.  \u201cSo Amazon can sell discounted flights but then earn back a part of that promotion from customers that shop for other Amazon products and from their Prime membership fees.\u201d  Amazon has dipped its toe in the travel industry before. The company launched \u201cAmazon Destinations\u201d in 2015 for customers to book hotel rooms in popular U.S. getaways, like Napa Valley and the Hamptons. But it shut the service down the same year, after failing to gain traction in a crowded field of online agencies.  Four years later, Amazon is a more powerful company whose interest in bricks-and-mortar grocery, air cargo, healthcare and Hollywood has sent shockwaves through a growing number of markets, expanding its sources of intelligence about its users.  In India, shoppers have turned to Amazon for more purchases, including movie bookings, food orders and utility payments.  \u201cPayment is very easy because I anyway keep my Pay account loaded,\u201d said Atanu Khatua, a 34-year-old businessman from West Bengal who booked a flight to Delhi on Amazon.  Amazon, which has been expanding services available through \u201cAlexa\u201d, the digital assistant on its Amazon Echo smart speaker, has not revealed any plans to roll out its ticketing the product beyond India.  Amazon Pay Director Shariq Plasticwala declined to comment on whether it would expand in India to areas such as hotel bookings.  THINK DIGITAL  Airlines, which operate in a highly regulated environment with high fixed costs, need to think more like digital retailers to maintain distribution margins, Kenya Airways CEO Sebastian Mikosz said.  \u201cIf we do not adopt an OTA (online travel agency) business model, we will become technology companies\u2019 sub-divisions,\u201d he said at the CAPA conference.  \u201cIf Amazon wanted to buy two or three airlines that wouldn\u2019t be an effort for them. I think the only reason they don\u2019t do it is because it is not practical. It is much better to have the problems outside and take the margin yourself.\u201d  Not every airline has the cash or inclination to compete with tech giants like Amazon. But some are looking at partnerships.  \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with the online travel agents, but we will look at the possibility also of working with Amazon,\u201d Philippine Airlines CEO Jaime Bautista said at the Paris Airshow.  CAPA Executive Chairman Peter Harbison said ticket selling would face \u201cdramatic changes\u201d in the next couple years.  \u201cThe ones who are going to be successful are the ones who are actually going to partner with them, an Amazon or something like that,\u201d he said.","1519":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of the web service Amazon is pictured in this June 8, 2017 illustration photo.

The videogame retailer\u2019s shares, whose wild gyrations have made or lost billions of dollars for hedge funds and other investors in recent weeks, closed down 60% at $90. They are now worth less than a fifth of their high of $483 last week.  Posters on the popular Reddit forum WallStreetBets, which was instrumental in fueling the rally, bemoaned the fall. \"Our darkest hour,\" read one post here by user name kigfik who said they were still holding the stock. Another user, Cinther, posted that they bought at $390 and \"lost so much that I don't even care anymore\" but were still holding.  \u201cThe rally is likely over (since) the short positions are pretty well taken care of,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  \u201cThat\u2019s the game you play when you do this thing. It can work for a while until it stops working and when it stops working, it reverses pretty quickly.\u201d  Short sellers saw paper gains of $3.39 billion during Tuesday\u2019s session, according to S3 Partners. Year-to-date realized and unrealized losses for shorts recently stood at $9.2 billion.  \u201cWe have had a lot of shorts take their losses and walk away from the trade,\u201d said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3\u2019s managing director of predictive analytics.  Spot silver prices, which became an alternative focus in the battle between small traders and Wall Street hedge funds last week, fell more than 8% after hitting an eight-year high on Monday. The main silver ETF was down 8.3%.  The retail frenzy in silver has left some dealers scrambling for bars and coins to meet demand.  Analysts said the silver pullback may show the limits of small investors\u2019 impact in a large and complicated market.  Online broker Robinhood, on whose platform much of the buying and selling has taken place, raised trading limits on GameStop Corp, AMC and other stocks, according to an update on its website on Tuesday.  \u2018BIZARRE SITUATIONS\u2019  Analysts predicted that the market frenzy, which has drawn the attention of regulators and politicians, was likely to fade, and said it was just a question of how soon.  \u201cThis is a pretty narrow strategy that likely creates some bizarre situations like GameStop and AMC but it\u2019s not broad enough to change how institutional investors are going to invest,\u201d said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.  \u201cThe strength of the move was so severe that it really opened up people\u2019s eyes to the power of social media in the investment world. But having seen it and how short-term the nature of it is, I think it\u2019ll lose its surprise.\u201d  Broader markets appeared to be moving on.

Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses,\u201d said Tenev.

REUTERS\/Lindsey Wasson  \u201cThe ones who work very close, like in the building up above, will come down even just to grab a drink because it\u2019s so fast and easy,\u201d Amazon Vice President Gianna Puerini said in an interview at the ShopTalk e-commerce conference in Las Vegas.  The detail offers an early glimpse at how the store, known as Amazon Go, is faring two months after opening its doors to the public. Shopping frequency, sales and other metrics reviewed by Amazon will likely inform how it thinks about expanding the concept elsewhere in the United States, if at all.  Amazon Go is fashioned after small grocery stores, with a crucial difference: it has no cashiers. Customers scan a smartphone app to enter the store, and then cameras and sensors track what they remove from the shelves and what they put back.  Amazon then bills shoppers\u2019 credit cards on file after they leave.  Puerini said store associates spend the vast majority of their time restocking shelves - another indication of the shop\u2019s popularity.  Research-focused venture capital firm Loup Ventures wrote of Amazon Go last month: \u201cOur experience was flawless, leaving us increasingly confident that Amazon is best positioned to own the operating system of automated retail. Eventually, we expect Amazon to make this technology available to other retailers.\u201d  The world\u2019s biggest online retailer first announced a test of Amazon Go in December 2016, in a challenge to brick-and-mortar rivals that are working to keep their own stores up to date.  However, old practices die hard.  \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t necessarily expect is how many people would stop at the end, on their first trip or two, and ask, \u2018Is it really OK if I just leave?\u2019,\u201d Puerini said.  She declined to discuss specific expansion plans and said there were no plans to add the technology to Whole Foods Market, the upscale grocery chain Amazon bought last year. Analysts have speculated otherwise.  In any case, Amazon is still researching how to improve technology at the store.  \u201cIf you show a child a can of Coke, you have to show it to them maybe once or twice, and it\u2019s very easy for them to be able to recognize it,\u201d Amazon Vice President Dilip Kumar said in the same interview with Reuters. \u201cNot so much with computers.\u201d  The company is working to teach computers to recognize items or activities with as little information as possible - a problem that some of Amazon\u2019s thousands of experts are addressing, Kumar said.","1531":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O is at the front line of responding to outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in the United States, delivering essential goods while about half the population faces government stay-at-home orders.

The deal, Amazon alleges, breaches 2019 agreements by Future.  The tussle has strained Amazon\u2019s ties not just with Future Retail - one of India\u2019s top retailers - but also with Ambani, Asia\u2019s richest man, and his Reliance group, which is fast expanding its e-commerce business and threatening companies like Amazon.  Amazon last Sunday won an injunction to halt Future\u2019s deal with Reliance from a Singapore arbitrator both sides had agreed to use in case of disputes. The Indian retailer then said in a news release it had complied with all agreements and \u201ccannot be held back\u201d by the arbitration proceedings.  In the letter to the Securities & Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairman Ajay Tyagi on Wednesday, Amazon said Future\u2019s news release and stock exchange disclosures violated Indian regulations, urging the regulator to investigate the matter and not approve the deal.  \u201cSuch a disclosure is against public interest, misleads public shareholders ... as well as perpetuates a fraud for the benefit of the Biyanis alone,\u201d Amazon letter said, referring to Future\u2019s promoter family led by Kishore Biyani.

Reliance, which in August bought Future\u2019s retail, wholesale and some other businesses, has said it plans to \u201cenforce its rights and complete the (Future) transaction ... without any delay.\u201d  The faceoff comes as Jeff Bezos-led Amazon has already been battling tighter foreign investment rules and antitrust cases in India, which is one of its key growth markets where it has committed investments of $6.5 billion.  Some Indian lawyers have argued the Singapore arbitrator\u2019s order in favour of Amazon is not automatically enforceable and would need ratification by an Indian court. But Amazon believes the order is binding, it told SEBI. The letter asks the regulator to \u201csuspend review\u201d of the deal.  SEBI\u2019s action in the matter \u201cwould promote ease of doing business in India by holding listed companies accountable for their dealings,\u201d Amazon\u2019s letter says.

Future has argued it entered into the deal with Reliance because its retail business was severely hit during the COVID-19 pandemic and it was critical to protect all its stakeholders.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon held early exploratory talks to buy control of Indian rival Flipkart but a deal with Walmart is more likely, daily newspaper Mint said on Wednesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  One person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the probability of a deal with Amazon was low, and that any such deal could spark monopoly concerns as Flipkart and Amazon dominate India\u2019s e-commerce market. The person declined to be identified as discussions were private.  Amazon declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Flipkart and Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.  Walmart is in talks to buy over 40 percent of Flipkart in potentially one of its biggest overseas deals, Reuters reported in February. A deal would give the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that Morgan Stanley estimated to be worth $200 billion in a decade\u2019s time.  The deal would also represent a direct challenge to Amazon in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy. Amazon has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands into online grocery delivery.  Walmart will buy a majority stake in Flipkart through a mix of primary and secondary share purchases in a deal that could value the Indian firm at $21 billion, Mint reported.  Flipkart, founded by former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007, controls nearly 40 percent of India\u2019s online retail market, ahead of Amazon, showed estimates by researcher Forrester.

REUTERS\/Karen Pulfer Focht\/File Photo  Warren\u2019s proposal would apply the new tax to the profits reported to shareholders, instead of the amounts companies already report to the Internal Revenue Service. The profits reported to shareholders are frequently much larger, given the loopholes, deductions and other accounting differences allowed by the tax code.  Her campaign estimates about 1,200 companies would be subject to the new tax. It would bring the government an additional $1.05 trillion in new tax revenue over 10 years, according to estimates from economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California-Berkeley.  Under her proposal, companies\u2019 first $100 million in profit would be exempt from the new tax, which would be in addition to existing corporate taxes that companies pay.  Warren specifically targeted Amazon.com and Occidental Petroleum as two companies that are not paying enough in corporate taxes and would be forced to pay more under her proposal.  Amazon disputed that the company is not paying adequate taxes, and a spokesperson also pointed out that the company creates \u201ctens of thousands of quality jobs.\u201d  \u201cAmazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.  For each dollar over that threshold, the companies would be subject to a 7 percent tax, Warren outlined in a post on the website Medium and seen by Reuters.  Warren hopes to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, who has focused on tax cuts for corporations, which he says have allowed the economy to flourish and helped lower the unemployment rate.  Warren is competing in a crowded field of more than 15 Democrats vying for their party\u2019s nomination and has sought to distinguish herself by offering the most numerous and expansive policy proposals.  Warren\u2019s new tax, which she dubs the \u201cReal Corporate Profits Tax,\u201d would account for profits U.S. companies make globally and would also be imposed on foreign companies doing substantial work in the United States.  \u201cThis new tax applies to the profits very large American companies report to their investors -- with no loopholes or exemptions,\u201d Warren wrote in her proposal.  Republicans are likely to criticize her plan by arguing it will drive companies currently incorporated in the United States to leave or change domicile to avoid the tax - a practice known as inversion.  Warren\u2019s campaign argues that rules on inversions put in place by the Treasury in 2016 have halted the practice and that she would continue strict enforcement if elected.","1539":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has asked India\u2019s market regulator to investigate Future Retail Ltd for insider trading, a letter seen by Reuters showed, as it seeks to prevent its business partner from becoming part of rival Reliance\u2019s empire.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at a logistics centre in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, April 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  The U.S. giant has been pressing the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to review Reliance\u2019s August deal to buy retail, logistics and other assets from Future Group for $3.4 billion including debt.  Amazon argues it had a 2019 agreement with Future which prevented the Indian group\u2019s retail assets from being sold to certain parties including Reliance Industries Ltd, which is led by Asia\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani.  The Nov. 8 letter to SEBI alleges Future Retail disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of an injunction granted by a Singapore arbitrator to block the deal.  After the Reuters story was published, a spokesman for Future said the company had communicated with Reliance on the arbitration order for a \u201clegitimate purpose\u201d as required by SEBI regulations. It added that Amazon had provided no evidence to back up its allegations of insider trading.  Reliance and SEBI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Amazon declined to comment on the letter\u2019s contents.  The spat is being closely watched as a key test of whether Indian firms, courts and regulators will respect arbitration decisions made in accordance with overseas arbitration rules, and adds to headaches for Amazon in India which is also dealing with antitrust challenges.  The injunction was granted on Sunday Oct. 25 and was reported by media with Amazon issuing a short statement saying it welcomed the decision.  Reliance later that evening said in a stock exchange filing that it had been informed of the arbitration order and would enforce its rights to complete the deal with Future without delay.  It is this Oct. 25 filing which Amazon argues in its 20-page letter that indicates Ambani\u2019s group was privy to \u201cprice sensitive\u201d details of the injunction.  Ambani\u2019s group \u201cwas not a party to the arbitration proceedings ... and could have received details related thereto only from FRL (Future Retail) or its Promoters,\u201d said the letter.  Future Retail, which has argued that Amazon\u2019s agreement last year was only with a separate Future Group unit, issued a statement to the stock exchange on the morning of Oct. 26 saying it was examining the arbitration order and that it believed the order would have to be tested by Indian law.  Future Group, which operates supermarkets and high-end food stores and has more than 1,500 outlets across India, has argued it entered into the deal to sell retail assets to Reliance because its business was severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and it was critical to protect all its stakeholders.  It remains to be seen whether Indian courts and regulators will side with Amazon or Future Retail. Future Retail has asked a New Delhi court for an order to restrain Amazon from approaching Indian regulators to block its deal with Reliance. Hearings on the case began on Tuesday.","1540":"(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. drug suppliers rose on Monday after a report that Amazon.com Inc had dropped plans to sell drugs to hospitals, in a boost to a pharmaceutical supply chain rattled by the looming threat of competition from the online retailer.

CNBC, which reported Amazon\u2019s plans on Monday, said the change comes partly because the e-commerce company had not been able to convince big hospitals to change their traditional purchasing process.

REUTERS\/Juan Carlos Ulate  The value of Amazon AMZN.O shares held by Jeff Bezos, the online retailer's chief executive and single largest shareholder, had taken a $10 billion hit in the week since Trump began attacking him and his company on Twitter.  Citing an unspecified report, Trump told reporters at the White House that the company was not paying the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate, and that it was costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars and forcing other retailers out of business, and he threatened to raise rates.  Late on Tuesday afternoon, a source familiar with proceedings at the White House said no specific actions addressing Trump\u2019s concerns about Amazon were on the table at the White House at this time, but that could change given Trump\u2019s dissatisfaction with the company.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the country, stepped in on Tuesday to defend Amazon, which is a member.  \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for government officials to use their position to attack an American company,\u201d Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement, citing the value of the free enterprise system and the rule of law. \u201cThe record is clear: deviating from those processes undermines economic growth and job creation.\u201d  It is not the first time Trump, or another U.S. president, has been publicly critical of a company.

In 2015, then-President Barack Obama criticized office supply company Staples Inc for not embracing the Affordable Care Act, drawing a quick rebuke from Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Bezos, ranked by Forbes magazine as the world\u2019s richest man with an estimated net worth of $115.6 billion, owns 78.89 million Amazon shares, worth about $110 billion at Tuesday\u2019s market close.  Amazon shares closed up 1.5 percent at $1,392.05. The shares started the day higher but fell as low as $1,355.33 after Trump\u2019s latest Amazon-related tweet.  Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but he has offered no evidence to back up his criticisms.  \u201cThe post office is losing billions of dollars ... because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,\u201d Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cIf you look at the cost that we\u2019re subsidizing, we\u2019re giving a subsidy to Amazon.\u201d  Trump offered no details about the report he cited or how he might charge the company more through USPS.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen on a building in San Jose, Costa Rica March 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Juan Carlos Ulate  The 7-2 vote in favor of repeal capped an acrimonious public hearing interrupted by chanting supporters of the tax, conceived in response to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class.  The council\u2019s stunning reversal came as momentum was building for a referendum drive against the measure, just weeks after it was unanimously adopted by the council and signed into law by the mayor.  \u201cThis is a cowardly betrayal of the needs of the working people,\u201d Councilwoman Kshama Sawant, a leading proponent of the tax who voted against repeal, said to thunderous applause moments before the council completed its vote.  But Councilwoman Lisa Herbold said she was reluctantly voting for repeal rather than drag the city through a protracted political fight she called \u201cnot winnable at this particular time.\u201d  \u201cThe opposition has unlimited resources,\u201d she added.  Amazon.com AMZN.O, the city's largest employer, was at the forefront of a coalition of businesses running a well-financed campaign to place a repeal referendum on the ballot for the November elections.  Amazon Vice President Drew Herdener hailed Tuesday\u2019s vote as \u201cthe right decision for the region\u2019s economic prosperity.\u201d  The tax would have applied only to the city\u2019s largest companies by revenue, those grossing at least $20 million a year. It was expected to be borne by about 500 companies.  Opponents had already collected nearly 46,000 signatures from voters in support of a repeal initiative, well more than the 17,000 needed to qualify for the ballot, according to the Downtown Seattle Association, a business group which led the petition drive.  The effort quickly raised $300,000, including contributions of $25,000 each from Amazon and coffee retailer Starbucks SBUX.O, another major Seattle stalwart, and $30,000 from a grocers trade group, said Jon Scholes, president of the Seattle Association.  HELP FOR THE HOMELESS  The measure, passed on May 14, would have levied a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city to raise at least $45 million over five years. The revenues were earmarked to build affordable housing and furnish support services for the homeless.  Sponsors of the tax said Seattle\u2019s biggest-earning businesses should shoulder some burden for easing a low-cost-housing shortage they helped create through an over-heated real estate market that has left the working poor and many middle-class families unable to afford to live in the city.  Opponents branded the measure a \u201ctax on jobs\u201d and said they feared it would spark an economic backlash.  Amazon had threatened to abandon plans for a major downtown office building if the head tax was approved. After Tuesday\u2019s vote, Herdener said Amazon was committed to \u201cbeing part of the solution to homelessness\u201d and would continue to invest in nonprofit groups addressing the problem.  Advocates for the poor say that rampant homelessness in the city is an extension of a larger crisis in affordable housing.  They cite data showing Seattle\u2019s median home prices have soared to $820,000 and that 41 percent of renters ranked as \u201crent-burdened,\u201d meaning they pay about a third or more of their income on housing.  The Seattle metropolitan area is home to the nation\u2019s third-largest concentration of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey and almost half of them living on the streets.  The debate has been closely watched by politicians in major cities nationwide.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK\/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Ambitious American lawmakers crafting an antitrust shopping list are putting Amazon near the top. Jeff Bezos\u2019 $880 billion retailing behemoth deepened its hold on consumers again in the third quarter. The dominant internet retailer spent heavily on faster shipping, propelling revenue growth of 24%. Ruthless expansion in areas, such as advertising, where its existing operations give it a leg up, and new markets such as healthcare, bring a showdown with City Hall closer than ever.  Amazon\u2019s best defense against critics remains that it doesn\u2019t act like a traditional monopolist. Instead of soaking consumers and maximizing profits, it keeps prices low, subsidizes delivery, and expands. That doesn\u2019t always please investors \u2013 the stock fell sharply after earnings disappointed.  Yet the firm\u2019s growing power, and especially its ability to use digital dominance to best rivals, increasingly makes European regulators and American lawmakers uneasy. Take internet advertising. Items not on the first page might as well not exist for many shoppers, forcing sellers to pay up to be a featured good. Amazon doesn\u2019t break out advertising, but it accounts for most of the \u201cother\u201d line in the firm\u2019s sales, which grew over 40%.  Sure, the company\u2019s relatively lackluster estimated revenue growth of 11% to 20% in the fourth quarter may indicate competition is heating up \u2013 but this will only make Bezos more aggressive.  Amazon has been touting initiatives that help society and provide political cover. This week it announced renewable energy projects and funding for high school computer science classes. It may not be enough. On Thursday, White House hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren asked the Federal Trade Commission to see if a security lapse in Amazon servers was partly to blame for a Capital One Financial hack that affected 100 million people.  It\u2019s a matter of time before Bezos faces a D.C. grilling, which he has avoided so far. On Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg made another public appearance before Congress. Sundar Pichai of Google and Jack Dorsey of Twitter have also endured hearings.  Regulators are also watching Bezos\u2019 expansion into new markets. This week, Amazon purchased Health Navigator, which can digitally triage patients. The firm\u2019s small size means this deal won\u2019t be in lawmakers\u2019 crosshairs. But Amazon\u2019s own shopping, and the perception that regulators too easily permitted its $13.7 billion Whole Foods Market acquisition, means future M&A will face tougher criticism.","1558":"FILE PHOTO: A company logo is pictured outside a Tesco supermarket in Altrincham northern England, April 16, 2016.

Amazon, which had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract, filed a lawsuit in November just weeks after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Trump has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company.  Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith issued a preliminary injunction but did not release her written opinion. She also ordered Amazon to post $42 million in the event the injunction was issued wrongfully.  The Amazon lawsuit said the Defense Department\u2019s decision was full of \u201cegregious errors,\u201d which were a result of \u201cimproper pressure from President Donald Trump, who launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks\u201d to steer the contract away from Amazon \u201cto harm his perceived political enemy\u201d Bezos.  Bezos also owns the Washington Post, whose coverage has been critical of Trump and which has frequently been a target of barbs by Trump about the news media.  The Pentagon, which had planned to start work on the contract on Friday, said it was disappointed in the ruling.  Lieutenant Colonel Robert Carver, a Defense Department spokesman, said the Pentagon believed \u201cthe actions taken in this litigation have unnecessarily delayed implementing DoD\u2019s modernization strategy and deprived our warfighters of a set of capabilities they urgently need.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft sign is shown on top of the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19,2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  It added it remained \u201cconfident in our award of the JEDI Cloud contract to Microsoft.\u201d  Defense Secretary Mark Esper previously denied there was bias and said the Pentagon made its choice fairly and freely without external influence.  Alexander Major, a partner at McCarter & English, said: \u201cThe court has confirmed through the injunction that Amazon\u2019s challenges with respect to this procurement are not trivial. It\u2019s not guaranteed that they will prevail but the fact that they got it at all is a big deal.\u201d  Amazon shares closed down 0.4%, while Microsoft was down 0.5%.  TESTIMONY SOUGHT FROM TRUMP  As part of the lawsuit, Amazon asked the court in January to pause the execution of the contract, popularly known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI. The contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations.  Microsoft said in a statement: \u201cWe have confidence in the Department of Defense, and we believe the facts will show they ran a detailed, thorough and fair process.\u201d  Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House declined comment.  Earlier this week, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, said it was seeking to depose Trump and Esper in its lawsuit over whether the president was trying \u201cto screw Amazon\u201d over the contract.  Amazon also seeks to question other officials involved in the decision and alleged that Trump had a history of inappropriately intervening in governmental decisions. Amazon called the process \u201cfatally flawed and highly unusual.\u201d  The procurement process has been delayed by legal complaints and conflict-of-interest allegations.  The judge told Amazon and the Pentagon to confer by Feb. 27 on what portions of the opinion can be released publicly.","1561":"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon AMZN.O brought a little cheer to Britain's troubled labour market on Thursday, saying it will create a further 7,000 permanent jobs in 2020, taking total new hires this year to 10,000.

The Audi e-tron midsize SUV will be offered in the United States next year at a starting price of $75,795 before a $7,500 tax credit. It is one of a volley of electric vehicles coming from Volkswagen AG brands, as well as other European premium brands including Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo Cars and Jaguar Land Rover.  All aim to expand the market for premium electric vehicles and also to grab share of that market from Palo Alto, California-based Tesla, which has had the niche largely to itself.  \u201cI want Audi to be the number-one electric vehicle seller in America over the long term,\u201d Audi of America President Scott Keogh told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is also head of rocket company SpaceX, planned to mark the e-tron launch occasion by staging a SpaceX event in Los Angeles at roughly the same time on Monday evening as Audi\u2019s unveiling.  Audi and parent Volkswagen are using the U.S. launch of the e-tron SUV in mid-2019 to take aim at one obstacle to expanding electric vehicle sales - the lack of convenient ways to recharge their batteries.  Audi will partner with online retailer Amazon to sell and install home electric vehicle charging systems to buyers of the e-tron, the companies said on Monday. Amazon will deliver the hardware and hire electricians to install them through its Amazon Home Services operation.  Amazon\u2019s partnership with Audi to provide home charging systems is the first time the online retailer has struck such a deal with an automaker, and signals a new front in Amazon\u2019s drive to expand its reach into consumers\u2019 homes beyond the presence of its Alexa smart speakers in living rooms and kitchens.  \u201cWe see charging installation as a very important business,\u201d Pat Bigatel, director of Amazon Home Services, told Reuters at Audi\u2019s launch event in San Francisco\u2019s Bill Graham Civic Center.  Audi executives said home charging stations would cost about $1,000, depending on the home\u2019s electrical system.  Tesla offers wall connectors for home charging at a $500 list price, and will arrange for installation, according to the company.  At the same time, Electrify America, a company funded by Volkswagen as part of its settlement of U.S. diesel emission cheating litigation, plans to launch next year the next round of installations of public charging stations, Electrify America executives told Reuters.  Tesla has developed its own network of Supercharger charging stations with more than 11,000 chargers in North America. Electrify America plans to have 2,000 chargers installed by mid-June next year. Those will be open to any vehicle, and customers can swipe a credit card to recharge.  \u201cWe want to work with all\u201d automotive brands, said Giovanni Palazzo, Electrify America\u2019s chief executive.  LIFTING THE CURTAIN  Audi has been heralding the launch of the e-tron SUV for some time, but until Monday it had not shared many details of the vehicle.  The e-tron is electric, and has two electric motors - one in the front and one in the rear - driving all four wheels. The Hungarian factory building motors for the e-tron will start with a production pace equivalent to 200 vehicles a day, Audi officials said.  In Europe, the vehicle will use cameras instead of conventional mirrors to give drivers a view to the rear. That feature is still not approved by U.S. regulators.  However, in many other respects the e-tron is a conventional, mainstream luxury SUV. It offers seating for five, and its length and wheelbase position it in the center of the market for midsize, five-passenger luxury SUVs such as the BMW X5. The e-tron is 5 inches (13 cm) shorter than the Tesla Model X, and it has conventional doors. The Model X uses vertically opening \u201cfalcon wing\u201d doors.  The e-tron will have an advanced cruise-control system that can keep the car within a lane and maintain a set distance behind another vehicle, but the system will be designed so that drivers must keep hands on the wheel.  Audi officials said they do not have official range estimates for the e-tron SUV under U.S. testing procedures. The e-tron\u2019s 95 kWh battery has less capacity than the 100 kWh battery used in the Tesla Model X 100D model, but more than the base Model X 75D.  The Model X 100D is rated at 295 miles (475 km) of range by the U.S. government.","1564":"March 14 (Reuters) -  * SECOND AMAZON EMPLOYEE IN SEATTLE TESTS POSITIVE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS - CNBC Source text: cnb.cx\/33iwH1N Further company coverage:","1565":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday asked the U.S. government to prioritize essential workers including its warehouse, grocery store and data center staff for receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D\u2019Silva and Shounak Dasgupta)","1567":"(Reuters) - Trying to keep up with Amazon\u2019s latest moves in its effort to avoid liability for defective products from third-party sellers is like watching a Ping Pong game.  In August, the company came out in favor of a proposed California law that would make it easier for injured consumers to hold electronic retailers responsible for allowing defective products to reach the marketplace. In a blog post, Amazon said it was willing to accept that liability as long as the law extended to all online marketplaces.  On Tuesday, Amazon disavowed responsibility for defective products sold on its site by other retailers. The company filed a petition asking the California Supreme Court to review an intermediate state appellate ruling in Bolger v. Amazon, which tags Amazon with precisely the liability it agreed to accept in the proposed California statute.  Then on Wednesday, the company showed it\u2019s not actually so eager to hear from state supreme courts on the matter of its responsibility for facilitating the sale of defective products. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed in July to hear Oberdorf v. Amazon, after the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asked for the state high court's view on whether Amazon could be strictly liable for a defective product that was sold on its platform by a third-party vendor. Instead of litigating before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, though, Amazon and Oberdorf resolved the case, according to a disclosure they filed at the 3rd Circuit. (Oberdorf counsel David Wilk of Lepley, Engelman, Yaw & Wilk did not respond to my phone message.)  So, to recap: Amazon accepts the prospect of liability in California, then tells the California Supreme Court it wants the court to hear its arguments against liability, then decides not to make parallel arguments before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.  \u201cI\u2019d call the strategy inconsistent,\u201d said Jeremy Robinson of Casey Gerry, who represents California plaintiff Angela Bolger. Bolger was severely burned in the explosion of a laptop battery she purchased on Amazon from a pseudonymous third-party seller. Amazon, he said, waited until the last possible day to file its petition for review of the intermediate appellate ruling allowing Bolger to proceed with her claims, signaling to Robinson that Amazon is trying to figure out how best to manage the risk of product liability exposure.  \u201cI think they see the writing on the wall and want to lose the battle on their own terms,\u201d Robinson said.  An Amazon spokeswoman declined via email to comment on developments in the Bolger and Oberdorf cases or on the company\u2019s strategy. Amazon outside counsel from Perkins Coie did not respond to my email.  Adding to the inconsistency: Amazon told the 5th Circuit in June that the federal appeals court should not certify the question of its liability for defective third-party products to the Texas Supreme Court. But the company is meanwhile waiting for a decision on the same issue from the Ohio Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in April in Stiner v. Amazon.  \u201cAmazon is going to do whatever is best for Amazon,\u201d said Ohio plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Brian Balser. Balser\u2019s client, Dennis Stiner, sued over the death of his son, who experienced a seizure and cardiac distress after consuming a caffeine supplement he bought on Amazon. Balser, who said he could not comment on whether the company has offered to settle his client\u2019s case, said he certainly noticed when Amazon posted that blog entry in August, agreeing to back the proposed California law to impose liability on online retailers.  Amazon\u2019s juggling act is on full display in its Sept. 22 petition to the California Supreme Court, requesting review of the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling in the Bolger case. The company argued that the lower court erroneously extended California\u2019s strict liability law to encompass a retailer that did not actually make or sell the defective product. It also argued, though, that it\u2019s not up to the courts to define the limits of liability. That\u2019s a matter for the California legislature, Amazon said. So, according to the company, the Court of Appeal \u201cusurped the legislature\u2019s role and created entirely new rules of strict liability.\u201d  The Amazon brief described the proposed California bill, which, it said, would \u201c(create) new liability rules for modern e-commerce.\u201d The company noted that the California Senate did not vote on the bill after it was passed by the Assembly, but, according to Amazon, the legislation is expected to be reintroduced in 2021.  The brief did not mention that Amazon backed the bill. Nor did it mention that Amazon\u2019s competitors have argued Amazon\u2019s support of the legislation is actually a strategic play to crush competitors that cannot afford to pay liability costs that Amazon can easily afford. In fact, Amazon portrayed itself in the California Supreme Court petition as a champion of startup online marketplaces that it said would be burned in \u201cthe \u2018blast radius\u2019 of the Court of Appeal\u2019s reconfiguration of California strict liability law.\u201d  Bolger counsel Robinson said his response to Amazon\u2019s petition, which is due in October, will point out that Amazon is urging the California Supreme Court to reverse a ruling that, according to the company, failed to defer to proposed legislation that would \u2026 lead to the same outcome as the supposedly misguided court decision. \u201cHow can they say this decision is wrong?\u201d said Robinson.

The move was the largest by a multinational company in Ireland this year and adds to the 11,300 announced by foreign companies in the first half of the year, a slight increase on the same period a year ago, according to Ireland\u2019s investment agency, IDA Ireland.  Ireland has a decades-old policy of attracting multinational jobs with a corporate tax rate of just 12.5 percent, making it a hub for U.S. companies - including heavyweights such as Apple, Google and Facebook - which account for one in 10 local jobs.  Amazon said the new Dublin-based roles will include software engineers, security specialists and big data specialists at both Amazon and Amazon Web Services, its cloud unit.

All three major U.S. indexes were lower, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq posting its biggest percentage loss since late July.  Wall Street extended its losses ahead of the tariff announcement after Trump asserted his belief that the United States\u2019 trade deficit with China was too big, stating \u201cwe can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d  Earlier, China vowed that it will not play defense in the escalating trade dispute, adding further fuel to tensions as a new list of items subject to tariffs, including technology and consumer goods, was anticipated from Washington.  \u201cThis is the sixth or seventh time we talked about this particular round of tariffs,\u201d said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. \u201cAs long as Trump is comfortable raising tariffs, he believes he\u2019s winning.\u201d  Consumer discretionary and technology were the biggest percentage losers on the S&P 500, falling 1.3 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.  Amazon.com led consumer discretionary stocks lower, falling 3.2 percent.  Apple Inc has said the moves could hit a \u201cwide range\u201d of its products. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares were down 2.7 percent, providing the biggest drag on the Dow, despite earlier reports that the United States would spare some of its products in the latest round of tariff actions.  All of the so-called FAANG group of momentum stocks closed down between 1.0 percent and 3.9 percent. Other FAANG stocks include Netflix, Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet.  \u201c(The FAANG stocks have) had great runs; the fact that they\u2019d come off a little bit really doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that they\u2019ve put in some very good performance numbers this year,\u201d Nolte said. But he noted \u201cinvestors might be slowly looking outside of tech for the next opportunity.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 92.55 points, or 0.35 percent, to 26,062.12, the S&P 500 lost 16.18 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,888.8 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 114.25 points, or 1.43 percent, to 7,895.79.  The S&P 500\u2019s slide was concentrated. Of the 11 major sectors in the index, only four ended the session in negative territory.  The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, rose 1.54 points, its first increase in six sessions.  Retailers, including Macy\u2019s Inc and Kohls Corp , dropped, helping pull the S&P 500 retailers index 2.1 percent lower.  Twitter fell 4.2 percent, the biggest percentage loser in the S&P 500 technology index, after brokerage MoffettNathanson flagged concerns over rising expenses.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.46-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.12-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 90 new lows.

FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen at an Amazon facility in Bethpage on Long Island in New York, U.S., March 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  The company on Friday fired two user experience designers, Maren Costa and Emily Cunningham, for what it called repeated violations of internal policies, without specifying which ones.  The two workers, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more on climate change, had recently made public statements questioning Amazon\u2019s pandemic safety measures and pledging to match donations of up to $500 to support staff at risk of getting the virus.  The e-commerce giant also said it dismissed Bashir Mohamed, a warehouse worker in Minnesota, for inappropriate language and behavior. Mohamed told Reuters he had been warning colleagues about the virus and calling on management to increase cleaning; Amazon has been \u201ctripling down on deep cleaning,\u201d it has said in recent statements.  Their dismissals follow Amazon\u2019s termination on March 30 of warehouse protest leader Christian Smalls on the grounds that he put others at risk by violating his paid quarantine when he joined a demonstration at Amazon\u2019s Staten Island, New York, fulfillment center.  In statements shared with Reuters, Cunningham said she believed Amazon could play a powerful role during the crisis, but to do so, \u201cwe have to really listen to the workers who are on the front line, who don\u2019t feel adequately protected.\u201d  Costa said in her statement, \u201cNo company should punish their employees for showing concern for one another, especially during a pandemic!\u201d  The world\u2019s largest online retailer is facing intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers and unions over whether it is doing enough to protect staff from the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 1.9 million people, including workers at more than 50 of Amazon\u2019s U.S. warehouses, according to the New York Times.  The company has been racing to update safety protocols, distribute protective gear and keep warehouses functional as it works to ship essentials to shoppers under widespread government stay-at-home orders. Small groups of employees have staged high-profile protests at several Amazon warehouses.  Mohamed, a 28-year-old Somali-American, said his boss told him not to organize other workers at the Minneapolis-area warehouse. Once he began informing colleagues of the risks they faced from the virus, he said, Amazon started targeting him.  \u201cThey didn\u2019t like the way I was talking,\u201d he said.  In a statement, Amazon said, \u201cWe respect the rights of employees to protest and recognize their legal right to do so; however, these rights do not provide blanket immunity against bad actions, particularly those that endanger the health, well-being or safety of their colleagues.\u201d  Amazon said Mohamed had also violated social distancing guidelines.  A dismissal letter Mohamed shared with Reuters did not specify social distancing but focused on his declining to talk to certain team leaders starting in early March; Mohamed alleged that before that period his manager had discriminated against him.  Public pressure on Amazon mounted on Tuesday, following five Democratic U.S. Senators who wrote to Amazon\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos last week to request an explanation about what happened with the other fired warehouse worker, Smalls.  Sanders tweeted: \u201cInstead of firing employees who want justice, maybe Jeff Bezos - the richest man in the world - can focus on providing his workers with paid sick leave, a safe workplace, and a livable planet.\u201d  Athena, a labor and activist coalition, called the latest dismissals \u201coutrageous.\u201d","1572":"WASHINGTON, March 4 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc should stop third-party sellers from price gouging for items like Purell hand sanitizer as people seek to protect themselves from the coronavirus, U.S. Senator Edward Markey said in a letter to the online retailer on Wednesday.  A box of small Purell bottles that usually sells for $10 was listed online for $400, he said. One third-party seller listed a bottle for $600 on Wednesday afternoon. However, the Amazon brand of hand sanitizer was listed for $8.25 for a large bottle.  Amazon was not immediately available for comment but last week it barred more than 1 million products that inaccurately claimed to cure or defend against the coronavirus.

The coronavirus has caused at least 2,797 deaths globally, and new reported infections around the world now exceed those from mainland China, where the flu-like disease arose two months ago out of an illegal wildlife market.  Amazon last month said it was putting in place travel restrictions to China.","1575":"SAN FRANCISCO\/BEIJING\/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said it will shut its China online store by July 18, as the U.S. e-commerce giant focuses on the lucrative businesses of selling overseas goods and cloud services in the world\u2019s most populous nation.  The move underscores how entrenched, home-grown e-commerce rivals have made it difficult for Amazon\u2019s marketplace to gain traction in China. Consumer research firm iResearch Global said Alibaba Group Holding\u2019s Tmall marketplace and JD.com controlled 82 percent of the Chinese e-commerce market last year.  An Amazon spokeswoman told Reuters on Thursday that it is notifying sellers that it will no longer operate a marketplace, nor provide seller services on Amazon.cn.  Sources familiar with its plans had told Reuters a day before that the company had planned to make such a move.  \u201cWe are working closely with our sellers to ensure a smooth transition and to continue to deliver the best customer experience possible,\u201d the spokeswoman said in a statement.  \u201cSellers interested in continuing to sell on Amazon outside of China are able to do so through Amazon Global Selling.\u201d  The sources said that Amazon shoppers in China will no longer be able to buy goods from third-party merchants in the country, but they still will be able to order from the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan via the firm\u2019s global store.  Amazon will wind down support for domestic-selling merchants in China in the next 90 days and review the impact on its fulfilment centers in the country, some of which it may close, one of the people said.  \u201cThey\u2019re pulling out because it\u2019s not profitable and not growing,\u201d said analyst Michael Pachter at Wedbush Securities.  FILE PHOTO: Amazon.com's logo is seen at Amazon Japan's office building in Tokyo, Japan, August 8, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  Ker Zheng, marketing specialist at Shenzhen-based e-commerce consultancy Azoya, said Amazon had no major competitive advantage in China over its domestic rivals.  Unless someone is searching for a very specific imported good that can\u2019t be found elsewhere, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason for a consumer to pick Amazon because they\u2019re not going to be able to ship things as fast as Tmall or JD,\u201d he said.  The Amazon spokeswoman said that the company would continue to invest and grow in China through its Amazon Global Store, Global Selling, Kindle e-readers and online content. Amazon Web Services, the company\u2019s cloud computing unit that sells data storage and computing power to enterprises, will also remain.  U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba and JD.com rose 1 percent on Wednesday after Reuters first reported the move, before paring gains later in the day. Amazon\u2019s shares closed flat.  E-COMMERCE SLOWDOWN  The withdrawal of the world\u2019s largest online retailer - founded by Jeff Bezos, who later became the world\u2019s richest person - comes amid a broader e-commerce slowdown in China. Alibaba in January reported its slowest quarterly earnings growth since 2016, while JD.com is responding to the changing business environment with staff cuts.  It also follows the Chinese e-commerce retreat of other big-name Western retailers. Walmart Inc sold its Chinese online shopping platform to JD.com in 2016 in return for a stake in JD.com to focus on its bricks-and-mortar stores.  Similarly, the country appears to factor less in the global aspirations of fellow U.S. tech majors Netflix Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, Wedbush Securities\u2019 Pachter said.  Amazon bought Chinese online shopping website Joyo.com in 2004 for $75 million, rebranding the business in 2011 as Amazon China. But in a sign of Tmall\u2019s dominance, Amazon opened an online store on the Alibaba site in 2015.  Amazon is still expanding aggressively in other countries, notably India, where it is contending with local rival Flipkart.","1576":"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Charlie munger says it is time for regulators to \u201clet up\u201d on wells fargo -- Munger comments on wells fargo at annual meeting of daily journal corp, which he chairs Munger says wells fargo had improper incentive systems and was too slow to address bad news, but will end up \u201cbetter off\u201d for having made mistakes Munger says u.s.

CommSec Senior Economist Ryan Felsman said a COVID-19 resurgence in Europe and the United States is partly fueling the tech rally.  \u201cOnce again, there is a desire to hold the stay-at-home types of technology stocks...which will still generate profits and will be greatly oriented to a more challenging economic environment,\u201d Felsman said.

Bets that more U.S. stimulus was in the offing came despite signs that talks in Washington had stalled again, leading the Trump administration to call on Congress to pass a less ambitious coronavirus relief bill.  U.S. Senate Republicans said they will go along with what President Donald Trump wants in coronavirus relief legislation, a White House spokeswoman said on Monday.  Focus in Asia swings to China, which is expected to report an increase in exports on Tuesday.  Beijing\u2019s tensions with Washington are also in view after the White House moved forward with three sales of advanced weaponry to Taiwan, sources familiar with the situation said on Monday.  The move in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. election is likely to anger China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province.  The yuan fell 0.8% on Monday, after the central bank cut foreign exchange forward reserve requirements that effectively lowers the cost of shorting the yuan.

She ordered the case to remain on hold until August 17, but said it could be extended or shortened depending on the length of the review.  Known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, the cloud computing contract is intended to give the militarybetter access to data and technology from remote locations.  The Amazon lawsuit, filed in November, said the Defense Department\u2019s decision was full of \u201cegregious errors,\u201d which were a result of \u201cimproper pressure from President Donald Trump, who launched repeated public and behind-the-scenes attacks\u201d to steer the contract away from Amazon \u201cto harm his perceived political enemy\u201d, Amazon head Jeff Bezos.

That changed with the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which has set off a flurry of corporate statements of solidarity with the black community \u2013 along with pledges of more than $1.7 billion to advance racial justice and equity.  FILE PHOTO: Demonstrators march across Brooklyn Bridge in protest against the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  The unprecedented outpouring of support, however, has stirred up criticism along with praise. Many social justice advocates, corporate diversity experts and investors say companies also need to focus on equity in their own ranks, especially by hiring and promoting minority workers.  The tensions show the difficulty executives face in aligning their firms with popular social causes at a time of soaring wealth and inequality \u2013 and growing pressure from some investors to show leadership on societal problems. Activists, along with some business leaders, also see an opportunity amid global protests to push reform on social justice issues well beyond police brutality.  The rush of corporate concern belies the reality of workforce inequity, said Natasha Lamb, managing partner of Arjuna Capital. Arjuna is a Boston-based investment adviser and frequent filer of shareholder resolutions pressing companies - with mixed success - to disclose more data on pay equity.  \u201cIf you take an honest look at corporate America, outside their glossy diversity reports, structural bias for women and people of color remains as entrenched as ever,\u201d she said.  Floyd\u2019s death has sparked a movement with wide-ranging goals, said Fiona Ma, California state treasurer and a director for systems managing about $650 billion in state retirement assets. \u201cIt\u2019s not just law enforcement\u201d at issue, she said, calling the protests \u201ca greater statement of today\u2019s values and holding people and companies accountable.\u201d  Leaders of major companies including Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, Nike Inc NKE.N and Warner Music Group Corp WMG.O have announced major gifts to advance racial justice amid the protests over Floyd's death. Bank of America pledged $1 billion over four years to address economic and racial inequality. At least a dozen other big companies announced gifts between $1 million and $100 million for similar efforts. FACTBOX:  \u201cOur Black community is hurting, and many of us are searching for ways to stand up for what we believe,\u201d said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O.  Companies\u2019 willingness to take strong stands could signal a substantive shift in the attitudes of corporate leaders, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group, a research and asset management firm. \u201cSome is probably lip service, but I think it goes beyond that, and there\u2019s a realization that something needs to change,\u201d Paulsen said.  DIFFERENT THIS TIME  Companies were mostly silent during protests in 2014 following the death of Michael Brown, who was shot by a Ferguson, Missouri policeman, and Eric Garner, who died after being put in a chokehold by a New York City officer.  Today the demonstrations are bigger and more racially diverse. Companies also face increasing pressure from investors, consumers and workers to lead on issues from climate change to gun control to immigration policy and racial inequity.  \u201cIt\u2019s good for their own employees to hear this, because especially their younger employees are part of a generational group that cares more about these issues,\u201d said Francis Byrd, a corporate governance consultant in New York.  The growing corporate involvement may also reflect a shift in public attitudes on race, said R. Paul Herman, chief executive of sustainable ratings agency HIP Investor. In the past, he said, companies avoided weighing in on racial controversies for fear of alienating customers. A Monmouth University poll released on June 2 showed the proportion of Americans who consider racial discrimination to be a big problem has increased from about half in 2015 to about 3 in 4 now.  On June 1, Facebook Inc FB.N Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page: \u201cTo help in this fight, I know Facebook needs to do more to support equality and safety.\u201d  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Facebook committed $10 million to groups working on racial justice, and Zuckerberg\u2019s private philanthropy has donated far more to the cause.  But the firm still faces pressure on workplace diversity. At its May 27 annual meeting, investors cast about 28% of votes, excluding shares held by insiders, in favor of a resolution sponsored by Arjuna that called for a breakdown of its median pay gaps by gender and race.  Facebook opposed the measure, saying it already discloses data showing that women and men are equally paid for similar work. A spokesman did not comment on whether it might add more pay disclosures but said the company is committed to workplace equity.  African-Americans make up less than 4% of Facebook\u2019s workforce and about 3% of its senior leadership, compared to 13% of the U.S. populace, according to company disclosures. Other major technology firms, including Google, Twitter Inc TWTR.N, Intel Corp INTC.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, have disclosed similarly low proportions of African-American workers and senior managers, relative to the population.  Twitter, Intel and Microsoft representatives said the firms have set ambitious goals to increase the proportion of underrepresented minorities in their ranks.  Google spokeswoman Jennifer Rodstrom said the company would need to \u201cwork to expand the talent pool externally, and improve our culture internally, if we want to create equitable outcomes and inclusion for everyone.\u201d  Monica Hawkins, a Washington, D.C.-based management consultant, said many executives struggle to raise diversity in senior management because they know too few minorities. Leaders need to expand their social and business circles, she said, because referrals are a key source of important hires.  \u201cThey need to open their network,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the work. You can\u2019t cut a check for that.\u201d  Proportions of African-American workers are much higher at firms with large numbers of relatively low-paid workers, such as retailers Walmart Inc WMT.N and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, according to company disclosures. But the higher percentages don\u2019t extend to the senior management ranks of either retailer and remain well below the level of the U.S. population, the disclosures show.  A Walmart spokeswoman cited recent comments from its CEO Doug McMillon that its recruiting and development of African-American employees and other people of color will be \u201ceven more of a priority\u201d going forward. Amazon says in a workforce report that it strives \u201cfor better representation across our various businesses.\u201d  When Amazon expressed its concern in a May 31 tweet over what it described as the \u201cbrutal\u201d treatment of black Americans, it faced immediate blowback over facial-recognition technologies it sells to police agencies.  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) responded to Amazon\u2019s tweet by asking if it would stop selling technology it says \u201csupercharges police abuse.\u201d In a 2018 study of Amazon\u2019s Rekognition technology, the ACLU found people of color were falsely matched at a high rate. Matt Cagle, an attorney for the ACLU of Northern California, called Amazon\u2019s support for racial justice \u201cutterly hypocritical.\u201d  Amazon pledged $10 million for social justice causes, some of which will go to the ACLU Foundation. The ACLU welcomed the donation, said Ben Wizner, director of its Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.  \u201cSince it is an unrestricted gift, the irony is that some of this money will undoubtedly be used to hold Amazon accountable for its role in perpetuating police abuses,\u201d he said.  Amazon has defended Rekognition and said all users must follow laws limiting its use. But late Wednesday, hours after this Reuters report was published, Amazon announced it would put a one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition.  \u201cWe\u2019ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology,\u201d the company said on its website. \u201cWe hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules.\u201d  FEW AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN MANAGEMENT  Reuters reviewed available data on workplace diversity from 27 large corporations that made statements about race in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death. The data is spotty, however, because companies are not legally required to release it and their disclosures can be selective.  The percentage of black board members often mirrors or surpasses that of the broader U.S. population, the company disclosures showed. But the percentage of black employees in senior management is typically much lower. More than half of the 27 companies disclosed percentages of African-Americans in their top ranks that were less than half the percentage in the broader population, and many companies disclosed no racial breakdown for managers at all.  At the Walt Disney Co DIS.N, none of the 15 senior executives listed on the company\u2019s website are black; Disney\u2019s recently-named treasurer is Hispanic. A Disney spokesman cited company diversity efforts including two programs announced last year that aim to attract and develop talent from underrepresented backgrounds.  The company on June 3 announced a $5 million pledge to support nonprofit organizations that advance social justice, including a $2 million donation to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, Deputy Senior Campaign Director at social justice organization Color of Change \u2013 which promotes racial equity through online campaigns - said the donation was a start but that Disney and other firms need to reassess their approach. Ogunnaike said companies should conduct civil rights audits that examine workforce demographics, hiring practices and company culture.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to look intensely and deeply at how racism is showing up,\u201d she said.  James Page, Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion at General Assembly, a technology training firm, said companies looking to show leadership on issues of race need to do more than donate to social justice organizations.  \u201cThis crisis did not occur because the NAACP didn\u2019t have enough money,\u201d Page said, referring to one of oldest and best-known U.S. civil rights groups. \u201cCorporations now need a clear plan on how they\u2019re going to change the makeup of their organizations.\u201d","1580":"WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said Amazon.com Inc is likely to succeed in its challenge to the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s decision to award an up to $10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft Corp.  U.S. Court of Federal Claims Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith\u2019s opinion was unsealed on Friday. On Feb. 13, she issued an order blocking work on the contract pending resolution of Amazon\u2019s court challenge.  Amazon contends the contract was awarded to its rival because of improper influence by President Donald Trump.  The opinion did not mention Trump or address Amazon\u2019s claims of improper influence, but instead focused on how the Pentagon assessed Microsoft\u2019s data storage in one price scenario.  Campbell-Smith wrote Amazon \u201cis likely to succeed on the merits of its argument that the DOD improperly evaluated\u201d a Microsoft price scenario. She added Amazon is likely to show that Microsoft\u2019s scenario was not \u201ctechnically feasible\u201d as the Pentagon assessed.  Microsoft did not immediately comment on Saturday, but told the Washington Post the opinion cited a \u201clone technical finding\u201d and noted it did not find any other government error in \u201cthe complex and thorough process that resulted in the award of the contract to Microsoft.\u201d  Amazon did not immediately comment on Saturday.  Campbell-Smith said \u201cin the context of a procurement for cloud computing services, the court considers it quite likely that this failure is material.\u201d  Amazon, which had been seen as a front-runner to win the contract, filed a lawsuit in November just weeks after the contract was awarded to Microsoft. Trump has publicly derided Amazon head Jeff Bezos and repeatedly criticized the company.  The Amazon lawsuit said the Defense Department\u2019s decision was full of \u201cegregious errors,\u201d which were a result of \u201cimproper pressure from President Donald Trump.\u201d  Bezos also owns the Washington Post, whose coverage has been critical of Trump and which has frequently been a target of barbs by Trump about the news media.  The Pentagon, which had planned to start work on the contract on Feb. 13, has said it was disappointed in the ruling.  As part of the lawsuit, Amazon asked the court to halt the execution of the contract, popularly known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI. The contract is intended to give the military better access to data and technology from remote locations.  Last month, Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, said it was seeking to depose Trump in its lawsuit and suggested the president was trying \u201cto screw Amazon\u201d over the contract.

The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant is developing systems that track what shoppers add to their carts, the people say. Microsoft has shown sample technology to retailers from around the world and has had talks with Walmart Inc WMT.N about a potential collaboration, three of the people said.  Microsoft\u2019s technology aims to help retailers keep pace with Amazon Go, a highly automated store that opened to the public in Seattle in January. Amazon customers scan their smartphones at a turnstile to enter. Cameras and sensors identify what they remove from the shelves. When customers are finished shopping, they simply leave the store and Amazon bills their credit cards on file.  Amazon Go, which will soon open in Chicago and San Francisco, has sent rivals scrambling to prepare for yet another disruption by the world\u2019s biggest online retailer. Some have tested programs where customers scan and bag each item as they shop, with mixed results.  For Microsoft, becoming a strategic ally to retailers has meant big business. In addition to developing retail technologies, it ranks No. 2 behind Amazon in selling cloud services that are key to running e-commerce sites, for instance.  It is not clear how soon Microsoft would bring an automated checkout service to market, if at all, or whether its technology would be the answer retailers are looking for. But some see the technology as the next big innovation in shopping, one that Amazon\u2019s competitors cannot afford to ignore.  \u201cThis is the future of checking out for convenience and grocery stores,\u201d said Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures in Minneapolis. The venture capital firm estimates the U.S. market for automated checkout is worth $50 billion. Cashier is one of the most commonly held jobs in the United States.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Microsoft said it \u201cdoes not comment on rumors or speculation.\u201d Walmart and Amazon declined to comment.  EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT  Microsoft\u2019s effort to date has largely fallen under its Business AI, or artificial intelligence, team, one person said. A group consisting of 10 to 15 people has worked on a host of retail store technologies, and they have presented some of their efforts in front of CEO Satya Nadella, the person said.  In a meeting with the team several months ago, Nadella recommended an \u201cintelligent edge\u201d device that could manage connected gadgets such as cameras on site with minimum data transfers to the cloud, which would cut down on costs, said the person.  Making its technology cheap enough so it does not eviscerate grocers\u2019 already thin profit margins is a major challenge for Microsoft, another person said.  Microsoft already showcases the basics for automated checkout at its Retail Experience Center in Redmond.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  It has half a dozen partners, including Redmond-based AVA Retail, that are building their own checkout-free or related services atop Microsoft\u2019s cloud, some of the people said. Sales of partners\u2019 services result in cloud revenue for Microsoft, along with insight into the market for new retail technologies.  Meanwhile, Microsoft\u2019s internal team, including a computer vision specialist hired from Amazon Go, has worked on attaching cameras to shopping carts to track customers\u2019 items. And it has studied novel ways for smartphones to play a role in the shopping experience, people said.  Still, the industry is playing catch-up to Amazon.  The company spent four years building Amazon Go in secret, before launching an employee-only pilot on its Seattle campus in 2016. It collected data for nearly 14 months more before opening the doors to its first Seattle store. Amazon has said it has no plans to introduce checkout-free technology to its Whole Foods Market grocery chain, which it acquired last year.  The company is still hard at work improving the service. Amazon Vice President Dilip Kumar told Reuters in an interview earlier this year that the company is training computers to identify items or activities with as little information as possible.  \u201cIt\u2019s a really hard problem,\u201d said Scott Jacobson, managing director of Madrona Venture Group, adding it\u2019s \u201cone that Amazon is uniquely positioned to solve.\u201d","1582":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Wednesday narrowed Woody Allen\u2019s $68 million lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc for backing out of a four-picture production and distribution agreement and refusing to distribute a film he had already completed.

She dismissed claims covering two alleged breaches of the Aug. 2017 multi-picture agreement, an unjust enrichment claim, and an alleged breach related to the first film, the completed \u201cA Rainy Day in New York.\u201d  Allen, 83, had sued two Amazon units in February, claiming they could not abandon their distribution plans because of a \u201cbaseless\u201d allegation that he had molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992.  The allegation had gained renewed prominence in the #MeToo movement, which began in late 2017.  Allen has long denied the allegation, which was also made by Farrow\u2019s mother Mia Farrow, who appeared in a dozen of his films and was his longtime partner. He has not been charged.  Lawyers for Allen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Amazon\u2019s lawyer Moez Kaba declined to comment.  Cote said Allen and his Gravier Productions Inc failed to allege an \u201cactionable breach\u201d of his so-called multi-picture acquisition agreement, or MAA.  \u201cThe MAA provides certain benefits to Amazon, such as an exclusive \u2018first look\u2019 at Allen\u2019s subsequent literary and visual materials and the right to publicize the parties\u2019 agreements, but the plaintiffs do not allege that they suffered damages from the termination of these provisions,\u201d the judge wrote.  Allen had originally sued Amazon Content Services LLC and Amazon Studios LLC. The latter is no longer a defendant because it had faced only the now-dismissed unjust enrichment claim.  Allen has won four Oscars, including best director for 1977\u2019s \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d which also won best picture, and several actresses have won Oscars for work in his movies.  But the filmmaker has seen modest commercial returns for many of his films since his bitter breakup with Mia Farrow. Some actors and actresses have expressed regret for appearing in his films after Dylan Farrow\u2019s allegation gained renewed attention.  Variety said in May that Amazon had returned to Allen the domestic distribution rights for \u201cA Rainy Day in New York.\u201d The film is being released in Europe, according to media reports.

Shares fell 7%, as revenue growth for the company\u2019s lucrative cloud computing business also slowed down in the third quarter, missing analysts\u2019 estimates. Amazon beat expectations on overall third-quarter revenue, posting a sales rise of 24% to $70 billion.  The news underscores the big investment Amazon is making to cut delivery times to one day for its Prime loyalty members, a way to outmaneuver rivals such as Walmart Inc that have marketed two-day shipping without subscription fees.  Costs for that program will nearly double to $1.5 billion during the holiday season, from what Amazon spent on one-day delivery during the second quarter, the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts.  Expenses rose because the company has to move inventory closer to customers and beef up its last-mile transportation footprint to make the plan work, Olsavsky said. The company also is giving up the fees that shoppers used to pay for one-day shipping and is still learning what the long-term cost structure of the program will be, he said.  Amazon\u2019s rising headcount reflects its delivery ambitions. It hired nearly 100,000 full and part-time workers in the third quarter, bringing its staff size to over 400,000 in the United States and 750,000 globally.  \u201cBy and away the biggest driver this time is the people that we\u2019re adding for fulfillment and transportation roles,\u201d Olsavsky said.  Still, Amazon is betting that fast shipping will spark sales growth, a strategy that over years has helped it become the world\u2019s largest online retailer.  \u201cAmazon will not necessarily be spooked by the increase in costs,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail. \u201cIndeed, it sees the higher shipping expense as an investment in the Prime platform and as a way to retain the loyalty of its shoppers.\u201d  Amazon said earlier this year that it now delivers some 10% of its 100 million-plus Prime-eligible goods in one day in the United States. The Seattle-based company did not provide an updated number on Thursday.  DARKENING CLOUD?  Weak holiday quarter guidance has added to worries that the U.S.-China trade spat may be hurting the U.S. retail industry, and that one-day shipping might not be as big a boost as Amazon anticipates.  There was \u201chope that this investment would lead to a further revenue acceleration in the holiday quarter, whereas the company has guided to the opposite,\u201d said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell.  Boxes ready to be loaded onto a delivery truck move along a conveyor belt at the Amazon fulfilment centre in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  Holiday sales typically generate a large share of retailers\u2019 revenue and profit. Amazon\u2019s forecast of $80.0 billion to $86.5 billion in sales came short of $87.4 billion that analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company also said it expects holiday-quarter operating income to be between $1.2 billion and $2.9 billion, while analysts were expecting $4.19 billion, according to research firm FactSet.  Olsavsky attributed some of the weakness to the timing of events outside the United States, which pushed revenue into the third quarter. For instance, the company saw customers in Japan pre-order goods before a rise in consumption tax went into effect on Oct. 1, he said.  Olsavsky declined to comment to reporters on regulatory scrutiny the company is facing over alleged foul play with merchants on its platform, saying later that the company only succeeds if its sellers succeed. Sales such as fulfillment services for merchants, as well as ad and other sales to merchants, beat analysts\u2019 estimates in the third quarter.  Olsavsky also downplayed concerns about a slowdown in growth for one of the company\u2019s profit centers, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The unit, which handles data storage and computing operations for other enterprises, increased revenue 35% to $9.0 billion, the second quarter in a row in which its rate of growth was under 40%.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict the pace of some of the sales cycles and the enterprise migrations that companies are willing to make,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are having great success, and we\u2019re adding a lot (to) the sales force.\u201d  Not all analysts saw a risk-free future, particularly as the unit\u2019s operating expenses jumped 46% to $6.7 billion in the third quarter.

Amazon did not confirm the authenticity of the notes, which Vice News reported were from a daily meeting with the company\u2019s Chief Executive Jeff Bezos and senior leadership team.  David Zapolsky, Amazon\u2019s secretary and top lawyer, allegedly wrote that a worker who criticized Amazon\u2019s warehouse operation during the coronavirus pandemic was \u201cnot smart, or articulate\u201d and suggested Amazon might \u201cmake him the face of the entire union\/organizing movement.\u201d  Amazon and other businesses have provided vital deliveries as nearly 90% of the United States has been told by their governments to stay home to slow the spread of coronavirus. However, some employees have protested, saying the companies are not doing enough to protect their health.  Workers from at least 19 of Amazon\u2019s U.S. warehouses including in Staten Island, New York have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to media reports.  Amazon said it fired employee Christian Smalls after he came to the Staten Island warehouse for a demonstration Monday in violation of his paid quarantine. Smalls was in contact with a diagnosed coronavirus patient, Amazon said.  In a statement, Zapolsky said: \u201cI was frustrated and upset that an Amazon employee would endanger the health and safety of other Amazonians by repeatedly returning to the premises after having been warned to quarantine himself after exposure to virus COVID-19. I let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me.\u201d  Smalls, 31, told Reuters he planned to sue Amazon and was working with the New York Attorney General, who earlier called on the National Labor Relations Board to investigate the firing.  He said he was not a professional organizer but had stepped into the role to help people. \u201cI want to support those who are afraid to speak up,\u201d Smalls said.  The alleged comments by Zapolsky follow a contentious relationship Amazon has long had with unions that have wanted to organize its workforce.  The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which said it was working with Smalls, called the alleged behavior \u201cdisgusting!\u201d The affiliated United Food and Commercial Workers International Union said in a statement that federal regulators should investigate Amazon\u2019s actions and Zapolsky and other executives should be fired.

Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp were selected in April to continue competing for the Pentagon cloud computing services that is part of a broad modernization of Pentagon information technology systems.  The selection left Oracle Corp and IBM Corp out of the competition for the contract for the Defense Department\u2019s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud, or JEDI.  Trump has taken several swipes at Amazon since becoming president, complaining of unfair business practices and that the online retailer does not pay the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate for package delivery.  Amazon did not have an immediate comment.  Trump\u2019s criticism stems in part from his oft-expressed dislike of the Washington Post\u2019s critical coverage of his administration. Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos privately owns the Washington Post.  Oracle has complained about the contract award process, including expressing concern about the role of a former Amazon employee who worked on the JEDI project until recusing himself, then later left the Defense Department and returned to Amazon Web Services.  Oracle earlier this month lost a lawsuit challenging the contract award. A judge ruled Oracle did not have standing to claim it was wronged by the decision because it did not meet the contract requirements.

The partnership between the U.S.-based online retailer and the network of more than 16,700 stores reflects growing investment by Mexican brick-and-mortar businesses in e-commerce, which accounts for a fraction of the country\u2019s retail sales but is seen as key to growth.  \u201cWe are in the process of taking the number of stores that are part of the Amazon pilot to a significantly bigger scale,\u201d Juan Fonseca, investor relations director for the company known as Femsa, said in a call with analysts.  He did not reveal how many Oxxo stores would take part in the expanded pilot.  Shares of Femsa were up more than 4 percent to a high of 179.79 pesos despite results that showed net profit plunged to 2.02 million pesos ($110,692) in the first quarter from 3.29 billion pesos in the year-earlier period.  The company attributed the profit drop largely to its Coca-Cola bottling unit, one of the world\u2019s largest, which was hurt by the Mexican peso\u2019s appreciation against the U.S. dollar. The poor showing was partly offset by growth in Femsa\u2019s Oxxo stores, pharmacies and gas stations.  Oxxo\u2019s same-store sales increased 7.5 percent on average, benefiting from pre-Easter shopping in late March that lifted sales across the sector, including at Wal-Mart de Mexico and El Puerto de Liverpool.

Femsa Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Padilla cheered signs of a drop in Mexican inflation, saying the company\u2019s quarterly results were slightly better than expected. He added that the election environment along with demand during the upcoming World Cup soccer tournament in Russia should benefit Oxxo in the second quarter.

Citing a leaked memo from Amazon\u2019s general counsel to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Smalls also said Amazon fired him after concluding that as a Black man he was a \u201cweak spokesman\u201d for workers.  He also said Amazon tried to drum up public support by making him the \u201cface\u201d of workers criticizing its pandemic response.  The complaint seeks unspecified damages for Black and Hispanic workers at the Staten Island facility.

It fired at least three other workers critical of its pandemic response in April, citing various alleged workplace violations.

The data strategy and artificial intelligence discussion papers are part of a bigger scheme to help European companies better compete with U.S. tech giants and state-aided Chinese companies in the digital world.  European digital and antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager and European industry chief Thierry Breton will present the proposals around noon. They will come up with a final draft by the end of the year following feedback from interested parties.  The core of the EU\u2019s data strategy is the creation of a single European data market and smaller data markets centered on key industries, according to a draft seen by Reuters last month.  Other elements include new rules covering cross-border data use, data interoperability and standards related to manufacturing, climate change, the auto industry, healthcare, financial services, agriculture and energy.  One of the possibly controversial proposals calls for doing away with EU competition rules against anti-competitive data sharing.  In response to complaints about the power wielded by large online platforms, the Commission is also considering introducing rules to stop these companies from unilaterally imposing conditions for access and use of data or benefiting from this in a disproportionate manner.  The discussion paper on artificial intelligence aims to set up a framework to govern the use of this technology used by an increasing number of companies, a draft seen by Reuters showed. The rules would apply to high-risk sectors such as healthcare, transport and predictive policing.

A French court last week ordered Amazon to restrict its deliveries to bare essentials such as groceries and medical supplies while it makes thorough safety checks.  But Amazon went further and suspended activity at six so-called fulfilment centres where it processes and packs items, in one of the biggest fallouts from the backlash yet.

Graphic: FAANG Blunts its Tax Bill - reut.rs\/2I3okPN  The financial and technology sectors lead others in the size of their profits, and they also reduced their effective tax rates more than others during the most recent quarter.  In the latest big example, Apple Inc AAPL.O on Tuesday reported a $13.8 billion net profit for the March quarter, up $2.8 billion from the year before, with nearly half of that increase resulting from a reduced tax rate. Changes to how overseas profits are treated also allowed it to plow a record amount of cash into stock repurchases.  Companies\u2019 tax rates rise and fall over time for a variety of reasons, making it difficult to say how much of the quarter\u2019s broad tax-rate decline was a direct results of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December.  However, this quarter\u2019s drop in average tax rates provisioned by recently reporting S&P 500 companies was dramatic compared with changes in the same quarter in recent years, and many companies attributed their lower tax rates to the fiscal overhaul. The companies in the Thomson Reuters analysis had median tax rates of 27 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and 29 percent in the first quarter of 2016.  Intel INTC.O halved its tax rate in the first quarter to 11 percent, primarily because of the tax cuts, reducing the chipmaker's effective tax bill by around $560 million.  Amazon.com's AMZN.O tax rate declined by 9 percentage points in the March quarter, adding $170 million to its bottom line.  Morgan Stanley MS.N, Citigroup C.N, JPMorgan JPM.N, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and Bank of America BAC.N trimmed their tax bills by a combined $2 billion in the first quarter, compared to what they would have set aside using last year's tax rates.  About a third of expected U.S. corporate earnings expansion in the March quarter is a result of the tax cuts, a trend that is likely to continue through 2018, said Patrick Palfrey, an earnings analyst at Credit Suisse.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing is a very strong underlying growth trend, which is being driven by revenue and margin growth,\u201d Palfrey said. \u201cThat\u2019s being augmented by the tax change.\u201d  The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, the new law slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and reshapes how the government taxes multinational corporations.

S&P 500 information technology companies on average slashed their first-quarter effective tax rates by 9 percentage points, outdone only by the telecommunication group\u2019s 10 percent reduction. They are followed by financials, which on average cut their tax rates by 8 percentage points.  Apple cut its effective tax rate to 15 percent in the March quarter from 25 percent a year before.  Alphabet's GOOGL.O effective tax rate of 11 percent in the first quarter netted the Google owner an additional $1 billion in net income compared to what it would have earned using its tax rate of 20 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Alphabet attributed its lower tax rate to changes in accounting rules for reporting investments, as well as to the Tax Act.  Twitter TWTR.N said that $21 million of its $70 million increase in non-GAAP quarterly net income was due to the tax cut.

The change does not mean that Amazon will stop selling non-essential items like phone cases and toys for now, only that products may be more likely to run out of stock in the next few weeks or sellers have to ship the products directly to consumers themselves.  In a note sent to sellers on Tuesday, Amazon said it is seeing increasing online shopping demand from consumers. As its household staples and medical supplies are running out of stock, it will prioritize certain categories in order to \u201cquickly receive, restock, and ship these products to customers.\u201d  Amazon defined several categories as essential products that can continue shipping, including baby products; health and household items; beauty and personal care; grocery; industrial and scientific; and pet supplies. Books are included as well.  \u201cWe understand this is a change for our selling partners and appreciate their understanding as we temporarily prioritize these products for customers,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.  The company said the new protocol applies to both first-party vendors and third-party sellers. That suggests that the company is not protecting its own products.  The move follows Amazon\u2019s announcement it will hire 100,000 workers for its warehouses on Monday, as the Seattle-based giant is trying to meet growing online shopping need from people who stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.  DELAYED PRIME DELIVERY  The months-long outbreak is posing challenges to the e-commerce giant\u2019s operations, from supply chain to deliveries, as the virus spreads from China to the rest of the world.  \u201cOur factories just resumed production, but now we can\u2019t ship to warehouses until April,\u201d said Zengxie Pang, a China-based seller, \u201cWe are already seeing a rising demand for kitchen supplies and they will likely run out of stock, as well as other products people use when they\u2019re stuck at home.\u201d  Amazon\u2019s two-day shipping guarantee has also in some cases slowed to up to seven-day delivery, Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note. Tuesday\u2019s announcement aims to speed up the operation, at the risk of limiting the availability of non-essential items like electronics that typically are a big part of Amazon\u2019s business.  \u201cThis change will likely force some third-party sellers currently dependent on Amazon to shift sales to other marketplaces (eBay, Wish, Walmart, Facebook Marketplace, etc.), or onto their own websites,\u201d Sebastian said.  Third-party sellers account for over half of the sales on Amazon. Amazon has been courting sellers to use its own fulfillment system, enabling many of them with faster delivery without the risks of sitting on inventories.  It is especially popular for sellers who use a drop shipping method, meaning sellers import products from manufacturers in countries including China and directly send them to an Amazon warehouse. Amazon earns fees from managing the storage and delivery process.  Sellers supplying products that are deemed non-essential could see their products run out of stock and they will be unable to restock as a result of the measure. Still, they can use other fulfillment methods to directly mail products to customers.  One consultant said the announcement landed as third-party sellers were grappling with economic uncertainty amid the outbreak. Workers at bars, gyms, theaters and other non-essential businesses are furloughed to help contain the spread of the deadly virus and President Donald Trump on Monday said the U.S. economy may be sliding into recession.  \u201cSellers are rethinking their entire strategies for selling in 2020, not just Q1 and Prime Day,\u201d said Chris McCabe, founder of Amazon seller consultancy ecommerceChris.com.  Prime Day, scheduled for July every year, is Amazon\u2019s annual marketing blitz when sellers offer exclusive deals and discounts that contribute more sales than Black Friday. Sellers usually stock up on inventory ahead of the shopping holiday, while this decision adds uncertainty to when they could ship products in.  \u201cJust posting this announcement has a big impact on Prime Day,\u201d McCabe said.","1618":"May 15 (Reuters) - Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd:  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD TAKES SHARE STAKE IN WORLDPAY INC OF 2.2 MILLION SHARES  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD UPS SHARE STAKE IN ICICI BANK LTD TO 8.6 MILLION ADR FROM 2.8 MILLION ADR - SEC FILING  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD CUTS SHARE STAKE IN GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC BY 54.8 PERCENT TO 6,132 SHARES  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD TAKES SHARE STAKE OF 3.2 MILLION SHARES IN HOMOLOGY MEDICINES INC  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD TAKES SHARE STAKE OF 70,600 SHARES IN WALT DISNEY CO  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD CUTS SHARE STAKE IN AMAZON.COM INC BY 45.2 PERCENT TO 72,215 SHARES  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD CUTS SHARE STAKE IN MORGAN STANLEY BY 55.3 PERCENT TO 32,273 SHARES  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD CUTS SHARE STAKE IN EVOQUA WATER TECHNOLOGIES CO BY 25.3 PERCENT TO 6 MILLION SHARES  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD: CHANGE IN HOLDINGS ARE AS OF MARCH 31, 2018 AND COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS QUARTER ENDED AS OF DEC 31, 2017  * TEMASEK HOLDINGS (PRIVATE) LTD CUTS SHARE STAKE IN GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC BY 54.8 PERCENT TO 6,132 SHARES Source for the quarter ended Mar 31, 2018: bit.ly\/2GfUouE Source for the quarter ended Dec 31, 2017: bit.ly\/2EIA1d2","1619":"(Reuters) - Parler urged a U.S. judge on Thursday to order Amazon.com Inc to restore the company\u2019s account, saying Amazon had no evidence the social media platform was used to incite last week\u2019s storming of the U.S. Capitol.

It said that content included calls to assassinate Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg and members of the media.  Ambika Doran, a lawyer for Amazon, said Parler violated its contract by allowing such content and had not shown it could effectively monitor content.  \u201cAmazon made the only real choice that it could, which was to suspend the account,\u201d she said.  Parler said Amazon had no contractual right to pull the plug and did so in a politically motivated bid to benefit Twitter Inc, a larger Amazon client that Parler said did not censor violent content targeting conservatives.

The device, known as Portal, comes in $199 and $349 versions and its signature feature is a wide-angle camera that automatically keeps users in focus as they move about a room, Facebook hardware executives told Reuters in a meeting last week.  They said Portal is available at Amazon and Best Buy stores in addition to Facebook.com and starts shipping to U.S. customers in early November.  Smart speakers costing under $100 from Amazon and Google have become best sellers in the nascent industry. Users issue voice commands to search, shop and listen to music, turning the speakers into a major funnel into the technology companies\u2019 competing networks.  Portal could help Facebook stop users from flocking to rival chat and video apps on other speakers and give it a new, wholly controlled environment to sell ads.  About 32 percent of U.S. consumers own a smart speaker, but another 16 percent plan to buy one by the end of 2018, according to an Adobe Analytics survey released last month.  Facebook expects to stand apart on the market because of Portal\u2019s touchscreen and the 400 million people who call through its Messenger service each month worldwide. Rival smart speakers with screens lack a video-chatting app that is as popular.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Still, Amazon has shipped 1 million of its Echo speakers with displays over the last year, according to research firm Canalys, which expects 4 million such devices across brands to ship globally next year.  Portal\u2019s camera, which uses a form of artificial intelligence to recognize body shapes, is a major marketing point, offering users the convenience of staying in the frame without having to adjust the device.  \u201cOur goal is to make you feel present in the same space as the person on the other end,\u201d said Rafa Camargo, the Facebook vice president overseeing Portal.  The launch of the product comes at a tricky time for Facebook. Last month, it announced an attacker gained the ability to take over 50 million user accounts because of software flaws.  Scrutiny this year over Facebook\u2019s privacy and content moderation practices have led some people to abandon the service and the company to warn of thinning profits.  Portal locks with a passcode, and its microphones and camera shuts off with the tap of a button. Video and voice calls are encrypted and contents of them are not stored, the company said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Users can conference with any Messenger user.  Portal integrates Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant to handle search queries, and Amazon collects audio files of requests made to Alexa.  The higher-priced Portal\u2019s screen is 15.6 inches, versus 10 inches. Both display photos and notifications from Facebook and videos from Food Network, but offer few other applications.  Additional features are available during calls, including joint listening on Spotify. A handful of animated e-books such as \u201cItsy Bitsy Spider\u201d will be included at launch for interactive story time.  Portal runs on the open-source version of Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system, similar to many Amazon devices.  Facebook\u2019s previous hardware, including its Oculus virtual reality headset and a phone developed with HTC, gained little adoption.  (This version of the story corrects paragraph 15 to say Amazon, not Facebook, collects audio of Alexa queries)","1621":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India\u2019s federal government will regulate content on video streaming platforms, including global services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Walt Disney\u2019s Hotstar, as part of rules announced this week.

Streaming services have gained traction in India because of the availability of affordable smartphones and cheap mobile data, making the South Asian nation a battleground for Amazon, Netflix and Disney as they seek to expand outside their home markets.

Some staff, elected officials and unions in recent months have said Amazon put employees\u2019 health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic. Amazon said its rate of infection was 42% lower than expected when considering the virus\u2019 spread in the general population.  Amazon in a blog post here encouraged other businesses to report comparable figures. It said it will expand virus testing to 50,000 U.S. employees per day by November through internally built capacity.  The disclosure by Amazon offers a rare look at the disease\u2019s impact on a big U.S. employer. Amazon has kept facilities open to meet a surge in demand from shoppers stuck at home, adding temperature checks, social distancing software and other safety procedures.  Athena, a labor and activist coalition, called on officials to investigate Amazon and for more regular reporting by the company in light of the news. \u201cAmazon allowed COVID-19 to spread like wildfire,\u201d coalition director Dania Rajendra said in a statement.  Amazon said that out of its 1,372,000 frontline employees at Amazon and its Whole Foods Market subsidiary, 19,816 tested positive or were presumed to have COVID-19 between March 1 and Sept. 19. The figure includes seasonal staff and those who may have been infected outside work, it said.  By contrast, 33,952 would have contracted the virus had Amazon\u2019s rate equaled that of the general populace, when accounting for employees\u2019 age and geography, it said.  Minnesota had the highest rate with nearly 32 infections per 1,000 workers, versus nearly 16 for the public. Amazon has butted heads with a labor group there; it did not have comment on the specific rate.  \u201cThis information would be more powerful if there were similar data from other major employers to compare it to,\u201d Amazon said in the blog post, adding that it hopes the numbers \u201cwill prove useful as states make decisions about reopening public facilities and employers consider whether and how to bring people back to work.\u201d","1623":"(Adds details on antitrust probes, byline)  LAS VEGAS, June 5 (Reuters) - One of Amazon.com Inc\u2019s top executives on Wednesday responded to reported information gathering by U.S. antitrust enforcers and to calls by some critics to break up the company with a simple message: we welcome any review.  \u201cSubstantial entities in the economy deserve scrutiny, and our job is to build the kind of company that passes that scrutiny,\u201d Jeff Wilke, the CEO of Amazon\u2019s consumer business, said at a press conference in Las Vegas.

Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage, following a period of \u201cloving exploration\u201d and trial separation. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.  Shortly after that, Bezos opened an investigation into the leak led by Gavin de Becker, a longtime security consultant and former appointee of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. De Becker proceeded to tell media that the leak was politically motivated.  Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, have all been targets of attacks on Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  The Washington Post has published many articles critical of the president. It acts as Amazon\u2019s \u201cchief lobbyist,\u201d Trump has said on Twitter, without presenting evidence.

In his blog, Bezos cited an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposed a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that \u201cthey have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI\u2019s) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u201d  In return for such an acknowledgement, according to the email, AMI offered \u201cnot to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos.\u201d  Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an \u201cextortionate proposal.\u201d  Fine and de Becker could not immediately be reached for comment.  The alleged extortion raises questions among some legal observers about whether AMI and its chief executive David Pecker have violated a cooperation agreement AMI made last year with federal prosecutors in connection with a $150,000 hush-money payment given to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claims she had an affair with President Donald Trump.  The payment was made during the 2016 presidential election to influence that election, according to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The deal not to prosecute was conditional on AMI not committing another crime, the office said.  A spokesman for the SDNY attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the matter.

Hollandse Kust Noord, located off the Dutch coast, will have a total capacity of 759 MW and is scheduled to become operational in 2023, when it will generate at least 3.3 terawatt hours (TWh) per year, Eneco said.  Mitsubishi, along with Japanese utility Chubu Electric Power Co Inc, bought Eneco last year in a deal valuing the Dutch energy firm at 4.1 billion euros ($4.9 billion).  Japanese trading houses as well as global oil and gas majors such as Shell, are increasingly focusing on cleaner energy as they join a global shift away from coal and other fossil fuels.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Russia\u2019s Roskomnadzor watchdog began blocking Telegram, a messaging service popular in Russia, on Monday after it refused to comply with a court order to grant state security services access to its users\u2019 encrypted messages.  Roskomnadzor\u2019s head Alexander Zharov said it had blocked 18 sub-networks and a significant number of IP-addresses belonging to Google and Amazon, the Interfax news agency reported.  \u201cWe have currently informed both companies that a significant number of IP addresses located in the clouds of these two services have fallen under the block on the basis of the court ruling (to block Telegram),\u201d Zharov was quoted as saying.  Blocking the IP addresses has prevented Russian internet users from accessing Telegram and other services that route content through Google and Amazon servers.  Some users have circumvented the block by using virtual private networks, which make it seem as though they were accessing the internet from another country.  Zharov told Interfax that Roskomnadzor hoped it would receive \u201clegally meaningful\u201d responses from Amazon and Google by Wednesday.  The U.S. companies did not immediately respond on Tuesday to a request from Reuters for comment on the Russian move.  \u201cDIGITAL RESISTANCE\u201d  Telegram CEO Pavel Durov called on Tuesday for \u201cdigital resistance\u201d, saying he was prepared to give out millions of dollars worth of grants in bitcoin digital currency to individuals and companies that run proxies and VPNs to support internet freedom.  Writing on his Telegram channel, Durov said there had not been a significant drop in users of the service in Russia since the ban took effect because users were using VPNs and proxies to access the messenger. He also thanked Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft \u201cfor not taking part in political censorship\u201d.  Durov, a pioneer of social media in Russia, left the country in 2014 and has become a vocal critic of the Kremlin\u2019s policies on internet freedom.  Telegram is widely used in countries across the former Soviet Union and Middle East. Durov said on Tuesday that Russians account for about 7 percent of its users.  As well as being popular with journalists and members of Russia\u2019s political opposition, Telegram has also been used by the Kremlin to communicate with reporters and arrange regular conference calls with President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman.  On Monday the spokesman\u2019s office asked journalists who were previously subscribed to a chat in Telegram to switch to a chat that had been set up in a different messaging service, ICQ, which is part of the Russian Mail.ru technology group (MAILRq.L).","1632":"A U.S. appeals court has asked Pennsylvania\u2019s top state court to decide whether state wage law, unlike its federal counterpart, requires Amazon Inc and a staffing company to pay warehouse employees for time they spend in security screenings at the end of their shifts.

REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - New Yorkers aren\u2019t known for their avoidance of conflict. Amazon has waded into a spat with the city over incentives it won in return for choosing New York as the location for half of its second headquarters, known as HQ2. The fact that other big companies have created jobs without such fanfare weakens Amazon\u2019s hand, but the Big Apple deserves one more shot.  State and city lawmakers have been scrutinizing the deal Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce giant made behind closed doors with Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. New York City Council members are concerned about the lack of independent analysis over the deal. State Senator Michael Gianaris, who represents the Queens neighborhood that Amazon selected, was nominated to a committee that could veto the agreement, which also includes a $2.5 billion investment from the company.  The $3 billion in incentives Amazon stands to achieve look generous, even if they are based on performance. Consider the $1.2 billion in tax credits through the Excelsior Jobs Program for the 25,000 jobs the company plans to add. That represents $48,000 per job, about six times more than what Morgan Stanley received between 2013 and 2015. While the comparison is rough, Apple got about one-tenth as much from Texas between 2012 and 2017.  Amazon doesn\u2019t really need anything like what it\u2019s getting. The $780 billion company is expected to generate $25 billion in pre-tax profit in 2020, according to I\/B\/E\/S estimates from Refinitiv. Being close to a fertile market for talented young professionals is its own reward. And Google, the search engine that\u2019s part of Alphabet, is investing $1 billion in a new campus in Manhattan and renting space elsewhere in the city, but hasn\u2019t availed itself of goodies like the Excelsior program.  Bezos\u2019 firm is considering walking away, according to Reuters and the Washington Post. But offering to halve the incentives would be more sensible. After all, New York has a reason not to let Amazon get away too easily: if the company\u2019s plans come off, it will be the fifth-biggest private employer in the city, according to 2017 data from Crain\u2019s New York Business.  More importantly, Amazon is negotiating the beginning of a relationship that could last for decades. If New York\u2019s lawmakers are determined to make life tough, it\u2019s a sign that Amazon is probably better off elsewhere.","1638":"March 28 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Composite index opened lower on Wednesday, pulled lower by Apple, Intel and Amazon, while the S&P 500 and the Dow rose on gains in financial and healthcare stocks.

REUTERS\/Kevin Mohatt  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amazon.com can be held liable like other traditional retailers for injuries from defective products sold via its sprawling e-commerce marketplace, a California state appeals court ruled on Thursday.  The decision overturned a San Diego Superior Court ruling that the world\u2019s biggest online retailer was shielded from liability because it acted as a service provider, which is not subject to California product liability law.  In addition to selling its own inventory, Amazon allows third-party vendors to list products for sale on its website. Such vendors may store their products in Amazon\u2019s warehouses or ship them directly to customers.  The appeals court found that Amazon played a pivotal role in every step of plaintiff Angela Bolger\u2019s purchase of a replacement laptop battery from Amazon third-party seller Lenoge Technology HK Ltd, which was operating under the fictitious name \u201cE-Life.\u201d Bolger alleged that the battery burst into flames while she balanced the laptop on her thighs, resulting in severe burns to her arms, legs and feet.  \u201cWhatever term we use to describe Amazon\u2019s role, be it \u2018retailer,\u2019 \u2018distributor,\u2019 or merely \u2018facilitator,\u2019 it was pivotal in bringing the product here to the consumer,\u201d the appeals court held.  Amazon has faced multiple lawsuits seeking to hold it responsible for damage or injuries caused by defective products sold by third parties, including ones based overseas in China, with most courts concluding it is not a \u201cseller\u201d under various states\u2019 product liability laws. But a few rulings have gone the other way and have allowed Amazon to be sued.  Both Pennsylvania\u2019s and Ohio\u2019s top courts are currently considering the issue, and federal appeals courts are weighing cases under California and Texas law.  The case decided on Thursday drew friend-of-the-court briefs from plaintiff lawyer groups and corporate groups.  The ruling comes as California lawmakers weigh legislation that would put Amazon and other operators of online marketplaces on equal footing under the state\u2019s strict liability law.","1640":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday it would buy small online pharmacy PillPack, a move that will put the world\u2019s biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains, drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managers.  The deal\u2019s potential to disrupt major players across the drug supply chain nationwide prompted a sell-off in shares of possible rivals, while sending Amazon shares up 2.5 percent.  PillPack supplies pre-sorted prescription drugs and other services to people who take multiple medications, a growing market as the U.S. population ages and requires treatment for multiple complex, chronic conditions.  Amazon is vying for a share of what is a more than $450 billion total U.S. prescription drug market, according to research firm IQVIA. Although PillPack expects sales to exceed only about $100 million this year, Amazon\u2019s huge customer base and existing shipping infrastructure could allow the company to scale up quickly.  Amazon could also negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies, giving them the ability to offer cheap generic drugs even to customers without health insurance, according to industry experts. But it will face deeply entrenched competition dominated by pharmacies run by CVS Health, Walgreen Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc, and pharmacy benefits provided by CVS, Express Scripts UnitedHealth Group.  \u201cAmazon\u2019s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.  The value of the deal was not disclosed. Bloomberg reported it to be $1 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers lost about $14 billion in market value on Thursday, while Amazon gained about $5.5 billion.  Shares of CVS closed down 6.1 percent, while Walgreen fell 10 percent. Shares of drug wholesalers McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen all fell.  JOINT VENTURE  The news comes just a week after a joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co named a CEO who will be tasked with significantly cutting healthcare costs for its estimated 1 million employees and dependents.  Although brick-and-mortar stores might feel the effects of Amazon\u2019s competition, the biggest battles will likely be fought by mail-order pharmacies, which generally serve patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease that may require drugs to control blood pressure, cholesterol and other problems.  PillPack said it has tens of thousands of customers across the country. But its expectation of over $100 million in 2018 revenue pales compared with larger rivals. CVS last year had about $45.7 billion in revenue from its mail order pharmacy business, accounting for about 15 percent of its pharmacy claims.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription drug pricing for employers and health plans and run large mail-order pharmacies, offering incentives to patients to fill prescriptions with them.  Doctors and PBMs have long said patients not properly taking their medicines is one of the main causes of increased healthcare costs, leading to hospitalizations and more severe health issues. Companies like PillPack and Express Scripts that offer care management services to improve patient compliance are seen as increasingly important in helping control rising costs.  With Amazon\u2019s announcement Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes, in a note, said pending health insurer\/PBM mergers of Aetna Inc with CVS and Cigna Corp with Express Scripts \u201care even more critical now.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  NOT WORRIED  Walgreen CEO Stefano Pessina, on a conference call after reporting quarterly results, said he was \u201cnot particularly worried\u201d about the PillPack deal.  \u201cThe pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages,\u201d Pessina said.  That said, Pessina added, \u201cWe know that we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working quite hard on that direction.\u201d  Some analysts played down the immediate threat.  \u201cI believe they bought this to learn about the market and to determine if they are able to make larger investments,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj.  Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper noted that PBMs typically require health plan members to use their own mail order pharmacies.  He said PillPack could be kicked out of current PBM networks, \u201cespecially if Amazon has designs of significantly ramping its prescription volume.\u201d  Express Scripts dropped PillPack from its network in April 2016, alleging that it had misrepresented itself as a retail pharmacy. The two reached an agreement a month later.  PillPack holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. It is an in-network pharmacy for some PBMs and for major Medicare Part D plans, a federal drug benefit to help Medicare beneficiaries pay for self-administered prescription medicines.  PillPack had attracted interest from Walmart Inc, which was looking to buy it for less than $1 billion, CNBC reported in April. The Amazon deal is expected to close during the second half of 2018.

A scathing antitrust report in October from the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel published details of what it said was Amazon\u2019s anti-competitive behavior and suggested barring the company from operating its online marketplace, in which it also competes. Amazon had pushed back against the report before it was released, saying that market interventions \u201cwould kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices and reducing consumer choice.\u201d  Amazon\u2019s online marketplace has come under increasing scrutiny over how it treats sellers, gathers data from such sellers and launches competing products.

An Amazon.com Inc worker prepares an order in which the buyer asked for an item to be gift wrapped at a fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota, U.S., November 12, 2020. Amazon.com Inc\/Handout via REUTERS  The new services seek to take some of the drudgery out of gift-giving. The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift\u2019s price.  Amazon\u2019s rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving.  Consumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share.  \u201cThis is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,\u201d said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon\u2019s ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient.  Walmart.com on Oct. 28 added a \u201cgift eligible\u201d label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging.  With gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.  BestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered.  Estee Lauder Companies Inc EL.N this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping.

Adobe Inc's ADBE.O e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship gifts to 18% more recipients than a year ago as travel gets curbed.  But Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019.  Amazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon\u2019s product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1\/2 times the rate over the same period last year.  It pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon\u2019s largest ever.  The company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts and messages for some items, with links to let recipients initiate a return and send a thank you note.  MYSTERIOUS SENDER  But some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card.  \u201cThe gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,\u201d said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked.  Amazon said its gift features remain popular.  Jeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper.  Though Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he \u201clearned his lesson.\u201d"}}
