( 2 images )  COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk\u2019s experimental diabetes pill, which it hopes will transform the diabetes market, has proved superior to both Merck & Co\u2019s Januvia and its own best-selling injectable treatment Victoza in tests.  The positive results in the latest of a series of pivotal clinical trials boost analysts\u2019 expectations that Novo\u2019s oral semaglutide medicine could become a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. Novo shares jumped more than 4 percent in early trade on Thursday.  The trial against Victoza, a once-daily injection, met the primary endpoint of similar blood sugar reduction but was also superior on weight loss, Novo said in a statement late on Wednesday.  \u201cThis data is important, as it positions oral-sema as at least as good as the market leading injectable GLP-1,\u201d said Deutsche Bank analysts.  The once-daily pill belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production, the first of which were derived from the venomous bite of North America\u2019s Gila monster lizard. So far, all have been injections.  Deutsche believes oral semaglutide could eventually sell more than $5 billion a year and allow Novo to grow sales in the high-margin GLP-1 diabetes segment for years to come, with the new product potentially priced closer to expensive injections than cheaper diabetes pills.  Analysts from Bernstein also said the outcome was stronger than anticipated.  The outcome of the trial against Merck\u2019s Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin, showed Novo\u2019s new drug was superior in demonstrating reductions in both long-term blood sugar level and weight, Novo said.  The success of oral semaglutide in the Phase III trials is a fillip for a medicine seen as important for ensuring the group\u2019s long-term growth in a highly competitive diabetes market. It follows earlier results from other Phase III studies that have also been positive.","1":"(Corrects source to \u201cWorld Health Organization\u201d from \u201cMerck & Co Inc\u201d)  Oct 18 (Reuters) - World Health Organization:  * WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAYS \u201cWELCOMES\u201d THE EMA ANNOUNCEMENT RECOMMENDING A CONDITIONAL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR MERCK\u2019S V920 EBOLA ZAIRE VACCINE  * WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION SAYS WILL MOVE TOWARDS PREQUALIFICATION OF MERCK'S V920 EBOLA ZAIRE VACCINE Source: (bit.ly\/2P16jES) Further company coverage:","2":"May 18 (Reuters) - FDA:  * U.S. FDA - ISSUES ALERT ABOUT DECREASED SURVIVAL ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF KEYTRUDA (PEMBROLIZUMAB) OR TECENTRIQ (ATEZOLIZUMAB)  * U.S. FDA SAYS THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE ADVERSE EVENT PROFILE OF KEYTRUDA OR TECENTRIQ  * FDA - MERCK, GENENTECH HAVE STOPPED ENROLLING PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS HAVE PD-L1 LOW STATUS TO KEYTRUDA\/TECENTRIQ MONOTHERAPY ARMS PER DMCS\u2019 RECOMMENDATIONS  * U.S. FDA SAYS MONOTHERAPY ARMS REMAIN OPEN ONLY TO PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS HAVE PD-L1 HIGH STATUS  * U.S. FDA - COMBINATION ARMS AND THE CHEMOTHERAPY ARMS OF BOTH STUDIES ALSO REMAIN OPEN  * FDA - ISSUED ALERT ON KEYTRUDA\/TECENTRIQ AS MONOTHERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH UROTHELIAL CANCER WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED PRIOR THERAPY, HAVE LOW EXPRESSION OF PD-L1 Source text : (bit.ly\/2k9egH8) Further company coverage:","3":"Jan 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday it approved Merck & Co Inc\u2019s Keytruda for the treatment of a type of bladder cancer.

The drug was approved as the first therapy in over a decade in the United States to treat previously untreated patients with an advanced or intermediate stage of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  \u201cThe price at which the recommended starting dose of Lenvima for unresectable HCC will be sold to wholesalers, excluding discounts, is $16,970 for a 30-day supply,\u201d Eisai told Reuters.  The price will be \u201cin parity\u201d with the prices of available doses, Chief Operating Officer Shaji Procida said.  The health regulator\u2019s decision also marks the first U.S. approval born of Eisai\u2019s drug development collaboration with Merck & Co Inc.  Under a deal here signed in March, the companies agreed to split profits from global sales of Lenvima, even for already-approved uses in thyroid cancer and in combination with another drug for kidney cancer.  Lenvima is expected to bring in revenue of $3.46 billion by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The latest approval here by the FDA also bodes well for Merck as investors remain concerned about its increasing reliance on blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Keytruda.  A wider adoption of Lenvima could help allay some of these fears by providing another \u201creasonable source of support\u201d to the company, analysts have said.","5":"(Reuters) - Newly unsealed court documents and other records show that Merck & Co and U.S. regulators knew about reports of suicidal behavior in men taking the company\u2019s anti-baldness treatment Propecia when they decided not to warn consumers of those potential risks in a 2011 update of the popular drug\u2019s label.  FILE PHOTO: A bottle of Propecia is seen on a pharmacy shelf in New York City, U.S., August 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Zachary Goelman  Internal records from Merck were made public in late January, when a federal magistrate in Brooklyn, New York, granted a 2019 Reuters motion to unseal 11 documents filed in years of litigation alleging Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction and other harmful side effects.  Since the 2011 decision on the warning, the FDA has received more than 700 reports of suicide and suicidal thoughts among people taking Propecia or generic versions of the drug. Those included at least 100 deaths. Before that, in the first 14 years the drug was on the market, the agency received 34 such reports, including 10 deaths.  Annual U.S. prescriptions of finasteride, as the drug is known, for hair loss increased to over 2.4 million in 2020, more than double the number in 2015, according to health data company IQVIA.  European and Canadian regulators, citing similar reports among men taking finasteride, require a warning of suicidal thoughts on the label, though they note that research has not proved that the drug causes such thoughts. To this day, the U.S. label contains no mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts.  As early as 2009, Merck knew of more than 200 reports of depression, including suicidal thoughts, in men taking Propecia, according to an internal \u201crisk management\u201d assessment from that year. The company decided there were too few reports of serious depression and suicidal behavior and not enough specifics about those cases to warrant more than \u201croutine\u201d monitoring of safety data.  In 2011, two years after the Merck risk analysis, the FDA was weighing a company request to add \u201cdepression\u201d to the drug\u2019s label as a potential risk, with no warnings related to suicide. FDA analysts disagreed about adding a warning related to suicide, according to previously unreported government documents. But the regulator ultimately agreed with Merck\u2019s request on the grounds that the number of suicides was lower than one would expect in this group of patients.  CALLS FOR TRANSPARENCY  Some medical researchers and patient advocates said Merck and the FDA have left American consumers in the dark about potentially life-threatening dangers associated with finasteride.  \u201cNo family should ever have to learn about this after the fact,\u201d said Kim Witczak, a consumer advocate who serves on an FDA advisory panel for psychiatric drugs. She has called for drug companies and regulators to issue stronger warnings after her husband died from suicide in 2003 five weeks after being prescribed an antidepressant for insomnia. Merck \u201chad an opportunity to put suicide on the label, but they didn\u2019t want to do that because it\u2019s all about sales.\u201d  Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist and Harvard Medical School faculty member whose own research has found possible links between finasteride and suicidal behaviors, said Merck\u2019s handling of the risk analysis and the FDA\u2019s inaction keep critical information from the public. Merck \u201cdefinitely should have provided a more complete picture,\u201d Irwig said.  In a statement to Reuters, Merck said that \u201cthe scientific evidence does not support a causal link between Propecia and suicide or suicidal ideation and these terms should not be included in the labeling\u201d for the drug. \u201cMerck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia.\u201d  Merck has said in past statements that Propecia has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. It also has argued in court that \u201cpremature hair loss itself, the very condition for which Propecia is prescribed, is associated with low self-esteem, poor body image, and depression.\u201d  In a statement, FDA said it \u201ccontinues to monitor postmarketing safety data for Propecia.\u201d Overall, the agency noted that the presence of a report in the FDA database \u201cdoes not mean the drug caused the adverse event\u201d and medical problems may stem from the \u201cunderlying disease being treated, caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons.\u201d  FDA declined to comment further about its handling of Propecia and reports related to suicide.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Merck\u2019s analysis of a potential suicide risk stayed secret in court for over three years -- and only became public after Reuters intervened in the proceeding. The insights in the recently unsealed documents echo findings from Reuters\u2019 2019 investigation, \u201cHidden Injustice,\u201d which revealed how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in lawsuits information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one.  The Reuters investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products -- including drugs, cars and medical devices -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden.  In granting Reuters\u2019 motion to unseal Merck documents, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo last month ruled that the company\u2019s arguments for continued secrecy \u201care so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.\u201d  INTERNAL DIFFERENCES  In addition to the risk management plan, Kuo unsealed other Merck documents including an internal marketing report from prior to the drug\u2019s launch and some communications with regulators regarding sexual dysfunction. Reuters obtained the FDA documents discussing suicide from a separate online repository maintained by the agency.  In 2010, while reviewing Merck\u2019s proposal to add potential depression risk to Propecia\u2019s label, an FDA safety evaluator recommended also adding a warning for suicidal thoughts and behavior, noting nine suicides and reports of other suicidal behaviors among patients who took finasteride, the FDA documents reviewed by Reuters show.  The reports of suicidal behavior analyzed by Merck and government regulators, known as \u201cadverse event\u201d reports, are filed by consumers, doctors and other members of the public. They are compiled in a public database by U.S. regulators, as well as drug-safety agencies in other countries.  In her November 2010 report, FDA safety evaluator Namita Kothary wrote that the nine suicides were difficult to assess due to incomplete information. \u201cHowever, we cannot exclude that finasteride may have contributed to the events,\u201d she wrote. Kothary did not respond to requests for comment.  Two other FDA reviewers disagreed. The two physicians -- Amy Woitach and David Kettl -- said the data supported adding depression to the label. Suicidal ideation, however, should be left off because the number of suicidal thoughts, attempts and deaths was \u201clower than would be expected in this patient population,\u201d according to their December 2010 report. Kettl and Woitach did not respond to requests for comment.  The European Medicines Agency found the relationship between finasteride and depression was hard to assess, but still required a warning about suicidal ideation in 2017, in part because Propecia is not prescribed for a serious condition, according to EMA committee meeting minutes. Doctors and patients generally weigh risks differently for a drug to treat a life-threatening health problem, versus something less severe.  When Health Canada required its warning in 2019, it noted 368 international reports of suicidal events reported in patients treated with finasteride through September 2018. Merck did not respond to questions about these regulatory moves.  The FDA approved Propecia in 1997, and sales climbed steadily through the 2000s, peaking at $447 million in 2010. Soon after, Merck\u2019s patent expired. Overall sales of finasteride have remained strong as cheaper generic versions have hit the market.  PERSISTENT DYSFUNCTION  The new information regarding a potential suicide risk emerged as a result of longstanding controversy about sexual problems associated with the drugs.  From the beginning, Merck\u2019s label said Propecia caused sexual dysfunction in nearly 4% of its clinical study participants. However, the 2009 risk management report also shows that the company was aware of reports that those sexual problems continued for some men after they stopped taking the drug.  The FDA in 2012 approved Merck\u2019s request to add a warning of erectile dysfunction that continued after stopping the drug, as well as \u201clibido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders.\u201d Even so, Merck at the time said scientific evidence did not establish that Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction.  The warning prompted more than 1,100 lawsuits against Merck by men alleging their sexual problems lasted long after they stopped taking Propecia. Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of the lawsuits consolidated before Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn federal court for a combined $4.3 million.  Reuters reported in 2019 that prior to the settlement, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers had alleged that Merck, when revising the drug\u2019s original label, understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. The allegation was part of a sealed court brief a Reuters reporter was able to read because of a redaction error. The brief cited internal Merck communications, filed under seal. Reuters intervened in the case, seeking to unseal those communications.  \u201cIMPORTANT POTENTIAL RISK\u201d  The 2009 risk management report unsealed last month shows that while depression did not emerge as a risk in clinical trials, Merck deemed it an \u201cimportant potential risk\u201d after the company received 218 global reports of depression from 1998 to 2008. Of those, 10 involved serious depression, and an additional nine involved suicidal behavior.  Merck noted limitations with both the depression reports and the nine involving suicidal behavior. Four provided \u201cinsufficient information to allow a full evaluation.\u201d Three of the men had other medical conditions, and for two, the symptoms developed after they stopped taking the drug.  \u201cOne fatal report was received from a sheriff\u2019s office and described a male who committed suicide by shooting,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe medical examiner did not think this event was related to Propecia, in addition, the report provided insufficient information to allow for assessment.\u201d  The report contained no additional details about the patient\u2019s identity or the medical examiner\u2019s investigation. Merck did not respond to questions about what steps it took to learn more about the case.  In its statement to Reuters, Merck said adverse event reports reflect only the opinions of the person who files them. \u201cWhile consumers and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse events, the reaction may have been related to the underlying disease being treated, or caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons,\u201d the company said.  Dr W. Vaughn McCall, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior at the Medical College of Georgia, agreed that relying on adverse event reports to monitor drug safety has its limitations. However, he said one of those limitations is that injuries and deaths are often underreported because people aren\u2019t familiar with the process or don\u2019t have time to examine a specific case.  He said there is a plausible biological explanation for a potential link between Propecia and suicidal thoughts. The drug reduces a testosterone-related hormone, which in turn could impact an anti-depressive steroid produced in the body.  \u201cThere is a reason to be suspicious,\u201d McCall said.","6":"(Reuters) - Moderna Inc and Merck & Co on Tuesday told a U.S. Congressional panel that they expect to profit from their coronavirus vaccines once approved, amid concerns the vaccines may not be accessible to all.

Merck\u2019s has yet to begin human studies of its experimental vaccine, lagging the leading candidates.  Executives from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc testified that they will price their respective potential vaccines at no profit while the pandemic rages on.  Gerberding and a representative from Moderna did not comment on the price they have in mind for their vaccines at the hearing, which focused on efforts to develop a safe, effective and widely accessible vaccine against COVID-19, which has claimed 600,000 lives globally.  Pfizer Inc has said the company intends to make a profit from its potential coronavirus vaccine if approved. However, Pfizer Chief Business Officer John Young, testified: \u201cWe recognize that these are extraordinary times and our price will reflect that.\u201d  Unlike rivals Moderna and AstraZeneca, Pfizer has not received funding from the United States for its vaccine development.  Lawmakers questioned whether Pfizer had declined government funding so it could price the vaccine at a profit.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t access federal funding solely for the reason that we wanted to move the vaccine faster to the clinic,\u201d Young said.  AstraZeneca said its vaccine would be provided at no profit under its agreement with the United States for allocation of some 300 million doses.  More than 150 coronavirus vaccines using a variety of technologies are in development globally, with some two dozen already in human trials. The aim is to produce vaccines that can end the pandemic by protecting billions of people from infection or severe illness. Whether any will succeed or be available by the U.S. government\u2019s stated goal of having one by late this year remains far from clear.  \u201cSpeed is important,\u201d Gerberding said of the vaccine development, \u201cbut we will not compromise scientific efficacy, quality, and above all, safety, despite the sense of urgency we all feel.\u201d","7":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Merck is pictured in this illustration photograph in Cardiff, California, U.S., April 26, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - The combination of Merck & Co\u2019s immunotherapy Keytruda and chemotherapy boosted response rates in patients with advanced hard-to-treat squamous cell lung cancer, the company said on Wednesday.  An early look at results of a 204-patient trial showed an overall response rate of 58.4 percent for newly-diagnosed patients given Keytruda plus carboplatin and paclitaxel or Celgene Corp\u2019s Abraxane. That compared to 35 percent for chemotherapy alone.  The interim results will be discussed in greater detail next month at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), where data from several Keytruda trials and other therapies that help the immune system fight cancer will be presented. Data on a rival Roche drug from a similar squamous cell lung cancer trial will be featured at the meeting.  The duration of response was more than six months in 65.8 percent of patients given the Keytruda regimen compared with 45.6 percent of those who received chemotherapy alone, Merck said.  Serious side effects were seen in 64.4 percent of Keytruda patients and 74.5 percent of patients given just chemotherapy.  Keytruda is the only immunotherapy approved in the United States to treat lung cancer patients who have not received prior treatment. That approval is for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of the disease.  Squamous cell, a type of NSCLC, accounts for about 30 percent of all lung cancers, according to the American Cancer Society. People diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer typically have a poor prognosis since the disease is often first diagnosed after it has spread.","8":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA\u2019s drug development programme has suffered a setback with its most important experimental drug, cancer treatment bintrafusp alfa, failing early in its lead trial.  FILE PHOTO: A logo of drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA is pictured in Darmstadt, Germany January 28, 2016. REUTERS\/Ralph Orlowski  In a statement on Wednesday, Merck KGaA said independent supervisors of the late-stage study, which was testing the drug against U.S. namesake Merck & Co\u2019s bestseller Keytruda in newly diagnosed cases of a certain type of lung cancer, concluded the drug was unlikely to show the desired effect.  The failure also puts a damper on the oncology ambitions of Britain\u2019s GlaxoSmithKline, which is co-developing the drug with Merck under a 2019 agreement that could have seen it pay up to 3.7 billion euros ($4.5 billion) to the German company.  Merck KGaA\u2019s shares dropped as much as 7% after the news that the INTR@PID Lung 037 trial was stopped but pared losses to trade 3.1% lower at 1455 GMT. GSK dropped 2.1% while the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index was little changed.  Keytruda dominates a class of immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors, and is expected to generate $17 billion in revenues this year.  Family-controlled Merck KGaA and Merck & Co Inc, known as MSD outside North America, share historic roots but have been under separate ownership since World War One.  Earlier stage trials, testing bintrafusp alfa against lung cancer, cervical cancer and biliary tract cancer, will continue.  \u201cWe need to dig deeper into what the news of today means for lung and the other studies in the bintrafusp programme,\u201d said Merck KGaA finance chief Marcus Kuhnert.  Kuhnert said the blow would not sway the strategy of the relatively small pharmaceuticals division. \u201c(This) is not going to change where we go in the future,\u201d he said in an analyst call.  Earnings growth in Merck\u2019s diversified business has recently been driven by biotech lab supplies, which have benefited from a scramble to ready treatments and vaccines against the coronavirus, offsetting sluggish drug revenue growth.  Merck\u2019s specialty chemicals used in semiconductor production have meanwhile benefited from a rebound in demand by the electronics industry.  GSK also said in a written statement that bintrafusp alfa development continues in several additional cancer indications. Merck said it had no indication that GSK intended to exit the collaboration.  The bintrafusp alfa drug is a so-called fusion protein, a unique combination of checkpoint inhibition and another immune response booster known as TGF-beta-inhibtion.","9":"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc:  * SELUMETINIB GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION BY THE U.S. FDA FOR NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1  * MERCK & CO INC - FDA GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR SELUMETINIB, A MEK 1\/2 INHIBITOR, FOR TREATMENT OF NEUROFIBROMATOSIS TYPE 1  * MERCK & CO INC - PHASE II TRIAL RESULTS FOR SELUMETINIB ARE EXPECTED LATER IN 2018 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","10":"(This March 8 story has been corrected to show in the 7th paragraph that Merck will pay, not receive, R&D reimbursement)  The logo of Eisai Co Ltd is displayed at the company headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, March 8, 2018. REUTERS\/Issei Kato  NEW YORK\/TOKYO (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc and Japan\u2019s Eisai Co Ltd have signed a potential multibillion-dollar collaboration to develop and sell Eisai\u2019s cancer drug Lenvima, which is already approved in dozens of countries for two uses.  The deal, under which Lenvima will be developed for several types of cancer alone and in combination with Merck\u2019s immunotherapy Keytruda, could be worth up to $5.76 billion to Eisai, but most of that would be contingent on eventual sales.  Eisai shares surged 10 percent on the news, with the Japanese drugmaker saying Lenvima may become a blockbuster drug generating annual sales of at least $1 billion in the year ending March 2021.  U.S. drugmaker Merck will be entitled to half of all global Lenvima sales revenue, even for its already approved uses for thyroid cancer and in combination with another drug for kidney cancer.  The deal is similar to a multibillion-dollar oncology collaboration Merck struck with AstraZeneca Plc on its cancer drug Lynparza and another medicine last July.  \u201cLike the Lynparza deal with AstraZeneca, this starts to really broaden out Merck\u2019s portfolio,\u201d Frank Clyburn, head of Merck\u2019s commercial oncology business, said in an interview. \u201cAnd Merck will start to receive revenue right away.\u201d  Under the deal, Eisai will receive an upfront payment of $300 million and up to $650 million for certain option rights through March 2021. Eisai could receive another $385 million in clinical and regulatory milestones, and Merck will pay another $450 million as reimbursement for research and development costs.  The collaboration gives Eisai access to Merck\u2019s R&D and sales clout as well as a means of maximizing the potential of Lenvima in combination with the leading immunotherapy drug.  Following positive trial data showing that Lenvima with Keytruda led to tumor shrinkage in 63 percent of advanced kidney cancer patients, the combination received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The combination also appeared to enhance the impact of Keytruda on advanced kidney cancer.  Breakthrough status is a designation given to treatments demonstrating substantial improvement over existing therapies in treating a serious or life threatening illness.  The companies said they will develop the combination for 11 different potential uses across six other cancer types, including skin cancer and bladder cancer.  \u201cIt makes sense ... to try to develop the drug to the full extent possible as monotherapy and in combination with Keytruda,\u201d Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in an interview.  Lenvima, an oral drug known chemically as lenvatinib, was discovered by Eisai scientists and belongs to a class of medicines known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block the blood vessel supply to tumors and tumor growth.  The injection of funds following the deal will be used to accelerate research and development of treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer, Eisai Chief Executive Haruo Naito told a news conference in Tokyo.  Eisai\u2019s shares, currently worth some $17 billion, have been hit in recent months by setbacks for two Alzheimer\u2019s drugs in development with Biogen Inc.  One drug, BAN2401, failed to meet the main goal of a mid-stage trial, Biogen said in December. In February, the U.S. drugmaker said it was enrolling more patients for its late-stage trial drug aducanumab, heightening concerns about the challenges of Alzheimer\u2019s drug studies.","11":"Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co Inc said on Thursday it was expecting early data from a trial of the experimental antiviral drug it was developing with Ridgeback Bio as early as the first quarter.  The company has decided to focus on therapeutics after its two COVID-19 vaccines failed to generate desired immune responses, prompting it to abandon the program last week.  The antiviral is being currently tested in a Phase 2\/3 trial that is set to be completed in May, but initial results could be reported by the first quarter, said Dean Li, head of the company\u2019s research and development division.  Li also said the drug still needed to be tested to see if it was effective against the new variants of the novel coronavirus, but predicted that it would work on all types, based on its mechanism of action.  The most concerning new variants of the novel coronavirus currently are the so-called British, South African and Brazilian, all of which appear to spread more swiftly than others.  Merck expects to make 10 million courses of the antiviral, molnupiravir, by the end of 2021, Li said at a conference call to discuss the company\u2019s quarterly earnings.

The study showed that Lynparza was successful as a first-line maintenance treatment for adults with a form of genetically-mutated pancreatic cancer called germline BRCA -mutated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  Lynparza, which is currently being used as a treatment for ovarian and breast cancers, showed it was better at delaying the rare pancreatic cancer from getting worse in patients when compared to a placebo.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Supreme Court is seen in Washington, U.S., June 11, 2018. REUTERS\/Erin Schaff  The justices heard arguments in Merck\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling that revived the lawsuits filed in federal court by patients who said they suffered debilitating bone breaks after taking the drug.  Some conservative justices as well as liberal Justice Stephen Breyer emphasized that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had been uncertain about the fracture risk and rejected Merck\u2019s proposal to add a warning label to the medication.  The nine-justice court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority, must decide whether a pharmaceutical company can be held liable under such circumstances.  A ruling for Merck, which is backed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the case, would be a relief for drug companies as it would preserve one of their most powerful defenses against product liability claims by contending they are preempted by the actions of a federal agency under both federal law and the U.S. Constitution.  Fosamax helps prevent and treat osteoporosis, a condition that can lead to bone fractures, in women who have gone through menopause. It may increase in the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint, often requiring surgical intervention.  Sales of Fosamax, which is also available as a generic drug, totaled $241 million in 2017, according to Merck.  Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA denied its proposal to add a warning label to the medication. After a task force further studied the issue, the agency in October 2010 ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning, which Merck did.  The plaintiffs said that the FDA rejected only Merck\u2019s proposed language for the warning that focused on stress fractures rather than the more serious fractures they suffered.  Breyer, along with conservative justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments and stressed the need to be cautious about warnings on drugs. Over-warning, Breyer suggested, can hurt the majority of patients \u201cwho can benefit from this medicine.\u201d  Liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor said Merck had a duty to present proper data and relevant warning labels to the FDA instead of letting the agency figure out what to do.  \u201cSeems to be sort of turning responsibility on its head,\u201d Sotomayor said.  Fosamax users sued New Jersey-based Merck in federal courts alleging the drug caused them to suffer serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk. The number of cases has swelled to more than 1,000.  A federal trial court in New Jersey threw out the cases, but in 2017 the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the claims to proceed to trial, saying that a jury could find that the FDA had objected only to Merck\u2019s phrasing of the proposed warning label.  Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not participate in the oral argument as she continues to recuperate after lung cancer surgery, but will take part in the ruling.","24":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co\u2019s immunotherapy Keytruda improved survival as a stand-alone treatment for newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients and with chemotherapy for hard-to-treat squamous cell lung cancer, new data released on Sunday showed, further cementing the company\u2019s lead in the most lucrative oncology market.  FILE PHOTO: A giant inflatable pair of lungs is seen in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, December 10, 2013. REUTERS\/Vincent Kessler  Keytruda is competing with drugs from Roche, Bristol-Myers Squibb and others that also unleash the body\u2019s immune system to attack tumors for dominance in lung cancer. They have racked up approvals for a variety of cancers, but newly-diagnosed lung cancer is seen as the biggest commercial opportunity.  The new results, presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, add to the view that Keytruda has \u201cset the floor against which other therapies will need to be compared,\u201d Roy Baynes, head of clinical development at Merck, told Reuters.  One trial studied 1,274 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who tested positive for the PDL1 protein targeted by Keytruda to see if they could avoid chemotherapy.  Overall, Keytruda patients lived for a median of 16.7 months, compared with 12.1 months for patients on chemotherapy.  But patient outcomes were linked to the biomarker. Keytruda patients with PDL1 levels above 50 percent lived for a median of 20 months, compared with 12.2 months for chemotherapy.  \u201cThis is a true milestone for the field,\u201d said Dr. John Heymach, an ASCO expert from Houston\u2019s MD Anderson Cancer Center who was not involved in the trial. \u201cThe era in which chemotherapy is the only option for non-small cell lung cancer patients is drawing to a close.\u201d  Keytruda already has U.S. approval for use in combination with chemotherapy as an initial treatment for non-squamous NSCLC. It is also approved as a stand-alone treatment for lung cancer patients whose tumors have high PDL1 levels.  Merck said it is not yet clear whether Keytruda combined with chemotherapy is better than Keytruda alone in patients who express PDL1.  Since much of the benefit in the latest trial was seen in patients with high PDL1 levels, the opportunity for Keytruda alone for lung cancer \u201cmay be of less significance commercially,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said in a research note.  Severe side effects, including lung inflammation, occurred in 18 percent of Keytruda patients, compared with 41 percent of chemotherapy patients.  \u201cNot only are patients living longer ... but they are also receiving a treatment that has substantially less toxicity,\u201d Dr. Heymach said.  For more ASCO coverage see: here.  Researchers also presented results from a separate trial of Keytruda in patients with late-stage squamous cell NSCLC, which accounts for about 30 percent of lung cancer and is considered particularly difficult to treat.  The 559-patient trial found patients given Keytruda plus chemotherapy lived for a median of 15.9 months, compared with 11.3 months for chemotherapy alone.  Merck said Keytruda trial patients lived for a median of 6.4 months before their disease worsened, compared with 4.8 months for the chemotherapy-alone group.

At least 20% of complications are caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria that severely limit treatment options.  Health agencies around the world have been pushing for newer versions of antibiotics to address the growing threat of antimicrobial-resistant infections.  \"It is important that the use of Recarbrio be reserved for situations when there are limited or no alternative antibacterial drugs for treating a patient's infection,\" the FDA said in a statement.

A logo of drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA is pictured in Darmstadt, Germany January 28, 2016.

Merck could also get up to a further 2.9 billion euros, depending on commercial milestones, for a total deal value of as much as 3.7 billion euros.  Merck will book any future U.S. sales from the product, while GSK will account for sales from other parts of the world.  GSK in December moved to bolster its cancer medicines cabinet with the $5.1 billion purchase of Tesaro.  Later that month, it unveiled plans to separate its prescription drugs and vaccines business from its over-the-counter products unit under a joint venture deal with Pfizer\u2019s consumer health division.  \u201cFor GSK, this alliance is a further step in the company\u2019s priority to strengthen its pharmaceuticals pipeline,\u201d it said.  The M7824 drug, a fusion protein that triggers two immune responses to cancer cells, is being tested on 10 tumour types and was recently shown to delay the progression of a certain type of lung cancer for at least 9.5 months in half of the trial participants.  Merck has already started a mid-stage phase II trial in non-small cell lung cancer, comparing M7824 directly with U.S. rival Merck & Co\u2019s Keytruda, currently seen as the most promising cancer immunotherapy on the market with $7.2 billion in 2018 sales.  Keytruda is part of a class of immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors, which are expected to generate well over $20 billion in combined annual revenues over the next few years.  Merck KGaA, which has no ownership ties with Merck & Co, is competing in that class with a drug called Bavencio, jointly developed with Pfizer, but analysts expect the drug to play only a minor commercial role.  For M7824, Merck combined Bavencio\u2019s mode of action with another immune response booster known as TGF-beta-inhibtion.  \u201cThis combination in a single molecule is unique. We don\u2019t know of any other at this time,\u201d said Belen Garijo, the head of Merck\u2019s healthcare division.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The vaccine, developed by U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co, is already being used under emergency guidelines to try to protect people against the spread of a deadly Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo.  It protects against the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus - the one that most commonly causes outbreaks.  The shot is also being reviewed under a fast-track system by regulators in the United States, with a decision expected in the first quarter of next year.  \u201cThis vaccine has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak, and the decision by European regulators will help it to eventually save many more,\u201d the WHO\u2019s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement.  The Congo Ebola outbreak has killed more than 2,100 people since the middle of last year. It is the second-largest Ebola outbreak in history, after a 2013-16 epidemic in West Africa that killed more than 11,300.  The Merck vaccine, which the company has now brand-named Ervebo, is likely to get a full marketing license from the European Commission in a few weeks.  Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said the company\u2019s priority now was to get regulatory approval of its Ervebo manufacturing site in Germany so that licensed supply of the vaccine \u201ccan be used to support global public health preparedness\u201d.  Merck\u2019s vaccine is being used in Congo in a so-called \u201cring vaccination\u201d approach, in which people who may have been in contact with someone newly infected with Ebola are traced and offered the shot to protect them.  Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust global heath charity said the Merck shot had already saved \u201ccountless lives\u201d in the country.  \u201cHaving this vaccine available under research conditions has been key in preventing the ongoing outbreak in the DRC spiraling into a repeat of the 2014-16 epidemic, where 11,000 people died,\u201d she told Reuters.  Health authorities in Kinshasa said last week they planned to introduce an experimental second Ebola vaccine, developed by drugmaker Johnson & Johnson, in the country\u2019s eastern provinces in November.  The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and spreads from person to person through direct contact with body fluids. It kills around half of those it infects.  There are currently no licensed treatments for the deadly infection, but scientists said in August they were a step closer to being able to cure it after two experimental drugs showed survival rates of as much as 90% in a clinical trial in Congo.","44":"April 27 (Reuters) - Institute For Advanced Study:  * MERCK AND INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY COLLABORATE TO DEFINE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PROGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","45":"A federal judge on Thursday denied a request by some 80 out-of-state plaintiffs who sued Merck & Co Inc over its shingles vaccine Zostavax to have their cases remanded to New Jersey state from federal court, calling their attempt to join claims to avoid federal jurisdiction \u201cegregious.\u201d  U.S. District Judge Peter Sheridan in Trenton, New Jersey said the patients had all received the vaccine at different times, in different states and by different healthcare providers, resulting in a failure to assert substantially similar claims, a requirement to properly join lawsuits.

The approval was based on results from a late-stage study where the drug reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 66% when compared with hormonal anticancer therapies such as enzalutamide or abiraterone.  Lynparza leads a class of drugs known as PARP inhibitors, which keep cancer cells damaged by chemotherapy from repairing themselves, and is a key asset for AstraZeneca with approvals in ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers.  The latest approval for the blockbuster cancer drug comes just weeks after it won broader approval as a treatment for ovarian caner in the United States.  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with more than 191,000 new diagnoses expected in the United States in 2020, according to the American Cancer Society.","49":"NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. drug company Merck & Co Inc said on Tuesday that its Chief Executive Ken Frazier plans to testify at a Senate hearing later this month examining rising prescription drug prices.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a June 2016 ruling that the two Merck patents, which cover methods of treating Hepatitis C, were unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by the company, including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.  A Gilead spokesman said the company was very pleased with the ruling and believe it was \u201cjustified and well supported by the record.\u201d  A Merck spokeswoman said in a statement that the ruling \u201cdoes not reflect the facts of the case\u201d and that the company was reviewing its next steps.  Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment of Hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. The viral disease is estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and can lead to liver failure.  A jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.  A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company\u2019s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.  Merck appealed the ruling, saying there was no \u201cdeliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.\u201d  But the appeals court said in Wednesday\u2019s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were \u201ctainted\u201d by misconduct and should not be enforceable.  In February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs.  The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck\u2019s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.","53":"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N said on Tuesday it intends to ramp up production of its top-selling vaccine Gardasil in 2023 and warned of a slowdown in revenue growth next year as demand for the therapy outpaces supply.  \u201cWe expect tempered growth rates for the product versus what we reported for the last couple of years,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said on a conference call with analysts.

While the blockbuster drug showed improvement in overall survival for patients treated with Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy, it did not meet statistical significance, the company said on Monday.  Keytruda has been approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for around 85% of lung cancer cases, and currently holds a dominant position in that market.  Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 10% to 15% of all cases of lung cancer, Merck said. It said the five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed in the U.S. with any stage of SCLC is estimated to be 6%.

Merck said the treatments when used as the initial treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) reduced the risk of death by about 47 percent in its late-stage trial.  The drugs also improved progression-free survival and had a higher response rate in patients than treatment with chemotherapy.  The drugmaker said it will present full results from the trial at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in San Francisco later this week.  Keytruda has been Merck\u2019s most important growth driver with its domination of the lucrative lung cancer space, and shows no sign of slowing as it produces positive clinical data and adds approvals for different types of cancer.  Approval of the combination to treat patients with RCC would put Merck again in competition with rival Bristol-Myers Squibb Co\u2019s Opdivo, which is already being used in combination with another Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat kidney cancer.  Bristol-Myers was a pioneer in pushing treatments that help the immune system attack tumors and Opdivo looked poised to be a top immuno-oncology treatment.

The combination of Bristol\u2019s treatments, Opdivo and Yervoy, is approved for treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the FDA said.  Based on a median of nine doses of Opdivo and three of Yervoy, the estimated cost of the therapy is $104,233, a company spokeswoman told Reuters. The cost varies based on factors including indication and treatment duration.  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases, making it a lucrative market, which is currently dominated by Keytruda.  Opdivo, which spurs the immune system to fight cancer, is one of Bristol\u2019s top-selling drugs, but it has been overtaken by Keytruda as the industry\u2019s immuno-oncology leader.  Bristol had previously struggled in its attempts to make the Opdivo and Yervoy combination the \u201cfirst-line\u201d of treatment in the NSCLC market.

While magnitude of the survival benefit in the late-stage study was not yet known, the Keytruda combination cut the risk of death by 51 percent compared with chemotherapy and significantly delayed disease worsening, according to data presented on Monday.  \u201cThis study showed a clear difference in long-term outcomes,\u201d said Dr. Leena Gandhi, the study\u2019s primary investigator, who called the results \u201cpractice changing.\u201d  In another closely-watched study, a combination of Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s immunotherapy drugs Opdivo and Yervoy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients whose tumors had a high number of genetic mutations. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy.  The results were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in Chicago.  Keytruda and Opdivo have piled up approvals for advanced cancers, such as for melanoma and bladder cancer. But those drugs and rival immunotherapies from Roche and AstraZeneca are jockeying for pieces of the largest lung cancer market. Thus far, Merck is dominating the coveted newly-diagnosed setting.  There are more than 200,000 new cases of NSCLC each year in the United States alone, with about half at advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis.  The Keytruda plus chemotherapy regimen was approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced patients based on earlier data from a small study. But many clinicians wanted to see validation of a survival benefit in a large trial.  \u201cWe were all waiting to see a definitive Phase III study that showed very clear cut results,\u201d said Gandhi, director of thoracic medical oncology at NYU Langone in New York.  In both studies, the positive results were not dependent on cancer cell\u2019s levels of PD-L1, a marker of inflammation that has been commonly used with drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo to help predict patient responses, with higher PD-L1 levels believed to lead to greater efficacy.  In the Merck-sponsored trial called Keynote-189, median overall survival was 11.3 months for chemotherapy but not yet reached for the Keytruda combination. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long their survival is going to be and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d Gandhi said.  After 12 months, 69.2 percent of patients in the Keytruda group were alive compared with 49.4 percent for chemotherapy, researchers reported.  The differences would likely have been more pronounced, but many patients in the chemotherapy group were given Keytruda or a similar drug once their disease progressed.  In the study called CheckMate-227, 43 percent of patients with high TMB who received Opdivo and low-dose Yervoy experienced no disease progression after one year versus 13 percent in the chemotherapy group. There was preliminary evidence of a likely survival benefit but it was too early to determine that, researchers said.  The overall response rate - those with significant tumor shrinkage - was 45 percent for the immunotherapies versus 27 percent for chemotherapy. After one year, 68 percent of responders to Opdivo and Yervoy continued to benefit from the therapy.  Dr. Matthew Hellman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study, said it was a validation of TMB as a biomarker and that Opdivo with Yervoy should be an important chemotherapy-sparing regimen in first-line lung cancer.  \u201cThis is great that there\u2019s new options and improved outcomes,\u201d Hellman said of the two studies. \u201cThat\u2019s tremendous progress for patients with lung cancer.\u201d (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; editing by Diane Craft)","76":"April 5 (Reuters) - Hcl Technologies Ltd:  * ACQUIRES LIFE SCIENCES AND CONSUMER SERVICES PROVIDER C3I SOLUTIONS FROM MERCK & CO INC Source text: bit.ly\/2q6XRGC Further company coverage:","77":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc on Tuesday said it will end another late-stage trial of an Alzheimer\u2019s drug because it was unlikely to work, adding to the pile-up of failures to find an effective treatment for the mind-wasting disease.

FILE PHOTO: The Merck logo is seen at a gate to the Merck & Co campus in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., July 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Plaintiffs suing Merck alleged that the company did not fully disclose on Propecia\u2019s label the incidence and duration of sexual dysfunction in men who took the drug in clinical trials. As part of an investigation of the impact of court secrecy on public health and safety, Reuters published an article in 2019 that examined the basis for those allegations, but many internal Merck documents that might have shed further light on the case remained under seal.  Sunday night, 16 months after Reuters filed a motion asking that those documents be unsealed, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo in Brooklyn rejected Merck\u2019s position that the public had no right to access its documents filed in court, which the company said contained proprietary information.  Merck\u2019s arguments for keeping the documents sealed, Kuo wrote, \u201care so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.\u201d As of Monday, the documents were still sealed on the court docket, despite Kuo\u2019s decision.  In a statement to Reuters, Merck said it \u201cinteracted appropriately and transparently with global regulators, including FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), and with physicians and consumers about the safety profile of Propecia. None of millions of pages produced by Merck suggest otherwise, including the documents unsealed by the Court.\u201d The company previously told Reuters it \u201cstands behind the safety and efficacy of Propecia\u201d and noted that the drug had been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s.  In its 2019 investigation, titled \u201cHidden Injustice,\u201d Reuters revealed how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in their courts information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one.  The investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products -- drugs, cars, medical devices and other products -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden.  In 2012, more than 1,100 Propecia-related lawsuits filed across the U.S. against Merck were consolidated before Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn federal court in so-called multidistrict litigation. Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of them for $4.3 million, to be divided among the plaintiffs.  Prior to the settlement, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers cited internal company communications to allege that in revisions to the drug\u2019s original label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. Merck settled before responding to the allegations in court, and Cogan allowed many of the Merck documents to remain under seal without conducting any analysis of whether they merited secrecy.  After Reuters filed its September 2019 motion to unseal, Merck argued that the material should not be considered \u201cjudicial documents\u201d -- which are entitled to a presumed public right of access -- in part because the case had already been settled before the allegations were decided.  Kuo, however, ruled that the presumption of public access does not disappear just because a judge never had a chance to rule on a particular motion. \u201cThe continuing presumption of access allows the public to see what is going into the sausage factory, even if a particular sausage is never made,\u201d Kuo wrote.  The judge ordered that all the documents sought by Reuters be unsealed.","80":"(Adds dropped words \u201cHF Hospitalization\u201d in headline)  March 28 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc:  * INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG VERICIGUAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE RISK OF THE COMPOSITE ENDPOINT OF HEART FAILURE HOSPITALIZATION OR CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH, COMPARED TO PLACEBO, WHEN GIVEN IN COMBINATION WITH AVAILABLE HEART FAILURE THERAPIES  * MERCK & CO INC SAYS SAFETY PROFILE OF VERICIGUAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT REPORTED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Supreme Court is seen as the court nears the end of its term in Washington, U.S., June 11, 2018. REUTERS\/Erin Schaff\/File Photo  At issue in the case is whether a pharmaceutical company can be held liable for failing to warn about a health risk associated with its drug when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected the company\u2019s proposal to add a warning label to the medication about the risk.  Fosamax helps prevent and treat osteoporosis, a condition that can lead to bone fractures, in women who have gone through menopause. Conversely, it may increase the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint.  Sales of Fosamax, which is also available as a generic drug, totaled $241 million in 2017, according to Merck.  Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA rejected its proposal to add a warning label to the medication, according to court papers. After further study of the issue, the agency ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning in October 2010, which Merck did the following January.  Hundreds of Fosamax users sued New Jersey-based Merck alleging the drug caused them to suffer serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk. The number of cases has swelled to more than 1,000.  Merck tried to have the cases thrown out, arguing that the FDA\u2019s rejection of its proposed warning label should preempt the lawsuits.  A federal trial court in New Jersey sided with Merck, but in March 2017, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the claims to proceed to trial, saying that a jury could find that the FDA had objected only to Merck\u2019s phrasing of the proposed warning label and might have approved \u201ca properly worded warning\u201d about Fosamax.  Backed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Merck asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, saying the appeals court ruling puts drug companies in an impossible position.  \u201cEven if they cooperate with the FDA, share their safety data, and follow the agency\u2019s direction to \u2018hold off\u2019 on adding label warnings, they still cannot escape costly, burdensome tort litigation complaining about those labels,\u201d Merck said.

The approval is based on results from a late-stage trial, where Keytruda showed a significant improvement in overall survival in cancer patients, Merck said.  Keytruda, a type of immunotherapy called a PD-1 inhibitor, is already an approved treatment for several forms of cancer, including lung and skin cancers.  Head and neck cancer includes tumors in the mouth, tongue, nose, sinuses, throat and lymph nodes in the neck.

The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case but U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday ruled Merck\u2019s patent was invalid. He said it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make and use the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.  Merck in a statement on Saturday said it planned to appeal and believed the judge\u2019s ruling did not reflect the facts of the case. Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.  The December 2016 verdict followed a trial in which jurors found that Merck\u2019s patent on hepatitis C treatments, which it acquired in 2014 when it bought Idenix Pharmaceuticals, was valid.  Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure.  Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment, with cure rates of more than 90 percent shown in clinical trials.  But there was a backlash from health insurers and other payers when Gilead launched Sovaldi at a price of $84,000 for a 12-week course.  Foster City, California-based Gilead reported that in 2017 it earned $9.1 billion on its four products to treat chronic hepatitis C, including Harvoni and Sovaldi.  Idenix, the original holder of the patent at issue in the lawsuit, sued Gilead in 2013 in an effort to block the launch of Sovaldi, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December of that year.  Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi\u2019s active ingredient, sofosbuvir, with another drug, was approved in October 2014.  Merck sells its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier. The company won a $200 million jury verdict last March in a separate patent infringement case against Gilead over hepatitis C drugs.  But in June 2016, a federal judge in San Jose, California, overturned that verdict after finding that Merck engaged in a pattern of unethical conduct, including lying under oath. Merck has disputed the judge\u2019s ruling and is appealing.  The case is Idenix Pharmaceuticals LLC et al v. Gilead Sciences Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, No. 14-cv-00846.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Amid heightened political scrutiny over the high cost of prescription medicines and promises by Trump that drug price reductions were coming, New Jersey-based Merck became the first major drugmaker to announce voluntary price decreases.  In addition to slashing the price of Zepatier, which owns a very small share of the hepatitis market, Merck said it would lower the list price by 10 percent of six other older drugs with minuscule sales. It also said it would not increase the average net price of other medicines in its portfolio of products by more than the inflation rate annually.  While that sounds like a substantial commitment, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat noted that it does not amount to a significant change and \u201ctechnically leaves the room open for increases where it would like to.\u201d  \u201cIf we look back at Merck\u2019s \u2018net price increase\u2019 across portfolio in 2017, it was already meeting the criteria that Merck outlined today.\u201d he said.

Trump, who has vowed to help reduce the cost of prescription drugs to consumers, expressed anger at drugmakers over planned price hikes. In a tweet on July 9, he said they \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d and that his administration would respond.  Under direct pressure from Trump, Pfizer Inc, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said it would delay July 1 price increases until the end of the year or until the president\u2019s blueprint for lowering drug costs goes into effect.  Swiss drugmaker Novartis followed this week, saying it would not raise prices in the United States for the rest of the year.  Although Pfizer and Novartis only promised delays to price hikes, Trump said they decided to not increase prices. He has not yet commented on Merck\u2019s announcement.  \u201cThis decision (by Merck) is a response to President Trump\u2019s blueprint and reflects the industry\u2019s understanding that the President is serious about bringing change to our drug markets,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.  Trump made lowering prescription drug prices a top 2016 presidential campaign issue.  In May, he unveiled a \u201cblueprint\u201d to lower drug prices that appeared to largely spare drugmakers and instead took aim at \u201cmiddlemen,\u201d such as health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers, which demand hefty rebates in exchange for broad access to patients. Pharmaceutical company stocks rose after the blueprint was announced.

Merck is already considered the frontrunner in the space and Keytruda is expected to earn peak sales of over $10 billion in 2023, according to Credit Suisse.  Keytruda is already approved in the U.S. to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received prior therapies and whose tumors show PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater.

An independent data monitoring committee determined the trial, which tested Keytruda as a monotherapy to treat NSCLC, extended the lives of patients significantly compared to chemotherapy.  Additional data from Merck, as well as results from trials of competitors, could eventually determine which companies will snatch the largest slice of the pie for the lung cancer market.  \u201cI think the market still believes that there could be other players in the lung cancer market, which would combat overall sales of Keytruda in this setting,\u201d Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler told Reuters.  \u201cBecause we don\u2019t know the full data set we don\u2019t know the survival benefit here.\u201d  Based on a recommendation from the committee, the trial will continue to evaluate a secondary goal on whether the treatment can delay the disease from progressing.  \u201cWhile it is still unclear whether Keytruda and (Bristol-Myers\u2019) Opdivo are truly different in some way, it is crystal clear that Merck has done a much better job designing trials and developing their drug.

Merck said the combination therapy met its main trial goals when compared to patients who were on chemotherapy alone, according to an interim analysis.  The company\u2019s shares were up 1 percent at $59.04 in midday trading.  Earlier this month, Merck reported data from an interim analysis of the trial that met a secondary goal of overall response rate, or the portion of patients with a reduction in tumor size.

The others are AbbVie Inc, AstraZeneca Plc , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc and Sanofi SA.  A spokesman from Senator Grassley\u2019s office said on Monday that two of the CEOs have agreed to testify so far, but did not specify from which companies.  A Sanofi spokeswoman said the French drugmaker was reviewing Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt\u2019s scheduling to determine if he can attend the hearing.

Pfizer, Bristol-Myers, and J&J did not immediately have a statement on the invitation to testify, while AbbVie did not respond to a request for comment.  The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries, where governments directly or indirectly control costs. That makes it by far the world\u2019s most lucrative market for manufacturers.  Congress has been targeting the pharmaceutical industry over the rising cost of prescription drugs for U.S. consumers, particularly since Democrats took over the House of Representatives in January.  Last week, the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Finance Committee brought in patient advocates and health policy experts to discuss the burden of high drug costs on consumers.  Senators and congressmen have also written to insulin manufacturers requesting information on why its cost has skyrocketed in recent years and how much the companies profit from the life-sustaining diabetes treatment.  Drug pricing is also a top priority of the administration of President Donald Trump, who had made it a central issue of the 2016 presidential campaign.  Drugmakers have slowed and limited U.S. price increases as scrutiny on their practices has intensified over the past few years.  They nonetheless increased prices on hundreds of drugs in January, including a 6.2 percent increase on the world\u2019s top-selling drug - AbbVie\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira - and hikes on insulin prices by Sanofi and Novo Nordisk.","122":"NEW YORK\/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Merck & Co\u2019s immunotherapy Keytruda plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival in newly-diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in a closely-watched study, cementing its lead position over Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and others in the most lucrative oncology market.  The survival data sent Merck shares up 2.2 percent to $58.47, while shares of Bristol-Myers plunged 8.4 percent to $53.68 despite positive lung cancer data for its immunotherapy combination in a subset of patients with a high degree of tumor mutations.  The magnitude of the survival benefit in the late-stage study was not yet known, but Keytruda plus chemotherapy cut the risk of death by 51 percent compared with chemotherapy alone, according to data presented at the American Association of Cancer Research meeting in Chicago on Monday.  \u201cThe Merck data is pretty much a home run,\u201d said Dr. Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study.  \u201cThe whole idea (of immunotherapy) would be to avoid chemotherapy. But it works. It\u2019s amazing that we\u2019re going to be bringing these drugs to the majority of patients with lung cancer in the first-line setting,\u201d Herbst added. \u201cWhy would you wait and not give someone immunotherapy up front?\u201d  Bristol-Myers\u2019s combination therapy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB), a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy.  But overall survival is considered the gold standard by doctors and investors, giving Keytruda a clear leg up.  The Keytruda plus chemotherapy regimen was approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced NSCLC patients based on earlier data from a small study. But many clinicians wanted to see validation of a survival benefit in a large trial.  \u201cWe were all waiting to see a definitive Phase III study that showed very clear cut results,\u201d said Dr. Leena Gandhi, the study\u2019s primary investigator and director of thoracic medical oncology at NYU Langone in New York.  Keytruda and Opdivo have piled up approvals for advanced cancers, such as for melanoma and bladder cancer. But those drugs and rival immunotherapies from Roche and AstraZeneca are jockeying for pieces of the largest lung cancer market, especially the coveted newly-diagnosed setting.  There are more than 200,000 new cases of NSCLC each year in the United States alone, with about half at advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis.  In the Merck-sponsored trial of more than 600 patients called Keynote-189, median overall survival was 11.3 months for chemotherapy, about what was expected. After 12 months, 69.2 percent of patients in the Keytruda group were alive compared with 49.4 percent for chemotherapy, researchers reported.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long their survival is going to be and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d said Gandhi.  The differences would likely have been more pronounced, but many patients in the chemotherapy group were given Keytruda or a similar drug once their disease progressed.  Keytruda, with a list price of about $13,500 a month before discounts or rebates, was given every three weeks with a standard chemotherapy regimen. It can be given for up to 24 months for those without disease progression, Merck said.  Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, called both trials \u201cincredibly important studies.\u201d  \u201cI worry about cost. A lot of people won\u2019t be able to afford these drugs,\u201d Brawley said.  There was a small increase in acute kidney injury in the Keytruda group compared with chemotherapy alone. There were also three treatment-related deaths from pneumonitis among Keytruda patients.  In the study called CheckMate-227, 43 percent of patients with high TMB who received Opdivo and low-dose Yervoy experienced no disease progression after one year versus 13 percent in the chemotherapy group. There was preliminary evidence of a likely survival benefit but it was too early to determine that, researchers said.  The overall response rate - those with significant tumor shrinkage - was 45 percent for the immunotherapies versus 27 percent for chemotherapy.  Dr. Matthew Hellman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study, and others said it was a validation of the TMB biomarker.  \u201cMaybe we can look at the TMB and it can further personalize therapy,\u201d said Herbst.  In both studies, positive results were not dependent on cancer cell\u2019s levels of PD-L1, a marker of inflammation that has been commonly used with drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo to help predict patient responses, with higher PD-L1 levels believed to lead to greater efficacy.  \u201cThis is great that there\u2019s new options and improved outcomes\u201d for patients with lung cancer, Hellman said.","123":"April 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Merck & Co Inc\u2019s cancer therapy, Keytruda, as part of a combination therapy for previously untreated patients with the most common type of kidney cancer, the company said on Monday.

While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.  \u201cWe are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,\u201d said Sandra Horning, Roche\u2019s chief medical officer.  She also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers.  The world\u2019s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals\u2019 cheaper copies.  Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an \u201calready robust\u201d set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq\u2019s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer.  \u201cWe continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,\u201d Baader\u2019s Bruno Bulic said.  \u201cFacing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche\u2019s profitability going forward.\u201d","126":"May 3 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc:  * MERCK PROVIDES UPDATE ON KEYNOTE-407 TRIAL  * MERCK - PHASE 3 KEYNOTE-407 TRIAL MET A PRE-SPECIFIED SECONDARY ENDPOINT OF ORR IN AN EARLY COHORT OF PARTICIPANTS AT AN INTERIM ANALYSIS  * MERCK & CO INC - NOW EXPECTS THAT AN ADDITIONAL INTERIM ANALYSIS WILL BE CONDUCTED PRIOR TO ASCO  * MERCK - BASED ON KEYNOTE-407 TRIAL DATA, RECENTLY SUBMITTED A SUPPLEMENTAL BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION TO U.S. FDA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","127":"FILE PHOTO: The Merck logo is seen at a gate to the Merck & Co campus in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., July 12, 2018.

REUTERS  Facebook users have claimed that pharmaceutical company Merck has said it is better to catch COVID-19 and recover naturally than it is to get vaccinated. This is false. It is a misrepresentation of a statement from Merck.  Multiple posts on Facebook have shared this claim in different ways, whether in written posts, memes or screenshots. One such post reads: \u201cVaccine manufacturer Merck scraps COVID vaccine, saying studies show it\u2019s more effective to get the virus and recover than get the vaccine\u201d (here). Another says: \u201cAccording to Merck, they have determined it's better to just get the virus and develop antibodies than taking a vaccine. They have abandoned vaccine development in favour of alternative therapies\u201d (here).  These posts appear to have misinterpreted a recent statement from Merck, which announced on Jan. 25 that it was dropping research on V590 and V591, its two candidate vaccines for COVID-19, to focus on therapeutics instead (here).  Citing its reasons for discontinuing development, the American pharmaceutical giant said: \u201cThis decision follows Merck\u2019s review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2\/COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d (here)  Therefore, Merck was referring to trial data showing its own vaccine candidates having an inferior result compared to a natural immune response to COVID-19. It was not advising against delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines. As it noted in its statement, other candidate vaccines have led to recipients showing a stronger immune response.  VERDICT  Misleading. Merck did not say it is better to catch COVID-19 than get vaccinated. The company\u2019s statement about an inferior response compared to a natural immunity referred only to tests on its own two vaccine candidates.

Merck will pay 1.75 Australian dollars per share for the Sydney-based biotech company, which uses viruses to infect and kill cancer cells.  The idea is to cause cancer cells to rupture and die, while also stimulating a wider immune system response in the body.  The deal, which is conditional on no better offer emerging from a counter-bidder, represents a premium of 160 percent to the average stock price over the past month - another example of the outsized offers often needed to clinch biotech takeovers.  Viral immunotherapy represents a new way of treating cancer and a number of companies are working to harness the power of specific viruses to fight tumors. Amgen AMGN.O became the first company to win approval for such a treatment in 2015.  Merck\u2019s current research chief Roger Perlmutter was responsible for acquiring the Amgen product during his previous job as head of R&D at the U.S. biotechnology giant.  Viralytics\u2019s leading experimental product, Cavatak, uses a proprietary formulation of a common cold virus and is currently being studied in multiple Phase I and Phase II clinical trials.  DRUG COMBINATION  Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said the acquisition represented \u201ca very nice tuck-in\u201d for Merck and came at an interesting time since Viralytics is expected to have news on clinical tests of its oncolytic virus with Merck\u2019s immunotherapy drug Keytruda in the second quarter of 2018.  Trials testing Cavatak with Keytruda include experiments to treat melanoma, prostate, lung and bladder cancers.  Roy Baynes, Merck\u2019s head of global clinical development, said Viralytics\u2019s approach complemented the U.S. drugmaker\u2019s immuno-oncology strategy and opened up the possibility of new synergistic drug combinations.  The board of Viralytics said it unanimously recommended shareholders vote in favor of the Merck offer, \u201csubject to there being no superior proposal and an independent expert concluding that the scheme is in the best interest of the company\u2019s shareholders\u201d.  The deal comes at a time of booming merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology sector, with $27.5 billion of transactions agreed in January alone as large drugmakers look for promising assets to improve their pipelines.  On completion of the transaction - expected by the second quarter of 2018 - Viralytics will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Merck.

In 2016, a jury returned a verdict that Gilead\u2019s hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed the patent, which Merck acquired when it bought Idenix Pharmaceuticals. Jurors determined that Gilead should pay $2.54 billion in damages, which was the largest verdict ever in a U.S. patent case.  But a federal judge in Delaware tossed the verdict in 2018, saying the Merck patent should not have been granted in the first place because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.

He said it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.  Gilead in a statement on Saturday said it always believed the patent was invalid and was pleased the judge confirmed that opinion.  Merck in a statement said it planned to appeal and believed the judge\u2019s ruling did not reflect the facts of the case.  The December 2016 verdict followed a trial in which jurors found that Merck\u2019s patent on hepatitis C treatments, which it acquired in 2014 when it bought Idenix Pharmaceuticals, was valid.  Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure.  Direct-acting antivirals, such as Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment, with cure rates of more than 90 percent shown in clinical trials.  But there was a backlash from health insurers and other payors when Gilead launched Sovaldi at a price of $84,000 for a 12-week course.  Foster City, California-based Gilead reported that in 2017 it earned $9.1 billion on its four products to treat hepatitis C, including Harvoni and Sovaldi.  Idenix, the original holder of the patent at issue in the lawsuit, sued Gilead in 2013 in an effort to block the launch of Sovaldi, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December of that year.  Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi\u2019s active ingredient, sofosbuvir, with another drug, was approved in October 2014.  Merck sells its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier. The company won a $200 million jury verdict last March in a separate patent infringement case against Gilead over hepatitis C drugs.  But in June 2016, a federal judge in San Jose, California, overturned that verdict after finding that Merck engaged in a pattern of unethical conduct, including lying under oath.

It did not disclose the terms of the acquisition of Themis, a privately held company.  Most big pharmaceutical companies have already placed their bets on COVID-19 treatments, but Merck has been waiting for opportunities with proven track records, Chief Executive Ken Frazier said.  \u201cWe wanted to be in a position where we could choose things that have the right kind of characteristics to make a contribution for a virus that\u2019s likely to be with us for some time,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  Both vaccines are designed to be delivered in a single dose.  The Themis vaccine, developed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Paris, is based on a modified measles virus that delivers bits of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body to prevent COVID-19.  It was developed in part through funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  Merck said it is moving quickly with this candidate and expects to start vaccinating volunteers \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d  The IAVI vaccine uses the same technology as Merck\u2019s Ebola vaccine ERVEBO, recently approved by the European Commission and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.  That candidate, which Merck is developing jointly with IAVI, is expected to start human trials some time this year, Frazier said.  The U.S. Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is backing the effort.  Both vaccines are made using technologies that have resulted in licensed products, unlike some frontrunners, such as the rapidly developed vaccine from Moderna Inc., which is expected to start large, late-stage clinical trials in July.  Last week, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Merck\u2019s vaccine, and those from Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, were a month or two behind Moderna\u2019s, but may get added to large efficacy trials this summer as they wrap up early-stage studies.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll be in a position to participate,\u201d Frazier said.  Merck intends to shoulder the cost of scaling up production of the vaccines before either has been proven to work, although it has not yet determined where they will be manufactured commercially, he said.  Doses of the Themis vaccine are already being made in France for clinical trials. Merck also plans to begin early production of the vaccine it is developing with IAVI at its plant in Pennsylvania.  Frazier said Merck had not signed any pacts with the U.S. government to deliver doses of either vaccine to Americans first, adding it was committed to making its vaccines accessible globally and affordably.  Ridgeback\u2019s pill, EIDD-2801, is designed to block virus reproduction, and has shown promise in animal studies of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It has also been shown to be safe and well tolerated in early stage trials.  Frazier compared it to Gilead Sciences\u2019 remdesivir, but it would be a pill, rather than an intravenous infusion. Efficacy trials will start later this year.  \u201cIf the drug works, we would be able to produce billions of doses,\u201d Frazier added.

Those allegations are contained in court filings that had been intended to be filed under seal.  Federal District Judge Brian Cogan has allowed Merck to keep secret internal company documents in litigation brought by Propecia users against the company. A faulty redaction allowed Reuters to view some of the details in a plaintiff\u2019s brief, but the underlying Merck documents cited in that brief are still sealed. Those are the documents the Reuters motion seeks to make public.  \u201cThis is a case of tremendous importance that has been sealed without on-the-record findings explaining that sealing,\u201d Reuters argued in its motion to intervene in the case. \u201cThe First Amendment precludes such an outcome.\u201d  Merck did not respond to a request for comment. The company previously told Reuters it \u201cstands behind the safety and efficacy of Propecia\u201d and noted that the drug has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s.  A June 25 Reuters investigation revealed how judges have allowed the makers of dozens of consumer products to file under seal in their courts information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one.  The investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured over the past couple of decades by allegedly defective products -- drugs, cars, medical devices and other products -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained under seal.  More than 1,100 Propecia-related lawsuits filed across the U.S. against Merck were consolidated before Judge Cogan in so-called multidistrict litigation (MDL). Merck agreed to settle most of them last year for $4.3 million, to be divided among the plaintiffs. Prior to the settlement, plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers cited internal company communications to allege that in revisions to the drug\u2019s original label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials, and how long those symptoms lasted. Merck settled before responding to the allegation in court.  Under U.S. law, court filings are presumed to be public, and the bar for secrecy is particularly high for the Propecia documents Reuters seeks to unseal, the motion states, because they are essential to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the drug causes persistent sexual side effects.  \u201cThese documents should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons,\u201d Reuters argued.

He also played a significant role in Merck\u2019s 2009 acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Schering-Plough, which then held Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, as a pipeline asset.  \u201cThat deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab.\u201d  Under Frazier\u2019s leadership, Keytruda has eclipsed Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s cancer immunotherapies, which hit the market first. Keytruda\u2019s sales topped $14 billion last year.  Shares of the company more than doubled over his tenure.  Frazier, the grandson of a sharecropper, made headlines in 2017 when he became the first business leader to leave former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s manufacturing council following Trump\u2019s comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cHis shoes won\u2019t be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today,\u201d Davis said on a post-earnings conference call.  Frazier\u2019s transition follows the recent retirement of Roger Perlmutter, who ran the company\u2019s research and development division for much of Frazier\u2019s tenure and was also considered a major force behind the success of Keytruda. Dean Li took over for Perlmutter on Jan. 1.  Davis has been CFO since 2014 and in charge of the company\u2019s business development, real estate and other corporate strategic functions since 2016.  A career healthcare executive, he was the president of Baxter International Inc\u2019s medical products business before joining Merck, and also spent 14 years at Eli Lilly and Co.  Citi analyst Andrew Baum said the elevation of Davis suggests the company will work to reduce its dependency on Keytruda.  The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.32 per share that missed analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.38 per share on lower-than-expected sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet.  It forecast a better-than-expected profit in 2021, although it said the COVID-19 pandemic would hurt sales of certain drugs, especially vaccines.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that brand-name drugmakers can be sued for recklessness if they intentionally fail to update warning labels for their drugs that makers of cheaper, generic versions must adopt as well.  The case was closely watched within the industry, and Merck drew support from industry groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Merck in a statement said it was disappointed and stands by the drug at issue, Proscar.  The decision came in a lawsuit by Massachusetts resident Brian Rafferty, who said he suffered from side effects, including sexual dysfunction, after taking the generic version of Merck\u2019s Proscar to treat an enlarged prostate beginning in 2010.  Under a 2011 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, generic drug companies cannot be sued for failing to provide adequate label warnings about potential side effects because federal law requires them to use the brand-name versions\u2019 labels.  As a result, Rafferty instead sued Merck, saying its Provacar label failed to warn that such side effects could continue after discontinuing use of the drug. A lower-court judge dismissed his negligence claims.  The top court reversed, allowing Rafferty to sue Merck for recklessness rather than negligence. This requires a higher standard of proof showing a drugmaker intentionally failed to update its warning label despite knowing the risks.  \u201cWhere a brand-name drug manufacturer provides an inadequate warning for its own product, it knows or should know that it puts at risk not only the users of its own product, but also the users of the generic product,\u201d Chief Justice Ralph Gants wrote.  Shielding brand-name manufacturers from liability entirely would leave consumers with no chance to sue generic drug companies, whose products command about 90 percent of the market, Gants wrote for the 4-0 court.  The decision was the latest by a top state court to weigh whether brand-name drugmakers can be sued over injuries blamed on generic drugs. The California Supreme Court in December ruled brand-name manufacturers could be sued by generic drug users.  Emily Lee-Smith, Rafferty\u2019s lawyer, said while she did not believe the heightened recklessness standard in Massachusetts was needed, \u201cwe think it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d  The case is Rafferty v.

The company also reported slightly higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit as Keytruda sales jumped 66 percent to $2.15 billion, compared with analysts\u2019 estimate of $2.12 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Keytruda has become the drug of choice as an initial, or first-line, treatment of advanced lung cancer, helping it to widen the gap with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co\u2019s rival drug Opdivo, which had been the early leader among treatments that help the immune system attack tumors. Opdivo had fourth-quarter sales of $1.8 billion.  Merck\u2019s Gardasil vaccine to prevent certain types of cancer also had a good quarter with sales up 32 percent to $835 million.  The company issued a 2019 earnings forecast with a midpoint a bit below Wall Street estimates, following a trend seen this month among other large drugmakers, including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer Inc, Bristol-Myers and Amgen Inc.

That follows a similar price increase for Keytruda earlier in the year, according to data from Rx Savings Solutions, which collects pricing data to help its customers save money on drugs.  It also raised the price of its human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil, which protects against cancers related to the virus, by around 6 percent. Analysts expect Gardasil will generate around $3 billion in sales for Merck this year.  It also raised the list price on three other vaccines.  \u201cMerck remains committed to responsibly pricing our medicines,\u201d Merck spokeswoman Pamela Eisele said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to evaluate our portfolio of products to look for opportunities to further reduce costs for patients and the health care system.\u201d  Eisele said the average net price of Merck\u2019s drugs, including rebates and discounts, fell 1.9 percent in the United States in 2017.  The latest increases earlier this month predate a Nov. 16 announcement by rival Pfizer Inc that it would raise prices on 41 of its medicines in January.  Many drugmakers, including Pfizer, Roche and Novartis, in July pledged not to raise prices for the remainder of 2018. Pfizer, under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, reversed course at the time and decided not to take previously announced price increases on some prescription medicines.

Lung cancer is by far the most lucrative oncology market with first-line approval providing access to the most patients.  Merck said on Monday that the green light from the European Commission allowed marketing of the combination in all 28 European Union (EU) member states plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway.  The Keytruda\/chemo combination is already approved in the United States. But last October the U.S. drugmaker withdrew an application for European approval, casting doubt over its prospects in the region.

Amid heightened public and political scrutiny over the high cost of prescription medicines and promises by Trump that drug price reductions were coming, New Jersey-based Merck became the first major drugmaker to announce voluntary price decreases.  In addition to slashing the price of Zepatier for hepatitis C, Merck said it would lower the list price of six other older drugs by 10 percent. It also said it would not increase the average net price of other medicines in its portfolio of products by more than the inflation rate annually.  Merck\u2019s most important product, the cancer drug Keytruda, lists for about $150,000 a year.  Trump, who has vowed to help reduce the cost of prescription drugs to consumers, had expressed anger at drugmakers over planned price hikes. In a tweet on July 9, he said they \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d and that his administration would respond.  Under direct pressure from Trump, Pfizer Inc, the largest U.S. drugmaker, said it would delay July 1 price increases until the end of the year or until the president\u2019s blueprint for lowering drug costs goes into effect.  Swiss drugmaker Novartis followed this week, saying it would not raise prices in the United States for the rest of the year.  Although Pfizer and Novartis only promised delays to price hikes, Trump said they decided to not increase prices. He has not yet commented on Merck\u2019s announcement.  \u201cThis decision (by Merck) is a response to President Trump\u2019s blueprint and reflects the industry\u2019s understanding that the President is serious about bringing change to our drug markets,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.  Trump made lowering prescription drug prices a top 2016 presidential campaign issue.  In May, Trump unveiled a \u201cblueprint\u201d to lower drug prices that appeared to largely spare drugmakers and instead took aim at \u201cmiddlemen,\u201d such as health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers, which demand hefty rebates in exchange for broad access to patients. Pharmaceutical company stocks rose after the blueprint was announced.  The cost of healthcare is expected to be a major campaign issue ahead of November midterm elections, with control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, both currently controlled by Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, potentially up for grabs.

FILE PHOTO: The Merck logo is seen at a gate to the Merck & Co campus in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., July 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The nine justices unanimously directed the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision to let the lawsuits proceed even though the Food and Drug Administration had rebuffed Merck when the company sought to add a warning to Fosamax\u2019s label about fracture risk.  Monday\u2019s ruling added clarity to a powerful defense employed by drug makers that product liability claims brought under state law are preempted by the actions of a federal agency, because federal law generally trumps state law under the U.S. Constitution. Merck argued that it cannot be penalized for failing to issue a warning that the FDA had blocked.  Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA denied its warning label proposal. After a task force further studied the issue, the FDA in 2010 ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning, which Merck did.  The plaintiffs contend that the FDA rejected only Merck\u2019s proposed language for the warning that focused on relatively minor stress fractures rather than the more serious fractures they suffered.  In a decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court said a drug manufacturer must show it \u201cfully informed\u201d the FDA of the need for a warning before it was rebuffed and that judges, not juries, must decide whether such lawsuits are preempted, as Merck has claimed. Lower courts now must revisit the case reflecting the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance.  Merck\u2019s shares were flat on Monday.  Fosamax helps prevent and treat osteoporosis, a condition that can lead to bone fractures, in women who have gone through menopause. But it may increase the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint, often requiring surgical intervention.  \u2018FULLY COMMITTED\u2019  In a statement, Merck said it was pleased with the decision and \u201cremains fully committed to defending these cases going forward and will continue to present evidence that it acted appropriately at all times in regard to the potential risk of atypical femur fractures.\u201d  David Frederick, an attorney for the Fosamax users who sued Merck, said Monday\u2019s decision reaffirms patients\u2019 ability to hold drug companies accountable. \u201cThis opinion protects access to justice for injured patients,\u201d Frederick said.  Sales of Fosamax, also available as a generic drug, totaled $209 million in 2018, according to New Jersey-based Merck.  Fosamax users sued Merck, alleging the drug caused them to sustain serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk. The number of cases has swelled to more than 1,000.  A federal trial court in New Jersey threw out the cases, but in 2017 the 3rd Circuit allowed the claims to proceed to trial, ruling that a jury could find that the FDA had objected only to Merck\u2019s phrasing of the proposed warning label.  On Monday, three justices - John Roberts, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh - agreed with the outcome of the case but did not join Breyer\u2019s decision. In a separate opinion, Alito signaled sympathy for Merck, noting the FDA had long been aware of the issue and was communicating with drug manufacturers, and noted that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration also backs Merck\u2019s position.","168":"April 9 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc:  * MERCK & CO INC CEO KENNETH FRAZIER\u2019S TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2017 WAS $17.6 MILLION VERSUS $21.8 MILLION LAST YEAR  * MERCK & CO INC SAYS CFO ROBERT DAVIS' FY 2017 TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $6.3 MLN VS $7.5 MLN IN FY 2016 - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2JwFqmR) Further company coverage:","169":"Feb 13 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc:  * MERCK ANNOUNCES DISCONTINUATION OF APECS STUDY EVALUATING VERUBECESTAT (MK-8931) FOR THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH PRODROMAL ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE  * MERCK & CO INC - EDMC CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT POSITIVE BENEFIT\/RISK COULD BE ESTABLISHED IF TRIAL CONTINUED  * MERCK & CO INC - DECISION TO STOP STUDY FOLLOWS A RECOMMENDATION BY EXTERNAL DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE  * MERCK & CO INC - IT WILL BE STOPPING PROTOCOL 019, ALSO KNOWN AS APECS STUDY  * MERCK & CO INC - STOPPING PROTOCOL 019, ALSO KNOWN AS APECS STUDY, A PHASE 3 STUDY EVALUATING VERUBECESTAT (MK-8931) Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","170":"(Reuters) - Incyte Corp said on Friday an independent committee concluded that its drug for a type of skin cancer in combination with Merck & Co\u2019s Keytruda failed to meet the main goal in a late-stage study.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  While Ebola is a deadly and contagious disease, it is also still relatively rare, making the potential market for a vaccine sporadic and very likely unprofitable. This poses a dilemma for drug companies: With no real prospect of a financial return, can they justify the investment in expensive development and trials.  GSK\u2019s vaccine candidates - two designed to protect against Ebola and one against the Marburg virus - will be transferred to the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C., the British drugmaker said in a statement. There is no financial element to the agreement, a spokesman said.  The transfer agreement will see Sabin continue to develop the candidate vaccines, one of which - a potential Ebola shot known as ChAd3 - has been through mid-stage, Phase II, trials in Africa and could possibly be used to halt or limit future Ebola epidemics.  \u201cEnabling Sabin to build on the scientific progress GSK has delivered up to Phase II increases the likelihood these candidate vaccines may help prevent potential future outbreaks,\u201d Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of GSK Vaccines, said in a statement.  GSK had put its Ebola vaccine work on hold after it was unable to progress the product through final stage, or Phase III, clinical trials toward the end of the 2014-16 epidemic, due to a dwindling number of Ebola cases.  U.S. drugmakers Merck MRK.N and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N are also developing potential vaccines against Ebola, and have made more progress with them than GSK had in clinical trials.  The Merck shot, known as VSV EBOV, is currently being used in the ongoing Ebola outbreak in Congo, which was last month declared an international health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO).  The disease has killed more than 1,800 people in the Congo outbreak which began a year ago and has become the second-worst on record.  GSK said Sabin had agreed a collaboration deal with the Vaccine Research Center at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to further develop the vaccine candidates.  The ChAd3 shot was originally developed by NIAID in collaboration with the Swiss-based firm Okairos, which was bought by GSK in 2013. All three experimental vaccines have shown promise in safety trials after being administered to more than 5,000 adults and 600 children, GSK said.","172":"(Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc MRK.N Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier will remain in the role beyond 2019, the drugmaker said on Wednesday, after it scrapped a policy requiring its CEOs to retire at the age of 65.

On his watch, the company\u2019s stock price has doubled and its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda has raked in blockbuster sales, becoming one of the leading products in a new generation of oncology treatments.  \u201cCEO succession has been our top priority, and removing the mandatory retirement policy enables the board to make the best decision concerning the timing of that transition,\u201d Merck\u2019s lead director Leslie Brun said in a statement.  A source familiar with the company said the decision to end the policy was initiated by the board, not by Frazier, and gives the company flexibility to run a succession program without a deadline.  The source stressed the company\u2019s strong bench of potential in-house CEO successors, including President of Global Human Health Adam Schechter, Chief Financial Officer Rob Davis and others.  Frazier made headlines last year when he became the first business leader to leave U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s now disbanded manufacturing council following Trump\u2019s comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The grandson of a sharecropper, and son of a janitor, Frazier\u2019s appointment to CEO in 2011 made him the only black person leading one of the major U.S. or European drugmakers.  Frazier made his name at Merck as the company\u2019s general counsel, steering the company through daunting litigation over Vioxx, its widely used painkiller that was withdrawn from the market in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks.  Merck eventually paid nearly $5 billion to settle some 27,000 lawsuits brought by those who claimed to have been harmed by the popular arthritis treatment.  As chief executive, Frazier has focused the company around the development Keytruda, which has racked up approvals to treat numerous types of cancer, including lung cancer.

The drug was approved in combination with Pfizer Inc\u2019s Inlyta to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma.  The approval, which comes two months ahead of expectations, allows this combination therapy to get an early launch ahead of other rival products, Cowen analyst Yaron Werber said, after the company received FDA approval on Friday.

Merck\u2019s offer of $20 per share was more than double ArQule\u2019s closing price on Friday, placing a high premium on its lead drug ARQ 531.  Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen called the deal smart and strategic.

A pharmacist refills a container in a drug dispensing machine at the Rock Canyon pharmacy in Provo, Utah, U.S., May 9, 2019. REUTERS\/George Frey  U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington sided with drugmakers Merck & Co Inc, Eli Lilly and Co and Amgen Inc by halting the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule from taking effect on Tuesday as planned.  Mehta in his ruling set aside the entire rule as invalid, saying HHS lacked authority from the U.S. Congress to compel drug manufacturers to disclose list prices.  \u201cIt is outrageous that an Obama appointed judge sided with big PhRMA to keep high drug prices secret from the American people, leaving patients and families as the real victims,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement, referring to President Donald Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.  PhRMA, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, is the largest industry lobbying group.  HHS Secretary Alex Azar had announced the rule on May 8, saying that forcing drugmakers to disclose their prices in direct-to-consumer TV advertising could help drive down skyrocketing prescription drug costs if the companies were embarrassed by them or afraid they would scare away customers.  HHS in a statement on Tuesday said it was disappointed in the court\u2019s decision, adding that it would work with the Department of Justice on next steps in the litigation.  \u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Azar remain focused on lowering drug prices and empowering patients through more transparency in healthcare costs,\u201d the agency said.  The rule was originally suggested in May 2018 as part of Trump\u2019s \u201cblueprint\u201d to lower prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers.  The judge said such disclosures could well be an effective tool in halting the rising cost of prescription drugs. \u201cBut no matter how vexing the problem of spiraling drug costs may be, HHS cannot do more than what Congress has authorized,\u201d Mehta concluded.  Under the rule, the wholesale, or list, price would be included if it was $35 or more for a month\u2019s supply or the usual course of therapy. HHS said the 10 most commonly advertised drugs had list prices of $488 to $16,938 per month or for a usual course of therapy.  PhRMA said the list prices could be confusing for patients and discourage them from seeking medical care.  Merck, Eli Lilly and Amgen filed their lawsuit alongside the Association Of National Advertisers trade group on June 14, arguing the rule would confuse consumers by forcing them to disclose a price irrelevant to patients with health insurance.  Drugmakers have long argued that list prices do not reflect out-of-pocket costs for most U.S. consumers or take into account the actual prices paid after discounts and rebates negotiated with health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to ensure patient access to the medicines.  The lawsuit alleged that HHS lacked authority to issue the rule and that it violated drugmakers\u2019 free-speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  The U.S. Justice Department defended the rule in court, saying it met a standard the U.S. Supreme Court set in 1985, when it held the government could force advertisers to disclose factual, non-controversial information.","192":"Dec 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s cancer drug developed along with Merck & Co as a first-line maintenance treatment for adults with a form of ovarian cancer, the companies said on Wednesday.

The FDA decision is shot in the arm for AstraZeneca, which has lost several patents on its older drugs since 2012, wiping out more than half of its sales.  Maintenance therapy means prolonged use and likely higher sales for British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which generated $297 million in Lynparza sales last year.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a June 2016 ruling that the two Merck patents, which cover methods of treating Hepatitis C, were unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by the company, including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.

A jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in March 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.  A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company\u2019s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.  Merck appealed the ruling, saying there was no \u201cdeliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.\u201d  But the appeals court said in Wednesday\u2019s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were \u201ctainted\u201d by misconduct and should not be enforceable.  In February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs.  The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck\u2019s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.

The justices declined to take up Merck\u2019s appeal of a lower court\u2019s ruling that overturned the massive damages verdict after finding that Merck\u2019s patent was invalid.  The case concerns a new generation of highly effective drugs for hepatitis C, a viral infection that can cause serious liver damage, able to cure more than 90% of patients, with few side effects.  New Jersey-based Merck\u2019s Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2013 accused California-based Gilead of infringing its patent on a family of compounds with the same basic chemical structure that is effective against the hepatitis C virus.  After a federal court trial in 2016, a jury sided with Idenix, awarding $2.54 billion for Gilead\u2019s infringement with its drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court, invalidated the patent in 2019 after determining that its claims on the family of compounds were overly broad, in violation of U.S. patent law.  In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Merck said that the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling undermined biotechnology breakthroughs in which discoveries often begin with a family of compounds that share a particular property.  A group of intellectual property scholars backed Merck in a written brief, telling the justices that the Federal Circuit ruling made it \u201cunreasonably difficult for a pharmaceutical company that comes up with an innovative new class of drugs to protect that class against imitation.

Merck was late to join the race to develop a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 2 million people and continues to surge in many parts of the world including the United States.  The company will record a pre-tax discontinuation charge in the fourth quarter for vaccine candidate V591, which it acquired with the purchase of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience, and V590, developed with nonprofit research organization IAVI, Merck said in a statement.  In early trials, both vaccines generated immune responses that were inferior to those seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19 as well as those reported for other COVID-19 vaccines, the company said.  The announcement is a setback to the fight against the pandemic and comes a month after Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline delayed launch of their shot to late 2021, underscoring the challenges of developing vaccines at record speed.  Tens of millions of doses of vaccines from rivals Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech as well as from Moderna Inc have so far been administered globally.  Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca Plc and others are also racing to develop safe and effective vaccines to protect against the virus.  Merck said it would focus COVID-19 research and manufacturing efforts on two investigational medicines: MK-7110 and MK-4482, which it now calls molnupiravir.  Molnupiravir, which is being developed in collaboration with Ridgeback Bio, is an oral antiviral being studied in both hospital and outpatient settings.  Merck said a Phase 2\/3 trial of the drug was set to finish in May, but initial efficacy results were due in the first quarter and would be made public if clinically meaningful.  Merck said results from a Phase 3 study of MK-7110, an immune modulator being studied as a treatment for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, were expected in the first quarter.

FILE PHOTO: Ken Frazier, Chairman and CEO, Merck & Co., speaks during a meeting of the Economic Club of New York in New York City, U.S., October 3, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  U.S. President Donald Trump said last year that one way his administration would seek to lower drug costs to consumers could be through an international pricing index (IPI) that would determine what Medicare pays for certain medicines based on the prices set in a handful of other countries. A proposed version of the rule is expected in August.  Other developed nations with single payer systems typically pay far less for drugs than the United States, which Trump called \u201cglobal freeloading.\u201d  \u201cI think there will be challenges to the rule,\u201d Frazier told reporters following the drugmaker\u2019s investor day in New York. \u201cA lot of people have objections to that rule. It\u2019s not just pharmaceutical companies.\u201d  Frazier, a lawyer by trade, did not say whether Merck would launch its own legal challenge to the proposed rule.  The company was one of three U.S. drugmakers that sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services this week over a new government regulation requiring them to disclose the list price of prescription drugs in direct-to-consumer television advertisements.  Of the Trump administration proposals to lower drug costs, the IPI option is the one Frazier said most concerns him, due to the effect importing price controls from other countries might have on innovation and patient access in the United States.  \u201cWe tell incomplete stories about those markets,\u201d Frazier said, noting that some countries ration treatments available to patients. He pointed to lower survival rates for lung cancer in Britain, which has an agency that can bar the use of approved new medicines based on their cost.  Earlier on Thursday, Merck executives touted the company\u2019s pipeline of experimental drugs beyond its blockbuster cancer treatment Keytruda.  The investor event was also an opportunity for Merck to showcase executives other than Frazier, who turns 65 in December. Last year, the company scrapped its mandatory retirement age of 65 for its CEO, saying it gave the board flexibility around finding his successor.  \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased by the breadth of the leadership talent at the company,\u201d Frazier said in response to a question about succession. \u201cI know that the board feels the same way.

The company also announced a $10 billion share buyback and raised its quarterly dividend by 15 percent, pushing its shares up about 1 percent.  Keytruda has been amassing approvals as a standalone therapy and in combination with other drugs to treat several forms of cancers. It is the leading immunotherapy for treating lung cancer, ahead of rival drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY.N, Roche ROG.S and AstraZeneca AZN.L.  Sales of Keytruda, which helps the immune system fight cancer, rose 80.4 percent to $1.89 billion from a year earlier and topped estimates of $1.87 billion, according to six analysts polled by Refinitiv.  Keytruda sales exceeded those of rival Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s drug Opdivo for the second straight quarter. Opdivo brought in sales of $1.79 billion for Bristol in the third quarter.  \u201cExpectations were high coming into the quarter but we think these results should still be well received and allow for continued confidence in the story and upside in the stock as we move into fourth quarter,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note.  The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range $4.30 to $4.36 per share, from its prior view of $4.22 to $4.30. The forecast was largely above analysts\u2019 estimates, according to Refinitiv data.  However, Merck narrowed its full-year revenue forecast to between $42.1 billion and $42.7 billion from its previous forecast range of $42 billion to $42.8 billion, to account for a hit from a stronger dollar.  Merck reported net income of $1.95 billion, compared with a loss of $56 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company had taken a $2.35 billion charge in connection with the formation of a collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L in 2017.  Excluding items, Merck earned $1.19 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.14, according to Refinitiv data.  Revenue rose 4.5 percent to $10.79 billion, but missed Wall Street expectation of $10.88 billion.  Sales of diabetes drug Januvia and related Janumet fell 2.3 percent to $1.49 billion, also missing estimates of about $1.51 billion.","216":"It also announced a partnership with privately held Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop an experimental oral antiviral drug against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  It did not disclose the terms of the acquisition of Themis, a privately held company.  Most big pharmaceutical companies have already placed their bets on COVID-19 treatments, but Merck has been waiting for opportunities with proven track records, Chief Executive Ken Frazier said.  \u201cWe wanted to be in a position where we could choose things that have the right kind of characteristics to make a contribution for a virus that\u2019s likely to be with us for some time,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  Both vaccines are designed to be delivered in a single dose.  The Themis vaccine, developed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Paris, is based on a modified measles virus that delivers bits of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body to prevent COVID-19.  It was developed in part through funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  Merck said it is moving quickly with this candidate and expects to start vaccinating volunteers \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d  The IAVI vaccine uses the same technology as Merck\u2019s Ebola vaccine ERVEBO, recently approved by the European Commission and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.  That candidate, which Merck is developing jointly with IAVI, is expected to start human trials some time this year, Frazier said.  The U.S. Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is backing the effort.  Both vaccines are made using technologies that have resulted in licensed products, unlike some frontrunners, such as the rapidly developed vaccine from Moderna Inc., which is expected to start large, late-stage clinical trials in July.  Last week, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Merck\u2019s vaccine, and those from Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, were a month or two behind Moderna\u2019s, but may get added to large efficacy trials this summer as they wrap up early-stage studies.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll be in a position to participate,\u201d Frazier said.  Merck intends to shoulder the cost of scaling up production of the vaccines before either has been proven to work, although it has not yet determined where they will be manufactured commercially, he said.  Doses of the Themis vaccine are already being made in France for clinical trials. Merck also plans to begin early production of the vaccine it is developing with IAVI at its plant in Pennsylvania.  Frazier said Merck had not signed any pacts with the U.S. government to deliver doses of either vaccine to Americans first, adding it was committed to making its vaccines accessible globally and affordably.  Ridgeback\u2019s pill, EIDD-2801, is designed to block virus reproduction, and has shown promise in animal studies of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It has also been shown to be safe and well tolerated in early stage trials.  Frazier compared it to Gilead Sciences\u2019 remdesivir, but it would be a pill, rather than an intravenous infusion. Efficacy trials will start later this year.  \u201cIf the drug works, we would be able to produce billions of doses,\u201d Frazier added.  The United States has recorded more than 1.6 million new coronavirus infections and over 97,000 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday.","217":"Sept 30 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc and Merck & Co Inc said on Monday their drug to treat a form of ovarian cancer improved progression-free survival in patients tested in a late-stage study.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign at an AstraZeneca site in Macclesfield, central England May 19, 2014. REUTERS\/Phil Noble\/File Photo  The result should pave the way for expanded use of the medicine, which is being developed and marketed with Merck & Co MRK.N under a deal struck last year.  Analysts said first-line use could boost Lynparza sales by more than $1 billion a year, although experts will first want to see the scale of the clinical benefit when full results are presented at a medical meeting.  The two companies did not say where they planned to present the data but one obvious venue would be the ESMO cancer congress in Munich in October.  Lynparza is already approved for later use in patients with so-called BRCA genetic mutations. Its latest success could expand the number of women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer who are suitable for the drug by 30-50 percent, AstraZeneca believes.  Lynparza - abandoned at one stage by AstraZeneca but revived by CEO Pascal Soriot when he took over in 2012 - became the first drug in a class known as PARP inhibitors to reach the market when it won U.S. approval at the end of 2014.  It now faces competition from rival products made by Tesaro TSRO.O and Clovis Oncology CLVS.O.  Based on the strong results seen in the latest Phase III study, known as SOLO-1, AstraZeneca and Merck said they would talk to regulators about approving the earlier use of the medicine in women with BRCA mutations, which can drive tumor growth.  \u201cIt is the first time that we see a significant and clinically impactful improvement in progression-free survival in the first-line maintenance setting for women with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer treated with a PARP inhibitor,\u201d said Sean Bohen, chief medical officer at AstraZeneca.

The therapy was approved for patients with a high-risk, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer who have undergone prior treatment and are ineligible for or have opted out of surgical removal of the bladder.  The approval was based on results from a mid-stage study in which nearly 41% of patients on Keytruda showed a complete response, with about half of them having a complete response for at least a year.  \u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019re recognizing that systemic immune activation can lead to durable remission of cancer,\u201d said Dr. Arjun Balar of NYU Langone\u2019s Perlmutter Cancer Center, the study\u2019s lead investigator.  \u201cThat is probably the path forward in terms of helping our patients preserve their bladder with bladder cancer.\u201d  Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is commonly treated with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine. However, patients who do not respond to the vaccine have limited treatment options other than surgery, which comes with substantial risk of complications, hospitalizations, and even death.  Merck had estimated that more than 80,000 Americans were newly diagnosed with bladder cancer over the last year, of which more than three fourths of patients were expected to have non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.  Keytruda is already approved for treating a number of cancers including melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.","230":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 8, 2019.

The approval is based on the treatment\u2019s late-stage trial results, which showed that Merck\u2019s drug, Zerbaxa, was as effective as another antibacterial drug.  Hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs in patients at least two to three days after being admitted or in those who are on mechanical breathing machines and have life-threatening lung infections with high mortality rates.  These infections are typically treated using antibiotics, but the growing problem of antibiotic resistance has rendered some of the most commonly prescribed treatments ineffective.  While the U.S. FDA has been pushing for newer versions of antibiotics, drugmakers have shied away from developing the treatments, as combating antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, popularly known as superbugs, becomes increasingly challenging.  At least 2 million people in the United States develop serious infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resulting in nearly 23,000 deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FILE PHOTO: Swiss drugmaker Roche's logo is seen at their headquarters in Basel, Switzerland January 28, 2016. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Its phase III IMpower130 study, one of eight trials it has going against lung cancer that rely on Tecentriq, met goals of boosting overall survival and progression-free survival in the initial treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to chemotherapy alone, Roche said.  This is the third late-stage study of Tecentriq alone or in a cocktail to show an overall survival benefit for people with NSCLC, Roche said.  Roche\u2019s third-to-market drug after Keytruda and Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo has just a fraction of their sales. Roche is under pressure to see as many trials succeed as possible because Tecentriq is central to its strategy to replace falling revenue from older, off-patent medicines.  \u201cThe results of the IMpower130 study add to the growing evidence showing the clinical benefit of Tecentriq-based combinations in the treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,\u201d Roche Chief Medical Officer Sandra Horning said.

Detailed IMpower 130 results are not due until later this year, possibly in September at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer conference in Toronto or October\u2019s European Society for Medical Oncology in Munich.  Given that, it \u201cis still very difficult to interpret how Tecentriq stacks up against competitors\u201d, said Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race.

Rituxan is already being hammered by copies in Europe. The patent clock is also ticking on Herceptin and Avastin, putting $21 billion in annual revenue at risk by 2020.

It also announced a partnership with privately held Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop an experimental oral antiviral drug against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Merck did not disclose the terms of the acquisition of Themis, a privately held company.  Most big pharmaceutical companies have already placed their bets on COVID-19 treatments. But Merck has been waiting for opportunities with proven track records, Chief Executive Ken Frazier said.  \u201cWe wanted to be in a position where we could choose things that have the right kind of characteristics to make a contribution for a virus that\u2019s likely to be with us for some time,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  Both vaccines under development are designed to be delivered in a single dose.  The Themis vaccine, developed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Paris, is based on a modified measles virus that delivers bits of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body to prevent COVID-19.  It was developed in part through funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  Merck said it moving quickly with this candidate and expects to start vaccinating volunteers \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d  Slideshow ( 6 images )  The IAVI vaccine uses the same technology as Merck\u2019s Ebola vaccine ERVEBO, recently approved by the European Commission and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.  That candidate, which Merck is developing jointly with IAVI, is expected to start human trials sometime this year, Frazier said.  The U.S. Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is backing the effort.  Both vaccines are made using technologies that have resulted in licensed products, unlike some frontrunners, such as the rapidly developed vaccine from Moderna Inc MRNA.O, which is expected to start large, late-stage clinical trials in July.  More than 100 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are in development, with about 12 in human testing designed mainly to evaluate safety.  Last week, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Merck's vaccine, and those from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Sanofi SASY.PA, were a month or two behind Moderna's, but may be added to large efficacy trials this summer as they wrap up early-stage studies.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll be in a position to participate,\u201d Frazier said of Merck\u2019s vaccines.  Merck intends to shoulder the cost of scaling up production of the vaccines before either has been proven to work, although it has not yet determined where they will be manufactured commercially, he said.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Doses of the Themis vaccine are already being made in France for clinical trials. Merck plans to begin early production of the vaccine it is developing with IAVI at its plant in Pennsylvania.  Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen said in a research note she expected Merck to be \u201can important player in the COVID-19 vaccines and treatments landscape\u201d and called the approach to pursue multiple vaccine strategies \u201ca good means to diversify risk.\u201d  Merck shares were up around 1.5% in late trading, as the broader U.S. stock market jumped.  Frazier said Merck had not signed any pacts with the U.S. government to deliver doses of either vaccine to Americans first, adding that it was committed to making its vaccines accessible globally and affordably. The drugmaker said it signed a memorandum of understanding with CEPI and Institut Pasteur outlining its commitment to a global vaccine that is distributed based on need.  Ridgeback\u2019s antiviral drug, EIDD-2801, is designed to block virus reproduction and has shown promise in animal studies of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It has also been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in early stage trials.  Frazier compared it to Gilead Sciences' GILD.O remdesivir, but it would be a pill, rather than an intravenous infusion. Efficacy trials will start later this year.  \u201cIf the drug works, we would be able to produce billions of doses,\u201d Frazier added.  The United States has recorded more than 1.6 million new coronavirus infections and over 97,000 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday.

REUTERS\/Phil Noble\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc has agreed to acquire drugmaker OncoImmune in a deal that will give it control of a drug that could help ease symptoms and reduce deaths in patients with severe or critical cases of COVID-19.  Merck is paying $425 million for the private company, in addition to extra payments for regulatory milestones and sales. Merck has built out its portfolio of COVID-19 medicines through a series of deals in recent months, including the acquisition of Australian drugmaker Themis and a partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP.  OncoImmune recently announced positive interim data from a phase 3 trial of its leading therapeutic candidate, CD24F, for patients with severe and critical COVID-19.  The data show that the therapy, which is administered as an injection, increased the likelihood of symptom improvement in serious COVID-19 cases and also reduced the risk of respiratory failure and death, said Roger Perlmutter, who heads research at Merck.  He added that CD24F could potentially complement dexamethasone, a generic steroid that is the current standard of care for the most serious COVID-19 cases. The steroid was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump for COVID-19 in October.  Merck is aiming to develop the manufacturing capacity needed to produce the therapy at scale, which could take weeks to months.  CD24F was originally developed to treat graft versus host disease (GVHD) for patients with leukemia who received stem cell transplants. OncoImmune has initiated phase 3 studies for the drug in GVHD.  Merck is also developing two potential vaccines that are still in early stages of development and an antiviral treatment called molnupiravir.  Pfizer Inc and BioNTech Inc filed for regulatory authorization of their vaccine candidate on Friday after advanced studies show it was highly effective in preventing COVID-19.","258":"May 8 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc:  * MERCK ANNOUNCES VIRTUAL 2020 ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","259":"(Reuters) -Merck & Co said on Wednesday it would supply 60,000-100,000 doses of its experimental COVID-19 treatment to the U.S. government for up to about $356 million.

Frazier, 66, will remain with the drugmaker as executive chairman for a transition period. He had been due to retire in 2019, but the company scrapped a policy requiring its CEO to retire at age 65.  Frazier was one of only five Black CEOs on last year\u2019s Fortune 500 list of America\u2019s largest companies, released in June 2020.  His departure would drop the number to three as TIAA CEO Roger Ferguson, Jr. will also retire in March. But with Rosalind Brewer, Starbucks\u2019 Chief Operating Officer, joining the ranks as CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc in March, the number will go to four.  Corporate boards are coming under pressure to address the dearth of Black leadership at top American companies with diversity increasingly recognized as a worthy corporate value.  Davis will inherit a company with one of the world\u2019s best selling drugs in its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and a tightened focus after it completes the spinoff of its slower growing women\u2019s health, biosimilar drugs and older products later this year.  Frazier joined Merck nearly 30 years ago and climbed the ranks, becoming the first Black CEO of a major drug company in 2011. He made his name at Merck as general counsel by steering the company safely through daunting litigation over Vioxx. He also played a significant role in Merck\u2019s 2009 acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Schering-Plough, which then held Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, as a pipeline asset.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cThat deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab.\u201d  Under Frazier\u2019s leadership, Keytruda has eclipsed Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s cancer immunotherapies, which hit the market first. Keytruda\u2019s sales topped $14 billion last year.  Shares of the company more than doubled over his tenure.  Frazier, the grandson of a sharecropper, made headlines in 2017 when he became the first business leader to leave former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s manufacturing council following Trump\u2019s comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cHis shoes won\u2019t be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today,\u201d Davis said on a post-earnings conference call.  Frazier\u2019s success at Merck shows that the lack of top Black executives is not reflective of performance but rather of comfort, said Monica Hawkins, a Washington, D.C.-based management consultant.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Because many executives\u2019 \u201csocial circles don\u2019t give them the social capital to know more than five Ken Fraziers - if they know any - that excellence becomes a question in their mind, because they\u2019ve never seen it before,\u201d Hawkins said.  Although Black directors held 8% of board seats in the S&P 500 as of August, just five of those companies, or 1%, had Black CEOs, according to researcher Equilar. They included Frazier.  Barry Lawson Williams, a retired corporate director involved in efforts to recruit and place Black business leaders, said the paucity of Black CEOs at top U.S. companies partly reflected competition for that talent from private equity and financial services companies who can pay more.  He expects the number of Black CEOs will rise in coming years, adding: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that there are a lot of good candidates.\u201d  Frazier\u2019s transition follows the recent retirement of Roger Perlmutter, who ran the company\u2019s research and development division for much of Frazier\u2019s tenure and was also considered a major force behind the success of Keytruda. Dean Li took over for Perlmutter on Jan. 1.  Davis has been CFO since 2014 and in charge of the company\u2019s business development, real estate and other corporate strategic functions since 2016.  A career healthcare executive, he was president of Baxter International Inc\u2019s medical products business before joining Merck, and also spent 14 years at Eli Lilly and Co.","262":"A federal appeals court on Tuesday was considering whether to reinstate a $2.54 billion jury verdict Merck & Co Inc won against Gilead Sciences Inc in a dispute over hepatitis C treatments \u2014 the largest ever in a patent infringement case.

FILE PHOTO: A vial of the measles, mumps, and rubella virus (MMR) vaccine is pictured at the International Community Health Services clinic in Seattle, Washington, U.S., March 20, 2019. Picture taken March 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Lindsey Wasson\/File Photo\/File Photo  Merck, the sole U.S. supplier of measles vaccines, said the increased demand was noticeable, but did not amount to a surge, and has not required a significant increase in distribution across the country.  \u201cDespite what we\u2019ve seen as a huge uptick in the number of cases ... the demand side of the equation hasn\u2019t been outstripping our underlying capacity,\u201d Merck Chief Marketing Officer Mike Nally, who also runs the firms Global Human Health business, said in an interview.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 704 cases of measles as of April 26, a 1.3 percent increase since the 695 reported last week. The vast majority of cases have occurred in children who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and public health officials are working to ensure immunization.  The measles virus is highly contagious and can cause blindness, deafness, brain damage or death. It is currently spreading in outbreaks in many parts of the world.  U.S. officials deemed the disease eliminated in 2000, yet outbreaks still happen as infected travelers expose vulnerable populations to the virus, particularly in communities with many vaccine skeptics.  Adults in the United States who were vaccinated against measles decades ago may also need a new dose of the vaccine depending on when they received the shot and whether they live in an outbreak zone or plan to travel to one, according to public health experts battling the outbreak.  Merck said on Tuesday that U.S. sales of MMR and chickenpox vaccines rose around 10 percent to $343 million in the first quarter.  Nally said much of the increase came from sales to private clinics, which pay more than the government for the vaccines, rather than an increase in volume.  He said there are pockets of demand for the vaccine around areas where there have been cases of measles. The current outbreak has been concentrated in New York City, where officials said more than 390 cases have been recorded since October, mostly among children in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn.  But Merck has not see a significant uptick of purchases from the CDC, which is a large supplier of the pediatric population through its Vaccines for Children program.  Merck\u2019s Nally said the company believes it will be able to meet that new demand.  \u201cAs measles outbreaks have occurred in different parts of the world over the last few decades, we\u2019ve always been able to surge capacity, and we feel confident about our ability to do so in the U.S,\u201d he said.","264":"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Merck & Co Inc would buy $1 billion worth of equity stake in Seattle Genetics\u2019s common stock, the companies said on Monday.

Seattle Genetics, a cancer-focussed drug developer, will receive an upfront payment of $600 million under the agreement, while Merck will invest the $1 billion to buy 5 million shares of Seattle Genetics for $200 per share, a premium of 33.4% to Seattle\u2019s last close.  This would amount to a stake of nearly 2.9%, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Shares of Seattle Genetics were up nearly 12% at $167.48 in premarket trade, while Merck shares were largely unchanged.

Seattle Genetics is also eligible for additional milestone payments of up to $2.6 billion.  Separately, Seattle Genetics has also given Merck exclusive license to sell its cancer therapy Tukysa in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe.

The new company\u2019s assets currently make up around 15% of Merck\u2019s total sales and around half of its drugs that treat people.  Merck will retain its animal health business, as well as drugs used for acute care in hospitals such as Bridion, which reverses the effects of anesthesia.  Merck shares fell 3.7% to $85.12 after the U.S. drugmaker also reported quarterly Keytruda sales below Wall Street\u2019s lofty estimates.  The spinoff is a culmination of the drugmaker\u2019s strategy of concentrating on a few key areas, particularly oncology, where Merck has turned the immunotherapy Keytruda into one of the world\u2019s top selling drugs, Merck Chief Executive Ken Frazier said in an interview.  \u201cThe whole key to this is that it allows Merck to be much more focused on its greatest growth opportunities,\u201d he said.  That starts with Keytruda, now a mainstay of many cancer regimens including for newly diagnosed advanced lung cancer, the biggest commercial opportunity in oncology. Its sales jumped nearly 45% to $3.11 billion, below analysts\u2019 estimates of $3.24 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Sales of the assets that will make up the new company were expected to fall or be flat through 2024, but it can achieve growth through management attention, said Kevin Ali, a Merck veteran who will head the new company.  Merck, which expects to complete the transaction in the first half of 2021, said the new company will send it $8 billion to $9 billion through a special tax-free dividend. The new entity is expected to have $8.5 to $9.5 billion in debt.  Merck forecast cost savings of over $1.5 billion by 2024 after the spinoff.  Announcement of the spinoff without more color on management succession could cause some concern for investors said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen.  Merck in 2018 scrapped a policy requiring CEOs step down at age 65, ensuring that Frazier, who turned 65 last year, can remain at the helm.  However, the spinoff was not related to succession, Frazier told Reuters.  \u201cOur board has a process in place for succession. This is really again taking actions today that will assure the longer term growth.\u201d  Merck also reported an adjusted quarterly profit of $1.16 per share, beating analysts\u2019 estimates by a penny.

REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse  LONDON - A vaccine given to girls to protect them against a virus that causes cervical cancer is a \u201ccritical\u201d health tool and access to it should be scaled up as swiftly as possible, especially in poorer countries, cancer experts said on Monday.  Figures from the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) showed an estimated 570,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed worldwide in 2018, making it the fourth most common cancer in women globally.  Each year, more than 310,000 women die from cervical cancer, and the vast majority of deaths are in poorer countries where immunization rates against the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes it are low.  In wealthy countries, some anti-vaccine campaigners are also persuading parents to refuse the shot for their children, leaving them at risk, IARC said.  \u201cUnfounded rumors about HPV vaccines continue to unnecessarily delay or impede the scaling up of vaccination,\u201d IARC\u2019s director Elisabete Weiderpass said in a statement.  She said IARC was committed to fighting cervical cancer and \u201cunequivocally confirms the efficacy and safety\u201d of HPV shots.  Britain\u2019s GSK makes an HPV vaccine called Cervarix, which targets two strains of the virus, while Merck makes a rival shot, Gardasil, which targets nine strains.  In a separate statement addressed to the WHO last week, the GAVI vaccines alliance also urged greater support for HPV shots, saying it aimed to immunize 40 million girls in poorer countries against HPV by 2020.  This would avert an estimated 900,000 deaths, GAVI said.  IARC said reducing the cost of vaccines in poorer countries would play a vital role in increasing access to them. It said it was working with the generic drugmaker Serum Institute of India to develop an HPV shot that \u201ccould provide a high-quality alternative at a lower cost\u201d.","267":"LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca\u2019s oncology business received a boost on Wednesday as results of a clinical trial showed its drug Lynparza helped women with ovarian cancer live longer without their disease worsening when given as a first-line treatment.  The result should pave the way for expanded use of the medicine, which is being developed and marketed with Merck & Co under a deal struck last year.  Lynparza is already approved for later use in patients with so-called BRCA genetic mutations. Its success in first-line therapy could expand the number of women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer who are suitable for the drug by 30-50 percent, AstraZeneca believes.  Lynparza - abandoned at one stage by AstraZeneca but revived by CEO Pascal Soriot when he took over in 2012 - became the first drug in a class known as PARP inhibitors to reach the market when it won U.S. approval at the end of 2014. It now faces competition from rival products made by Tesaro and Clovis Oncology. Based on the strong results seen in the latest Phase III study, known as SOLO-1, AstraZeneca and Merck said they would talk to regulators about approving the earlier use of the medicine in women with BRCA mutations, which can drive tumour growth.  \u201cIt is the first time that we see a significant and clinically impactful improvement in progression-free survival in the first-line maintenance setting for women with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer treated with a PARP inhibitor,\u201d said Sean Bohen, chief medical officer at AstraZeneca.

Sales of Keytruda surged 55 percent to $2.27 billion. While shy of lofty Wall Street estimates of $2.33 billion, they topped Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s rival drug Opdivo, which brought in $1.8 billion, for the fourth consecutive quarter.  Lung cancer accounted for 65 percent of Keytruda\u2019s U.S. sales.

Gardasil sales rose 27 percent to $828 million, beating analyst expectations by about $25 million.  Sales of the company\u2019s measles-mumps-rubella and chickenpox vaccines rose 27 percent to $496 million, helped by government tenders in Latin America and higher European and U.S. demand.  Measles cases in the United States have hit their highest level since the virus was declared eradicated in 2000, with a total of at least 705 confirmed cases so far. Merck is the sole provider of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.  The company said it plans a restructuring program to optimize its manufacturing and supply network and cut its real estate footprint, and expects to take related charges of $500 million in 2019.  Excluding items, Merck earned $1.22 per share, beating the analysts\u2019 average estimate by 16 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income nearly quadrupled to $2.92 billion from $736 million a year earlier, when the company had taken a $1.4 billion charge related to a collaboration deal with Japanese drugmaker Eisai Co Ltd.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Merck was late to join the race to develop a vaccine to protect against the virus, which is again surging in many parts of the world including the United States. Rivals Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc are already deep into late-stage testing.  The company began recruiting trial participants in September for an early-stage study of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate V591, which it acquired with the purchase of Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience.  Initial data showing whether V591 triggers an immune response in trial participants is expected by the end of the year, Merck research chief Roger Perlmutter said on a conference call.  The drugmaker is also collaborating with research non-profit IAVI on a second candidate that uses the same technology as Merck\u2019s Ebola vaccine. It is several weeks behind the V591 program but on a similar development track, Perlmutter said.  Merck said it was building facilities to be able to manufacture many millions of doses of the two vaccines. Drugmakers have committed to large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines before gaining approval to speed their eventual availability.  In addition to the vaccines, Merck has begun two late-stage studies of an antiviral drug against COVID-19 being developed in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. The company said it has secured resources to produce millions of doses of the drug before the end of 2020.  The U.S. drugmaker also reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast. Merck shares rose more than 1% to $79.68.  Merck now expects 2020 adjusted profit of $5.91 to $6.01 per share, up from its prior forecast of $5.63 to $5.78 per share.

Shares dropped 2.8 percent to $57.22, however, on investor concerns that the company is becoming increasingly reliant on the drug, which is positioned to become the leading player in a new generation of oncology treatments.  Analysts said some investors were disappointed that the company said it does not plan to spin off its animal health business or do a large, transformational deal.  \u201cWhile Keytruda continues to do fantastically well, investors are still clamoring for something else besides Keytruda to focus on \u2013 thus the push by investors to spin out animal health, and the continual probing about M&A,\u201d Jefferies analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.  The surge in Keytruda sales more than offset steep declines in sales for its shingles vaccine Zostavax and hepatitis C treatment Zepatier.  Keytruda had sales of $1.46 billion in the quarter, ahead of $1.40 billion estimated by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Keytruda's sales have nearly pulled even with Bristol-Myers Squibb's BMY.N rival drug Opdivo, which also harnesses the body's immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells. Industry experts give Merck's drug the edge after results from trials for both treatments last month, and Merck said on Tuesday the drug could be its largest seller ever.  Revenue from the drug accounted for nearly 15 percent of Merck\u2019s sales.  Merck CEO Ken Frazier said on the company\u2019s conference call that while the company did not expect to do transformational deals, it was looking for opportunities to enhance its drug pipeline.  \u201cWe have a strong balance sheet. We have the power and the flexibility to do deals at any size and stage, and we\u2019re going to continue to look for things that can drive long-term value and growth,\u201d he said.

Frazier, 66, will not be handing over the reins completely, at least for now. He will remain with the drugmaker as executive chairman for a transition period.  He was set to retire in 2019, but the company scrapped a policy requiring its CEO to retire at the age of 65.  Davis will inherit a company with one of the world\u2019s best selling drugs in its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and a tightened focus after it completes the spinoff of its slower growing women\u2019s health, biosimilar drugs and older products later this year.  Frazier joined Merck nearly 30 years ago and climbed the ranks, becoming CEO of the Fortune 500 company in 2011. He made his name at Merck as general counsel by steering the company safely through daunting litigation over Vioxx. He also played a significant role in Merck\u2019s 2009 acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Schering-Plough, which then held Keytruda, or pembrolizumab, as a pipeline asset.  \u201cThat deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab.\u201d  Under Frazier\u2019s leadership, Keytruda has eclipsed Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s cancer immunotherapies, which hit the market first. Keytruda\u2019s sales topped $14 billion last year.  Shares of the company more than doubled over his tenure.  Frazier, the grandson of a sharecropper, made headlines in 2017 when he became the first business leader to leave former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s manufacturing council following Trump\u2019s comments on a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia.  \u201cHis shoes won\u2019t be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today,\u201d Davis said on a post-earnings conference call.  Frazier\u2019s transition follows the recent retirement of Roger Perlmutter, who ran the company\u2019s research and development division for much of Frazier\u2019s tenure and was also considered a major force behind the success of Keytruda. Dean Li took over for Perlmutter on Jan. 1.  Davis has been CFO since 2014 and in charge of the company\u2019s business development, real estate and other corporate strategic functions since 2016.  A career healthcare executive, he was the president of Baxter International Inc\u2019s medical products business before joining Merck, and also spent 14 years at Eli Lilly and Co.  Citi analyst Andrew Baum said the elevation of Davis suggests the company will work to reduce its dependency on Keytruda.  The company also reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.32 per share that missed analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.38 per share on lower-than-expected sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet.  It forecast a better-than-expected profit in 2021, although it said the COVID-19 pandemic would hurt sales of certain drugs, especially vaccines.

It was developed in part through funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).  Merck said it moving very fast with this candidate and expects to start vaccinating volunteers \u201cwithin weeks.\u201d  The IAVI vaccine uses the same technology as Merck\u2019s Ebola vaccine ERVEBO, recently approved by the European Commission and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.  That candidate, which Merck is developing jointly with IAVI, is expected to start human trials sometime this year, Frazier said.  The U.S. Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is backing the effort.  Both vaccines are made using technologies that have resulted in licensed products, unlike some frontrunners, such as the rapidly developed vaccine from Moderna Inc, which is expected to start large, late-stage clinical trials in July.  Last week, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Merck\u2019s vaccine, and those from Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, are a month or two behind Moderna\u2019s, but may get added to large efficacy trials this summer as they wrap up early-stage studies.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll be in a position to participate,\u201d Frazier said.  Merck intends to shoulder the cost of scaling up production of the vaccines before either has been proven to work, although it has not yet determined where they will be manufactured commercially, he said.  Doses of the Themis vaccine are already being made in France for clinical trials. Merck also plans to begin early production of the vaccine it is developing with IAVI at its plant in Pennsylvania.  Frazier said Merck had not signed any pacts with the U.S. government to deliver doses of either vaccine to Americans first, adding that it was committed to make its vaccines accessible globally and affordably.  Ridgeback\u2019s pill, EIDD-2801, is designed to block virus reproduction, and has shown promise in animal studies of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It has also been shown to be safe and well tolerated in early stage trials.  Frazier compared it to Gilead Sciences\u2019 remdesivir, but it would be a pill, rather than an intravenous infusion. Efficacy trials will start later this year.  \u201cIf the drug works, we would be able to produce billions of doses,\u201d Frazier added.  The United States has recorded more than 1.6 million virus infections and over 97,000 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday.

FILE PHOTO: A Gilead Sciences, Inc. logo is seen outside the company headquarters in Foster City, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  A jury awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Gilead\u2019s Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents, but a judge later ruled the patents unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.  Merck had urged the Supreme Court to place limits on the doctrine of \u201cunclean hands\u201d that can prevent plaintiffs from winning lawsuits if they acted in bad faith.  Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Injection drug use is among the causes of the infection.  Direct-acting anti-viral medications like Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni have revolutionized treatment of hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. Merck holds patents that it has said cover a compound that is the foundation for all major antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C.  A federal court jury in San Jose, California awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.  A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling that in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.  Merck\u2019s litigation against Gilead has included several reversals of fortune.  In 2016, a jury in Delaware said Gilead infringed a related patent and ordered it to pay Merck $2.54 billion in royalties, the largest verdict ever in a patent case. But a judge threw out the verdict in February 2018, ruling that Merck\u2019s patent was invalid because it was not sufficiently detailed in its wording.","310":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc and Merck & Co Inc said on Monday their treatment for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian  cancer improved progression-free survival in patients tested in a late-stage study.  The study tested Lynparza in patients as an add-on to an already existing standard of care, bevacizumab, and was compared to a group of patients given bevacizumab alone.  The treatment showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival in women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer, the companies said.  Lynparza added to bevacizumab reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 41% in the overall trial population.  The combination also improved progression-free survival to a median of 22.1 months compared to 16.6 months for those treated with bevacizumab alone, the companies said.  The treatment, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, is approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer and metastatic breast cancer and has been used to treat over 25,000 patients worldwide.  The American Cancer Society expects about 22,530 women to be newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2019.","311":"April 28 (Reuters) - Merck & Co Inc:  * ANNOUNCES FIRST-QUARTER 2020 FINANCIAL RESULTS  * Q1 NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $1.50  * Q1 GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $1.26  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE ESTIMATE $1.34 -- REFINITIV IBES DATA  * SEES FY 2020 NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $5.17 TO $5.37 INCLUDING ITEMS  * SEES FY 2020 GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE $4.12 TO $4.32  * & CO INC - ACTIVE IN COVID-19-RELATED ANTIVIRAL AND VACCINE RESEARCH  * & CO INC - LOWERS 2020 FULL-YEAR REVENUE RANGE TO BE BETWEEN $46.1 BILLION AND $48.1 BILLION  * & CO INC - LOWERED 2020 FULL-YEAR REVENUE RANGE INCLUDES A NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF APPROXIMATELY 2.5%  * & CO INC - LOWERS 2020 FULL-YEAR GAAP EPS RANGE TO BE BETWEEN $4.12 AND $4.32  * & CO INC - ARE PARTICIPATING IN NIH-LED ACCELERATING COVID-19 THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS AND VACCINES (ACTIV CONSORTIUM)  * & CO INC - IN Q1, ESTIMATED OVERALL IMPACT OF COVID-19 TO MERCK\u2019S REVENUE WAS IMMATERIAL  * & CO INC - FOR 2020, EXPECTS AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO REVENUE OF ABOUT $2.1 BILLION (EXCLUDING IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE) DUE TO COVID-19  * & CO INC QTRLY KEYTRUDA SALES $3.28 BILLION VERSUS $ 2.27 BILLION  * & CO INC - IN Q1, WITHIN HUMAN HEALTH BUSINESS, MARKETS IN ASIA PACIFIC, INCLUDING CHINA, SAW A NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES  * & CO INC QTRLY JANUVIA \/ JANUMET SALES $1.28 BILLION VERSUS $1.35 BILLION  * & CO INC - IN Q1, WITHIN MARKETS OUTSIDE ASIA PACIFIC, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, SAW CUSTOMERS BUILD INVENTORY  * & CO INC - ANTICIPATES REDUCED DEMAND FOR ITS PHYSICIAN-ADMINISTERED PRODUCTS WHILE PANDEMIC-RELATED ACCESS MEASURES REMAIN IN PLACE  * DECLINES IN MEDICAL VISITS, ELECTIVE SURGERIES WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR SOME PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BRIDION (SUGAMMADEX)  * & CO INC - EXPECTS THAT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON ECONOMY WILL HAVE AN ADDITIONAL UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON ITS ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS  * & CO INC QTRLY GARDASIL \/ GARDASIL 9 SALES $1,097 MILLION VERSUS $838 MILLION  * & CO INC - ASSUMED MAJORITY OF NEGATIVE IMPACT WILL BE IN Q2, WITH A GRADUAL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATIONS BEGINNING LATE IN Q2  * & CO INC - TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED ITS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  * & CO INC - TO DATE, COVID-19 HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY OF CO\u2019S MEDICINES AND VACCINES  * & CO INC - CURRENTLY BELIEVES SUPPLY OF ITS MEDICINES AND VACCINES WILL REMAIN AT NORMAL LEVELS THROUGH PANDEMIC  * & CO INC - REMAIN FULLY COMMITTED TO SPINOFF DEAL OF ITS WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH, TRUSTED LEGACY BRANDS AND BIOSIMILARS BUSINESSES  * & CO - INTENDS TO CONSOLIDATE NEW JERSEY CAMPUSES INTO A SINGLE NEW JERSEY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION IN RAHWAY BY END OF 2023  * & CO INC - ON TRACK FOR COMPLETION OF ORGANON SPINOFF DEAL IN FIRST HALF OF 2021 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","312":"(Corrects spelling of Merck CEO\u2019s surname to Frazier in paragraph 5, \u2018addition\u2019 in paragraph 4.)  HOUSTON, May 27 (Reuters) - Top fund manager BlackRock Inc on Wednesday said it cast an advisory vote in favor of an independent chairman and against the reelection of two directors at Exxon Mobil Corp over the company\u2019s approach to climate risks.  Exxon shareholders on Wednesday rejected all four shareholder resolutions with none getting more than 38% of the votes cast. The independent chairman proposal fell with 32.7% in favor of an appointment when the next chief executive is named.
