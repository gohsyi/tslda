PHOTO: U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer addresses The Economic Club of New York in New York, U.S. on March 23, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is hiring former U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer as a senior adviser, the world\u2019s largest fund manager said in a memo on Wednesday.  Over his career Fischer helped to shape modern economic theory as an academic, trained many future policymakers and put his ideas into practice in a series of jobs culminating in roles at the center of the response to the 2008 global financial crisis.  Fischer, who was born in Zambia, served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 2005 to 2013 before joining the Fed, where he was vice chair for 3-1\/2 years until October 2017.  New York-based BlackRock, which manages about $6 trillion in assets, said Fischer would be a senior adviser within the BlackRock Investment Institute, an arm of the company that serves as a think tank on investment strategy, according to the memo co-signed by Chief Executive Larry Fink and confirmed by a company spokeswoman.  The memo said Fischer will add to the company\u2019s research, support its investment teams and speak with clients on markets, economics and central bank policy.  During his time at the Fed, as memories of the financial crisis faded, monetary policymakers continued to wrestle with how to undo their historic stimulus efforts at that time without sending the economy into another tailspin.  As some of his colleagues began wondering about a permanent downshift in global inflation and interest rates, Fischer maintained an underlying faith in the macroeconomic models - which he helped refine - that showed falling unemployment ultimately raising inflation and requiring higher interest rates in response.  Prior to his role as a monetary policymaker, Fischer was chief economist at the World Bank, and first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund during the Asian financial crisis. He was also a vice chairman at Citigroup Inc from 2002 to 2005.","1":"BOSTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc cited the value and costs of shareholder proposals in a letter to regulators weighing reforms to the proxy process, and did not specifically comment on ideas like raising the current $2,000 threshold needed to file some resolutions.  In the letter dated Feb. 3 and provided by a BlackRock spokesman on Thursday, the top asset manager wrote that \u201cShareholder proposals can be a valuable part of an investment stewardship process, however, it should be acknowledged that the costs of these proposals are borne by all shareholders.\u201d (Reporting by Ross Kerber Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)","2":"(Reuters) - The world\u2019s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc, expects the overall backdrop for risk assets to be positive in 2021, supported by easy money from central banks, with Asia well-poised to lead the post-COVID-19 recovery.  FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018\/File Photo  Investors will continue to look for income, yields and returns, Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit at BlackRock, which manages a record $7.8 trillion in assets, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum from Hong Kong.  \u201cHence, countries with reasonable fundamentals and good growth potential (will be preferred),\u201d Seth said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, 2021.  Some Asian central banks will remain on a neutral-to-accommodative path in 2021, he said, adding that Indonesia, India and Malaysia may have room to ease. Seth expected bond yields in those countries to drift lower next year.  Seth said it would take another 12-18 months before economic activity returned to normal, employment levels recovered and inflation started to rise. For central banks in the United States and other developed markets, he said policy normalisation was not on the horizon.  Seth expected the U.S. 10-year yield to be in the 1.00%-1.50% range by the end of 2021.  The fissure between emerging markets and developed countries will be driven by the fundamental trajectory of these economies and their sovereign balance sheets in a post-COVID-19 world, not by vaccine availability, Seth said.  In that context, he expected Asia to grow faster than the rest of the world, led by China, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, and to some extent, India.  \u201cChina, (which has) seen a meaningful recovery post-COVID-19, certainly stands out,\u201d he said.  The debts of Chinese state-owned enterprises have come into focus following defaults in recent weeks, but Seth dismissed that as \u201cthe second chapter of deleveraging\u201d and not a system-wide risk.  He expected a modest increase in inflation as economies revive, monetary and fiscal support continued and supply chains evolve.  \u201cOn the other hand, you still have the combination of debt, demographics, technology, which have been and will remain the disinflationary forces in the world,\u201d he said, adding that would remove the risk of hyperinflation.

FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen at the BlackRock Japan headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, October 20, 2016. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  European Ombudsman Emily O\u2019Reilly launched an inquiry after the EU executive in March appointed BlackRock, through the company\u2019s Financial Markets Advisory unit (FMA), to produce a study that would inform EU plans to integrate sustainability into banking prudential rules.  EU lawmakers and NGO Change Finance questioned BlackRock\u2019s ability to provide impartial advice as its $7.8 trillion in assets under management includes large stakes in fossil fuel industries and in banks affected by the regulations.  In a decision on Wednesday, O\u2019Reilly stopped short of calling for the Commission to cancel the contract, but said it should have exercised \u201csignificantly more critical scrutiny\u201d of BlackRock\u2019s application.  \u201cQuestions should have been asked about motivation, pricing strategy and whether internal measures taken by the company to prevent conflicts of interest were really adequate,\u201d she said.  CANCELLATION CALL  Change Finance on Wednesday called for the contract to be cancelled, and published a report with NGO Corporate Europe Observatory, which said BlackRock and industry groups it is a member of have lobbied to weaken planned EU green finance rules.  A BlackRock spokesman said the Commission had already publicly stated that the technical quality of FMA\u2019s proposal underpinned the contract win.  \u201cFMA has taken a wide-ranging and inclusive approach, including academia, civil society, banks, supervisors and market practitioners, and looks forward to completing its work and delivering its final report to the Commission,\u201d he said.  The European Commission said it welcomed the Ombudsman\u2019s findings, which did not find evidence of maladministration, and would study its recommendations in detail.  \u201cIt confirms what we have said throughout this process: we applied the rules fully and fairly,\u201d a spokesman said.  BlackRock beat eight other bidders with its offer of 280,000 euros ($334,000) - roughly half the contract\u2019s estimated value. This \u201cexceptionally low financial offer\u201d could be seen as an attempt to secure influence over policies, the Ombudsman said.  BlackRock said it would ensure \u201cphysical segregation\u201d of FMA to ensure information did not flow to other parts of its business.  Brussels is undergoing a mammoth policy overhaul, revising energy, farming and finance regulations to better support EU plans to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions.  Amid increased scrutiny of existing EU rules, the Ombudsman criticised the Commission last week for granting priority status to gas projects without properly assessing their climate impact.","4":"LONDON\/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s banks are not integrating climate change and other sustainability concerns into their risk management systems as quickly as regulators expect, a study by BlackRock for the European Union showed on Monday.  FILE PHOTO: The facade of the European Commission headquarters is reflected in the windows of the EU Council building in Brussels, Belgium, April 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir  In an interim report, BlackRock said it had analysed feedback from the region\u2019s lenders and found most were only just starting to reflect environmental, social and governance (ESG) related risks in their internal processes.  A final report, which will be used by Brussels to help develop new regulations, is due by April next year.  \u201cWhile interviewed banks often state that they have initiatives in place to enhance the integration of ESG risks, the majority have not formalised an ESG risk integration strategy with clear timelines and responsibilities,\u201d it said.  \u201cWith respect to climate risk, many smaller banks stated that they have not yet started its integration into risk management,\u201d the report said.  It also found that only a minority of regulators provide guidance to banks on ESG risks or reflect it in their oversight processes, such as through climate-related stress tests.  \u201cThe majority of supervisors interviewed do not yet have any quantitative indicators in place to monitor and assess the exposure of supervised banks to ESG risks,\u201d the report said.  While some banks have begun to launch ESG-related products and make commitments to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate, the report said that in the view of many civil society organisations, efforts by lenders so far fell short.  \u201cThe Commission is committed to transparency. As promised, we published BlackRock\u2019s interim report today,\u201d a European Commission spokesman said. \u201cThis report is only a preliminary analysis of data collected so far. The final report is to be submitted to the Commission at a later stage.\u201d  The EU\u2019s appointment in April of the world\u2019s biggest asset manager to help it plan future prudential regulations has raised concerns about conflicts of interest.  While the bloc\u2019s Ombudswoman said last month that the Commission had failed to consider such conflicts properly, she did not cancel the contract.

The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 20% during the period.  The massive volatility in global markets has left asset managers dealing with the biggest challenge since the financial crisis of 2008.  BlackRock\u2019s net income fell to $806 million, or $5.15 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.05 billion, or $6.61 per share, a year earlier.  BlackRock pulled in $35 billion in new money during the quarter but a big part of that was due to risk-averse investors going to cash as markets became volatile.  Its cash-management business reeled in over $52 billion in net inflows as clients sought to de-risk.  \u201cBy asset class, index and active bond flows both missed our forecast substantially,\u201d analysts at UBS wrote in a note.  BlackRock\u2019s fixed-income products, typically viewed as safe-havens, experienced outflows of $35 billion, sapping a recent source of strength for the asset manager.  \u201cEroding investor sentiment was a headwind to asset gathering this quarter,\u201d said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.  \u201cResults were softer than usual, proving that even BlackRock isn\u2019t immune to a market downturn,\u201d Sanders said.  A 34% growth in technology services revenue, to $274 million, was a bright spot, helping the firm grow revenue to $3.71 billion, up 11% from the comparable quarter last year.  Speaking about a potential economic recovery, BlackRock\u2019s Fink told CNBC that he does not see a rapid rebound.  \u201cUntil we have adequate testing, rapid testing, it is very hard for me to see how we are going to reboot in the next 30 days,\u201d Fink said.  Many healthcare experts believe comprehensive testing as essential to the reopening of the economy, and chief executives from some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies recently told President Donald Trump more testing was needed to guarantee safety.  While Fink was confident that eventually new protocols to save lives and minimize the severity of the disease will be developed, leading to a more normalized environment, he said it may not be until August.  BlackRock is a key partner in the U.S. government\u2019s effort to support the U.S. economy.  BlackRock was recently hired by the New York Fed to manage purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and to oversee certain liquidity facilities. The firm will also oversee the secondary market corporate credit facility, which will purchase corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds.  The asset manager\u2019s shares, down about 10% for the year, rose 1.9% on Thursday.","6":"Cryptocurrency company Blockchain has tapped a former BlackRock Inc legal executive as its general counsel.

The world\u2019s biggest asset manager had argued that between Jan. 1, 2010, and Jan. 30, 2013, it should not have to pay VAT on all the service given that it included services for special investment funds, which are exempt from the tax.  Britain\u2019s tax authority disagreed issued a recovery notice to cover the period.  The First Chamber of the Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that a \u201csingle supply of management services, provided by a software platform belonging to a third-party supplier for the benefit of a fund management company, which manages both special investment funds and other funds, does not fall within the exemption provided for in that provision.\u201d  BlackRock said it respected the EU court\u2019s decision. A source at the company said it had paid and continued to pay VAT in full.  The court said that BlackRock in Britain receives services from a unit in the United States via a software platform called Aladdin that provides portfolio managers with market analysis to help make investment decisions.  These services constitute a single supply, whichever funds are being managed, it said.  Gert-Jan van Norden, a financial services partner at KPMG Netherlands, said the ruling would be a disappointment for the wider funds industry, which was hoping to copy BlackRock had the ruling gone the other way.  \u201cIt does not seem a very reasonable outcome. If you bought these services from two different entities, it would not be a problem,\u201d van Norden said.","8":"FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen at the BlackRock Japan headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, October 20, 2016.

FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security concerns, has not disclosed why it asked Pamplona to sell its 47% stake in Leesburg, Virginia-based Cofense, which helps protect email users from phishing attacks.  The development represents one of the rare, high-profile examples of CFIUS undoing a deal that had already been completed.  A major investor in Pamplona\u2019s private equity funds is Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, who was included in an \u201coligarchs\u2019 watchlist\u201d by the U.S. Treasury Department that could have resulted in sanctions against him because of his potential ties to the Kremlin.  However, unlike other Russian oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg, Fridman has not been hit by U.S. sanctions.  \u201cThe process remains ongoing and we are working diligently towards a solution,\u201d Pamplona said in a statement, declining to comment further.  Representatives for BlackRock, Cofense, Fridman and the U.S. Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Pamplona decided last October to launch an auction process to sell its stake after CFIUS approached it. Pamplona took the decision 10 months after acquiring Cofense with BlackRock, and other investors, including Adam Street Partners and Telstra Ventures, in a $400 million deal.  BlackRock, which owns a 30% stake in Cofense, is the front-runner to buy Pamplona\u2019s stake in a deal that could be reached as early as this week, the sources said. However, it is still possible that another bidder prevails or that negotiations will fall through, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.  A July 19 deadline agreed with CFIUS to reach a deal for Cofense has already lapsed. Complicating negotiations is the involvement of the U.S. government, which has formed a trustee with the company to oversee the sale, the sources said.  The protracted process is also weighing on price negotiations. Pamplona is negotiating with BlackRock a mechanism of deferred payments that will be based on the future financial performance of Cofense, which it hopes will eventually lead to a deal value higher than last year\u2019s investment, the sources said.  It is also possible, however, that the deal ends up valuing Cofense, which was previously known as Phishme, lower than last year\u2019s $400 million valuation, the sources added.  Pamplona and BlackRock did not seek CFIUS approval when they completed their deal for Cofense last year, because the review system is voluntary and the firms thought there would be no national security concerns raised, according to the sources.  The firms relied on Cofense\u2019s management team, which also has an equity stake in the company, to run the business, the sources added.  CFIUS has made cyber security and the protection of personal data its top priority in recent months. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment report cited Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the U.S. political system.  In another example this year of CFIUS seeking to untangle an acquisition, it asked Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd earlier to sell Grindr LLC, the popular gay dating app it has owned since 2016. Grindr collects personal information submitted by its users, including a person\u2019s location, messages, and in some cases even someone\u2019s HIV status.  Last year, CFIUS launched a pilot program under which filings for review for certain types of investments in some U.S. technology companies it deems to be of critical importance are no longer optional.  ALFA GROUP TIES  Fridman and his partners control Alfa Group, which includes top Russian private bank Alfa Bank, its biggest food retailer X5 Retail Group and other assets.  Fridman, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $15.9 billion, is also a principal shareholder in LetterOne, which invests in energy, telecoms, technology and other areas.  Pamplona was founded in 2005 in London by Moscow-born British dealmaker Alexander Knaster, who had previously served as CEO of Alfa Bank from 1998 until 2004. Last year, Knaster passed on day-to-day management of Pamplona to co-managing partners Martin Schwab and William Pruellage.  Knaster remains chairman of Pamplona, which manages over $12 billion in assets across a number of funds.  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is best known as a provider of mutual funds, but has also invested in private equity since 1999.

Slideshow ( 6 images )  BlackRock Inc said it will speak with weapons manufacturers and distributors \u201cto understand their response\u201d to the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in U.S. history, putting pressure on companies such as Sturm Ruger & Company Inc and American Outdoor Brands Corp.  BlackRock is the largest shareholder in both gunmakers and has more than $6 trillion in assets under management. It stopped short of saying it would divest its funds of gun companies, however.  Underlining how the Valentine\u2019s Day massacre at the Florida high school has rattled the finance industry\u2019s relationship with gunmakers, First National Bank of Omaha said separately on Thursday it would not renew a contract with the National Rifle Association (NRA) to issue a NRA-branded Visa card. The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Gun control activists have campaigned in recent days for everything from banning semi-automatic guns like the one used in the Florida shooting to asking public pension funds to sell gun stocks.  New Jersey legislators on Thursday said they plan to introduce bills to bar state pension funds from investing in gun manufacturers.  BlackRock said it cannot sell shares of a company in an index, given its fiduciary responsibilities. Instead, \u201cWe focus on engaging with the company and understanding how they are responding to society\u2019s expectations of them,\u201d BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said in an email.  Sweeney declined to give more specifics, such as what if any changes BlackRock might seek at weapons makers or at retailers that sell their products.  But with so much money under management, BlackRock often has among the largest stakes in U.S. public companies, giving it much potential influence over their policies.  It owns about 17 percent of the total shares of Sturm Ruger and has about 11 percent of American Outdoor Brands, for instance, according to U.S. regulatory filings. The shares are largely held in funds that track indexes, such as the $6 billion iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF.  BlackRock and other large index fund managers carry clout partly through their proxy votes, such as for directors and on matters brought to a vote by shareholders.  Both American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger for instance face shareholder resolutions calling for them to report on their efforts related to gun safety, according to a list of resolutions kept by the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility.  Representatives for American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares in both companies rallied on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump advocated tightening background checks for guns in response to the most recent school shooting.  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in January wrote a letter to corporate executives saying that companies need to show how they make \u201ca positive contribution to society\u201d in addition to delivering financial performance.  And he said that BlackRock would increase its own engagement with companies to improve its oversight over those companies, doubling to 64 the number of people it has dedicated to \u201cinvestment stewardship,\u201d its team that focuses on other company\u2019s governance.","16":"FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019.

The fund manager oversees $6.4 trillion in assets.  The move comes as BlackRock puts in play plans that Buckingham helped develop to grow its business in China, which has historically been restricted and small in comparison with its operations in the United States and Europe. The Asia Pacific region accounts for 7 percent of the company\u2019s assets under management.  Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink described developing its China business as one of the company\u2019s most critical priorities in the company\u2019s annual report earlier this year and added that Chinese regulations allowing foreign asset managers to eventually own 100 percent of a domestic fund management company could allow BlackRock to significantly expand its presence.

Chinese banks\u2019 wealth management subsidiaries have broad business capacity including launching publicly-offered products, so they are attractive to international asset managers, said Yin Ge, partner at Han Kun Law Offices in Shanghai.  Forming wealth management ventures would also allow foreign asset managers to leverage Chinese banks\u2019 distribution network, and \u201cwe have received increasing inquiries on this option,\u201d Ge said.  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and Temasek will own the majority of the new venture due to ownership restrictions of wealth management units by Chinese banks, the people said.  CCB, China's second-largest bank by assets after Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd 601398.SS1398.HK, set up a wholly owned wealth management unit this year and so cannot control another wealth management firm, the people said.

CCB and Temasek did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment.

Wealth management ventures offer another option for money managers to enter the country with controlling stakes.  Other \u201cleading and capable\u201d foreign asset management firms are also in talks with Chinese banks to set up wealth management joint ventures, said Wang Daqing, large bank department chief at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).  \u201cForeign investors have long required greater access to China\u2019s market, so we expanded that access for them first,\u201d a CBIRC regulator overseeing the wealth management industry told Reuters.  \u201cThey now have more options when choosing to enter the market, whether it\u2019s a private fund manager or an asset management JV,\u201d the person said.  Market reaction has nevertheless been mixed.

Mark Wiedman, a senior managing director for the world\u2019s largest asset manager, donated $2,700 to Kasich\u2019s unsuccessful campaign when the politician was seeking the Republican Party nomination in 2016, according to public records. The money was later returned.  A federal securities rule prohibits companies\u2019 executive officers from making donations to government officials who could influence the hiring of a fund manager and then providing asset management services to those governments for a fee. The ban is in effect for two years after the contribution is made.  Ohio uses BlackRock-managed funds, and its relationship with the asset manager predated the donation, BlackRock said when it asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to let it accept fees from the state, noting that exceptions to the rule have been granted before.  The SEC\u2019s ruling prevents BlackRock from facing a loss of approximately $37 million, according to the New York-based company\u2019s filing.  Wiedman is global head of iShares and index investments, a booming business within BlackRock that includes its exchange-traded funds. The iShares brand brought in nearly $35 billion of new cash into BlackRock in the first quarter. BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion overall.  BlackRock declined to comment. Last year they said in a statement that Wiedman made the contribution solely in support of the campaign, and that both BlackRock and Wiedman promptly worked to address the error after the company discovered the contribution.

His campaign has met with multiple foreign fund managers in recent months to try and calm concerns about his policies, with aides telling investors that he is not opposed to foreign investment and markets.  \u201cThey asked to speak with us and I accepted so we could get to know each other,\u201d Lopez Obrador said in a local TV interview later on Monday.  He said that he told Fink that he would uphold the rule of law and fight corruption, and not expropriate private property.  \u201cThey have lots of information ... they\u2019re intelligent,\u201d Lopez Obrador added.  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is heavily invested in Mexico and in November announced it would acquire the local asset management business of a Citigroup Inc subsidiary.

BlackRock declined to comment on the content of the encounter.

On Monday, he said a private concession could salvage the $13 billion airport project he has previously threatened to scrap.  Markets have not reacted strongly to Lopez Obrador\u2019s lead in the polls.  The peso has weakened more than 7 percent against the dollar since mid-April, but the fall is mostly in line with other emerging market currencies. Fund managers and companies warn the next few months could be more volatile, partly on concerns over Lopez Obrador\u2019s economic policy.  BlackRock, which has $6.3 trillion in assets under management, engages with governments \u201cirrespective of party affiliations,\u201d the company said in a statement. Fink was a vocal supporter of President Enrique Pena Nieto\u2019s economic reforms.  Fink was due to meet with the management of clients, business partners and three other presidential campaigns - those of second-placed Ricardo Anaya, ruling party candidate Jose Antonio Meade and independent Margarita Zavala.  The Anaya campaign confirmed they had met. A spokesman for Zavala said she was due to meet Fink on Monday afternoon.  The campaign for Meade, who was finance minister before he became the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), said the two met for about half an hour in the afternoon.  Describing the talks as \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201ccordial\u201d, Vanessa Rubio, a senior Meade campaign official, noted the two had known each other for years and that relations were \u201cvery close\u201d with BlackRock while the PRI candidate was finance minister.  According to a recent poll, less than two months before Mexicans vote, Lopez Obrador\u2019s support grew to 39 percent from 38 percent in the previous poll at the end of March, but his lead narrowed to 14 points from 18.  Fink has been consistently optimistic about the country\u2019s prospects. In 2014, he said if he was starting his career, he might try his luck in Mexico.

Several of the world\u2019s top private equity managers have quietly raised billions of dollars from Mexican pension funds, known as afores, since new rules were enacted early last year, filings to the Mexican Stock Exchange and a non-public document reviewed by Reuters showed. Regulators have authorized some managers to raise more over time.  It was not immediately clear how much in total has been raised to date in Mexico by equity managers, which include Discovery Capital Management, General Atlantic, Partners Group, Lexington Partners and HarbourVest Partners.  Their arrival in Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy comes after a regulatory change in January 2018 that allowed foreign private equity managers to tap into $179 billion worth of pension fund assets for the first time and eased some restrictions on how pension funds invest their assets.  Mexico\u2019s lower house of Congress is about to vote on a draft law by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) that would give pension funds further flexibility.  Blackstone Managing Director Matthew Pedley said in an interview that pension funds were taking advantage of the recent change in regulation to add exposure to international alternatives and diversify their portfolios.  Others consulted by Reuters on their funds in Mexico declined to be identified.  The private equity funds could help Mexican pension funds spread risk with international investments ranging from infrastructure to energy and special situations hedge funds.  Luis Sayeg, investment management director at Citibanamex, which manages one of the leading pension funds in the country, said the new funds could benefit pensions.  \u201cIt is a new opportunity to diversify the portfolio into alternative asset classes, with likely attractive returns, that do not necessarily exist in Mexico,\u201d Sayeg said.  The draft law was praised by ratings agency Fitch although some critics have expressed concern that the government wants to tap pensions to help finance pet projects.  PENSION POT  Black Rock was one of the first foreign asset managers to expand into Mexico, raising $615 million for two funds, one of which will focus on infrastructure investments, a non-public document detailing fundraising activity showed.  KKR & Co raised $683 million for two funds, including one that will invest across private equity, growth equity, real assets as well as special situations hedge funds and private credit funds, the document showed.  The new funds are all listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange.  Mexico is attractive to those looking to raise assets for long-term investment.  The country has the largest and one of the fastest-growing private pension fund systems in Latin America, almost doubling in size in seven years, a global pension fund assets analysis by consultancy Willis Towers Watson found.  Mexican pension funds\u2019 investment outside the country is still limited to 20 percent of overall assets while their investment in alternatives like private equity is also limited to 20 percent.  This gives them little room for diversification at a time when most other maturing pension fund systems are loosening investment restrictions to help address problems like funding gaps and an ageing population.  Investing in new asset classes or geographies adds layers of complexity. This often requires more sophisticated investment processes, risk management and corporate governance practices.  Tonatiuh Rodriguez, chief executive at one of Mexico\u2019s leading pension funds, Afore Azteca, said its investment committee had decided not to invest in private equity for now.  \u201cThe risk of these investments is a risk that needs to be monitored and managed in a different way,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThe returns we get from investments in the public market, which, by definition, is more regulated, are good.\u201d  Regulation stipulates that the private equity managers need to invest at least 10 percent of the capital in Mexico and commit at least 2 percent as co-investment alongside the pension funds.  Despite his risk aversion, Rodriguez said: \u201cThe fact that those are large, well-known managers, with best practices, minimizes the risks for pension funds.\u201d","37":"Jan 16 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, reported on Wednesday a 60 percent slump in quarterly profit from a year ago when the company booked a more than $800 million gain due to changes in the U.S. tax code.

CCB, China\u2019s second-largest bank by assets after Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd , set up a wholly owned wealth management unit this year and so cannot control another wealth management firm, the people said.  The state-backed bank has also launched a strategic partnership with BlackRock regarding investment, asset management, risk management and financial technologies, the internal notice showed.  CCB and Temasek did not respond to requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment.  ANOTHER OPTION  China has allowed foreign asset managers to set up private fund businesses, and next plans to scrap ownership rules on mutual fund businesses in April. Wealth management ventures offer another option for money managers to enter the country with controlling stakes.  Other \u201cleading and capable\u201d foreign asset management firms are also in talks with Chinese banks to set up wealth management joint ventures, said Wang Daqing, large bank department chief at the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC).  \u201cForeign investors have long required greater access to China\u2019s market, so we expanded that access for them first,\u201d a CBIRC regulator overseeing the wealth management industry told Reuters.  \u201cThey now have more options when choosing to enter the market, whether it\u2019s a private fund manager or an asset management JV,\u201d the person said.  Market reaction has nevertheless been mixed. For some leading Chinese banks, setting up a wealth management firm controlled by foreign investors has limited benefits.  \u201cThe asset under management and investment power of the JV won\u2019t be reflected on the book of our bank,\u201d said the head of wealth management company of a mid-sized Chinese bank. \u201cPlus it\u2019s capital consuming for us to set up another arm.\u201d  Under current regulation, a wealth management company must have no less than 1 billion yuan ($143 million) registered capital.  Efforts for such JVs risk descending into a simple political gesture if Chinese banks cannot leverage investment capabilities from the foreign investors, the person said.

In the letter, American Outdoor Brands\u2019 chairman and chief executive officer said public safety priorities should be to enforce existing laws, improve background checks and address mental health challenges.  \u201cThe solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company, our employees, our industry, our shareholders, the economies we support and, significantly, the rights of our law abiding customers, but results in no increase in public safety,\u201d stated the letter. It is signed by company Chairman Barry Monheit and CEO James Debney.  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, on Friday said it would press gun makers and weapons retailers in its portfolios to explain how they monitor firearms sales and use, and said it was studying the creation of new index-based portfolios of stocks that would exclude gun makers and retailers.

The letter from American Outdoor Brands, and an accompanying eight-page company memo, amount to one of the industry\u2019s first detailed defenses of its practices and may guide a debate over what specific changes investors might seek.  American Outdoor said its distributors face restrictions on who they may sell firearms to, and said it works closely with law enforcement agencies to trace guns used in crimes.  \u201cWe believe it is important to tell you that we respect the national debate that is currently underway regarding firearms and safety,\u201d Monheit and Debney wrote.  The company said its investors understand the risks the stock poses. \u201cWe believe that our stockholders are well aware of the products we manufacture and fully understand the risks associated with investing in a firearms manufacturer,\u201d the memo states.

The portfolio managers would eventually be transferred to mainland Europe to handle client accounts there once Britain and the European Union agreed a regulatory framework, they added.  But neither of the firms, who together employ more than 10,000 people in London, expects a chaotic exit that would force them to carry out the emergency relocation, the sources said.  A spokeswoman for BlackRock, which is the world\u2019s biggest asset manager and manages around $6.3 trillion, declined to comment on the plan but in an emailed response to Reuters said:  \u201cBlackRock maintains extensive regulatory licenses and permissions across Europe and globally to ensure it can continue to serve its clients post-Brexit.\u201d  To avert such moves, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is in talks with Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on agreements which would oversee cross-border asset activity and managers.  The U.S. makes sense as a temporary base for Goldman and BlackRock as Europe has cooperation agreements with U.S. regulators, so managers could handle European clients\u2019 accounts from there until ESMA and the FCA have theirs.  \u201cBy pulling the UK out of Europe, there\u2019s potentially a regulatory hole because the UK doesn\u2019t have a cooperation and information sharing agreement with each EU country,\u201d said Neil Robson, regulatory partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman.  An ESMA spokesman said it expects to have agreements in place before the end of March. If not, BlackRock will move around 10 equity portfolio managers to New York, one source said, adding they would later move to the euro zone.  Goldman\u2019s asset management business GSAM, with 50 managers in London, has plans to send \u201ca handful\u201d to the U.S. financial capital until a framework is in place, the second source said, adding they too would eventually relocate to the euro zone.  GSAM has picked Dublin as a centre for administrative staff when it no longer has access to the single market from London following Brexit. reut.rs\/2QUGhAr  \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation and are prepared to serve clients whatever the outcome,\u201d a GSAM spokesman said.  It is not known whether other big U.S. asset managers are drawing up similar plans and State Street, Fidelity Investments and Northern Trust all declined to comment.  \u201cEXTREME SCENARIO\u201d  Although concerns about a chaotic no-deal exit have eased since the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s draft plan in Parliament on Tuesday, the contingency plans highlight efforts by money managers to avoid major disruption before the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the EU.  For BlackRock, the strategy expands on plans announced in October in which it said \u201conly very few\u201d roles would be moved from London as a result of Brexit.  Although London-based asset managers already operate funds listed in Luxembourg and Dublin, holding more than a trillion euros of assets for customers across the bloc, they would not be able to continue operating as they do now post-Brexit.  \u201cUntil such time as the UK has that agreement in place with each of the EU 27 member states or with ESMA on behalf of all of them, UK managers would find it difficult to conduct marketing of their funds in such countries,\u201d Robson said.  Adam Jacobs-Dean, managing director, global head of markets regulation at the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) in London, said most of its member firms are working on the assumption that new agreements will be in place in time.  \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme scenario. Hopefully soon we\u2019ll see agreements being finalised and this falls away in terms of Brexit planning.\u201d (Reporting by Josephine Mason, Abhinav Ramnarayan and Helen Reid; additional reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Alexander Smith)","48":"BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, said on Thursday it will offer new investment strategies and exchange-traded funds that exclude civilian firearms producers and retailers, following through on plans it outlined last month after a Florida high school massacre.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  According to a client update sent by a company spokesman, BlackRock will offer a new line of firearm-free products to big institutional investors and pension plans that track broad market indexes like the S&P 500 and Russell 1000.  BlackRock also said it would create two new ETFs that would exclude gun makers and large gun retailers, and add similar screens to existing stock and bond ETFs that already consider social factors. The changes would bounce retailers from some current ETFs including Walmart Inc and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc.  Strong investor interest in the products in theory could weaken demand for shares of gun makers such as American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co, where BlackRock funds have large stakes, although it could take awhile for clients to move enough money to make an impact.  BlackRock\u2019s action is the latest instance of a business responding to a backlash among many Americans against firearms companies following a series of U.S. mass shootings, although the eventual impact of the company moves remains unclear.  BlackRock has about $6 trillion under management. The firm and rivals have struggled to balance social and environmental issues important to clients with their need to own stocks represented in big worldwide indexes.  BlackRock did not make executives available for interviews including CEO Larry Fink, and did not offer more details about talks it has sought with companies involved with firearms. The gunmakers have defended their safety efforts.  Other firms already offer ETFs with at least some restrictions on gun-related stocks including the Global X S&P 500 Catholic Values ETF.  Still, given the firm\u2019s size, BlackRock\u2019s new products could prove a significant step as financial firms face pressure to impose limits tighter than current laws act in the wake of the February shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead and renewed a national gun control debate.  On March 22, Citigroup Inc added restrictions on firearms sales for retail clients.  Other banks and fund managers have said they would speak to clients involved with firearms, but they have not disclosed further actions, including Bank of America and State Street Corp.  BlackRock\u2019s new gun-free strategies will track broad indexes, including the S&P 500, the Russell 1000, Russell 2000 and Russell 3000, and the MSCI World ex-US index, and could appear in company 401(k) plans.  The ETFs getting the new screens have had little exposure to firearms makers, BlackRock said, and already consider social factors in their stockpicking such as the iShares MSCI USA ESG Optimized ETF.  The new screens would bar them from owning retailers with more than $20 million in revenue from gun sales. That would include Walmart and Dick\u2019s, although both in February said they would stop selling firearms to people under 21 years old.  BlackRock acknowledged in the client note that it runs money for a diverse set of clients \u201cwho have a wide range of views on firearms.\u201d","49":"LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, has hired Carole Crozat to head up thematic research in its sustainable investment team, staff were told on Wednesday in a memo seen by Reuters.

In addition to climate reporting, companies have faced calls to suspend their dividend payments or share buybacks in order to concentrate on paying workers during the pandemic.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Rieder, who is chief investment officer of global fixed income for the world\u2019s largest fund manager, said inflation could be declining from current levels.  \u201cPeople keep waiting for the bogeyman coming in terms of inflation, and they\u2019re going to have to wait a long time,\u201d Rieder said on Wednesday. \u201cWhy not pause?\u201d  BlackRock manages $6.4 trillion in assets, with nearly a third of that in fixed income.  Over the past three weeks, Rieder has been buying longer-term bonds, particularly Treasuries coming due in 5 years, but also those due as far in the future as 30 years.  Earlier this year, Rieder had been selling long bonds, citing uncertainty around Fed policy.  Now, he says, the picture is clearer.  Markets, bracing for an economic slowdown possible by 2020, are pushing back against three years of Fed rate hikes aimed at restoring policy to normal footing a decade after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.  Strong buying pushed 30-year U.S. yields US30YT=RR to 3.12 percent on Thursday, from highs this month above 3.3. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX stock index is down 2.2 percent over the same period, including dividends.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Nov. 28 policy rates are \u201cjust below\u201d estimates of a level that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy U.S. economy.  Markets assign an overwhelming probability that there will be two hikes at most between now and the end of 2019. Rieder in September predicted the Fed would raise rates only twice or so in 2019. At the time markets priced in a better-than-even chance that the Fed would move three times or more.  Investors await a U.S. jobs report on Friday that will shed light on wage inflation.  But inflation is unlikely, Rieder said, as consumers fail to purchase big-ticket items. Housing and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, meanwhile, are reeling from rate hikes.  The Fed is also shrinking its cache of bonds bought after the financial crisis to spur lending and investment.  Partly as a result of that, global market liquidity is set to shrink compared to the prior year for the first time since the crisis, BlackRock estimates show.  Indeed, investors should expect more volatility, Rieder said.  \u201cPeople are underestimating the amount of liquidity that\u2019s being drained from the system.\u201d","53":"FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York City, NY, U.S., October 17, 2016.

The 1,470-km (910-mile) train project is designed to link tourist spots and spur development on the Yucatan Peninsula at an estimated cost of $7 billion.

FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above its building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The comments fleshed out details about how the $7 trillion asset manager would cast its shareholder votes at a time of economic uncertainty. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink laid out a more forceful approach in January after criticism from investors.  Michelle Edkins, BlackRock's BLK.N global head of investment stewardship, said in an interview on Tuesday that the pandemic is consuming corporate attention but indicated that BlackRock will not cut company directors slack as it decides whether to back their re-election.  BlackRock will continue to judge whether boards have made progress against goals BlackRock has touted for several years such as those tied to climate issues, Edkins said. This year, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re being much more direct.\u201d  Absent progress the company expects it will vote against more directors, she said. In previous years it has supported directors about 97% of the time at Russell 3000 companies, according to Proxy Insight.  Edkins also said the pandemic could help sort out which companies have kept a long-term focus and have strong human capital management and business continuity plans.  \u201cThe concept of long-term sustainability would suggest that companies that come through this crisis and do well would be exactly the kinds of companies you would look to as role models,\u201d she said.  BlackRock\u2019s comments come as investors weigh what impact the coronavirus will have on efforts to slow climate change.  Among other things, BlackRock this year will look for executive pay to correlate with long-term performance metrics such as companies\u2019 total shareholder returns over three or five years, according to a fact sheet provided by the company.  A Reuters analysis last year found a pattern of deference to managers by BlackRock and other top index fund managers, even at poor-performing companies as measured by three-year returns through the end of 2018.  BlackRock also will ask companies to give details recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and threatened to vote against non-executive directors in cases where there are not adequate disclosures.  BlackRock said it will explain more specific votes, such as why it opposed executive pay at chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O. BlackRock published seven such explanations in 2017, but just two the next year and one in 2019.  Now, said BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to enhance the quantity and quality of communications.\u201d  In another example cited by a BlackRock spokesman on Wednesday, the company said in a note on its website that it voted against the chair of the audit committee of energy provider National Fuel Gas Co.

The practice being investigated, known as cum-ex, typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each of whom was entitled to a tax rebate.  A BlackRock spokesman said the world\u2019s biggest fund manager was \u201cfully cooperating with an ongoing investigation relating to cum ex transactions in the period 2007-2011\u201d.  BlackRock\u2019s inclusion is significant because it oversees more than $6.4 trillion in assets, including company shares which it lends to banks as part of its business.  State prosecutors in Cologne declined to comment on the search of BlackRock, which came as Germany\u2019s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, urged Europe to tighten cooperation against abusive tax schemes, after Reuters and other media revealed sham trading deals that cost taxpayers billions of euros.  Numerous banks and investors are already being investigated over the sham trading.  BlackRock\u2019s chairman in Germany, Friedrich Merz, who has helped secure its influence in Europe\u2019s industrial powerhouse, took his current role in 2016 -- after the period being investigated -- and has condemned illicit dividend stripping.  Merz has taken an early lead in the race to succeed Angela Merkel as leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats and secure the chance of running for chancellor as soon as next year.  \u201cSCANDAL\u201d  Cologne prosecutors also searched offices of Unicredit\u2019s HypoVereinsbank to gather evidence in proceeding against other suspects, a source close to the matter said.  Unicredit declined to comment on the search of its German unit, which was reported earlier by Sueddeutsche Zeitung.  Earlier this week, Scholz described the stock-trading scheme as a \u201cscandal\u201d that underscored the need for better European cooperation in his strongest yet condemnation of the practice, which has hit Germany, Denmark, Austria and Belgium.  Tax authorities in Denmark say they lost $2 billion, while Germany estimates it was tricked out of more than 5 billion euros ($5.71 billion) by a similar method.  Danish politicians called for action after Reuters and other media, coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv, revealed the large-scale use of such schemes.  German prosecutors think the players in the cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit.  Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012, but the scam then hit Denmark, where authorities have subpoenaed more than 420 companies and people, freezing hundreds of millions of euros of assets around the globe.

Global Credit Opportunities\u2019 fundraising builds on BlackRock\u2019s broader push in establishing a global private credit franchise. In addition to opportunistic credit, over the last few years, BlackRock has expanded its private credit capabilities in Asian private credit, special situations, and U.S. and European middle market credit, including the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners in 2018.  BlackRock\u2019s Global Credit platform manages $100 billion in total client assets, and seeks to generate income and capital growth by targeting less liquid opportunistic, stressed and special situations investments.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The moves by BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager with more than $6 trillion under management, amount to the most detailed critical stance by a big financial firm after last month\u2019s deadly high school shooting in Florida.  \u201cAs it has for many people, the recent tragedy in Florida has driven home for BlackRock the terrible toll from gun violence in America. We believe that this event requires response and action from a wide range of entities across both the public and private sectors,\u201d BlackRock said in a note to clients posted on its website.  Were it to launch the new portfolios, the step in theory might reduce demand for industry stocks given the firm\u2019s leading stakes in companies like American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co..  Representatives for the companies have not responded to questions about shareholder pressure this week and did not immediately respond to inquiries on Friday.  The financial sector has been under pressure from clients and safety activists to re-examine relations with the weapons industry after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.  In its client note, BlackRock said its questions to gunmakers would include whether they require retailers to certify they do background checks and whether they require distributors to disclose regulatory warnings.  BlackRock also said it will ask gunmakers whether they monitor if their distributors and retailers \u201chave a high volume of their guns identified as having been used in crimes.\u201d  That could please gun-safety advocates like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has argued a small share of gun shops deserve the title of \u201cbad apples\u201d for failing to control their inventory.  For retailers, BlackRock said it is asking questions such as what strategies they use to prevent the potential misuse of guns, such as limits on bulk purchases.  BlackRock is the top shareholder in American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger and is second-largest in a third weapons producer, Vista Outdoor Inc.  The three represent just 0.01 percent of total assets, BlackRock said, which could make it easy for the company to exclude them. A spokesman declined to offer more detail about what new index-based portfolios might look like.  BlackRock\u2019s investments in the gunmakers are held through passive products. BlackRock said it cannot sell securities held in such funds, leaving it with the responsibility to reach out to companies and, where necessary, to vote against directors or management.  BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink in recent years has emphasized the firm\u2019s focus on social and governance issues, aimed at reducing portfolio risk. That stance, along with the company\u2019s size has made it a focal point of gun-safety activists.  BlackRock had previously said it would engage with weapons companies, as have other firms including State Street Corp and Bank of America, but they have not offered as much detail about their questions to the industry.  Other big fund investors have not taken a public stance on gunmakers. Spokespeople for Vanguard Group and Fidelity have declined to discuss their engagement with specific companies.  A representative for American Funds parent Capital Group said via e-mail on Friday that the firm is \u201cengaging with gun manufacturers to understand their plans to ensure the safe use of these products.\u201d  Big retailers this week put in place new restrictions, such as a decision by Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods to halt the sale of assault-style rifles and to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy firearms.","66":"FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018.

The independent chairman proposal fell with 32.7% in favor of an appointment when the next chief executive is named.

BlackRock, along with buyout firm KKR & Co, last year bought a 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines for $4 billion, and was also looking at a deal involving ADNOC\u2019s gas pipeline infrastructure, the sources said.  However, it has now decided not to bid for the assets.  \u201cBlackRock is not there anymore,\u201d said one of the sources with knowledge of the matter, adding the timing is not right for the world\u2019s largest fund manager given the global market turmoil linked to the coronavirus outbreak.  ADNOC, BlackRock and Snam declined to comment.  Global Infrastructure Partners did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources declined to be identified because the information was not public.  ADNOC hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Mizuho last year to arrange the lease of its natural gas pipeline assets, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, as it sought new partnerships in an era of lower oil prices. ADNOC, which manages almost all of the proven oil reserves in the United Arab Emirates, has embarked on a major shake-up over the past few years to cut costs, boost efficiency and monetise its assets.  Snam is looking at ADNOC natural gas pipelines alongside other infrastructure funds such as Global Infrastructure Partners, the two sources said.  There are six to seven bidders in the race, one of the sources said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big price tag, so there could be a big alliance among the various subjects interested,\u201d one of the sources said.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The world's largest fund manager has put those who make or sell America\u2019s preferred weapon of mass murder in its crosshairs. On Friday BlackRock, which oversees more than $6 trillion, outlined steps to ensure the three publicly traded arms manufacturers in which it owns stock make \"a positive contribution to society.\" It won't solve America's gun-violence epidemic, but by engaging with gunmakers and distributors rather than divesting, BlackRock provides a blueprint for how shareholders can bring about social change and safeguard their investments.  The Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and teachers at a Florida high school by a young man wielding a Smith & Wesson assault-style rifle galvanized consumers and companies like no previous gun-related tragedy \u2013 not Sandy Hook, not Las Vegas, not Orlando. The country\u2019s largest retailers, airlines, rental-car outfits and hotel chains responded by changing their policies on firearms sales or cutting their affiliations with the National Rifle Association.  But BlackRock is in a unique position, one of both clout and inflexibility. As the largest shareholder in the three publicly traded consumer-arms merchants, including Smith & Wesson parent American Outdoor Brands, it bears some complicity in providing capital to fund their operations, including the production of AR-15s. Yet because BlackRock\u2019s customers own those shares through passive funds designed to mimic indexes, such as the Russell 2000 of small-cap companies, it can\u2019t simply sell stock and walk away.  After weeks of considering its role, which Breakingviews first highlighted the day after the shooting, Chief Executive Larry Fink has come up with a plan. BlackRock will pose more than a dozen questions on guns to manufacturers and distributors. These range from asking \"What steps do you take to support and promote gun safety education at the point of sale?\" to \"What steps do you take to support the safe and responsible use of your products?\"  True, for the majority of Americans who in recent polls say they want enhanced gun-safety regulation, a strongly worded letter with some pointed questions may not sound like much. But look again at BlackRock\u2019s note. The firm says that \u201canother key aspect of investment stewardship is voting on specific proxy proposals and on the election of a company\u2019s directors.\u201d That\u2019s finance-speak for: If these companies fail to respond, we will vote to fire their directors, a class that includes chief executives, when the annual meeting comes along.  And that\u2019s not an idle threat. Last year BlackRock, along with rival index-fund manager Vanguard, used this power to force Exxon Mobil\u2019s board to report on what it was doing to combat climate change. Again, BlackRock is not curing gun violence. That\u2019s a job for policymakers. But as legislators fail to act, it\u2019s one small step in that direction.","74":"TURIN, Italy (Reuters) - A rescue plan for Italy\u2019s Carige by U.S. asset manager BlackRock would allow a fund financed by Italian lenders to take part in a cash call at the Genoa-based bank, the chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo said on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO: The Carige bank logo is seen in Rome, Italy, April 16, 2016. REUTERS\/Stefano Rellandini\/File Photo  Carlo Messina said the BlackRock proposal was consistent with a restructuring plan drafted by Carige\u2019s temporary administrators which allowed the Italian banking fund to take a stake by converting debt into equity.  Italian banks propped up Carige in November by buying a 320 million euro hybrid bond to beef up its total capital via the voluntary-contribution arm of a depositor guarantee fund.  Messina told shareholders that Intesa indirectly held 25.3 percent of that bond through the fund.  \u201cIt appears the deal proposed by BlackRock is in line with the relaunch plan drawn up by the bank\u2019s commissioners,\u201d Messina said at Intesa\u2019s annual general meeting.  The European Central Bank (ECB) appointed temporary administrators to run Carige at the start of the year after the top shareholder in Italy\u2019s 10th-largest bank in December blocked a 400 million euro cash call.  The cash call was part of an industry-financed rescue that would have seen lenders convert the 320 million euro bond.  The commissioners are now looking for a buyer to fill a capital shortfall which has swelled to 630 million euros.  However, sources have said the BlackRock plan may envisage an even bigger cash call to build up a capital buffer.  The ECB has extended until mid-May a bid deadline to give more time to BlackRock, the only known potential buyer through one of its funds specializing in restructuring.","75":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N declined to back or reject a regulatory proposal to reform the shareholder resolution process in a long-awaited letter distributed on Thursday, seeking instead a middle ground on a hotly contested, politicized issue.

Shareholder activists said their supporters filed a record number of critical comments against changes they worry would make it harder to bring attention to environmental, social and governance issues. Meanwhile, corporations supportive of the rule changes want them in order to streamline annual meetings.  Both sides had hoped that BlackRock -- with $7.4 trillion under management -- would support them before the SEC finalizes the rule in or around March, especially after BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said last month the company would focus more on climate issues.

A BlackRock spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.  Among other big passive fund managers, Vanguard Group, in its own comment supported a longer holding period for investors looking to file proposals. A State Street Corp STT.N executive said in an interview last week the firm did not have a view on the matter. Some smaller active managers have criticized the reforms.  Richard Fields, a King & Spalding LLP attorney, said that in avoiding specifics in its SEC comments, \u201cBlackRock has chosen to stay squarely on the fence.\u201d While BlackRock\u2019s clients may have a wide range of views on the proposals, \u201cone might have assumed that Fink\u2019s January letter would herald a more assertive posture,\u201d he added.

BlackRock shares were down 4 percent in trading on Tuesday morning.  Overall, the company\u2019s closely-watched earnings per share figure continue to grow, helped by lower taxes and beating analyst forecasts. But another measure, earnings before interest and taxes, fell short of forecasts.  Edward D Jones & Co LP analyst Kyle Sanders called the results \u201cdisappointing.\u201d  \"All these asset managers have just been getting clobbered the last couple of months, and today's results aren't going to alleviate any of those concerns,\" he said.

Sanders said the withdrawal of institutional money from the stock market is being interpreted as particularly concerning not just for BlackRock but for markets generally. Investors pulled $30.8 billion from BlackRock\u2019s institutional equity index accounts, which BlackRock attributed to investors cutting risk.  \u201cThat\u2019s the smart money,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s what everyone looks to, and when people see that head to the sidelines, they\u2019re going to read that as more challenges to come.\u201d  Markets grew anxious during the quarter about escalating U.S.-China trade disputes, U.S. Federal Reserve policy holding back economic growth, and a rout in emerging market currencies from Turkey to Argentina and India.  Revenue of $3.6 billion at BlackRock was nearly 2 percent short of analyst forecasts, and earnings before interest and taxes of $1.4 billion fell about 5 percent short.  BlackRock\u2019s total net flows were down $3.1 billion and \u201clong-term\u201d flows, excluding accounts where investors hold cash, were up by $10.6 billion, the lowest figure in nine quarters.  The results reflected increased investor preference for low-cost ETFs that own broad swathes of the market and make it easier to move in and out of the market. That ETF business is one in which BlackRock is, along with a very small group of competitors, dominant. The company makes most of its money by charging a percentage of the value of the assets it manages.  The company\u2019s iShares-brand ETFs took in $33.67 billion in new money, down from $52.31 billion, a year earlier. Meanwhile, revenue from technology services, a growing area of emphasis for the company, grew 18 percent year-over-year.  In an interview, Fink touted recent wins with clients, including increasing the number of ETFs available without trading commissions through Fidelity Investments as well as Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L, awarding the company a near-$40 billion slice of one of Europe's biggest investment contracts to be invested using various BlackRock index strategies.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.22 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $944 million a year earlier. On a per share basis and excluding nonrecurring items, charges that do not affect the company\u2019s book value and tax items that do not impact cash flow, BlackRock earned $7.54, compared with $5.76 a year earlier.","79":"(Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is adding bitcoin futures as an eligible investment to two funds, a company filing showed.

The funds will invest only in cash-settled bitcoin futures traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday.  A BlackRock representative declined to comment beyond the filings when contacted by Reuters.  Earlier this month, Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, hit a record high of $40,000, rallying more than 900% from a low in March and having only just breached $20,000 in mid-December.  Bitcoin tumbled 10.6% in midday U.S. trading Thursday.  Other U.S.-based asset managers will likely follow BlackRock\u2019s lead and add exposure to bitcoin in some form to their go-anywhere or macro strategies as the cryptocurrency market becomes more liquid and developed, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA.  \u201cIt\u2019s easy to see how strong the performance has been of late and look at a historical asset allocation strategy that would have included a slice of crypto and how returns would have been enhanced as a result,\u201d he said. \u201cLarge institutional investors are going to be able to tap into the futures market in a way that a retail investor could not do.\u201d  There is currently no U.S.-based exchange-traded fund that owns bitcoin, limiting the ability of most fund managers to own the cryptocurrency in their portfolios.  BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had said at the Council of Foreign Relations in December that bitcoin is seeing giant moves every day and could possibly evolve into a global market. (bit.ly\/2XXFHrB)","80":"LONDON\/BOSTON (Reuters) - Larry Fink, chief executive of the world\u2019s biggest asset manager BlackRock, warned the companies it invests in on Tuesday they will need to show a game plan for surviving in a world aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century.  FILE PHOTO: Larry Fink, Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, stands at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  In his annual letter to the management of companies across the world, Fink said they would also need to make clear how the plan is integrated into the company\u2019s long-term strategy and reviewed by the board.  To help investors prepare their portfolios for the transition to a net-zero economy, Fink flagged a number of fresh steps the asset manager would take, including, where possible, publishing scores for how its equity and bond funds are positioned to adapt to global temperature changes.  The focus on companies\u2019 net-zero strategies comes as policymakers and campaigners push asset managers to do more to hold companies to account over their climate plans, ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Scotland later this year.  With $8.7 trillion in assets under management, mainly in passive funds, BlackRock has a significant stake in most large U.S. corporations and in many in other countries, giving it much influence over their decisions.  \u201cThe world is moving to net zero, and BlackRock believes that our clients are best served by being at the forefront of that transition,\u201d Fink said.  \u201cWe are carbon neutral today in our own operations and are committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. No company can easily plan over 30 years, but we believe all companies \u2013 including BlackRock \u2013 must begin to address the transition to net zero today.\u201d  Last month BlackRock called for companies to lay out their plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, but Fink\u2019s widely-read annual letter will draw more investor attention to the priorities.  Methodologies for measuring temperature alignment are constantly evolving, based on new research and data specific to particular sectors and regions, Fink said in his letter.  The group would also look to incorporate climate considerations into its capital markets assumptions and implement a \u201cheightened-scrutiny model\u201d when deciding which assets to include in its actively managed portfolios.  Going forward, BlackRock would also publish details of the proportion of its assets under management that are aligned with net zero and plans to announce interim targets for the proportion it aimed to be net-zero aligned by 2030.  After telling clients last year that sustainability would be the company\u2019s new standard for investing, BlackRock introduced a policy that would see it sell out of some coal companies, although at the time many campaigners said the bar set by BlackRock to exit was not low enough.  Despite pressure to take a more aggressive stance, Fink\u2019s letter made no mention of introducing tougher thresholds, drawing criticism from some.  \u201cLarry Fink\u2019s new net-zero commitment could be a positive step if it were paired with concrete and immediate action to stop investing in new fossil fuels. But a year after its first, extremely weak coal commitment, BlackRock has yet to announce a more ambitious policy,\u201d said Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment campaigner at Reclaim Finance.","81":"Laurence Fink, founder and chief executive officer of BlackRock, Inc. speaks during the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York, U.S., November 13, 2017.  LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Larry Fink is flexing what green muscles he has. A year ago, the BlackRock boss used his annual letter to chief executives of companies in which the world\u2019s biggest asset manager has a stake to assert that sustainable investing was the way forward. His latest missive, published on Tuesday, develops the theme in a way that demonstrates how BlackRock is simultaneously potent and powerless.  Fink\u2019s main intervention is to require companies to show how they will reduce their carbon emissions to zero by 2050. If they all follow the $8.7 trillion asset manager\u2019s instructions, it would go a long way to solving climate change. The more interesting part of the letter, though, is what Fink intends to do with laggards.  BlackRock faces regular criticism because its funds continue to hold billions of dollars of investments in companies with coal and other carbon-heavy assets. Fink says these firms and others that drag their feet will face \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d, with the implication that BlackRock will sell out if their managements don\u2019t come up with a credible strategy. Given that New York pension funds just offloaded $4 billion of dirty assets, this threat is hardly radical.  The drawback is that dumping carbon-heavy investments doesn\u2019t help the planet if these assets end up in the hands of unlisted companies or governments that don\u2019t share the imperative to do something about climate change. That\u2019s why Fink\u2019s call for private companies and public debt issuers to also disclose their decarbonisation strategies could be significant. If this catches on, polluters will have fewer places to hide. BlackRock, which oversees over $1 trillion of actively managed debt, has some scope to force the issue.  The weak link in Fink\u2019s strategy is that 90% of BlackRock\u2019s $4.4 trillion equity portfolio is held by index-tracking passive funds which cannot sell if there are climate objections. That makes it all the more important that the group uses its clout to vote against foot-dragging executives at annual general meetings. Fink\u2019s letter underlines a pre-existing commitment to support more shareholder resolutions. But he will need to show that he is actually doing so this year. If he doesn\u2019t, BlackRock\u2019s green physique will face deserved ridicule.","82":"BOSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Five Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday asked BlackRock Inc to justify why it rarely supported shareholder resolutions tied to climate issues despite its increased focus on the environment this year.

While the data-scraping techniques BlackRock will deploy are increasingly prevalent in more mature markets, use of such technology to drive investment decisions is less popular in China.  Some Chinese hedge fund managers questioned the likely effectiveness of such a strategy.  \u201cWhether it\u2019s People\u2019s Daily articles, or satellite images, or social media postings, I don\u2019t think the data is big enough to generate profitable trading,\u201d said Huang Can, a Shenzhen-based hedge fund manager who uses machine learning in high-frequency trading.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The portfolio managers would eventually be transferred to mainland Europe to handle client accounts there once Britain and the European Union agreed a regulatory framework, they added.  But neither of the firms, who together employ more than 10,000 people in London, expects a chaotic exit that would force them to carry out the emergency relocation, the sources said.  A spokeswoman for BlackRock, which is the world\u2019s biggest asset manager and manages around $6.3 trillion, declined to comment on the plan but in an emailed response to Reuters said:  \u201cBlackRock maintains extensive regulatory licenses and permissions across Europe and globally to ensure it can continue to serve its clients post-Brexit.\u201d  To avert such moves, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is in talks with Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on agreements which would oversee cross-border asset activity and managers.  The U.S. makes sense as a temporary base for Goldman and BlackRock as Europe has cooperation agreements with U.S. regulators, so managers could handle European clients\u2019 accounts from there until ESMA and the FCA have theirs.  \u201cBy pulling the UK out of Europe, there\u2019s potentially a regulatory hole because the UK doesn\u2019t have a cooperation and information sharing agreement with each EU country,\u201d said Neil Robson, regulatory partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman.  An ESMA spokesman said it expects to have agreements in place before the end of March.

It is not known whether other big U.S. asset managers are drawing up similar plans and State Street, Fidelity Investments and Northern Trust all declined to comment.  \u201cEXTREME SCENARIO\u201d  Although concerns about a chaotic no-deal exit have eased since the defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s draft plan in Parliament on Tuesday, the contingency plans highlight efforts by money managers to avoid major disruption before the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the EU.  For BlackRock, the strategy expands on plans announced in October in which it said \u201conly very few\u201d roles would be moved from London as a result of Brexit.  Although London-based asset managers already operate funds listed in Luxembourg and Dublin, holding more than a trillion euros of assets for customers across the bloc, they would not be able to continue operating as they do now post-Brexit.  \u201cUntil such time as the UK has that agreement in place with each of the EU 27 member states or with ESMA on behalf of all of them, UK managers would find it difficult to conduct marketing of their funds in such countries,\u201d Robson said.  Adam Jacobs-Dean, managing director, global head of markets regulation at the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) in London, said most of its member firms are working on the assumption that new agreements will be in place in time.  \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme scenario.

Having helped bring stock ownership to millions of small investors, BlackRock could go one better and give those same people the power to wield their shares in company votes.  More than half of BlackRock\u2019s assets under management sit in index trackers and exchange-traded funds. The company run by Larry Fink buys and holds the shares, and bears the right to vote in shareholder meetings, though doesn\u2019t itself gain or lose when stock prices move. Its funds typically own around 5% of big U.S. companies, from iPhone maker Apple to Utah\u2019s Zions Bancorp.  BlackRock engages with thousands of companies on topics like sustainability. But sometimes its decisions are questionable. For example, BlackRock backed Chinese companies\u2019 proposals to enshrine the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s interests above those of investors in 2017. Expressing views on censorship, gun safety or diversity through its governance and voting policies can also make BlackRock a political target. Republican U.S. senators seized on the firm\u2019s climate change stance as a sign of its political leanings in 2020.  Fink\u2019s company is in part trying to channel what it hears from investors. Handing voting decisions to them directly would avoid misunderstandings. Doing so is far from simple, however, especially for products like ETFs, where BlackRock may have no direct link to the ultimate holder.  The Securities and Exchange Commission considered so-called pass-through voting in the 1970s and decided it was unworkable. But technology has advanced a long way since then. BlackRock\u2019s Aladdin software amasses data on a scale unthinkable when it was created two decades ago.

Introducing real shareholder democracy could be a worthy stretch project. Sure, asking most investors to vote on tens of thousands of director nominations and shareholder proposals is pointless. But giving them the option to do so, or to choose between BlackRock\u2019s recommended voting preferences or alternative tailored policies, could be a selling point. There are technological, logistical and regulatory barriers to overcome.

A thawing in U.S.-China trade tensions during the fourth quarter supported global equity markets, especially U.S. stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 index climbed 8.5% during the period, taking the year\u2019s surge to 29%.  The rapid rally in stocks had led some market participants to wonder if investors have turned too bullish on stocks.  A recent report by Deutsche Bank highlighted how investors, betting on a bounce in global growth, now have the greatest exposure to equities in two years. The report noted similarly extended positioning a month before a sharp reversal in February 2018.  Fears of a global slowdown have moderated through 2019 and investors have started to take on risk, Fink said.  \u201cThere is quite a bit of momentum going into 2020 in terms of investor appetite,\u201d he said.  Concerns regarding trade have probably moderated and investors are likely to be focused more on the impending U.S. presidential election, said Fink, who is often quoted for his views on the markets and corporate governance and has been listed among the world\u2019s best CEOs by Barron\u2019s.  The long-running U.S.-China trade dispute is expected to enter a new, quieter phase as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are set to sign an initial trade deal later on Wednesday.  \u201cWe still don\u2019t know exactly what that means,\u201d said Fink.  \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe trade will be as big of a headline in 2020 as it was in 2019,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. To match Special Report USA-FUNDS\/INDEX REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Companies across the world have looked to banks and asset managers to help provide emergency funding since the pandemic spurred most leading economies to lock down citizens in an effort to stop its spread, crippling many businesses.  Since the end of January, BlackRock had provided around 3 billion euros in equity and 13 billion euros in credit to new and existing investee companies, the source said, with just over half of the firms raising money after a big hit from the virus.  Of the capital deployed, around half went to companies in Britain, Europe\u2019s biggest equity market.  Among the companies to receive fresh capital were cinema owner Everyman Media EMANE.L, with BlackRock buying 3.4 million shares in April to become its second biggest investor, according to regulatory filings and Refinitiv data.  Others included SSP Group SSPG.L, where BlackRock acquired 21 million shares in March to take its stake to 12.65%.  The share prices of many companies had risen since the capital injection, to the benefit of BlackRock\u2019s clients, as liquidity fears eased, the source said.  \u201cThe positive impact of those investments in society and in local and national economies \u2013 in terms of supporting jobs, R&D, technology innovation and infrastructure rollout \u2013 is very significant,\u201d said Rachel Lord, Head of EMEA at BlackRock.  BlackRock, which managed around $6.5 trillion in assets at the end of March for both retail and institutional clients, is a major investor in most of Europe\u2019s leading stock markets, and the region\u2019s biggest money manager by assets under management.  More than 100 firms had contacted BlackRock to sound out its willingness to take part in fundraisings, while more than 100 more had received pre-emptive calls from the asset manager to let them know the terms of potential support, the source said.  As lockdowns are lifted and companies get a better sense of changes in consumer spending, a second wave of equity fundraisings could come in the fourth quarter, the source added.  While companies often raise equity over several months, the emergency nature of many fundraisings meant many firms went to their biggest investors for help and completed deals quickly.  In Britain, this was helped by a rule change in March that enabled firms to raise up to 20% of their share capital in quick-fire share sales.  While investors including Schroders and Merian flagged their willingness to support such fundraisings, others criticised their dilutive impact on earnings per share.","99":"OSLO (Reuters) - Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest investment company, bought a 197.4 megawatt(MW) wind farm in western Norway through one of its funds and will cover its construction cost, the firm and the project\u2019s previous owner Zephyr both said on Thursday.  Zephyr, a Norwegian wind farm developer and operator, will continue to manage the farm\u2019s construction, which will cost about 200 million euros ($231.76 million) and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.  The project will be built on the west coast of Norway, close to the city of Floroe and aluminum maker Alcoa will buy the entire electricity produced for a period of 15 years to power its Norwegian based production plants, they said.  The wind farm, called Guleslettene, will carry 47 turbines of 4.2 MW capacity from Vestas and will have an ability to produce enough electricity to power more than 40,000 houses, said Zephyr.  The construction cost will be funded by Blackrock\u2019s equity and a long-term loan from Dekabank.  After the transaction, the cost of which was not disclosed, Blackrock has $5 billion of renewable energy assets under management, with 170 projects within wind and solar, it said.  To date, BlackRock Renewable Power has a total invested portfolio of approximately 4.6 gigawatt (GW) of generating capacity across wind and solar projects located in Norway, Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, Ireland, France and Britain.

The world\u2019s largest asset manager, with more than $6 trillion under management, also said it is studying the creation of new index-based portfolios that would exclude gunmakers and retailers, a step that could have major implications for the industry given the firm\u2019s big stakes in companies like American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co.  \u201cAs it has for many people, the recent tragedy in Florida has driven home for BlackRock the terrible toll from gun violence in America. We believe that this event requires response and action from a wide range of entities across both the public and private sectors,\u201d BlackRock said in a note to clients.  BlackRock\u2019s comments are among the most detailed response yet from any part of the financial sector, which has been under pressure from clients and safety activists to re-examine relations with the weapons industry after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.  BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink in recent years has emphasized the firm\u2019s focus on social and governance issues, which along with the company\u2019s size has made it a focal point of gun-safety activists.  BlackRock had previously said it would engage with weapons companies, as have other financial firms, including State Street Corp and Bank of America. Other firms have cut marketing ties with the National Rifle Association, including First National Bank of Omaha, which will not renew a contract to issue an NRA-branded Visa card.  Representatives for American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger have not responded to questions about the pressure from shareholders and other firms. Big retailers this week have put in place new restrictions, such as a decision by Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods to halt the sale of assault-style rifles and to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy firearms.  In its client note BlackRock said its questions to gunmakers would include whether they require retailers to certify they do background checks and whether they require distributors to disclose regulatory warnings.  For retailers, BlackRock said it is asking questions such as what strategies they use to prevent the misuse of guns, such as limits on bulk purchases.

About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) has been wiped off the German drugmaker\u2019s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found Bayer liable because Monsanto, which it bought for $63 billion last year, had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup.  Bayer suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month and more than 11,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages.  BlackRock, which latest filings show owns 7.2 percent of Bayer\u2019s voting rights, plans to either abstain from or vote against ratifying the management board\u2019s actions during the year under review, the sources said.  The largely symbolic vote of confidence \u201cwill send a message to the board\u201d that BlackRock is not happy with the way Bayer\u2019s management handled the Monsanto deal, one of the sources said.  A vote to ratify the board\u2019s actions features prominently at every German AGM. It has no bearing on management\u2019s liability, but is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment.

In his annual letter to CEOs posted on the company\u2019s website on Tuesday, Fink forecast a \u201cfundamental reshaping of finance\u201d and said companies must act or face anger from investors over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth.  Fink also said BlackRock would \u201cbe increasingly disposed\u201d to cast critical proxy votes tied to sustainability, and said in a separate letter to clients that the firm will by mid-2020 sell off from its actively managed client portfolios stakes in companies that derive more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal production.  Climate activists hailed Fink\u2019s revamped stances and said they would put pressure on rivals, though some cautioned the New York-based asset manager must still back up its new rhetoric.  \u201cAs the biggest financial institution in the world, BlackRock\u2019s announcement today is a major step in the right direction and a testament to the power of public pressure calling for climate action,\u201d said Ben Cushing of the U.S.-based environmental group Sierra Club, in an emailed statement.  A shift in global investing trends has sent trillions of dollars into passive funds run by BlackRock and rivals Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, STT.N bringing all three powerful new leverage on top corporations.  A Vanguard spokeswoman said the firm aims to address climate change \u201cwhile adhering to our obligations to deliver long-term value to our fund holders.\u201d State Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  All three companies count clients with a wide range of political views and tried to represent their actions in terms of investment strategy rather than politics.  Montana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas, a Republican and legislative liaison with the Montana Board of Investments, for which BlackRock manages assets, said he supports the use of many fuel sources including coal and that BlackRock should be wary of calls to move away from fossil fuels.

OUT FROM BEHIND THE SCENES  A Reuters analysis in October found the top index fund managers rarely challenge company management and have largely opposed climate change proposals. In 2018 and 2019 BlackRock and Vanguard only backed around 10% of climate-related shareholder resolutions.  Historically BlackRock has said it lobbies corporate executives behind the scenes, an approach that critics said undercuts other reform efforts.  At Exxon Mobil's XOM.N annual meeting on May 29, for instance, BlackRock backed all but one of 10 directors up for election and opposed all but one of seven shareholder proposals, disclosures show.  Fink on Tuesday said BlackRock would disclose its proxy votes quarterly and give more explanation about high-profile decisions.  In an interview, Robert Jackson, a member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said he was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the step as a way to create more accountability for the votes.  Investors have begun to put their money into more climate-friendly funds, albeit the overall size of the action is still small. New deposits into sustainable funds grew to $20 billion in 2019, according to data from Morningstar, nearly four times the previous year\u2019s record.  BlackRock has promised more focus on climate issues in the past but disappointed activists. The company did not make Fink or other executives available to comment.  In an interview with CNBC Fink said, \u201cMore and more clients are looking for a more sustainable portfolio\u201d and reiterated that companies should make more disclosures like those promoted by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.  BlackRock did not give specific details on which companies it might divest or the size of those positions, and Fink wrote BlackRock will \u201ccontinue to hold exposure to the hydrocarbon economy.\u201d Historically even top U.S. coal producers make up just a small fraction of BlackRock\u2019s active fund holdings.  For instance as of May 31 the $861 million BlackRock Advantage Small Cap Core Fund BDSAX.O owned 29,965 shares of Arch Coal worth $2.64 million.  Banks also have faced pressure to trim fossil fuel financing. Last week a group of institutional investors in Barclays BARC.L filed a resolution calling for it to stop financing firms not aligned with the Paris climate agreement.  Seb Beloe, partner at sustainability-focused WHEB Asset Management in London, said BlackRock\u2019s new stand will be helpful in pressing companies to think how they might operate under the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming.  \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we need companies to think hard about, in terms of how to contribute to the rapid deployment of solutions and to make their assets more resilient,\u201d he said.","107":"LONDON (Reuters) - Italy\u2019s election outcome could lead to pressure on Italian and other southern euro zone bonds but should not be a \u201csustained negative\u201d for the euro or regional stock markets, asset manager BlackRock said on Monday.  Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at the world\u2019s largest asset manager, noted that Italy\u2019s strengthening economy, with real GDP growth of 1.5 percent likely in 2018-2019, should cushion some of the hit from politics.  Sunday\u2019s election delivered a hung parliament in Italy with a strong showing by euroskeptic, anti-immigrant parties.  Another positive was Germany\u2019s progress on the weekend toward forming a coalition government, Turnill added.  \u201cWe see scope for pressure on Italian and peripheral euro zone government bonds but don\u2019t see this as a sustained negative for the euro or regional equities,\u201d Turnill told clients.

Criticism of index investing is not new, but BlackRock\u2019s highlighting a particular thread of concern as a primary risk factor in this way is. The company manages $1.8 trillion in iShares-brand exchange-traded funds (ETFs), most of which track an index, and another $2.4 trillion in non-ETF index funds.  BlackRock zeroed in on one argument about index investing that says index funds\u2019 \u201ccommon ownership\u201d of several companies in a single market segment reduces competition between those companies, imposing a cost on society that may need to be regulated. The asset management company and other researchers have disputed academic studies coming to that conclusion.

Fink was awarded $24.3 million in compensation last year, compared with $26.5 million in 2018, based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.  Going by a set of calculations BlackRock prefers, Fink\u2019s total compensation for the year rose 5% to $25.25 million. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year.  Fink is often quoted for his views on the markets and corporate governance and has been listed among the world\u2019s best CEOs by the newspaper Barron\u2019s.  BlackRock's stock rose 28% in price during 2019, its best performance since 2017, as global financial markets rebounded from a sharp selloff at the end of 2018. That compares with a 23.5% rise for a Thomson Reuters index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock's industry rivals in the United States .TRXFLDUSPINVM.

Fink\u2019s pay is among the highest in investment management globally as well as among U.S. financial firms, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the past the company\u2019s pay to executive officers has drawn criticism from proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co LLC.  The company\u2019s president, Rob Kapito, was paid $19.3 million in 2019, a decrease of 7.6% from the prior year, according to the calculations based on regulatory guidelines.

A BlackRock spokesman said the world\u2019s biggest fund manager was \u201cfully cooperating with an ongoing investigation relating to cum ex transactions in the period 2007-2011\u201d.  BlackRock\u2019s inclusion is significant because it oversees more than $6.4 trillion in assets, including company shares which it lends to banks as part of its business.  State prosecutors in Cologne declined to comment on the search of BlackRock, which came as Germany\u2019s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, urged Europe to tighten cooperation against abusive tax schemes, after Reuters and other media revealed sham trading deals that cost taxpayers billions of euros.  Numerous banks and investors are already being investigated over the sham trading.  BlackRock\u2019s chairman in Germany, Friedrich Merz, who has helped secure its influence in Europe\u2019s industrial powerhouse, took his current role in 2016 -- after the period being investigated -- and has condemned illicit dividend stripping.  Merz has taken an early lead in the race to succeed Angela Merkel as leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats and secure the chance of running for chancellor as soon as next year.  \u201cSCANDAL\u201d  Cologne prosecutors also searched offices of Unicredit's CRDI.MI HypoVereinsbank to gather evidence in proceeding against other suspects, a source close to the matter said.  Unicredit declined to comment on the search of its German unit, which was reported earlier by Sueddeutsche Zeitung.  Earlier this week, Scholz described the stock-trading scheme as a \u201cscandal\u201d that underscored the need for better European cooperation in his strongest yet condemnation of the practice, which has hit Germany, Denmark, Austria and Belgium.  Tax authorities in Denmark say they lost $2 billion, while Germany estimates it was tricked out of more than 5 billion euros ($5.71 billion) by a similar method.  Danish politicians called for action after Reuters and other media, coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv, revealed the large-scale use of such schemes.  German prosecutors think the players in the cum-ex scheme misled the state into thinking a stock had multiple owners who were each owed a dividend and a tax credit.  Germany changed and clarified the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012, but the scam then hit Denmark, where authorities have subpoenaed more than 420 companies and people, freezing hundreds of millions of euros of assets around the globe.","111":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of Republican lawmakers from energy-producing states on Friday called on President Donald Trump to prevent banks from halting loans and investments with companies that produce oil and other fossil fuels while they have access to federal assistance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \u201cWall Street\u2019s big banks ... should not be able to reap the benefits of participating in federally guaranteed loan programs laid out in the CARES Act, such as the Paycheck Protection Program or the trillion dollar Federal Reserve facility lending programs, while simultaneously targeting American energy companies and workers,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Trump.  Democratic lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who want an economic recovery featuring investments in conservation and alternative energy to fight climate change, have been calling on Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to bar oil and gas companies from accessing loans through the Main Street facility.  Many energy companies have been struggling to stave off bankruptcy due to a meltdown in global crude prices after governments around the world issued stay-at-home orders that obliterated demand for motor and jet fuel.  For years, environmental activists have pressured banks and financial firms to drop support of fossil fuel companies.  The Republican lawmakers, led by Senators Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, and Representatives Don Young of Alaska and Liz Cheney of Wyoming, accused some major U.S. financial institutions of halting fossil fuel investments to \u201cplacate the environmental fringe.\u201d They specifically cited BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, which has been given a central role in the COVID-19 corporate recovery as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  BlackRock announced in January it was divesting from coal burned in power plants. Its global head of sustainable investing, Brian Deese, was a White House climate official under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  \u201cConsidering BlackRock\u2019s central role as a Federal Reserve fiduciary for the distribution of CARES Act credit facilities, its hostility towards the American energy sector is unacceptable and should be closely scrutinized,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.  The lawmakers urged Trump to use \u201cevery administrative and regulatory tool\u201d to prevent those institutions from participating in federal lending programs while \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against investments in parts of the energy sector, but did not specify what measures could be taken.  A spokesman for BlackRock said the company will execute its mandate as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u201cat the sole discretion of the bank, and in accordance with their detailed investment guidelines, in order to provide broad support to credit markets and achieve the government\u2019s objective of supporting access to credit for U.S. employers and supporting the American economy.\u201d  Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a recent interview that he and Mnuchin planned to work with U.S. regulators and the banking industry to ensure financial institutions do not discriminate against oil drillers when choosing whom to provide credit to.","112":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management LLC added Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Twitter Inc, but trimmed stakes in Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc in the quarter through June, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.

A number of prominent fund managers sharply cut their holdings in Apple only weeks before it became the first publicly-traded U.S. company to be worth more than $1 trillion.  Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital slashed its stake by 77 percent, while Philippe Laffont\u2019s Coatue Management unloaded 95 percent. Advisory firm Diamond Hill Capital Management cut its stake by 27 percent.  Other big holders, including Sanders Capital and Adage Capital Partners, only trimmed small amounts in the second quarter.  Soros also rejigged his energy holdings, raising stakes in Devon Energy Corp and Kinder Morgan Inc, while dissolving his stake in the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF and cutting exposure to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Williams Companies Inc.  Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers\u2019 stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of learning what the managers are selling and buying.  But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.  The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm\u2019s equities holdings.","113":"March 23 (Reuters) - Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, on Monday committed $50 million to relief efforts as the coronavirus pandemic leads to job losses and unexpected medical costs.  \u201cWe are committing $50 million to relief efforts, helping meet immediate needs of those most affected right now and by addressing the financial hardship and social dislocation that this pandemic will bring,\u201d the company said.

The prosecutors are investigating a fraud known as cum-ex that typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate.  On Tuesday, they searched the Munich offices of BlackRock, prompting the globe\u2019s biggest investor to say that it was fully cooperating with the probe of cum-ex transactions between 2007-2011.  The search has prompted wide national interest in Germany because Friedrich Merz, a potential successor to Merkel, has held the post of BlackRock\u2019s chairman in Germany since 2016.  Merz, who was not there at the time of the trades that are being investigated, said he had ordered the fund\u2019s management board to investigate all incidents involving such cum-ex deals.  \u201cEverything will be investigated and we will actively participate in that,\u201d he said at a political event in the northwestern German city of Duesseldorf on Tuesday.

Merz has taken an early lead in the race to succeed Merkel as leader of Germany\u2019s Christian Democrats and secure the chance of running for chancellor, possibly as soon as next year.  Gerhard Schick, a Greens party member of Germany\u2019s parliament, said the case raised the question as to whether Merz had responded promptly enough.","115":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  HONG KONG (Reuters) - BlackRock has sold almost all its stake in China Telecom, a company subject to a new ban on U.S. investment, a stock market filing on Friday showed.

The world\u2019s biggest asset manager sold 818 million shares in China Telecom, one of 44 sanctioned companies, at an average of HK$1.92 each on Tuesday, a Hong Kong exchange filing showed, 12% below Tuesday\u2019s closing price.  The filing gave no reason for the HK$1.6 billion ($206 million) sale, which reduced BlackRock\u2019s stake in China Telecom from 6.1% to 0.2%, and BlackRock had no immediate comment.  BlackRock said on Monday its index funds had adjusted holdings to reflect moves by MSCI Inc, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indicies to cut China Telecom and other firms affected by the sanctions from their benchmarks.  The Trump administration expanded the investment ban, to an extra nine firms on Wednesday, and investors expect more liquidations to come from big U.S. funds before the rules take effect in November 2021.

BlackRock\u2019s iShares-branded ETFs took in $17.8 billion during the quarter, down from $34.6 billion in the first quarter. The company also cut fees on some ETFs to increase its market share.  \u201cBroadly, we\u2019ve seen a weakness in flows this past quarter driven by investor de-risking and less investor risk appetite in the marketplace,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys.  Cyprys said the company\u2019s growth is \u201cgoing to have ups and downs, and this is one of the downs,\u201d but added that investors \u201chave an opportunity to buy in on the weakness.\u201d  BlackRock stock traded down as much as 1.8 percent before rebounding to trade down 0.2 percent.  Yet even with the slower-than-usual growth in demand for the funds, which are relatively cheap to manage as they gain in size, revenue rose more than 10 percent to $2.9 billion.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.07 billion in the second quarter, up more than 25 percent, as weaker, yet still positive, demand for index funds helped plump up margins and the company settled into a lower tax rate.  Operating income, a measure of profits after some expenses including employee pay, rose 16.4 percent to $1.4 billion in the quarter from the same period in 2017.  The company\u2019s effective tax rate was 24 percent, down from more than 30 percent in the year-ago period, before a major U.S. tax cut was passed.  \u201cThe most important thing we\u2019ve been proving is the strength of our diversified business model,\u201d which includes not just funds but also, increasingly, technology services, said Chief Executive Larry Fink in an interview.  BlackRock earned $6.62 per share, compared with $5.20 a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $6.66 per share, while analysts expected $6.55, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Strong earnings growth, particularly in the United States, was clouded during the quarter by rising tensions between America and its trading partners. Fink warned that it is unclear \u201cwhere we\u2019re going with trade,\u201d adding that \u201cyou saw a lot of international investors pull out of the market because they\u2019re questioning what does this all mean in regard to trade and globalization.\u201d  Fink also told Bloomberg Television that markets could fall 10 to 15 percent if tariff wars become full-blown.  BlackRock ended the quarter with $6.29 trillion in assets under management, down from $6.32 trillion in the preceding quarter.  Investors pulled $22 billion from the company\u2019s stock funds and deposited $26 billion into its fixed-income products, according to the earnings release. Overall flows, excluding funds where investors park cash temporarily, were $14.50 billion, the lowest since the second quarter of 2016.","119":"FILE PHOTO: Blackrock's Richard Prager rings the opening bell above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S. May 31, 2019.

BlackRock, with oversight of more than $6.4 trillion in assets, is widely followed by investors and economists for its influence at many of the world\u2019s public companies.  Plans to open an office in Saudi Arabia were announced in 2017 as Riyadh began courting investors to support its push to diversify the economy away from oil.  Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered by Saudi agents inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.

BlackRock-managed funds voted for a measure requiring the board chairman be an independent director, according to a BlackRock filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  More than 86 million shares voted against the proposal at a shareholder meeting in June, while fewer than 17 million voted in favor, according to Tesla.  Musk serves both as Tesla\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer. Some corporate-governance activists call for the role to be split between two people to improve oversight, and the new filing revealed at least one major investor backed such changes at Tesla. BlackRock\u2019s role in backing the proposal was not previously reported.  Musk has been under public pressure over the company\u2019s spending and after tweeting on Aug. 7 that he planned to take the company private, only to abandon the idea by Aug. 24.

BlackRock\u2019s filings also showed it voted this year in favor of shareholder proposals at Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc to give each shareholder an equal vote on governance matters.  Some companies are structured in a way that effectively gives some shareholders more power than others, regardless of the number of shares they hold.  BlackRock withheld votes or voted against nearly all management recommendations at Netflix Inc, including an advisory vote on executive pay.","121":"LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N, the world's biggest asset manager, has appointed two executives to oversee its operations in continental Europe as part of efforts to expand in the region, a memo to staff on Wednesday seen by Reuters showed.

With \u201can ambitious strategy for growth\u201d, Lord said BlackRock needed dedicated leadership in continental Europe and so had appointed Stephane Lapiquonne and Christian Hyldahl to jointly lead the company\u2019s efforts.  The two would work with the firm\u2019s country managers and regional leadership to develop a continental European platform for BlackRock, she said.  \u201cThe objective is to help individual countries deliver BlackRock\u2019s scale and collective voice to our people, clients and wider stakeholders,\u201d Lord said.  Paris-based Lapiquonne joined the firm in 2010 to build the company\u2019s Financial Markets Advisory capability in EMEA. Copenhagen-based Hyldahl joined last year and was previously chief executive of Danish pension fund ATP and Nordea Asset Management.  Both will report to Lord and will represent the region on the company\u2019s European Executive Committee. Hyldahl and Lapiquonne will remain country managers for the Nordics and for France, Belgium and Luxembourg, respectively.  BlackRock has more than 2,000 employees in more than 15 offices across continental Europe, compared with more than 3,000 in Britain, which it has previously said will remain its European base of operations after Brexit.  Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union has prompted many large asset managers with continental European clients to set up or expand their presence there, to ensure a continued right to trade.  As part of its expansion in the region, BlackRock last year bought French data firm eFront for $1.3 billion. It also announced plans to build up its so-called \u201calternatives\u201d investing team in Paris and moved some staff to the Netherlands.  BlackRock has ridden a wave of increased demand from clients to use cheaper index-tracking funds, a trend that is expected to continue and which has also benefitted Amundi AMUN.PA, the region's largest asset manager by total assets and which is majority owned by French bank Credit Agricole CAGR.PA.","122":"The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016.

FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. To match Special Report USA-FUNDS\/INDEX REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Both studies - done by climate-focused shareholder organizations - found BlackRock BLK.N continued to offer little backing to resolutions asking companies for steps like setting emissions targets or lobbying reports.  The findings prompted the organizations to complain that BlackRock hasn\u2019t backed up its vows to prioritize climate matters earlier this year. The studies found BlackRock supported such resolutions around 10% of the time this year, about the same as in 2019.  Other fund firms supported the climate-related resolutions about half the time or more, in keeping with their increased popularity, the studies of dozens of votes said.  Proxy votes have drawn attention in recent years as a point of leverage for investors looking for companies to take more aggressive action on the environment or social issues. But they also can put fund firms in the awkward position of demanding changes at the same companies whose retirement assets they seek to manage.  One more frequent backer of the resolutions was the asset-management arm of JPMorgan JPM.N which supported them roughly half the time this year according to the separate but similar studies by activist investment firm Boston Trust Walden and by Majority Action, a liberal-leaning shareholder advocacy group.  That was up from JPMorgan\u2019s support rate of just 4% for climate resolutions in 2019 according to Walden.  \u201cI see an asset-management industry that overall is waking up to the substantial level of risk of climate change,\u201d said Eli Kasargod-Staub, Majority Action executive director. He and Walden senior vice-president Tim Smith both said BlackRock\u2019s climate voting record did not match its rhetoric.  \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see their votes remain at this substandard level,\u201d said Smith.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  A BlackRock spokesperson said it has spoken more frequently this year with portfolio companies on environmental matters and other issues, voted more frequently against corporate directors and given more details about its stewardship activities. BlackRock also said not all proposals are worth supporting, and that \u201cnot all shareholder proposals are created equal.\u201d  It had previously given statistics showing it took a tougher line in some proxy votes this year, especially at energy companies.  A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on its proxy votes. In February the company had outlined new initiatives for sustainable investing including more use of data.  The 162 environmental and social proposals voted at shareholder meetings this year at S&P 1500 companies won average support of 27.7% and 18 passed, said proxy solicitor Georgeson, up from 2017 when 211 of them won 20.3% average support and 5 passed.  Business groups - including one led by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon - have supported making the proposals harder to file or resubmit and last November the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 along partisan lines for such changes. A final vote could come Wednesday.  BlackRock, known for its index funds, has taken a neutral stand on the rule changes, unlike some active management firms that oppose them. JPMorgan has not filed comments on the matter.  A BATTLE AT DELTA  Whatever the outcome, BlackRock and some rivals have begun to provide more details about individual votes.  For instance at Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N BlackRock voted \"against\" a shareholder resolution calling for a company report on how its lobbying activities match goals to limit rises in global temperatures.  Explaining the vote on its website, BlackRock said it expects Delta will provide more disclosures in any case and noted it is working to reduce its emissions via newer planes and the use of biofuels.  The resolution drew support from 46% of shares cast, including votes from JPMorgan, securities filings show. It would have passed with the support of BlackRock, a 5% holder at the time.","124":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, on Tuesday said it would continue to reduce fees on a small group of its products with the highest growth potential, days after cutting fees on 11 exchange-traded funds.  FILE PHOTO: A woman walks next to a BlackRock sign pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York, October 11, 2015. REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz  Mark Wiedman, BlackRock\u2019s global head of iShares and index investments, said at the company\u2019s Investor Day that BlackRock is focused on areas where it can win or develop new markets and whose customers are most sensitive to price. The company\u2019s ETF brand is called iShares.  The fee cuts on Friday most deeply affected products in the bond market, including an emerging-market bond exchange-traded fund and another one invested in municipal bonds. The company is locked in a tight battle for assets with, among others, the Vanguard Group, which is known for offering low-cost index funds. Together the companies collected more than 60 percent of the record $655 billion that moved into ETFs globally in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc.  BlackRock hopes to convert not just investors who are using index funds to replace stock and credit-picking managers but also institutional clients who might invest in individual bonds but prefer the convenience of a single trade.  \u201cWe see these as fast-growth areas and we want to capture that growth,\u201d said Wiedman.  From 2012 to 2017, the average effective rate BlackRock charges across its assets dropped from $22.10 a year for every $10,000 under management to $19.10, according to BlackRock Chief Financial Officer Gary Shedlin.  But Shedlin said most of that decline came from changing product demand by clients, market movement and the effect of foreign-exchange conversion, areas the company does not control. All of BlackRock\u2019s price cuts in that time period were offset by growth, he said.  They continue to spend roughly $1 billion a year on technology and will continue to aggressively put seed money into new products, which Shedlin described as one of the company\u2019s best uses of cash.  Over time, investments in technology will result in more general and administrative expenses relative to revenue, but will likely be offset by relative declines in spending on compensation, boosting profit margins.  And the company\u2019s dividends and buybacks continue as well, with the quarterly dividend rising nearly 9 percent to $3.13 a share, he said, pending approval by BlackRock\u2019s board of directors and subject to market conditions.  The company reviewed its spending plans after a U.S. tax law passed last year, which sliced corporate and individual income rates.","125":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N, George Soros and big sovereign wealth funds are among investors expressing interest in buying stakes in the initial public offering of Deutsche Bank's DBKGn.DE asset management arm, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

DWS is seeking anchor investors, the person said, while it also wants to ensure the liquidity for the free floating shares.  Deutsche Bank\u2019s largest investors, the Qatari royal family and the Chinese conglomerate HNA [HNAIRC.UL], are not expected to invest in the IPO, said the person, who disclosed the potential investor base on condition of anonymity because the IPO process is ongoing.  Spokesmen for Qatar and HNA declined to comment. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment, while the potential DWS investors declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.  The DWS listing will mark the most tangible milestone yet in Chief Executive Officer John Cryan\u2019s struggle to restructure the flagship German bank.  Deutsche said in March 2017 it would list a stake in DWS as part of a broader overhaul to help the bank move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals.  Some investors have raised questions about the timing of the IPO as the economic growth cycle turns and financial markets become more volatile.  \u201cOne of the key investor concerns regarding DWS is the question whether the asset management industry in general is at the top of the cycle,\u201d said a second person close to the IPO.  The asset management industry is facing pressure on fees and rising regulatory costs, which show no signs of abating and which could limit profits for the sector.  \u201cAsset management is under pressure from regulators, investors and the public to perform better and charge less,\u201d said Tom Brown, Global Head of Asset Management at consultants KPMG. \u201cFirms need scale or to specialize to stay in the game.\u201d  These potential constraints come on top of issues specific to Deutsche Bank.  \u201cWill DWS be able to cut costs as harshly as needed?\u201d the second person close to the IPO said. \u201cWill it be able to do an interesting large M&A deal given the fact that DB wants to retain control?\u201d  Another concern among investors is that Deutsche Bank could dilute the price of DWS shares by selling down its stake if the bank needs to raise capital.  The IPO would help Deutsche to bolster its balance sheet and quell shareholder unrest over the pace of its turnaround after three consecutive years of losses. It could also possibly open the way to dividend payouts.  A price range for the shares is expected to be announced as soon as Sunday, followed by the publication of an investor prospectus on Monday.  The IPO would likely take place in the week of March 19, sources have said, adding it had been brought forward hoping to lock in stock market valuations ahead of any correction.  DWS head Nicolas Moreau, formerly with the French insurer Axa AXAF.PA, has been on the road for four weeks over the past few months drumming up investor interest and plans to meet with investors again next week.","126":"NEW YORK, May 7 (Reuters) - Four Mexican presidential campaigns are meeting on Monday with BlackRock Inc chief executive Larry Fink, the world\u2019s largest asset manager confirmed, ahead of a July 1 election that is being closely watched by financial markets.

Normally, that money is locked up for years.

BlackRock is known for more widely offered funds that invest in publicly traded stocks and bonds.  Yet Chief Executive Larry Fink has made it a priority to compete in private markets, too, against Goldman Sachs and other rivals better known for those sorts of investments, such as Blackstone Group LP. BlackRock was spun off from Blackstone more than two decades ago.

FILE PHOTO: The seal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hangs on the wall at SEC headquarters in Washington, U.S., June 24, 2011. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) five-member commission voted 5-0 to propose a rule to allow companies that sell ETFs to launch plain vanilla versions without first seeking approval from the regulator. The SEC said it hopes the rule change will boost competition and innovation by lowering the barriers to entry.  The rule change, subject to feedback from the industry, would apply to open-ended ETFs, a type of mutual fund that does not have restrictions on the amount of shares it can issue, which covers the vast majority of ETFs today.  Dozens of ETF companies currently operate under different requirements in a complex system they say has inadvertently allowed some firms to gain a competitive advantage.  ETF issuers must get SEC permission, known as exemptive relief, before selling funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Democratic Commissioner Rob Jackson said he reluctantly voted for the rule change due to potential risk factors to investors, while Commissioner Kara Stein, also a Democrat, emphasized the enforcement of existing oversight controls.  \u201cThe rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount - each as of the prior business day,\u201d said Stein.  The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group that advocates for regulated funds, including ETFs, applauded the SEC proposal.  \u201cInvestors - and the asset managers who serve them - deserve a more uniform ETF regulatory framework. The time is right to codify these exemptive orders into a single rule,\u201d the group said in a statement.  Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA Research, said the proposed rule change could \u201csupport new ETF launches, particularly tied to long-term thematic approaches, from small independent asset managers.\u201d  BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group accounted for more than 60 percent of the record inflows of $655 billion that entered ETFs globally in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc.  Melissa Garville, a BlackRock spokeswoman, said: \u201cETFs are driving investor progress by helping tens of millions of people generate wealth and meet retirement goals. That is why BlackRock has long supported regulation of the ETF market that enhances transparency, market quality and choice for investors. We look forward to reviewing the proposal in more detail and commenting in due course.\u201d","137":"Jan 20 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is adding bitcoin futures as an eligible investment to two funds, a company filing showed, in a move to bring the world of cryptocurrency to its clients.

The EU\u2019s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, known as MiFID II, which took effect in January, states investment research must be priced separately from other broker services to ensure transparency and better value for money.  With the rules making clear how much investors are being charged for research, many asset managers are scrutinising more than ever what they\u2019re paying for and using less.  \u201cIt\u2019s really clear the amount being paid is 30-50 percent lower and that\u2019s staying there,\u201d Nigel Bolton, chief investment officer of international equities at BlackRock, told Reuters on the sidelines of a briefing on Tuesday.  \u201cA lot of people are waiting for it to get better, but I don\u2019t think it will. Budgets are down and aren\u2019t going to come back up.\u201d  The sweeping changes in how asset managers consume research will underscore concerns about pain being felt across European equity research providers almost one year after MiFID II came into force.  Stockbrokers have been the main losers from the new legislation, Bolton said, echoing a sentiment across the financial sector.  \u201cWe basically think twice before having a meeting (with a stockbroker), and we share meetings,\u201d Bolton said.  The cuts are likely to drive consolidation as small- and medium-sized brokerages struggle with the loss of research income and falling commission fees amid growing competition.  His comments come after reports last month that Australia\u2019s Macquarie was in talks to buy boutique London-based broker, Liberum, in a bid to strengthen its UK equities business as MiFID II forces it to pay for research.  German private bank Berenberg has laid off staff in its equities business amid pressure from MiFID II, the Financial Times reported last month.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the mass cull I\u2019d expected. We\u2019ll see more mergers (in 2019),\u201d Bolton told a briefing earlier on Tuesday.

The comments fleshed out details about how the $7 trillion asset manager would cast its shareholder votes at a time of economic uncertainty. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink laid out a more forceful approach in January after criticism from investors.  Michelle Edkins, BlackRock\u2019s global head of investment stewardship, said in an interview on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic is consuming corporate attention but indicated that BlackRock will not cut company directors slack as it decides whether to back their re-election.  BlackRock will continue to judge whether boards have made progress against goals BlackRock has touted for several years such as those tied to climate issues, Edkins said. This year, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re being much more direct.\u201d  Absent progress the company expects it will vote against more directors, she said. In previous years it has supported directors about 97% of the time at Russell 3000 companies, according to Proxy Insight.  Edkins also said the pandemic could help sort out which companies have kept a long-term focus and have strong human capital management and business continuity plans.  \u201cThe concept of long-term sustainability would suggest that companies that come through this crisis and do well would be exactly the kinds of companies you would look to as role models,\u201d she said.  BlackRock\u2019s comments come as investors weigh what impact the coronavirus will have on efforts to slow climate change.  Among other things, BlackRock this year will look for executive pay to correlate with long-term performance metrics such as companies\u2019 total shareholder returns over three or five years, according to a fact sheet provided by the company.  A Reuters analysis last year found a pattern of deference to managers by BlackRock and other top index fund managers, even at poor-performing companies as measured by three-year returns through the end of 2018.  BlackRock also will ask companies to give details recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and threatened to vote against non-executive directors in cases where there are not adequate disclosures.  BlackRock said it will explain more specific votes, such as why it opposed executive pay at chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. BlackRock published seven such explanations in 2017, but just two the next year and one in 2019.

The contract to build and maintain the prison was first awarded almost eight years ago to a different company. BlackRock took over the project in 2016, after the Mexican government made changes to the prison and raised the promised annual payments to its operator to pay for them.  BlackRock will receive annual payments of at least 1.281 billion pesos ($65.5 million) a year for 20 years to cover construction, food and other maintenance, according to documents obtained by Reuters via a freedom of information request and a report by congressional auditor ASF.

Rick Rieder, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income, speaks during a Reuters investment summit in New York City, U.S., November 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income, said he is optimistic about the state of the U.S. economy with consumers in \u201ctremendous shape\u201d based on factors such as their income, household net worth and their savings rate.  As a result, \u201cWe have definitely gotten longer risk in the last 3-4 weeks,\u201d Rieder said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York on Thursday.  \u201cI think people have all gotten into cash and have all beared-up about the world coming to an end,\u201d he said.  Recession fears were compounded by anxiety about Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren rising in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, Rieder added.  Warren has emerged as a front-runner along with former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.  Some investors fret about Warren\u2019s plans to hike taxes on Wall Street, and regulate financial services more aggressively.  U.S. stock markets sold off hard starting mid-September amid concerns about trade, politics and concerning U.S. manufacturing data. The market has recovered since and the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX has since hit record highs.  The U.S. economy\u2019s big services sector can continue to grow without sparking inflationary pressure for finite resources in the way that manufacturing industries traditionally could not, Rieder said.  \u201cThe consumer and services can keep the economy in good shape,\u201d Rieder said.  As BlackRock's BLK.N top bond investment officer Rieder oversees $2.3 trillion, about a third of the New York's firm's total assets under management.  Betting against a near-term recession or further cuts in interest rates, Rieder is selling credit and buying agency mortgage-backed securities.  One way the firm has taken advantage of the market\u2019s heightened worries about the economic outlook is by writing covered calls - selling options against stock holdings.  \u201cWe have some names that have done pretty well in some of our funds. We have been selling a decent amount of calls,\u201d he said.  Sellers of call options take on the obligation sell shares at a fixed price in the future. It is a neutral to moderately bullish strategy that seeks to harvest income from heightened volatility levels.  Even though volatility selling has proven a crowded trade, reducing its attractiveness at the index level, the trade still had juice when implemented at the level of individual stock, he said. He declined to name particular companies in which BlackRock sold options.  Rieder also said Fed officials have done a good job matching rate cuts to economic conditions, and said he hopes \u2013 and expects \u2013 the U.S. central bank will pause from further adjustments while waiting to see if inflation starts to hit 2% or perhaps higher.  \u201cI think they should stop now. I don\u2019t think they should cut rates anymore from here. They should stop and get out of the way,\u201d he said.  Rieder also said the Fed\u2019s operations to boost liquidity by purchasing about $60 billion per month in short-term Treasuries plays an under-appreciated role in keeping the economy humming.  \u201cYou create a dynamic that\u2019s much more important to the global economy and emerging markets than interest rates are, by a lot.\u201d  September\u2019s sharp squeeze in money markets spurred the Fed into providing billions of dollars in daily cash injections and has reassured Rieder the U.S. central bank is back in the business of providing sorely needed liquidity, he said.","159":"FILE PHOTO: Larry Fink, Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, stands at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018.

The $9 trillion asset manager on Wednesday said it would require companies which emit lots of carbon dioxide to set nearer-term targets for cutting greenhouse gases, as well as more fully disclosing their true emissions. That\u2019s progress, but BlackRock can still go further.  A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018.  The latest steps from the company led by Larry Fink help clear up a few of the uncertainties from his latest letter to company chief executives, published last month. Some lobbyists had wondered exactly what BlackRock\u2019s chairman and chief executive meant when he said that companies should \u201cdisclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy\u201d. The fund manager\u2019s latest edict suggests he expects heavy-polluting companies to set short- and medium-term targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, rather than vague ones for 2050. They will also have to disclose the carbon discharged when customers use their products, rather than just the emissions from their production processes.  This adds to the impression that BlackRock\u2019s green turn is more than just a marketing manoeuvre. In December the group increased the number of carbon-intensive companies its stewardship team focuses on to over 1,000, from 440. It has put 191 of them on notice that it will vote against their management teams if they don\u2019t improve their green ideas. Managers of BlackRock\u2019s $400 billion of actively managed equity funds will be able to sell the stocks of persistent refuseniks.  Even so, BlackRock remains in a sort of green limbo. Though it says it will be minded to vote more aggressively against climate slowcoaches, the proof will only come after the next round of annual shareholder meetings. Until then, sceptics will wonder why the world\u2019s largest asset manager continues to aim for limiting global warming to \u201cwell below 2 degrees Celsius\u201d from pre-industrial levels, rather than the more planet-friendly 1.5 degrees. They might also want to know why BlackRock doesn\u2019t name the companies on its hit list, and why it doesn\u2019t push for customer-emissions data from other big industries like banking. Some European fund managers require companies to set what they call \u201cscience-based targets\u201d \u2013 independently vetted pathways to net zero. BlackRock still doesn\u2019t.  But Fink has other levers he could pull. BlackRock oversees $4 trillion of equities invested in index-tracking funds. The fund manager cannot sell shares of persistent climate laggards without threatening its obligation to track the index. However, it doesn\u2019t follow that Fink is powerless.  According to index provider MSCI\u2019s latest annual report, BlackRock is the company\u2019s biggest single client, supplying 11.5% of its revenue. Imagine if Fink and a host of like-minded fund managers demanded that MSCI remove the most egregious green offenders from the benchmark indexes tracked by passive funds worth trillions of dollars. The funds would then have to sell.  Sceptics might protest that such a move would undermine the integrity of indexes. But BlackRock already seems sanguine about this. The company devoted some of its letter to clients in January to flagging so-called \u201ctilted\u201d funds which weed out heavy carbon emitters. Fink could also reasonably claim that this sort of action will help shield customers from exposure to companies which fail to adapt to a net zero world.  BlackRock also has precedent for leaning on index providers. In 2018 it wrote to MSCI to request that the company retain in its indexes shares of companies with unequal voting rights, such as technology group Snap, despite proposals to exclude them. The dual-class shares stayed.  The usual argument against divestment is that selling stocks will just drive assets into the hands of privately held owners or companies from countries which care less about climate change. A related concern is that if capital-starved western polluters go bust, dirtier developing-world rivals might seize their market positions. The focus on equities also detracts from the fact that heavy carbon emitters are much more dependent on bank debt and bonds for funding.  Still, this doesn\u2019t mean BlackRock should do nothing. The risk of being evicted from an index could be a last-resort stick with which to beat the biggest laggards. Armed with this threat, BlackRock\u2019s stewardship team could press slowcoaches into making credible plans to reduce carbon emissions. And BlackRock\u2019s $1 trillion actively managed debt portfolio gives Fink scope to push the climate-change agenda in credit markets too.  If BlackRock took all of these steps, it could lay claim to be a green leader. Right now, there\u2019s more to do.","161":"(Repeats SCHEDULED COLUMN originally published on July 10, no changes)  NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - Investors will watch next week\u2019s earnings from BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, for a snapshot of how the industry performed during the second quarter\u2019s dramatic rebound in global financial markets.  Most expect numbers from industry bellwether BlackRock and other asset managers to reflect the sharp stock market rebound. The S&P 500 rose 20% in the second quarter after falling as much in the first three months of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the economy.  Since the performance of asset managers tends to be tied to how markets fare, investors see a range of risks ahead, including further acceleration of U.S. coronavirus cases and potential market volatility around the Nov. 3 presidential election.  Still, \u201cjust on a market level, the asset managers are in much better shape coming out of the second quarter than they were coming out of the first quarter,\u201d said Macrae Sykes, global financial services sector analyst at Gabelli Funds.  BlackRock is scheduled to report on July 17, with T. Rowe Price, WisdomTree Investments and Invesco among asset managers reporting in the following weeks.  Analysts expect a strong recovery in the sector\u2019s assets under management (AUM) in the second quarter, driven by rising financial markets and improving risk appetite. Higher levels of AUM mean more fees and stronger margins and earnings, analysts said.  BlackRock\u2019s assets fell to $6.47 trillion at the end of the first-quarter, from $7.43 trillion at the end of 2019.  Improving fund flows are also likely to help second-quarter earnings for the group, analysts said. Fixed income flows reversed back into positive territory in April and stayed that way throughout the quarter while equity flows improved from March lows, according to Jefferies.  Analysts at Morgan Stanley recently raised their estimate for second-quarter earnings-per-share for traditional asset managers by 19%.  Most analysts expect BlackRock to show robust flows into its $2 trillion exchange-traded funds business, with strength in the fixed income and alternatives ETFs offsetting outflows from equities.  Investors will also look for details on BlackRock\u2019s role in the Federal Reserve\u2019s debt-buying efforts as the central bank sought to stabilize a corporate bond market roiled by economic fallout of the pandemic.  The firm\u2019s own ETFs accounted for a large share of corporate bond ETFs it bought on behalf of the Fed as part of the central bank\u2019s relief program. BlackRock waived asset management fees on ETFs purchased on behalf of the Fed.  BlackRock\u2019s shares are up about 9% year-to-date, outperforming a 3% decline in the S&P 500. The broader sector has not fared as well, with the Refinitiv U.S. Investment Management & Fund Operators Price Return Index is down about 13% for the year.  Some investors worry asset managers could take a hit if a resurgent pandemic forces parts of the United States to halt or reverse the reopening of their economies.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs last week said the U.S. economy would shrink by 4.6% in 2020, from an earlier forecast of a 4.2% contraction.  \u201cWe remain cautious with equity markets nearing post Covid-outbreak highs amid risk of a market correction should a second coronavirus wave impede the pace of the global economic recovery,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients about the sector.  The U.S. presidential election could also heighten market volatility. A victory by Democratic challenger Joe Biden could threaten Republican policies championed by President Donald Trump and generally favored by Wall Street, including lower corporate tax rates and fewer regulations, analysts said.  A separate indication of the financial industry\u2019s health may come next week from several big Wall Street banks set to report earnings, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley.","162":"FRANKFURT, Nov 7 (Reuters) - German state prosecutors in Cologne executed a search warrant at Blackrock\u2019s offices in Munich on Tuesday, a spokesman said, adding that the company\u2019s country chairman, Friedrich Merz, was not suspected of wrongdoing.

The European Central Bank on Jan. 2 placed Italy\u2019s 10th largest bank under special administration and asked it to find a buyer to stave off the risk of state intervention.  The Genoa-based bank has said it needs to raise 630 million euros ($713 million) in capital after reporting a 2018 loss of 273 million euros. It has 3.5 billion euros in bad loans and has already launched three cash calls since 2014.  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is particularly interested in Carige\u2019s bad loans and in its private banking unit Banca Cesare Ponti, two of the sources said.  Apollo Global Management, which already owns Carige\u2019s insurance units, had initially also expressed an interest in buying the bank, but has now pulled out, one source said. Apollo had no immediate comment.  Carige declined to comment.  The bidders face two potential hurdles.  One is Carige\u2019s biggest investor, the Malacalza family, which owns 27.5 percent of the bank and in December voted against a capital increase.  Any bidder would need to get the Malacalzas on board to succeed or it would risk being voted down at a shareholder meeting called to approve the deal.  The family could buy into the capital increase to avoid being heavily diluted. It has invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015 to build a stake, which was worth 23 million euros before trading in the stock was halted when the bank was placed under special administration.  The second potential problem is the price at which either Varde or BlackRock would buy the bank\u2019s bad loans.  The 630-million-euro capital hole has been calculated on the basis of an offer for 1.9 billion euros worth of bad loans that Carige has already received from state-owned debt recovery specialist SGA, a company owned by the Italian treasury.  Should Varde or BlackRock offer a lower price for the soured debts, where funds typically aim to make big returns, the capital shortfall would be bigger.  The SGA offer remains on the table to give Carige\u2019s commissioners the option of selling a cleaned-up bank or if a private takeover fails and the bank needs an injection of state money.  Under a January emergency decree, Italy\u2019s government can buy up to 1 billion euros worth of Carige\u2019s shares.

The solidarity fund officially endorsed it on Monday by pledging to convert hybrid bonds worth 313 million euros into Carige shares. The participants were due to present the plan to the European Central Bank next week. Given the deal\u2019s high political profile, it\u2019s surprising that the asset manager run by Larry Fink waited so long before walking away.  The plan always looked overly ambitious, though. According to Il Messaggero, BlackRock expected Carige to break even in 2020 and deliver net income of 160 million euros by 2023 \u2013 earning an 8 percent return on equity of 1.9 billion euros. That\u2019s double the 4 percent average return produced by Italian banks in 2018, BLN data show. Turning around the weakened Carige brand in Italy\u2019s stagnating economy was a tall order.  BlackRock\u2019s change of heart removes the last market-based option for fixing Carige. The group run by former UBS banker Fabio Innocenzi was put under direct ECB control in January after failing to raise enough cash to absorb loan losses. Another potential investor, U.S. fund Varde Partners, walked away earlier this year after balking at the poor quality of the bank\u2019s assets, according to a person familiar with the situation. Italian banks have stayed on the sidelines, hoping the state would pay them to ride to the rescue, as when Intesa Sanpaolo snapped up two failed Veneto-based lenders in 2017.  The buck is now likely to stop with the Italian government, which has pledged to inject up to 1 billion euros into Carige to calm nervous depositors. As with other failed Italian banks, taxpayers might have to pick up the tab.","176":"(Reuters) - Sendinblue, a digital marketing platform aimed at helping smaller businesses sell more online, said on Thursday it raised $160 million in its latest funding round.

Several of the world\u2019s top private equity managers have quietly raised billions of dollars from Mexican pension funds, known as afores, since new rules were enacted early last year, filings to the Mexican Stock Exchange and a non-public document reviewed by Reuters showed. Regulators have authorized some managers to raise more over time.  It was not immediately clear how much in total has been raised to date in Mexico by equity managers, which include Discovery Capital Management, General Atlantic, Partners Group, Lexington Partners and HarbourVest Partners.  Their arrival in Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy comes after a regulatory change in January 2018 that allowed foreign private equity managers to tap into $179 billion worth of pension fund assets for the first time and eased some restrictions on how pension funds invest their assets.  Mexico\u2019s lower house of Congress is about to vote on a draft law by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) that would give pension funds further flexibility.  Blackstone Managing Director Matthew Pedley said in an interview that pension funds were taking advantage of the recent change in regulation to add exposure to international alternatives and diversify their portfolios.  Others consulted by Reuters on their funds in Mexico declined to be identified.  The private equity funds could help Mexican pension funds spread risk with international investments ranging from infrastructure to energy and special situations hedge funds.  Luis Sayeg, investment management director at Citibanamex, which manages one of the leading pension funds in the country, said the new funds could benefit pensions.  \u201cIt is a new opportunity to diversify the portfolio into alternative asset classes, with likely attractive returns, that do not necessarily exist in Mexico,\u201d Sayeg said.  The draft law was praised by ratings agency Fitch although some critics have expressed concern that the government wants to tap pensions to help finance pet projects.  PENSION POT  Black Rock was one of the first foreign asset managers to expand into Mexico, raising $615 million for two funds, one of which will focus on infrastructure investments, a non-public document detailing fundraising activity showed.  KKR & Co raised $683 million for two funds, including one that will invest across private equity, growth equity, real assets as well as special situations hedge funds and private credit funds, the document showed.  The new funds are all listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange.  Mexico is attractive to those looking to raise assets for long-term investment.  The country has the largest and one of the fastest-growing private pension fund systems in Latin America, almost doubling in size in seven years, a global pension fund assets analysis by consultancy Willis Towers Watson found.  Mexican pension funds\u2019 investment outside the country is still limited to 20 percent of overall assets while their investment in alternatives like private equity is also limited to 20 percent.  This gives them little room for diversification at a time when most other maturing pension fund systems are loosening investment restrictions to help address problems like funding gaps and an ageing population.  Investing in new asset classes or geographies adds layers of complexity. This often requires more sophisticated investment processes, risk management and corporate governance practices.  Tonatiuh Rodriguez, chief executive at one of Mexico\u2019s leading pension funds, Afore Azteca, said its investment committee had decided not to invest in private equity for now.  \u201cThe risk of these investments is a risk that needs to be monitored and managed in a different way,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThe returns we get from investments in the public market, which, by definition, is more regulated, are good.\u201d  Regulation stipulates that the private equity managers need to invest at least 10 percent of the capital in Mexico and commit at least 2 percent as co-investment alongside the pension funds.  Despite his risk aversion, Rodriguez said: \u201cThe fact that those are large, well-known managers, with best practices, minimizes the risks for pension funds.\u201d (Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; additional reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Cynthia Osterman)","178":"NEW YORK, May 22 (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Friday charged the founder and former owner of a Hollywood movie production and distribution company with defrauding a BlackRock Inc investment fund out of about$14 million to pay for luxuries including a Beverly Hills mansion.

Inflation expectations, as measured by the difference between the yields of TIPS and regular Treasuries known as breakeven rate, have recovered from their dramatic drop in late 2018, as investors lost confidence about the economy due to trade tensions between China and the United States.  Investors had also grown worries about further rate hikes from the Fed before policy-makers took a dovish shift at their policy meeting in late January.  The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate fell to 1.69 percent at the start of the year before touching 1.96 percent last Friday, which was its highest level in nearly three months, Tradeweb data showed.  To be sure, TIPS would lose their relative attractiveness to regular Treasuries if the U.S. economy slips into a recession and the Federal Reserve were to begin cutting interest rates, which Turnill said were unlikely to happen in 2019.  Investors have shifted $430 million back into TIPS-focused funds so far this year after withdrawing some $4.8 billion from them in the final quarter of 2018, according to data firm Lipper.  \u201cWe see potential for TIPS to play a valuable role in portfolios in the near term,\u201d Turnill wrote.","183":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo for BlackRock is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., March 30, 2017.

FILE PHOTO: Workers work on a drill rig at the BP America Dracorex Gas Unit well site in Lufkin, Texas, U.S., June 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Jonathan Bachman\/File Photo  Oil and gas giants such as Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS, Chevron CVX.N and BP BP.L are generating as much cash at today's oil prices of around $70 a barrel as they did in 2014, before crude spiraled down from over $100 a barrel to lows of below $30 a barrel.  As they emerge from the deepest downturn in decades, boards have vowed to remain thrifty and stick to lower spending targets in order to return value to shareholders after years of pain.  Alastair Bishop, director and portfolio manager in BlackRock\u2019s natural resources team, which has major holdings in the world\u2019s five largest oil and gas companies, said he did not expect capital expenditure, or capex, to rise in the near term.  \u201cIt is a sweet spot for IOCs (international oil companies) where they have relatively low cost inflation, a reasonable oil price and at these levels they can generate significant cashflow to go toward paying down debt (and share) buybacks,\u201d Bishop told Reuters in an interview.  BlackRock is the largest investor in Shell and BP and among the top five in Total TOTF.PA, Exxon XOM.N and Chevron, Eikon Refinitiv data shows.  Unlike earlier in the decade, when oil companies raced to grow production to meet soaring demand in China, boards are today focused on returns from investments, Bishop said.  \u201cI am not sure investors are wanting large IOCs to be chasing growth. There is much greater interest in generating returns and free cash flow.\u201d  But given the nature of the business where fields naturally decline as they age and take years to develop, investments will have to grow after 2020 to avoid a dip in production.  \u201cWould I be surprised if beyond 2020 capex budgets start to move higher? No, I wouldn\u2019t. There will be a little cost inflation and they will need to start thinking about their production profile into the 2020s,\u201d Bishop said.  The appetite for huge multi-billion-dollar projects such as deepwater oil fields and large gas processing facilities that became the trademark for Big Oil has however weakened, Bishop said.  Instead, companies should opt for smaller-scale and phased projects where spending is better controlled such as shale oil and offshore field expansions as well as non-oil and gas projects such as chemical plants and power generation, he added.  \u201cThere seems to be less appetite for just ploughing money straight back into the ground,\u201d according to Bishop.  \u201cFrom our side, unless you have new opportunities right at the bottom of the cost curve we are not that desperate for you to drive volume growth in terms of oil.\u201d  GRAPHIC: Big Oil cashflow - tmsnrt.rs\/2Pn84xn  RENEWABLES  BlackRock sees the transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner low-carbon energy happening faster than many oil companies expect, with oil demand peaking in the early 2030s, Bishop said, around a decade earlier than most other forecasts.  But what role oil majors will play in the transition remains unclear.  Europe\u2019s energy giants have stepped up investments in low-carbon energies following the landmark U.N.-backed 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, in contrast with their U.S. rivals.  \u201cLevels the Europeans are spending in that area look entirely reasonable to me,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cIf they can prove the business model works then it would make sense for them to start allocating more.\u201d","187":"FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018.

The company wrestled with difficult market trends during the quarter, including an industrywide slowdown in the demand for its hottest product, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track markets.  BlackRock\u2019s iShares-branded ETFs took in $17.8 billion during the quarter, down from $34.6 billion in the first quarter. The company also cut fees on some ETFs to increase its market share.  \u201cBroadly, we\u2019ve seen a weakness in flows this past quarter driven by investor de-risking and less investor risk appetite in the marketplace,\u201d said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys.

Yet even with the slower-than-usual growth in demand for the funds, which are relatively cheap to manage as they gain in size, revenue rose more than 10 percent to $2.9 billion.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.07 billion in the second quarter, up more than 25 percent, as weaker, yet still positive, demand for index funds helped plump up margins and the company settled into a lower tax rate.  Operating income, a measure of profits after some expenses including employee pay, rose 16.4 percent to $1.4 billion in the quarter from the same period in 2017.  The company\u2019s effective tax rate was 24 percent, down from more than 30 percent in the year-ago period, before a major U.S. tax cut was passed.  \u201cThe most important thing we\u2019ve been proving is the strength of our diversified business model,\u201d which includes not just funds but also, increasingly, technology services, said Chief Executive Larry Fink in an interview.  BlackRock earned $6.62 per share, compared with $5.20 a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $6.66 per share, while analysts expected $6.55, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Strong earnings growth, particularly in the United States, was clouded during the quarter by rising tensions between America and its trading partners. Fink warned that it is unclear \u201cwhere we\u2019re going with trade,\u201d adding that \u201cyou saw a lot of international investors pull out of the market because they\u2019re questioning what does this all mean in regard to trade and globalization.\u201d  Fink also told Bloomberg Television that markets could fall 10 to 15 percent if tariff wars become full-blown.  BlackRock ended the quarter with $6.29 trillion in assets under management, down from $6.32 trillion in the preceding quarter.  Investors pulled $22 billion from the company\u2019s stock funds and deposited $26 billion into its fixed-income products, according to the earnings release. Overall flows, excluding funds where investors park cash temporarily, were $14.50 billion, the lowest since the second quarter of 2016.","194":"FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018.

BlackRock\u2019s memo said that Ed Kuczma would take on some of Landers\u2019 portfolio management responsibility duties, adding that Kuczma has more 15 years of investment experience in Latin American equities.  The transition comes during a wild period for investors focused on the region, whose swing to conservative rule in places, including Brazil, has isolated leftist-ruled countries such as Venezuela, a major oil producer. Brazil\u2019s new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was sworn in on Tuesday. Investors are also looking for progress on economic initiatives from Mexico to Argentina.

BlackRock, which oversees $6.4 trillion in both actively managed and passive funds, announced in 2017 a strategy to bolster its own stockpickers, including reorganizing to focus on niches, such as specific geographic regions where it could offer expertise and win assets.

The company has applied to the local regulator to get a license to set up the new investment management business.  The Financial Times said on Monday BlackRock had chosen Paris over London to locate this new business.  Unlike other banks and financial companies, the fund manager has decided not to relocate staff to Paris from London.

Financial markets rallied in the fourth quarter, building on sharp gains of the prior two quarters, as accommodative global central bank policy and improving growth prospects helped lift investors\u2019 risk appetite.  While rallying stock markets provided a powerful boost to BlackRock\u2019s results, the profit report showed outsized growth in inflows at a time when the rest of the industry is expected to struggle with redemptions.  \u201cYes, markets were great for everyone this quarter, but most asset managers are still bleeding out assets ... whereas BlackRock\u2019s flow growth rate is continuing to accelerate,\u201d said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.  \u201cThat shows that they are taking market share ... widening the competitive gap with all their peers,\u201d said Sanders.  BlackRock\u2019s adjusted net income of $10.18 per share in the fourth quarter topped Wall Street estimates of $9.14, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  The asset manager raked in higher investment and advisory fees, a major source of revenue, through the quarter.  BlackRock\u2019s growing size and wide reach in financial markets across the globe have seen the asset manager become one of the most important firms in capital markets today.  When markets turned turbulent in early 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve roped in BlackRock to run various vehicles the Fed created to buy corporate debt from the primary and secondary markets, thereby helping restore calm to markets.  BlackRock\u2019s success, not untied to its size, is likely to spur consolidation among peers looking to play catch-up with the investment behemoth, analysts said.  \u201cWe anticipate elevated mergers and acquisitions within the industry as peers attempt to replicate BlackRock\u2019s scale, technology capabilities and comprehensive product lineup,\u201d Edward Jones\u2019 Sanders said.  In February 2020, asset manager Franklin Resources Inc bought rival Legg Mason Inc in a $4.5 billion deal, and in December, Bloomberg reported U.S. custodian bank State Street Corp was exploring options for its asset management business.

FILE PHOTO: The company logo and trading information for BlackRock is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The San Francisco-based nonprofit, which has received funding from liberal billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer \u2013 both of whom recently withdrew as contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination - said its website drew 1,092 new users per day in February, more than double the daily rate last year, with many of the visits from accountants and lawyers who oversee corporate filings.  SASB CEO Janine Guillot said the group is now working to translate the new traffic into more data reporting. SASB counts 139 companies worldwide that report data in accordance with its guidelines. Guillot said she expects that could rise to as many as 300 by next year.  \u201cIt is surprising how much a little letter from Larry Fink can generate,\u201d said Guillot, referring to BlackRock\u2019s CEO.  Fink\u2019s annual missive to corporate CEOs in mid-January asked that all companies in which BlackRock invests by year-end \u201cpublish a disclosure in line with industry-specific SASB guidelines,\u201d or something similar, arguing in favor of SASB\u2019s \u201cclear set of standards.\u201d  State Street Corp, STT.N another large asset manager, also plugged SASB for promoting material disclosures in a recent open letter.  WHO\u2019S BEHAVING BADLY?  SASB is one of several organizations \u2013 another is the Global Reporting Initiative - seeking to cut through a fog of uncertainty on how to measure companies\u2019 progress on sustainability matters, at a time of mounting concern among investors over climate change and other issues.  A lack of widely adopted reporting standards on sustainability metrics up to now has yielded alarming results for ratings firms seeking to rank companies on their performances, complicating the task for investors trying to build a truly green portfolio. [L3N26L3XH]  In a study published last year, for example, MIT Researcher Roberto Rigobon found the scores that companies received from five top environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings firms on greenhouse gas emissions had an average correlation of 0.13 - remarkably low considering the 0.9 level of major credit ratings services.  \u201cThis is disturbing,\u201d Rigobon said. \u201cWe need to be able to figure out as a society who is behaving badly and who is not.\u201d  Finding a set of uniform reporting standards for sustainability could solve the problem in the same way as financial accounting standards have made it easier for investors to assess a company\u2019s financial health, according to Robert Fernandez, vice president at Breckinridge Capital Advisors and a member of SASB\u2019s investor advisory group.  \u201cMaybe we wouldn\u2019t have to rely on the ESG raters as much if there were more data and we could do more of the analysis ourselves,\u201d he said.  SASB rival GRI asks for a wider range of details in its sustainability reporting guidelines than SASB\u2019s industry-specific requests. GRI is used by about 4,000 companies, according to research firm Corporate Register, though the figure has grown little in recent years.  GRI CEO Tim Mohin said he worries investors and companies are going to lean toward SASB\u2019s narrower reporting guidelines, instead of GRI\u2019s more thorough ones. If SASB became dominant, he said, \u201cIt could become a massive rollback of ESG disclosure.\u201d  BlackRock did not make executives available to discuss why they favored SASB. BlackRock has a representative on the board that sets SASB standards, and executives from BlackRock and from State Street serve on SASB\u2019s investor advisory group.  PAPERWORK OVERLOAD  Some companies report against both SASB and GRI standards, or plan to do so soon, including Vornado Realty Trust VNO.N, JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O and Duke Energy DUK.N. Duke executives said they hope the standards eventually converge.  \u201cWe just want to have consistency, that\u2019s the main goal,\u201d said Duke CFO Steve Young.  For other companies, SASB's simplicity makes it a favorite. Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM.O of Laurel, Mississippi, said last month it will adopt SASB guidelines, even after shareholders rejected a resolution seeking partial SASB reporting.  Chief Financial Officer Mike Cockrell said the company made the decision after BlackRock and other investors suggested the step. He said he also hopes the move will forestall shareholder requests for other, more detailed disclosures including from the GRI.  \u201cI could have a staff of 30 people working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks and still not be able to complete some of these reports,\u201d he said.  Andrew Behar, CEO of environmental resolution sponsor As You Sow, said he credits BlackRock and State Street for boosting SASB, even if ideally companies would also provide a GRI report.  For now, he said, \u201cWe got what we wanted.\u201d","203":"NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, raised the total compensation for Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink by 8.9 percent in 2017, according to a filing on Friday.

A recent report by Deutsche Bank highlighted how investors, betting on a bounce in global growth, now have the greatest exposure to equities in two years. The report noted similarly extended positioning a month before a sharp reversal in February 2018.

It\u2019s the default source for governments needing advice on the biggest financial questions. Its sprawl means that sometimes it seems to be on both sides of certain dealings. That\u2019s Goldman Sachs, before and during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. It also describes another company today: investment manager BlackRock.  A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  With some $7 trillion under management, Larry Fink\u2019s mutual and exchange-traded fund specialist is by far the largest such group on the planet. Its funds typically own 5% or more of listed U.S. companies, often making the BlackRock complex the largest shareholder. The expertise it gleans from its global presence made it the go-to place for the Federal Reserve to get urgent help with parts of its multi-trillion-dollar coronavirus rescue package.  Given this reach, Fink\u2019s annual missives about corporate purpose and serving stakeholders beyond just shareholders are required reading for almost every chief executive. Moreover, institutional and corporate investment managers responsible for perhaps $30 trillion of assets \u2013 a figure 50% larger than U.S. GDP \u2013 use risk-management software called Aladdin that BlackRock developed, uses in-house, and sells to others, according to a Breakingviews estimate based on the last value disclosed by BlackRock and stock-market gains since then.  Politicians have raised questions about the $80 billion firm\u2019s many tentacles as recently as last month. Things like running mutual funds, for example, are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and others. But the recent sale by lender PNC Financial Services of its 22% stake in the asset manager means there should be fewer limitations on BlackRock\u2019s activities, and this also removed one potential source of more intrusive oversight.  A newcomer to this story might think BlackRock, along with rival asset managers Vanguard and State Street, ought to be on watchdogs\u2019 radar as critical to the world\u2019s financial system \u2013 just as regulators have stamped the global systemically important financial institution, or G-SIFI, designation on Goldman, among a list of other global banks headed by JPMorgan. But they are not.  PRODUCTS, NOT COMPANIES  There are valid reasons. The assets BlackRock manages belong to its clients, not to Fink\u2019s company. As Douglas Elliott, then a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, noted in a 2014 paper, it\u2019s important to distinguish what might be systemically risky about investors\u2019 behavior from risks posed by asset managers themselves.  Mutual funds and ETFs are, strictly, independent legal entities that are free to take their management contracts elsewhere. BlackRock doesn\u2019t put its own money at risk \u2013 or that of depositors, as banks do \u2013 so there\u2019s scant logic to bank-like capital-cushion requirements based, say, on a percentage of total assets under management.  Prudential regulation of that kind matters fund-by-fund, but far less so, if at all, at the BlackRock corporate level. One or several individual funds could go belly-up with no financial impact on the company. The reputational damage might cost BlackRock\u2019s shareholders \u2013 its bosses might even decide to voluntarily bail out funds to limit that damage \u2013 but other investors\u2019 money would not be at risk.  Thanks to these realities and a communication and lobbying effort by BlackRock and its peers, the Financial Stability Oversight Council \u2013 created by the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation and charged with looking at the issue \u2013 in 2014 shifted its focus toward risky products and activities, rather than companies like Fink\u2019s.  Even under that approach, worries about how ETFs \u2013 which have grown massively in popularity since 2009 \u2013 would perform in a crisis have so far proved mostly unfounded. Some differently structured exchange-traded products at other firms, like the United States Oil Fund, ran into trouble during the March coronavirus panic. But BlackRock ETFs, including those that track illiquid bonds, if anything helped provide price transparency. Creating a stress test more challenging than that would be difficult.  Yet sheer size counts for something. Though BlackRock is most commonly a passive, index-tracking owner, some observers worry that holding big stakes in multiple firms that operate in the same sectors could lead to anti-competitive behavior. Also, if enough funds driven by similar corporate policies make similar bets and then all seek to unwind them at once, the market impact would by definition be larger if it\u2019s BlackRock than a smaller competitor.  Non-bank financial players are also on international watchdogs\u2019 radar. Organizations like the Financial Stability Board worry about so-called shadow banking. But they will probably focus more on risks associated with opaque private debt funds or highly leveraged hedge funds than BlackRock\u2019s products, especially given the ETF market recently navigated a testing experience.  Still, Fink\u2019s outfit can\u2019t escape attention altogether. BlackRock can legitimately argue that the most significant potential systemic dangers are built into individual products. But the risk added by the company\u2019s scale and integration in the global financial system is bigger than zero.  ATTRACTIVE DISTRACTIONS  Justified or not, BlackRock\u2019s other business lines will also ensure it remains in the spotlight. One is the firm\u2019s advisory business. As the dominant player in bond ETFs, BlackRock risks appearing to have a conflict of interest when advising the Fed, or other central banks, on massive bond-buying programs. In March, the U.S. central bank handed BlackRock\u2019s financial markets advisory unit its bailout mandate without a competitive process. Questioned by Senator Martha McSally last month, Fed Chair Jay Powell said speed dictated the choice and the Fed would eventually rebid the contract.  The advisory unit produces a tiny fraction of BlackRock\u2019s revenue, but it punches above that weight in influence and prestige. It could easily become a flashpoint for political criticism that spills over into the company\u2019s other business.  Then there\u2019s Aladdin. Users \u2013 sophisticated asset managers remarkably including Vanguard, BlackRock\u2019s arch-rival \u2013 surely have alternative ways to monitor portfolio risk and perform other functions the software handles. But glitches with a widely relied-upon platform could still rattle markets. An operational misstep could harm the company\u2019s reputation and raise the hackles of watchdogs, too.  In her critique, McSally also took aim at BlackRock\u2019s investments in China. Tracking global stock indexes that include some companies based there is not the same as actively investing in businesses in the People\u2019s Republic. Still, after U.S. President Donald Trump in May lambasted the main federal retirement fund\u2019s plan to start following an index that includes Chinese companies, the plan\u2019s bosses backed off the idea. Such objections \u2013 and reactions \u2013 might spread, complicating BlackRock\u2019s core fund-management business.  Even Fink\u2019s push for better environmental, social and governance accountability is controversial. For example, a group of Republican senators don\u2019t want climate-related criteria that might apply to some BlackRock-managed funds to influence the Fed\u2019s bond buying; rival Democrats, in contrast, do want the central bank to take climate risks into account.  BlackRock\u2019s incentives are very different from Goldman\u2019s more than a decade ago. Its business model, in simplistic terms, is primarily about making money for others, not for its own account. However scrupulous and transparent BlackRock may try to be, though, suspicions will persist as it grows even larger. It\u2019s easy to foresee calls for tighter regulation. BlackRock could become a political football, too, especially given Fink\u2019s Democratic sympathies. Simply as a target, Goldman used to be the biggest in the financial world. That\u2019s now BlackRock\u2019s burden.","208":"LONDON, April 30 (Reuters) - Sandra Boss, an external member of the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Committee, is stepping down following her decision to take a role at U.S. investment company Blackrock, Britain\u2019s central bank said on Thursday.

Overall, the company sold $43.6 billion in stock, bond and other \u201clong-term\u201d investment funds, more than the $10.6 billion sold the quarter prior.  Still, weaker investment performance and the company\u2019s own price cuts hurt. The company collects fees as a percentage of assets under management, which are now just under $6 trillion.  The S&P 500 .SPX fell more than 10 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31.  Money that the company earned for hitting certain performance targets and for lending out shares to people betting against stocks fell from the year prior.  \u201cThere are moments you can\u2019t control what clients are doing, when clients are de-risking.

People are also flocking to the company\u2019s iShares ETFs to get cheap exposure to various parts of the market.  The iShares group took in $81 billion in the quarter, compared with $34 billion in the quarter prior.  BlackRock\u2019s stock is down nearly a third from an all-time high near $600 per share last year, declining more than 21 percent in 2018. The stock rose 4.3 percent to $418 on Wednesday as a broader rally pushed U.S. stock indexes higher.  Analysts seemed pleased with the average level of fees BlackRock was able to charge as well as continued success at winning new assets.  \u201cWe see the silver lining,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders. \u201cThis was a reaffirmation to investors that BlackRock is differentiated with iShares.\u201d  Net income fell to $927 million, or $5.78 per share, in the quarter, from $2.30 billion, or $14.01 per share, a year earlier, when U.S. corporate tax cuts helped.

BlackRock sliced expenses, but not as fast as its revenues fell. The company said last week it was cutting about 500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce, and booked a $60 million restructuring charge in the quarter. Total staff is still expected to be higher than a year ago following the cuts.

The world\u2019s largest fund manager told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it wants to launch a money-market fund that will invest primarily in debt from issuers who have better-than-average environmental practices.  BlackRock, which oversees nearly $6 trillion in assets, also planned to commit 5 percent of the net revenue from its management fee on the BlackRock Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund, or LEAF, to purchase carbon offsets. Money from carbon offsets generally funds projects that reduce emissions, such as planting trees or trapping methane emissions from waste dumps in developing countries.  Money-market funds invest in relatively safe short-term government or high-quality corporate-issued debt. Companies and investors treat the funds like cash and expect them to hold their value, earn income and be available at a moment\u2019s notice. It is rare for environmental factors to be taken into account as part of the investment strategy.  BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has been under increasing pressure by activist groups to address the perceived social and environmental shortcomings of companies held by his funds.  Because the company\u2019s most popular products are index funds that hold broad swaths of the market, BlackRock has a significant stake in publicly traded companies worldwide that draw ire from investors, including alcohol, tobacco and weapons manufacturers as well as fossil-fuel companies. BlackRock also has a pivotal shareholder vote in corporate-governance matters involving those companies.  Last week, a hoax letter purporting to be from Fink claimed the fund manager would require companies it owns to align their businesses with measures to counter climate change. An advocacy group took credit for the fake letter.  BlackRock has not asked companies to meet specific environmental standards, saying its role is not to make political judgments on its clients\u2019 behalf.  But it has pressed oil-and-gas companies including Exxon Mobil Corp to provide more information about how environmental regulations and related issues could affect their bottom lines. The asset manager has also unveiled new products for people focused on environmental goals.  In 2017, the company hired Brian Deese, a former Obama administration official who helped negotiate the Paris agreement on climate change, to run its sustainable investing group.

Going by a set of calculations BlackRock prefers, Fink\u2019s total compensation for the year fell 14% to $24 million. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year.  \u201cBlackRock\u2019s Board of Directors and I both believe that the performance of our stock price should be a factor in determining the compensation of our senior executives,\u201d Fink, who is often quoted for his views on the markets and corporate governance and has been listed among the world\u2019s best CEOs by the newspaper Barron\u2019s, said in the filing.  BlackRock\u2019s stock slid 23.5% in price during 2018, its worst performance since 2008, as a severe bout of volatility buffeted financial markets.

FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen at the BlackRock Japan headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, October 20, 2016. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  The world's largest asset manager made the call in a letter to index provider MSCI, which had sought comments about a proposal it is considering to adjust the index weighting of stocks like Facebook Inc FB.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O to account for their unequal voting structures.  BlackRock, which manages $6.3 trillion, said while it appreciates the index provider\u2019s attention to the issues, MSCI\u2019s proposed changes could distort markets. Instead, \u201cwe believe that policymakers, not index providers, should set corporate governance standards,\u201d it stated in the letter, signed by BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick and posted on the firm\u2019s website.  Since last year a number of high-profile technology firms, including Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N, Dropbox Inc DBX.O and Snap Inc SNAP.N, have listed shares with a voting structure that gives lopsided decision-making power to insiders. According to the Council of Institutional Investors, among 124 IPOs in 2017, 23 had unequal voting rights, although some would give outside investors more voting power over time.  Corporate executives say the structures help their firms focus on long-term growth.  BlackRock and rivals like State Street Corp STT.N and Vanguard Group have criticized the trend but have bought the shares to fill index funds they say must try to replicate mandated market segments.  MSCI and other providers last year made changes that excluded some stocks with unequal rights, like Snap, from widely followed indexes, including the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000. MSCI said in January it might make further changes after more consultation with clients.  BlackRock\u2019s Novick wrote that a global body like the International Organization of Securities Commissions would be well-positioned to suggest listing standards that national regulators could use. A Madrid-based spokeswoman for the organization said it has not undertaken work on the matter.  U.S. regulations are still under development. A committee that advises the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March recommended reforms like clear disclosures of different voting rights and of the risks that could result.  SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said at the time he would like analysis of related areas like concerns about short-term investing and the attractiveness of U.S. capital markets. In February, Commissioner Robert Jackson said stock exchanges should develop some kind of limit on dual-class structures.","218":"* Climate Finance Partnership plans infrastructure fund  * BlackRock takes first-loss tranche of at least $100 mln  * To invest at least a quarter of capital in Africa  LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A BlackRock-backed group aims to raise an initial $500 million for a private equity fund that will invest in climate change-linked infrastructure upgrades in emerging markets.  BlackRock will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 by France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.  The BlackRock funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors which BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million.  The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in South East Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said.  The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing.  In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act was \u201cparticularly urgent\u201d given many cities were not built to withstand \u201cthe new climate reality\u201d.  Climate has also been at the forefront of this year\u2019s annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising is set to be announced.  \u201cWe believe creative collaboration is essential to mobilizing investment into climate infrastructure in emerging markets at scale, providing our clients with further opportunity to invest in the global low-carbon transition,\u201d Brian Deese, Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock, said in the statement.  France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively.  The CFP members have pledged to help raise the additional seed capital for the fund. BlackRock will invest an as yet determined amount in addition to the funding for the first-loss tranche.  \u201cEmerging market equities are substantially cheaper than those in developed economies and they offer the best choice for growth in an otherwise slow-growth world,\u201d said Jeremy Grantham, Trustee of the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust.

The Fed has been raising rates to stave off inflation and end its historic measures to counter the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.

One proposed solution is to have companies report against metrics offered by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit organization whose backers including another Democratic presidential candidate, billionaire Michael Bloomberg.  Last month Fink forecast a \u201cfundamental reshaping of finance\u201d due to climate change risks, and urged companies to make disclosures in line with those suggested by SASB and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.  Activists have praised Fink\u2019s intentions but said they are waiting to see how the company acts, such as how it votes on climate-related issues at the springtime proxy season.","230":"NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc on Wednesday disclosed in its annual report for the first time a risk associated with \u201cthird-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing.\u201d  \u201cAs a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing,\u201d the world\u2019s largest asset manager said in the report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cIf the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.\u201d (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by David Gregorio)","231":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, generated higher profit during the first quarter by luring more money from investors even as stock and bond markets fell.  Fund manager profits typically decline during market routs because their fees are based on the value of customer assets. But BlackRock benefited from its large footprint in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have been taking market share away from pricier investment products for several years.  BlackRock attracted nearly $57 billion in new cash from clients in the latest quarter. Its iShares ETFs unit was the biggest contributor, drawing $35 billion in net inflows.  \u201cIt\u2019s better to be BlackRock in this atmosphere,\u201d BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview.  \u201cWe have always differentiated ourselves in more volatile times.\u201d  Markets swung wildly during the first three months of the year as early enthusiasm over U.S. corporate tax cuts was soon blunted by concerns about inflation, the risk of a global trade war and Federal Reserve policy.  Even so, BlackRock\u2019s assets under management climbed to $6.32 trillion as of March 31, up from $5.42 trillion a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  In addition to customer inflows, BlackRock benefited from favorable currency movements, lower taxes and ensuring expenses rose less than revenue.  The New York-based company\u2019s net income rose to $1.09 billion, or $6.68 per share, in the first quarter, up 28 percent from the year-ago period.  Adjusted for special items, BlackRock earned $6.70 per share, beating the $6.39 per share analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Its shares closed 1.5 percent higher at $533.01.  BlackRock shares are up nearly 40 percent in price terms over the past year, compared to an 18.5 percent rise for a Thomson Reuters index that includes more than a dozen of its U.S. rivals.  The results suggest BlackRock is continuing to evolve from a traditional fund manager into a steadier financial operation whose profits are not based exclusively on market movements, said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders.  Technology has played a key role in that shift, helping to lure new assets by improving investment performance and automating routine functions, he said.  \u201cI\u2019m viewing this more as a technology firm than a traditional asset manager,\u201d said Sanders.  BlackRock has a technology business that licenses its internal operating system to clients and competitors. Though it is among BlackRock\u2019s smaller business lines, Fink said he expects its revenue to grow at mid-teen percentages in the coming years.  Earlier this year, the company opened an artificial intelligence laboratory in California's Silicon Valley and added Microsoft Corp MSFT.O executive Peggy Johnson to its board of directors.","232":"FILE PHOTO: Larry Fink, Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, stands at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018.

Boss is currently member of a risk committee for the Bank of England and a director of two public companies, according to BlackRock and to her LinkedIn profile.  Under Novick, BlackRock - with roughly $7 trillion in assets under management - largely took a behind-the-scenes approach in its dealings with the large companies in its portfolios.

Yin Liqin\/CNS via REUTERS  \u201cChina is slightly more invest-able than the UK right now,\u201d said Nigel Bolton, chief investment officer of international equities on the sidelines of a briefing on Tuesday.  The comment illustrates the depth of concern about the uncertain outcome of Brexit, with the FTSE 100 .FTSE and midcap index FTMC on track for their worst year since 2008 and sterling languishing at 20-month lows.  It is also significant as Beijing remains locked in a protracted trade row with Washington, which has triggered big sell-offs in China\u2019s volatile equity market in recent months amid worries it will hurt the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  BlackRock\u2019s Bolton said he would wait until there is clarity around that dispute. But he pointed as positives to Beijing\u2019s efforts to shore up its economy and expectations the government will take more aggressive action in coming months to reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown next year.  \u201cWe think the upside is potentially bigger than the downside. We\u2019ve been edging money back into China,\u201d he said.  In contrast, he still sees a 30 percent downside risk to domestically focused U.K. equities as Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal flounders with less than four months until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29.  The blue-chip FTSE 100, which makes 70 percent of its income outside of the UK, has fallen 11.5 percent so far this year, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 is down 15 percent year to date.  The sterling was near 20-month lows on Tuesday after May on Monday pulled a parliamentary vote because she faced defeat and a day later rushed to Europe to try and renegotiate new terms.  While BlackRock doesn\u2019t expect Britain to go through a hard Brexit, the political uncertainty will cast a cloud over the market for the foreseeable future.  That may be the case for European equities too, Bolton said.  \u201cIn Europe, we\u2019re more cautious over the next year or two.

The funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors that BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million.  The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said.  The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing.  Climate has also been at the forefront of this year\u2019s annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising was announced.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  BlackRock, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management, is giving primary responsibility for those institutional clients to executives in local regions.  It is also putting Edwin Conway in charge of BlackRock Alternative Investors, a group of complex investment products that Chief Executive Larry Fink thinks can amp up the company\u2019s profits.  BlackRock, known best for funds that track the stock and bond markets, has been putting more emphasis on so-called illiquid alternative investments, complex investments including private equity and real estate that typically come with higher fees and are more likely to be sold to an institution than a mom-and-pop investor.  Conway, previously head of Blackrock\u2019s institutional client business, will succeed David Blumer, who is becoming an adviser. The alternative group\u2019s chairman is Mark Wiseman, one of several people tipped as Fink\u2019s possible successors .  As part of the changes, Mark McCombe, another potential Fink successor, takes on a new role as chief client officer to work with global clients, including governments, financial companies and investment consultants that steer money from big clients, such as pension funds. Rob Fairbairn, who is already responsible for some top clients, becomes a vice chairman.  Fink, one of BlackRock\u2019s founders in 1988, has neither signaled any intention to leave nor publicly named a successor. He told analysts last year that he thinks the alternative investments business can be a source of major growth for the company.  Asset managers have been squeezed by rising competition and pressure to reduce fees, and in recent months many have been cutting jobs and costs. Even BlackRock, which has benefited by offering low-cost exchange-traded funds, announced layoffs in January. At the time Fink pledged to continue investing in what he sees as growth opportunities.

Budgets are down and aren\u2019t going to come back up.\u201d  The sweeping changes in how asset managers consume research will underscore concerns about pain being felt across European equity research providers almost a year after MiFID II came into force.  Stockbrokers have been the main losers from the new legislation, Bolton said, echoing a sentiment across the financial sector.  \u201cWe basically think twice before having a meeting (with a stockbroker), and we share meetings,\u201d Bolton said.  Verena Ross, executive director of the EU\u2019s European Securities and Markets Authority, which is overseeing the implementation of MiFID II, said the watchdog was closely monitoring the market\u2019s concerns about research.  \u201cThe landscape is changing and that has some implications, but at the same time the evidence from the data is not particularly firm yet,\u201d she told a conference in London.  The watchdog will look, in particular, at whether there is sufficient coverage of small-cap companies, she said.  The cuts are likely to drive consolidation as small- and medium-sized brokerages struggle with the loss of research income and falling commission fees amid growing competition, experts say.  The comments come after reports last month that Australia's Macquarie MQG.AX was in talks to buy boutique London-based broker, Liberum, in a bid to strengthen its UK equities business as MiFID II forces it to pay for research.  German private bank Berenberg has laid off staff in its equities business amid pressure from MiFID II, the Financial Times reported last month.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the mass cull I\u2019d expected.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  NEW YORK\/LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Steve Schwarzman has one big regret. In 1994 the Blackstone boss sold a stake in some funds that later became BlackRock, the $7 trillion asset manager run by Larry Fink. Schwarzman describes the sale as \u201ca heroic mistake.\u201d It\u2019s not too late to fix it.  Yet he might not be alone in coveting the investment manager. The stability of BlackRock\u2019s earnings has won it the respect from investors that its Wall Street peers, such as Goldman Sachs, covet. It fetches 16 times the next 12 months\u2019 forecast earnings, according to Refinitiv, compared to 9 times for the investment bank and money manager helmed by David Solomon.  Today, BlackRock serves opposite ends of the market from Blackstone and Goldman Sachs. Fink\u2019s company houses two-thirds of its assets in exchange-traded and passively managed index funds. Blackstone\u2019s $545 billion of private equity, real estate and other investments, managed for wealthy clients and institutions, are active. Ditto most of the $1.5 trillion Goldman oversees.  Yet all are hungrily eyeing the middle. BlackRock\u2019s fees from easy-to-trade products are under pressure amid tough competition, so Fink is growing alternative investments like private equity. Blackstone is eyeing more retail money \u2013 so it\u2019s perhaps no wonder Schwarzman says he often pictures the two together. As for Goldman, it\u2019s somewhere in between but looking to grow at both ends, having entered consumer financial services with its Marcus electronic bank and Apple credit card.  Valuation has always been the obstacle, though needn\u2019t be for much longer. Blackstone\u2019s shares had risen around 85% in 2019 by mid-December, helped by a restructuring that let passive funds like BlackRock\u2019s buy shares. The $63 billion buyout firm even trades at a higher multiple of 2020 earnings, after a decade of trading at a discount. Goldman is only a couple of billion dollars larger than BlackRock, which was worth $78 billion in mid-December. Mathematically, a merger of equals is doable.  Fink has little reason to contemplate such a deal for now. But at 67, and an oft-cited contender to lead the Treasury under a Democratic president, succession is a live topic.

FILE PHOTO: The Carige bank logo is seen in Rome, Italy, April 16, 2016. REUTERS\/Stefano Rellandini\/File Photo  Temporary administrators appointed by the European Central Bank to run Carige are trying to find a buyer for Italy\u2019s 10th-largest bank by mid-May, after its top shareholder derailed an industry-financed rescue by blocking a 400 million euro cash call in December.  A specialist fund run by BlackRock is the only known potential bidder although Italy\u2019s government stands ready to step in should a private buyer fail to clinch a deal.  The government, which in 2017 took over Italy\u2019s then third-largest bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares by the end of September under emergency measures approved at the start of the year.  Reporting a 273 million euro loss for 2018 due to the amount of bad loans it held, the Genoa-based lender said in February it needed to fill a 630 million euro capital shortfall.  Its cash needs could now swell further as the potential buyer looks to build a capital buffer to hedge against possible setbacks in the restructuring process, a third source said.  A fourth source said BlackRock wanted to avoid potential future capital shortfalls in light of some guidelines set by the ECB in relation to Carige.  Both the ECB and BlackRock declined to comment.  The BlackRock fund, which is advised by Mediobanca, is in talks with the Italian lenders who came to Carige\u2019s rescue in November by buying a 320 million euro hybrid bond issued by bank to boost its total capital ratio.  A conversion of that bond into equity to reduce the investment required by the BlackRock fund was discussed at a meeting among Italian banks on Wednesday.  The conversion appears likely to take place although no final decision has yet been taken, according to the head of a depositor guarantee fund which bought the Carige bond on behalf of banks.","250":"FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016.

FILE PHOTO: Larry Fink, Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock, stands at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  The warning is the first time BlackRock has publicly sought the release of so-called Scope 3 emissions data, part of its plans to hold companies more to account over climate change.  Scope 3 refers to emissions generated by a company\u2019s products or services, rather than just its own operations. For an oil company, for example, this would include the emissions created when its gasoline is used in a car.  The news comes weeks after BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink made climate central to his annual letter to company CEOs, and follows a December move to scale up the number of companies it talks to on the issue.  That more than doubled the number of heavy-emitting companies facing intensive talks to 1,000, although not all would face a vote against directors in the current season of shareholder meetings, with votes dependent on specific circumstances.  \u201cWhere corporate disclosures are insufficient to make a thorough assessment, or a company has not provided a credible plan ... we may vote against the directors we consider responsible for climate risk oversight,\u201d BlackRock said.  \u201cWe may also support shareholder proposals that we believe address gaps in a company\u2019s approach to climate risk and the energy transition,\u201d it said.  BlackRock has been criticised by activists for not ensuring change happens more quickly, particularly given it is often a major shareholder or even the biggest in firms it invests in.  Katrin Ganswindt, a campaigner with environmental group Urgewald, said BlackRock should ditch holdings in companies that did not comply with its demands over emissions.  \u201cPotentially voting against boards is an important way for the world\u2019s largest asset manager to take its massive responsibility seriously. However, without the actual threat of exclusion, this policy update remains yet another paper tiger,\u201d she said.  BlackRock has previously told companies it wants to see their plans for prospering in a low-carbon economy, but the latest missive provides more detail about what that entails.  On target-setting, it wants to see shorter-term goals over the next five years and medium-term targets over 10 years to ensure companies\u2019 longer-term plans are solid.  It also wants decision-makers to be well-versed on climate.  \u201cWe expect directors to have sufficient fluency in climate risk and the energy transition to enable the whole board \u2013 rather than a single director who is a \u2018climate expert\u2019 \u2013 to provide appropriate oversight of the company\u2019s plan and targets,\u201d BlackRock said.","253":"LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors are shoring up portfolios against economic downturn, with plans to cut allocation to publicly listed equities in 2019 in favor of assets such as private equity and real estate, according to the results of a BlackRock survey.  FILE PHOTO: A trader looks at price monitors as he works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Over half the 230 institutions managing $7 trillion of inevitable assets surveyed by BlackRock plan to decrease allocation to public equities this year, up from 35 percent in 2018, the survey, released on Monday, showed.  Global stocks suffered their worst year in over a decade in 2018, with trepidation surrounding economic slowdown, trade tension and rising interest rates infecting the market in the second half of the year. Markets have been similarly volatile at the start of 2019.  Equities appear to be especially in disfavor in the United States and Canada, with 68 percent of investors there planning to reduce allocations, versus 27 percent in continental Europe, the survey showed.  Underpinning this rebalancing is concern that the economic cycle is turning, as cited by 56 percent of clients.  While strong economic data in the United States and a dovish message from U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Friday have helped to alleviate some worries, the U.S. and Canada-based investors were most concerned about rising U.S. interest rates, BlackRock said.  This represented just over half of those surveyed (52 percent), while geopolitical instability and trade tensions were citied as bigger concerns by European and Asian accounts.  BlackRock said private assets and fixed income are likely to be the main beneficiaries of the shift in sentiment in 2019, as investors search for uncorrelated sources of returns.  As such, 54 percent of those surveyed intend to increase exposure to real assets, 47 percent planned to boost private equity allocations and 40 percent chose real estate.  Flows to fixed income are expected to increase to 38 percent, from 29 percent a year earlier. Within this asset class, private credit is set to benefit -- 56 percent of those surveyed globally planned to increase allocations to the sector.  Cash too will be a key part of portfolios though BlackRock highlighted regional differences. Of Asia-Pacific accounts, 33 percent planned to increase cash holdings while 27 percent of continental European accounts aimed to decrease cash.  bit.ly\/2F9mUCh","254":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will watch next week's earnings from BlackRock BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, for a snapshot of how the industry performed during the second quarter's dramatic rebound in global financial markets.  FILE PHOTO: The Fearless Girl statue is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., June 11, 2020. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Most expect numbers from industry bellwether BlackRock and other asset managers to reflect the sharp stock market rebound. The S&P 500 .SPX rose 20% in the second quarter after falling as much in the first three months of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the economy.  Since the performance of asset managers tends to be tied to how markets fare, investors see a range of risks ahead, including further acceleration of U.S. coronavirus cases and potential market volatility around the Nov. 3 presidential election.  Still, \u201cjust on a market level, the asset managers are inmuch better shape coming out of the second quarter than theywere coming out of the first quarter,\u201d said Macrae Sykes, global financial services sector analyst at Gabelli Funds.  BlackRock is scheduled to report on July 17, with T. Rowe Price TROW.O, WisdomTree Investments WETF.O and Invesco IVZ.N among asset managers reporting in the following weeks.  Analysts expect a strong recovery in the sector\u2019s assets under management (AUM) in the second quarter, driven by rising financial markets and improving risk appetite. Higher levels of AUM mean more fees and stronger margins and earnings, analysts said.  BlackRock\u2019s assets fell to $6.47 trillion at the end of the first-quarter, from $7.43 trillion at the end of 2019.  (GRAPHIC: BlackRock's stock performance - )  Improving fund flows are also likely to help second-quarter earnings for the group, analysts said. Fixed income flows reversed back into positive territory in April and stayed that way throughout the quarter while equity flows improved from March lows, according to Jefferies.  Analysts at Morgan Stanley recently raised their estimate for second-quarter earnings-per-share for traditional asset managers by 19%.  Most analysts expect BlackRock to show robust flows into its $2 trillion exchange-traded funds business, with strength in the fixed income and alternatives ETFs offsetting outflows from equities.  Investors will also look for details on BlackRock\u2019s role in the Federal Reserve\u2019s debt-buying efforts as the central bank sought to stabilize a corporate bond market roiled by economic fallout of the pandemic.  The firm\u2019s own ETFs accounted for a large share of corporate bond ETFs it bought on behalf of the Fed as part of the central bank\u2019s relief program. BlackRock waived asset management fees on ETFs purchased on behalf of the Fed.  BlackRock's shares are up about 9% year-to-date, outperforming a 3% decline in the S&P 500. The broader sector has not fared as well, with the Refinitiv U.S. Investment Management & Fund Operators Price Return Index .TRXFLDUSPINVM is down about 13% for the year.  Some investors worry asset managers could take a hit if a resurgent pandemic forces parts of the United States to halt or reverse the reopening of their economies.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs last week said the U.S. economy would shrink by 4.6% in 2020, from an earlier forecast of a 4.2% contraction.  \u201cWe remain cautious with equity markets nearing post Covid-outbreak highs amid risk of a market correction should a second coronavirus wave impede the pace of the global economic recovery,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients about the sector.  The U.S. presidential election could also heighten market volatility. A victory by Democratic challenger Joe Biden could threaten Republican policies championed by President Donald Trump and generally favored by Wall Street, including lower corporate tax rates and fewer regulations, analysts said.  A separate indication of the financial industry's health may come next week from several big Wall Street banks set to report earnings, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N.","255":"* Top CEOs exit event amid concerns over journalist  * JPMorgan, Ford also withdraw from event  * Saudi Arabia warns against threats to punish it (Adds Blackstone withdrawal)  LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink and Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman will no will no longer attend a high profile conference in Saudi Arabia, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, becoming the latest senior executives to withdraw amid concerns about a missing journalist.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Fink was awarded $27.7 million in compensation last year, compared to $25.5 million in 2016, based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.  But BlackRock said it raised Fink\u2019s pay for the year by 9.6 percent to $27.9 million, according to a set of calculations it prefers. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year.  The company\u2019s president, Rob Kapito, was paid nearly $22 million, according to figures based on regulatory guidelines. Kapito and Fink were among BlackRock\u2019s founders in 1988.  BlackRock also rolled out in late 2017 multi-million-dollar stock options to a small group of Fink\u2019s and Kapito\u2019s deputies to keep them on board and for succession planning.

New York-based BlackRock\u2019s net income grew by nearly 58 percent in 2017 to $5 billion while the assets overseen by the company topped $6 trillion, an industry record and 22 percent gain over the year prior.  In its most recent quarter, BlackRock, which manages the iShares-brand exchange-traded funds, generated higher profit by luring more money from investors even as stock and bond markets stumbled.

His pay is among the richest among U.S. financial firms, according to Thomson Reuters data covering listed corporations, and the company\u2019s pay to executive officers has drawn criticism from proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co LLC.

The firm could roll it out further depending on the success of the trial, the person added.  The initiative comes at a time of unprecedented change for the industry, as tougher regulations and a squeeze on fees pressure money managers to stand out from rivals.  But it also shows big asset managers such as BlackRock continue to invest in optimizing human performance, despite the growing popularity of \u2018passive\u2019 investing, which is based on index-tracking, with minimum buying and selling.  But while BlackRock stresses the prime motivation is promoting wellness, not everyone might welcome a scheme that collects employees\u2019 personal data, especially in an industry where performance is already meticulously tracked.  BlackRock money managers currently use a system called \u2018Aladdin\u2019 which provides the risk-management and trading tools as well as analytics to help them make investment decisions.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Over the course of a handful of days in mid-September, cash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up, and interest rates in U.S. money markets shot up to as high as 10% for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed\u2019s rate.  While jarring, the outcome of the event - with the Fed now providing billions of dollars in daily cash injections and building back up its stash of bonds through $60 billion a month of Treasury bill purchases - has reassured Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock Inc BLK.N, that the U.S. central bank is back in the business of providing sorely needed liquidity.  The \u201cfunding scare was a seminal moment,\u201d Rieder said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit.  The Fed\u2019s actions - in tandem with three interest rate cuts since July - have helped steepen the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which had dropped into so-called inversion over the summer. An inverted yield curve, when yields on shorter-duration bonds are higher than those for longer-dated maturities, is a classic signal of approaching economic recession.  Since then, for instance, the spread between yields on 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes has climbed by nearly 30 basis points, from around negative 5 to around positive 25 now. That relieves pressure on banks whose margins had become compressed and lowers the risk of wider weakness in the economy and financial markets more broadly, he said.  On top of that, U.S. stocks are back at record highs.  \u201cAdding liquidity to the system is incredibly powerful,\u201d Rieder said.  Moreover, Rieder said there is a reasonable chance the Fed will opt to remain in the balance sheet expansion business for longer than currently expected. At the moment, the Fed has signaled its plan is to buy $60 billion in bills a month through at least the first quarter of next year.  But with its roughly $4 trillion balance sheet amounting to less than 20% of U.S. gross domestic product, the Fed has much more room to continue building its asset portfolio than its main counterparts in Europe and Japan, Rieder said. The European Central Bank\u2019s asset holdings are the equivalent of nearly 40% of the trading bloc\u2019s GDP, while the Bank of Japan\u2019s are more than 100% of that economy\u2019s annual output.  Meanwhile, Rieder said the Fed is done cutting rates after having delivered three reductions since July. The Fed\u2019s targeted overnight rate now stands at 1.50-1.75%, down from 2.25-2.50% at mid-year.  That said, they are not going to reverse those cuts any time soon, according to Rieder.  \u201cI don\u2019t think the Fed\u2019s going to raise rates for a long time, and they\u2019re going to let inflation run hot.\u201d","266":"FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above its building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Board building on Constitution Avenue is pictured in Washington, U.S., March 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Leah Millis\/File Photo  Over the past week, the central bank has released a volley of measures to boost liquidity in the financial markets and get cash into the hands of small businesses and consumers amid growing worries the coronavirus outbreak would wreak economic havoc across the country.  As part of that program, the Fed has committed to purchasing billion of dollars of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) secured primarily by multifamily home mortgages guaranteed by housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The New York Fed said in a statement on Tuesday it had retained BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory to purchase the assets on the Fed\u2019s behalf from primary dealers in the market.  \u201cBlackRock was selected on a short-term basis to serve as an investment manager after considering their expertise in trading and analyzing agency CMBS in the secondary market, and robust operational and technological capabilities,\u201d the Fed said.  BlackRock said it would release more details on the terms and conditions of the purchasing program in due course and would not discuss any purchases with dealers until then.  Earlier on Tuesday, the Fed also told large banks it still expected them to submit the capital plans for the central bank\u2019s annual stress tests by the original April 6 deadline,  In said those plans will be used to \u201cmonitor how firms are managing their capital in the current environment.\u201d  At the same time, the Fed said it will give banks more time to address non-critical examiner issues and will temporarily reduce examination activities at banks.

I think they\u2019re going to stand pretty firm.\u201d  The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods.  U.S. President Donald Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports into the United States if Beijing fails to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to Chinese trade, technology transfer and industrial subsidy policies.  In a tweet on Thursday Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade and North Korea and that the two planned to meet at the G20 summit in Argentina which starts at the end of this month.  Fink said he had traveled to China in recent weeks and defined a \u201cfull-fledged trade war\u201d as meaning U.S. levies on all Chinese imports.  He said China will likely not buy more U.S. Treasuries as the trade war goes on. That would put pressure on Washington, which has financed its growing debt by selling bonds, often to China and other foreign governments.  Just days after a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Fink said his company has privately engaged with gun makers on how they plan to respond to the social backlash from mass shootings.  BlackRock is the largest shareholder in several gun makers through its massive index funds, which generally hold shares in all companies in a certain index.  Fink in January wrote a letter to corporate executives saying that companies need to show how they make \u201ca positive contribution to society\u201d in addition to delivering financial performance, as his company faces such demands from shareholders and customers.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Betting against a near-term recession or further cuts in interest rates, BlackRock\u2019s chief investment officer for global fixed income Rick Rieder is selling U.S. corporate debt and buying agency mortgage-backed securities.  Rieder, whose business represents $2.3 trillion of the $7 trillion BlackRock has under management, said at the Reuters Investment Outlook 2020 Summit that he believed the Federal Reserve had stopped its rate-cutting cycle for now. While the manufacturing sector has been hit by the ongoing trade war with China, its contribution to U.S. gross domestic product has fallen dramatically in recent years.  He was the third speaker at the November 2019 Reuters Summit to cite the opportunities available in the mortgage market. Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at PIMCO, said that mortgage-backed securities were creating today\u2019s best investment opportunities.  As the Fed cut interest rates three times this year, the interest rate on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has fallen by more than a full percentage point. That has driven a wave of refinancing that helped cheapen mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie.  Andrew Hsu, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital, cited the opportunity in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). But Hsu was interested in CMBS in particular, because he believed that commercial borrowers were less likely to refinance their mortgages in a low-rate environment.  Rieder, however, believes pre-payment speeds will remain moderate. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these interest-rate levels and we think you\u2019re not going to see a pre-payment acceleration.\u201d What\u2019s more, he said he expects interest-rate volatility to remain low, which would benefit the mortgage market.  Rieder also cited the growing demand from banks for mortgage-backed products, like JPMorgan JPM.N which reported significant growth in its securities business in the third quarter. Global banks earned $1 billion from trading agency MBS in the first half of 2019, a fivefold increase on last year for what industry sources say is the fastest growing revenue source in investment banking.  Finally, Rieder said that spreads in investment-grade credit were no longer interesting, and liquidity in the market was thinner than that in the mortgage market. \u201cIn a world of uncertainty, I\u2019d rather take more liquidity and a bigger buyer base.\u201d","288":"FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016.

However, the major Ad Hoc and Exchange bondholder groups, which combined hold around $21 billion of the total eligible debt and in theory could block any deal, have notably held off from supporting or rejecting the proposal.  Argentina\u2019s negotiations with creditors had stalled in June after edging close to an agreement, with the main issues being with the two groups, which slammed the talks as having failed and later criticized the government for a lack of engagement.

BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and Fink is widely followed by investors, traders and economists for his views on financial markets and the global economy.  \u201cEuropean equities trade at multiple points below the U.S. because they don\u2019t have an equity culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a big believer that Europe needs to find ways to have the Europeans focusing on investing for the long term through equities.\u201d  German news magazine Der Spiegel cited central bank sources on Friday as saying ECB President Mario Draghi planned to restart purchases of government bonds by November to support the fragile euro zone economy.  The magazine also said Draghi hoped the move would encourage companies to invest more and consumers to spend more.

Assets had dipped below $6 trillion amid market turmoil late last year.  Total quarterly net inflows across all product types jumped 13.6 percent to $64.67 billion from a year earlier.  Overall, the company sold $59 billion in stock, bond and other \u201clong-term\u201d investment funds, up from the $43.6 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

The benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which sank 14 percent in the final three months of 2018, rebounded by 13 percent in the first quarter, its best performance since the third quarter of 2009.  BlackRock lost more than $26 billion in its equity portfolio during the first quarter, but this was more than offset by a jump in fixed income of nearly $80 billion. Long-term investments rose by $59 billion.  \u201cInvestment flows look stronger than we anticipated,\u201d said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones.  \u201cBlackRock has a really strong reputation in fixed income management and it looks like that asset class came back into favor with interest rates kind of dipping lower. I think that drove better-than-expected asset flows,\u201d said Sanders.  Institutional fund net inflows grew nearly nine-fold to $29.12 billion from a year ago.  Net income attributable to BlackRock fell to $1.05 billion, or $6.61 per share, in the first quarter, from $1.09 billion, or $6.68 per share, a year earlier. That well exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations for a profit of $6.13 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  BlackRock said its iShares-branded ETFs took in $30.69 billion of new money, compared with $81.40 billion in the fourth quarter.  Revenue from technology services, a key area of focus for BlackRock, grew 11 percent to $204 million.  Still, the company continued to feel the pinch from fee pressures amid an ongoing industry-wide shift from high-fee actively managed mutual funds to low-fee passive-investment products.  Base fees dropped 5% year-over-year, mainly due to the negative markets in the fourth quarter and a stronger U.S. dollar that eroded the fees they collect, BlackRock said.  \u201cI think it was pretty well known that fees would be down, not just for BlackRock but for any asset manager just because those are based on an average of market values throughout the quarter and we started the quarter at such a low point,\u201d said Edward Jones\u2019 Sanders.","298":"(Reuters) - PNC Financial Services Group Inc PNC.N plans to sell its entire 22% stake in the world's largest asset manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the U.S. bank said on Monday, exiting one its most attractive investments after more than two decades.

Moelis, which has advised activist investors in the past, does not work with activists anymore, following other banks seeking to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.  The Moelis hires come as investors, including many hedge funds, are prodding corporations to shake up their businesses by spinning off units, buying back their own stock and sometimes overhauling management and boards of directors.  To defend against hedge funds such as Trian Fund Management and Third Point LLC, investment banks have been adding to their defense teams to offer corporate America more expertise on how to evaluate governance, executive compensation and other issues where they may be vulnerable.

BlackRock, which oversees nearly $6 trillion in assets, also planned to commit 5 percent of the net revenue from its management fee on the BlackRock Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund, or LEAF, to purchase carbon offsets. Money from carbon offsets generally funds projects that reduce emissions, such as planting trees or trapping methane emissions from waste dumps in developing countries.  Money-market funds invest in relatively safe short-term government or high-quality corporate-issued debt. Companies and investors treat the funds like cash and expect them to hold their value, earn income and be available at a moment\u2019s notice. It is rare for environmental factors to be taken into account as part of the investment strategy. In a statement, BlackRock said it would also make an annual payment to help the World Wildlife Fund, a conservation group.  BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink has been under increasing pressure by activist groups to address the perceived social and environmental shortcomings of companies held by his funds.  Because the company\u2019s most popular products are index funds that hold broad swaths of the market, BlackRock has a significant stake in publicly traded companies worldwide that draw ire from investors, including alcohol, tobacco and weapons manufacturers as well as fossil-fuel companies. BlackRock also has a pivotal shareholder vote in corporate-governance matters involving those companies.  Last week, a hoax letter purporting to be from Fink claimed the fund manager would require companies it owns to align their businesses with measures to counter climate change. An advocacy group took credit for the fake letter.  BlackRock has not asked companies to meet specific environmental standards, saying its role is not to make political judgments on its clients\u2019 behalf.  But it has pressed oil-and-gas companies including Exxon Mobil Corp to provide more information about how environmental regulations and related issues could affect their bottom lines.

It also made explicit its call for companies to lay out plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.  \u201cWe will step up our engagement efforts with this universe and consider accelerated voting actions should the substance of companies\u2019 climate-related commitments and disclosures not meet our expectations,\u201d the company said.  The changes come at a time of rising pressure on companies to help address environmental and social problems. New York-based BlackRock said performing well on such sustainability measures can help companies improve long-term returns.  After a year marked by growing concern over the lobbying activities of some companies, particularly around climate, BlackRock also said it would look for companies to align their lobbying activities with their public statements.  It also called for them to make their boards more diverse.  In addition, the money manager said it would be more likely to support some climate-related shareholder proposals than in the past - a sore point with many climate activists.  In a report on Thursday, the company said it had increased its support for climate- and social-related shareholder proposals since July 1, backing 11 out of 22.  \u201cWe\u2019ve really intensified our engagement approach,\u201d said London-based Sandy Boss, the asset manager\u2019s top stewardship executive, who joined in April. She cited the example of Spanish airports operator Aena, where BlackRock backed a shareholder resolution calling for an annual vote on its climate plans.","309":"MILAN (Reuters) - Rome\u2019s fragile government battled to avoid another costly bank bailout on Thursday after U.S. fund manager BlackRock ditched a proposed rescue of Italy\u2019s Carige.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Carige bank is seen in Rome, Italy, April 9 2016. REUTERS\/Alessandro Bianchi\/File Photo  BlackRock and Carige gave no reason for the decision, which highlights investor concerns about Italy\u2019s uncertain political environment as time runs out for the troubled bank.  Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said he was confident a market solution could still be found, telling reporters in Rome that the bank\u2019s commissioners were seeking an alternative investor and that the work done so far would not be wasted.  Political infighting and the fact it was unable to keep its stake below 25 percent were among the factors that persuaded BlackRock to back out, a source familiar with the matter said.  Under the plan, based on a 720 million euro ($806 million) capital injection, Italian banks were set to take up some of Carige\u2019s shares by converting a bond into equity. But without more investors, BlackRock\u2019s stake would have exceeded a quarter.  The rescue aimed to help the state avoid its fourth major bank bailout in two years. The government has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares if it cannot find investors.  A state bail-out would potentially embarrass the ruling parties, the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which both attacked previous governments over the use of public funds to save ailing banks.  OTHER SOLUTIONS  Carige, which has been put under special administration by the European Central Bank, said it was looking at other market solutions to its capital shortfall after BlackRock\u2019s move but said it could also seek government financial aid.  \u201cWe will evaluate other market solutions aimed at ensuring the stability and turnaround of Banca Carige,\u201d it said in a statement, adding it could still make a \u201crequest for a precautionary recapitalisation to the economy ministry.\u201d  The ECB, which sources have said has set a mid-May deadline for investors to submit binding bids for Carige, said on Thursday it had been informed of developments and was in contact with Carige\u2019s temporary administrators.  Carige has been laid low by years of mismanagement and an excessive exposure to the depressed economy of Italy\u2019s northwestern Liguria region.  Italian bond yields have risen in recent days on concerns over tension within Rome\u2019s ruling coalition, with the gap between its benchmark bond yields and safer German Bunds increasing on Wednesday to the widest in more than two months.  In another sign of jitters about political risk and a weak economy, Italy\u2019s biggest bank by assets UniCredit said this week it would reduce government bond holdings.  But UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier said on Thursday the bank remained strongly committed to the euro zone\u2019s third largest economy.","310":"FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: The BlackRock logo is seen outside of its offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, is in talks with Intesa\u2019s executives and is hoping to secure control of the stake in order to play a bigger role in Eurizon\u2019s operations and its IT management, one of the sources said.  \u201cBlackRock is the natural buyer for Eurizon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will take a stake and use it as a Trojan horse to plug in their IT systems and control the operational side of the business.\u201d  The source said BlackRock sees the deal as a strategic stake acquisition rather than a passive investment.  BlackRock and Intesa declined to comment.  Being a leader in technology and integrating its global satellites onto its operating system Aladdin are key priorities for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.  The company recently pulled out of a joint venture agreement in India because it couldn\u2019t deploy its own technology and much of its Investor Day earlier this month was focused on tech initiatives across its business.  Intesa has been working with UBS to review strategic options for Eurizon for several months, the sources said.  The Italian lender wants to retain control of the unit, which has 315 billion euros in assets under management and operates in Italy as well as Eastern Europe and Asia.  It would sell no more than 30 percent of Eurizon, two separate sources said.  Intesa has said it would like a deal with a global asset manager to pave the way for other accords with smaller or same-size partners. If BlackRock takes the entire 30 percent stake which is up for sale, such deals could only translate into commercial partnerships.  Yet BlackRock is expected to push for immediate control of the 30 percent stake, one of the sources said.  In unveiling a new four-year business plan in February, Intesa said it aimed to strike an asset management partnership. Boss Carlo Messina said it made sense to act quickly and reach an accord this year.  Speaking in Venice on June 15, however, Messina said the bank was still in the early stages of looking for an investor in its asset management business and was talking to several potential partners.  For Intesa the transaction would help drive growth at Eurizon, which is already one of the most efficient asset managers in Europe with a cost-income ratio of 20 percent.  \u201cSize will matter more and more,\u201d Eurizon CEO Tommaso Corcos said in a press interview in March.  With a business model driven by revenues from its insurance and asset management arms, Intesa is targeting 10 billion euros in fees in 2021, accounting for 48 percent of its total operating income, up from 45 percent in 2017.  The bank has so far been focused on cutting its problematic debt, reaching a deal in April with Swedish debt collector Intrum Justitia INTR.ST to cut soured loans below 10 percent of total lending.","313":"LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink will no longer attend a high profile conference in Saudi Arabia, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, becoming the latest senior executive to withdraw amid concerns about a missing journalist.

FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above their building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. To match Special Report USA-FUNDS\/INDEX REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The New York-based asset manager has stressed the importance of the societal issues known as ESG, like climate change and workforce diversity, that are popular with younger investors. So far BlackRock has resisted steps sought by critics, such as giving more details of its talks with oil company executives or backing many shareholder resolutions.  But that may be changing as BlackRock prepares for the 2020 proxy season in the spring, said several people who have spoken with BlackRock BLK.N executives and hinted at by the company itself.  In a statement emailed by a spokesman BlackRock said that \u201cWe share the concern about climate risk and its impact on shareholder value for all companies. Indeed, we believe evidence of the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios is building rapidly and we are accelerating our engagement with companies on this critical issue.\u201d  The spokesman, Ed Sweeney, did not provide more details.  Moira Birss, a director of Amazon Watch, which advocates for indigenous peoples and rainforest conservation, said she expects BlackRock may change its engagements with agribusinesses based on recent conversations she held with BlackRock executives.  \u201cIt\u2019s a positive sign that BlackRock is willing to directly engage with us,\u201d although it remains to be seen if satisfactory changes result, she said.  Tim Smith of ESG-focussed money manager Boston Trust Walden, who often talks with BlackRock executives, said he expects them to press corporations harder in the coming year to adopt climate-impact reporting guidance. He said BlackRock executives seem more receptive to climate and other concerns heading into 2020, as competing asset managers take more aggressive stands on environmental matters.  \u201cThey need to pay attention to this issue, especially if they lose business because of it,\u201d he said.  Activists say they will be watching for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to outline some new approaches in his annual letter due in January.  Most big fund firms face similar calls to become more active on ESG matters, which they must balance against other client priorities like performance. BlackRock draws the most attention because of its $7 trillion in assets and because it rarely challenges management, even at poor performers, as a Reuters analysis found.  BlackRock says it lobbies effectively behind closed doors. Previously, BlackRock has made targeted changes like encouraging boards to have at least two women and urging companies to report according to the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.  Critics say the quiet approach undercuts pressure from other shareholders. Cliff Weight, director at ShareSoc, the UK Individual Shareholder Society, said BlackRock could still give more details around its talks with companies.  Of BlackRock\u2019s current disclosures about its engagements, Weight said, \u201cWe question whether this is a marketing exercise\u201d meant to impress clients.  BlackRock also faces pressure from some public pension funds that have taken a harder look at the ESG practices of fund managers handling their money. Seattle public employee pension officials say they continue to monitor BlackRock\u2019s interactions with companies whose shares it owns.  The chief investment officer of Japan\u2019s big Government Pension Investment Fund, Hiro Mizuno, has urged asset managers to incorporate ESG into their investment processes.  Annual reports of the Japanese fund show BlackRock managed 2.7 trillion yen ($25 billion) in foreign equities passive money as of March, almost half as much as a year earlier. A fund spokeswoman declined to discuss the change and noted that factors like fees also weigh on allocation shifts.  BlackRock has given little indication a deep stewardship overhaul is in store, though it has cast a number of high-profile critical votes. One came May 29 against Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N presiding director Steven Reinemund, BlackRock fund disclosures show.  Asked about the vote, an Exxon spokeswoman said, \u201cWe welcome and value input from all shareholders.\u201d  BlackRock did not explain the vote or say if Exxon was the U.S.-based global energy company of which BlackRock reported it opposed a director due to \u201clack of progress on climate-related disclosure.\u201d","316":"Nov 25 (Reuters) - Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA:  * SAID ON FRIDAY BLACKROCK,INC NOTIFIED JERONIMO MARTINS THAT IT NOW HOLDS 2.02% VOTING RIGHTS IN THE COMPANY  Source text: bit.ly\/2KREHij  Further company coverage: (Gdansk Newsroom)","317":"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian investment bank Banco BTG Pactual SA tapped a veteran BlackRock Inc portfolio manager as its new head of equity funds and said it plans to launch a new Latin America-focused fund.

BlackRock is the world\u2019s largest asset manager, and Fink is widely followed by investors, traders and economists for his views on financial markets and the global economy.  \u201cEuropean equities trade at multiple points below the U.S. because they don\u2019t have an equity culture,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a big believer that Europe needs to find ways to have the Europeans focusing on investing for the long term through equities.\u201d  German news magazine Der Spiegel cited central bank sources on Friday as saying ECB President Mario Draghi planned to restart purchases of government bonds by November to support the fragile euro zone economy.  The magazine also said Draghi hoped the move would encourage companies to invest more and consumers to spend more.  Fink said loose monetary policy has been most effective in the United States because of Americans\u2019 longstanding embrace of equities and their exposure to that market.  \u201cIt makes sense in the U.S. economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes much less sense in economies where most of the pool of assets of individuals are sitting in a bank account.

U.S. stocks have appreciated sharply in recent years, thanks in part to steps the U.S. Federal Reserve took to resuscitate the U.S. economy after the financial crises of 2007-09, but worries abound that investors may be in a late-cycle environment, BlackRock strategists said.  Indeed, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index has gained about 16 percent in 2019 due to monetary and fiscal stimulus efforts in China and signs the U.S. Federal Reserve will delay further rate hikes for the time being.  In general, the recent market gyrations have not spurred financial advisers into action, Patrick Nolan, a senior strategist with BlackRock\u2019s portfolio solutions team, said.  Faced with bouts of volatility, investors can pick from one of three options, Nolan said.  They could treat market gyrations as noise and largely ignore them, Nolan said. Alternatively they could react very strongly and dump risky assets, he said.  The third option is to add more protection in portfolios even as one remains positioned to take part in any gains if markets grind higher, he said.  \u201cIt looks to us like adviser models are still taking option one. We actually think option three might be a better path from here,\u201d said Nolan.  To do this, BlackRock\u2019s head of factor investing, Andrew Ang, favors quality - an approach where the focus is on companies that have a track record of stable earnings, are productive and sport a relatively lower level of debt.  \u201cWhen we take that sort of position we can still participate in the upside for markets but we do that with a more defensive posture,\u201d said Ang.

I think they\u2019re going to stand pretty firm.\u201d  The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods.  U.S. President Donald Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports into the United States if Beijing fails to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to Chinese trade, technology transfer and industrial subsidy policies.  In a tweet on Thursday Trump said he had a \u201cvery good\u201d talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade and North Korea and that the two planned to meet at the G20 summit in Argentina which starts at the end of this month.  Fink said he had traveled to China in recent weeks and defined a \u201cfull-fledged trade war\u201d as meaning U.S. levies on all Chinese imports.  He said China will likely not buy more U.S. Treasuries as the trade war goes on. That would put pressure on Washington, which has financed its growing debt by selling bonds, often to China and other foreign governments.  Just days after a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Fink said his company has privately engaged with gun makers on how they plan to respond to the social backlash from mass shootings.  BlackRock is the largest shareholder in several gun makers through its massive index funds, which generally hold shares in all companies in a certain index.

Both studies - done by climate-focused shareholder organizations - found BlackRock continued to offer little backing to resolutions asking companies for steps like setting emissions targets or lobbying reports.  The findings prompted the organizations to complain that BlackRock hasn\u2019t backed up its vows to prioritize climate matters earlier this year. The studies found BlackRock supported such resolutions around 10% of the time this year, about the same as in 2019.  Other fund firms supported the climate-related resolutions about half the time or more, in keeping with their increased popularity, the studies of dozens of votes said.  Proxy votes have drawn attention in recent years as a point of leverage for investors looking for companies to take more aggressive action on the environment or social issues. But they also can put fund firms in the awkward position of demanding changes at the same companies whose retirement assets they seek to manage.  One more frequent backer of the resolutions was the asset-management arm of JPMorgan which supported them roughly half the time this year according to the separate but similar studies by activist investment firm Boston Trust Walden and by Majority Action, a liberal-leaning shareholder advocacy group.  That was up from JPMorgan\u2019s support rate of just 4% for climate resolutions in 2019 according to Walden.  \u201cI see an asset-management industry that overall is waking up to the substantial level of risk of climate change,\u201d said Eli Kasargod-Staub, Majority Action executive director. He and Walden senior vice-president Tim Smith both said BlackRock\u2019s climate voting record did not match its rhetoric.  \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see their votes remain at this substandard level,\u201d said Smith.  A BlackRock spokesperson said it has spoken more frequently this year with portfolio companies on environmental matters and other issues, voted more frequently against corporate directors and given more details about its stewardship activities. BlackRock also said not all proposals are worth supporting, and that \u201cnot all shareholder proposals are created equal.\u201d  It had previously given statistics showing it took a tougher line in some proxy votes this year, especially at energy companies.]  A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on its proxy votes. In February the company had outlined new initiatives for sustainable investing including more use of data.  The 162 environmental and social proposals voted at shareholder meetings this year at S&P 1500 companies won average support of 27.7% and 18 passed, said proxy solicitor Georgeson, up from 2017 when 211 of them won 20.3% average support and 5 passed.  Business groups - including one led by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon - have supported making the proposals harder to file or resubmit and last November the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 along partisan lines for such changes. A final vote could come Wednesday.  BlackRock, known for its index funds, has taken a neutral stand on the rule changes, unlike some active management firms that oppose them. JPMorgan has not filed comments on the matter.  A BATTLE AT DELTA  Whatever the outcome, BlackRock and some rivals have begun to provide more details about individual votes.  For instance at Delta Air Lines Inc BlackRock voted \u201cagainst\u201d a shareholder resolution calling for a company report on how its lobbying activities match goals to limit rises in global temperatures.  Explaining the vote on its website, BlackRock said it expects Delta will provide more disclosures in any case and noted it is working to reduce its emissions via newer planes and the use of biofuels.  The resolution drew support from 46% of shares cast, including votes from JPMorgan, securities filings show. It would have passed with the support of BlackRock, a 5% holder at the time.","348":"DUBAI (Reuters) - BlackRock's BLK.N Managing Director Amer Bisat said on Wednesday that the world economy could contract by 11% in the first half of 2020 and lose $6 trillion in economic output due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Conservatively, 5 million jobs could be lost in January-June, Bisat told a virtual panel discussion moderated by the Carnegie Middle East Center. The picture looks even worse when under-employment, reduced hours and reduced wages are taken into account, he added.  Asked if the policy reaction so far has been commensurate to the shock, Bisat said: \u201cPolitically, the answer is categorically no.\u201d  But he praised the economic measures taken by governments and central banks.  \u201cJust the announced amount of fiscal stimulus that has been thrown globally at the problem between February and March ... is $5 trillion worth of fiscal inputs that will be thrown over the global economy for the next probably six months or so.  \u201cTo that you add 65 cases of interest rate cuts, you have 20-odd countries that have already announced some form of quantitative easing. How do you translate all this into stimulus?\u201d Bisat said. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but the reality is this is unprecedented.\u201d  RECOVERY  Bisat likened the economic shock from the pandemic to a natural disaster, which he said usually \u201cleads to a strong recovery afterwards\u201d.  The recovery from the coronavirus\u2019s impact \u201cis not likely to be as aggressive\u201d, however, due to uncertainty around when the shock will end, the possibility the virus will re-emerge, and its global nature.  But after the strong policy measures taken and pent-up demand, \u201cthere\u2019s no question in my mind that the recovery will be very, very sharp afterwards.\u201d  \u201cIt will look like a V. The question to me is: will the size of the V be so powerful that it will offset the lost output from the downside? I think the answer is no,\u201d Bisat said, adding he estimated \u201cwe will lose 2 to 3 percentage points of global GDP that we will never see again\u201d.  Speaking about Lebanon, where a financial crisis exacerbated by months of political instability has brought much of the economy to a halt, Bisat said the coronavirus pandemic could push a forecast contraction to \u201chigher double digits\u201d.  He said the country was in urgent need of external financing, adding: \u201cAny international support right now would desperately need the umbrella of the IMF.\u201d","349":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Carige bank is seen in Rome, Italy, April 9 2016.

Duration measures the sensitivity of a bond\u2019s price to changes in interest rates.  Rieder described inflation as \u201caccelerating\u201d following a U.S. Labor Department report that showed consumer prices rose more than expected in January.  The U.S. Federal Reserve could deliver three or four interest rate hikes this year, Rieder said, as it works to head off pressures that could erode the value of the dollar.  The futures market is currently pricing in three increases in the federal funds rate this year.  Rieder has long said the economy is in good shape and ready for more rate hikes even as the Fed fell short of its own inflation target in recent years. He has argued that economic statistics do not fully capture the fact that consumer prices are held in check by new technologies.  Rieder had forecast three or more rate hikes at the beginning of 2017, at the time a minority viewpoint, and he was ultimately vindicated as the Fed raised rates three times last year.  On Wednesday, Rieder said he does not expect that stronger inflation will have \u201cnegative macroeconomic implications.\u201d Investors are currently debating whether tax cuts and a bigger U.S. budget deficit will cause the economy to overheat and force the Fed to hike quickly, hurting markets.

FILE PHOTO: The Carige bank logo is seen in Rome, Italy, April 16, 2016. REUTERS\/Stefano Rellandini\/File Photo  Carige was placed under special administration by the European Central Bank at the start of the year after Italy\u2019s Malacalza family, the lender\u2019s top shareholder, blocked a proposed cash call, derailing an industry-financed rescue.  Italian banks bought a 320 million euro hybrid bond issued by Carige in November to beef up its capital reserves. The investment was carried out through the voluntary-contribution arm of Italy\u2019s FITD depositor protection fund.  Speaking to reporters on Monday after a meeting of the voluntary scheme\u2019s steering committee, FITD chairman Salvatore Maccarone said banks were set to convert 313 million euros worth of the hybrid bond into equity, giving them a roughly 43 percent stake in Carige.  The debt-to-equity conversion is expected to receive final approval at an FITD general meeting on May 14, he said, adding the whole rescue plan, which includes the issue of further additional shares, would then be presented to the European Central Bank on May 17.  \u201cIt\u2019s a deal which we believe will solve (Carige\u2019s) problems once and for all,\u201d Maccarone said.  The exact size of BlackRock\u2019s investment is not yet known but it will cover the remainder of the new share issue apart from a small amount which will be available to current shareholders. BlackRock will take operational control and name a new chief executive, Maccarone said.  The deal needs to be approved by Carige\u2019s shareholders, meaning the position of the Malacalza family, which holds a 27.6 percent stake, will be key.  A shareholder meeting to vote on the plan is expected to take place in June or July, trade union FABI said in a statement after a meeting with the bank\u2019s special administrators.  The union said the cash call should take place after the summer and that no additional job cuts were planned beyond the 1,250 cuts already announced in February.  The family of steel billionaires will see its holding heavily diluted, even if it buys into the portion of the cash call reserved for current shareholders.  The Malacalzas have invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015, although their stake was worth just 23 million euros when the bank was placed under special administration and trading in the stock halted.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The award to the world's biggest asset manager follows a high-profile bidding competition kick-started early this year after Lloyds said it was yanking 109 billion pounds in assets from current manager Standard Life Aberdeen SLA.L.  That surprise move followed the 11 billion pound merger of original manager Aberdeen Asset Management and insurer Standard Life, which Lloyds said made the combined company a material competitor - a charge SLA is currently fighting.  Lloyds on Friday said that it would also look to agree a strategic partnership with BlackRock to collaborate in alternative asset classes, risk management and investment technology.  \u201cBlackRock has been selected following a competitive tender process in which it clearly demonstrated its global market-leading capabilities and deep expertise in the UK market,\u201d Antonio Lorenzo, chief executive of Scottish Widows and group director of insurance & wealth, said in a statement.  Lloyds-owned Scottish Widows and Lloyds\u2019 wealth management division contributed assets to the 109 billion pound mandate with SLA.  \u201cThe partnership will ensure that Scottish Widows and the group can deliver good investment outcomes for its customers over the coming years,\u201d Lorenzo added.  Lloyds said the BlackRock deal would begin after an arbitration process over the SLA contract termination concludes or when the existing contract expires, adding that it is confident in its right to end the SLA deal.  SLA, which is seeking 250 million pounds in compensation, declined to comment.  Lloyds said that, after a review by Scottish Widows and Lloyds\u2019 wealth unit of their asset management arrangements, it is also near to announcing plans for the remaining 80 billion pounds in assets and would update the market in due course.  Lloyds has been using the mandate transfer to leverage partnerships with asset managers towards the aim of growing its presence in the insurance and wealth sector - an ambition that formed a key pillar of its most recent three-year strategy, laid out in February.  Already holding a top share of its core banking markets, a push into other sectors offers Lloyds an opportunity for growth it has exhausted in products such as mortgages.  On Monday it confirmed it was in talks with Schroders SDR.L, one of Britain's biggest listed asset managers, over a potential deal that would could be one of the biggest in wealth management tie-ups in recent years.

(Reporting by Richard Leong Editing by James Dalgleish)","361":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve wants to raise interest rates one to two more times this year and will do so if inflation gathers steam, BlackRock Inc\u2019s Rick Rieder told Reuters this week.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Rieder, who is chief investment officer of global fixed income for the world\u2019s largest fund manager, said markets expect the Fed\u2019s next move on rates will be to cut them. Many investors are predicting a recession by 2020 with limited basis for such a claim, he said in a phone interview on Monday afternoon.  \u201cThe Fed would still like to get a hike or two done,\u201d according to Rieder. \u201cThe markets\u2019 interpretation is a bit extreme.\u201d  Rieder\u2019s views about the Fed and financial markets are widely followed. BlackRock firm managed $5.98 trillion as of the end of 2018, with a third of that in bonds. He also sits on the New York Fed\u2019s Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.  In a sharp reversal of his stance in December, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the Fed has \u201cthe luxury of patience\u201d in deciding whether to raise rates again.  Futures tied to the federal funds rate are currently pricing in a 13 percent chance of one or more cuts by next January, compared to a nearly 8 percent chance of hikes. Traders assign an overwhelming probability that the Fed\u2019s target range will remain 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent.  Rieder has argued since October that the Fed could, should and would pause rate hikes given tame inflation. At the time the view was not common.  Yet the second half of the year often delivers stronger economic data and could open a window for further hikes in time for the Fed\u2019s policy meetings in June, September or December, Rieder said.  The Fed is shrinking its cache of bonds bought after the 2008 financial crisis to spur lending and investment, and central bankers signaled last week that the asset-shedding operation could end sooner than previously thought. The Fed\u2019s balance sheet is down to $4.1 trillion from a peak of $4.5 trillion.  Rieder said the Fed should move to end its reduction of bonds.  \u201cWhile $4 trillion sounds like a very big number, the U.S. economy is a very big number,\u201d said Rieder, given a U.S. economy around $20 trillion in annual gross domestic product. \u201cThey can run a bigger balance sheet and give themselves some flexibility.\u201d  Rieder said he has been buying longer-term bonds, emerging-market debt denominated in local currencies and U.S. investment grade credit. But he said he is avoiding leveraged loans given weaker investor protections, a lower likelihood of rising rates that would boost the loans\u2019 value and the possibility that issuers will not pay on schedule.","362":"ROME, May 9 (Reuters) - Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Thursday he was confident that a market solution can be found for ailing Italian bank Carige even though time is running out.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  Fink is one of several top business executives, including JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s Jamie Dimon and HSBC Holdings plc CEO John Flint, who pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who has been critical of the country\u2019s policies, went missing.  Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, vanished after entering the consulate. Turkish officials say they believe he was murdered there and his body removed, which the Saudis strongly deny.  Asked on CNBC if he would cut off all business ties with Saudi Arabia if it became clear that King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, Fink said, \u201cNo.\u201d  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager with oversight of more than $6.4 trillion in assets, is widely followed by investors and economists for its influence at many of the world\u2019s public companies and it also has a foothold with governments around the globe.  Fink has long had relationships with Saudi officials and one year ago announced plans to open offices within the country. Relationships with the business and investment community are essential to the country\u2019s Vision 2030 push to diversify the economy away from oil. The plan has grabbed attention for its big-ticket initiatives, such as a $500 billion business zone and a plan, now shelved, to sell part of the state oil firm.  But the journalist\u2019s disappearance on Oct. 2 created a complex calculus for BlackRock, whose chief executive has worked to present it as socially conscious.  In a letter to top corporate executives earlier this year, Fink wrote that to \u201cprosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.\u201d  Fink told CNBC he wanted the conference delayed until the end of an investigation into the journalist\u2019s disappearance but that he had not been successful. At that point, he said, he had only one choice and that was to withdraw.  \u201cWe needed to be thoughtful and mindful how to navigate this,\u201d Fink said.  \u201cI wanted to preserve the relationships that we\u2019d worked so long for.\u201d","364":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo and trading information for BlackRock is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 30, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N is planning to raise $3.5 billion for investments in energy infrastructure in what is poised to be its largest alternative investment fund yet, an executive at the world's largest asset manager told Reuters.  The company announced on Wednesday that it has already raised $1.5 billion for the Global Energy and Power Infrastructure Fund III. The private fund will focus on operating infrastructure, such as power plants, pipelines and wind farms, in developed markets, potentially including the United States.  Mark Florian, BlackRock\u2019s global head of its energy and power infrastructure team, said there is growing demand for new infrastructure as countries around the world shift from coal and nuclear power sources to natural gas and renewable energy.  He said large utilities and global energy companies are outsourcing the management and development of infrastructure, creating an opportunity for investment organizations such as his that want to provide capital.  \u201cThe needs are just getting bigger,\u201d Florian said in a telephone interview.  BlackRock, known more for its stock and bond funds, has been building up its infrastructure unit, which it started in 2011. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has told analysts this year that he expects so-called illiquid alternative investments, which include private equity and typically come with higher fees than its other funds, to \u201cbe one of the more significant\u201d drivers for BlackRock\u2019s business over the next few years.  The latest fundraising comes just over a year after BlackRock closed a deal to buy First Reserve Corp\u2019s Energy Infrastructure Funds unit, bringing over some of that company\u2019s existing funds and employees.  Overall, BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion in assets, including $41 billion on the \u201creal assets\u201d team that includes the energy infrastructure business.","365":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BOSTON\/LONDON (Reuters) - Five Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday asked BlackRock Inc BLK.N to justify why it rarely supported shareholder resolutions tied to climate change issues despite its increased focus on the environment this year.  The proxy voting record of the top asset manager is \u201ctroubling and inconsistent,\u201d according to a letter sent to Reuters by the office of U.S. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and signed by four others.  In a statement sent by a spokesman, BlackRock said its work on behalf of clients includes both voting and engagement, or talks with corporate managers. It cited certain negative proxy votes cast this year and noted the company now more often publishes details about votes.  \u201cWe are currently reviewing our engagement priorities and voting guidelines,\u201d BlackRock said.  BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in January had vowed to press companies to do more to combat climate change, underscoring the shifting moods of clients and reflecting new money pouring into sustainable investing strategies.  But a pair of recent studies found that BlackRock supported climate-related proxy resolutions only around 10% of the time this year, in line with its past record. Other companies took a more aggressive tack this year, notably the asset-management arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.JPM.N  Schatz\u2019s letter cited one of those studies and noted how in several cases BlackRock\u2019s support for management was decisive. He also wrote that BlackRock backed nearly all directors at oil, gas and utility companies.  Earlier on Thursday, speaking at an online news conference about efforts to limit climate change, BlackRock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said the company had appointed new leaders to its stewardship team.  \u201cAs a result of our commitment and these changes that were implemented during this transition year, you should certainly expect that our voting engagement outputs in 2021 around climate will look materially different from the past year,\u201d Hildebrand said.","366":"FRANKFURT, March 6 (Reuters) - BlackRock, George Soros and major sovereign wealth funds are among the investors expressing interest in buying stakes in the initial public offering of Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset management arm, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
