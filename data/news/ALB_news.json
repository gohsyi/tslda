The blunt assessment of the company, which supplies the white metal for use in Teslas and other electric vehicles, comes as prices plunge due to oversupply.  Lithium companies have produced far more lithium than the EV industry needs this year, prompting Albemarle Chief Executive Luke Kissam to warn of \u201cchallenging market conditions\u201d on Thursday.  \u201cWe think Albemarle is overvalued,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s Jeffrey Zekauskas said in a note to clients. The bank downgraded Albemarle to \u201cunderweight,\u201d encouraging investors to sell, and cut its price target to $60 per share from $68.  Zekauskas added that the bank believes the multiple the lithium business is trading at - about 13 times earnings - is not sustainable.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle did not respond to requests for comment.  The stock fell 5.3% to $67.58 in late Friday afternoon trading. Shares are down nearly 30% from a high for the year reached last March.  In response to growing shareholder angst, Albemarle earlier this week said it would cut $100 million in costs. The company had already slashed its forecast and pared back expansion projects.  Global trade tensions, slowing growth and the scaling back of Chinese EV subsidies have also undermined lithium demand. Lithium carbonate prices in China - the world\u2019s largest consumer - are down 65% to $8,500 per tonne since the start of 2018, according to data from Benchmark Minerals Intelligence.  A Benchmark global price index is down about 52% in the same time period.  While Albemarle sells much of its lithium on long-term contracts, executives are now renegotiating many of those deals. They have little leverage amidst the price drop.  That\u2019s a key worry for JPMorgan: \u201cThere is too much lithium in the market available at low prices, and the business models of the battery makers are under pressure in using Albemarle material.\u201d  In addition, the global EV sales growth rate has cooled to 20% so far in 2019, compared to a 50% growth rate in 2018, the bank said. That could further pressure prices for the metal.  \u201cAlbemarle contends that current lithium spot prices are a bottom for the industry.

The contract allows Albemarle to produce lithium on land owned by the Chilean government. It requires the company to offer up to 25 percent of its annual production capacity at a discounted price to companies chosen by the government to produce cathode, a critical component of lithium batteries, inside Chile.  Sebastian Sichel, head of Corfo, the government agency that oversees mining concessions in the lithium-rich Salar de Atacama, told reporters on Monday that Albemarle had yet to provide Corfo with the information it needs to determine how much of a discount to apply to the lithium.  \u201cWe are waiting for the company to resolve these pending issues,\u201d Sichel said. \u201cFor now, what we have is slowness in decision-making on the part of the company.\u201d  Albemarle, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, declined to comment.  Local daily La Tercera reported on Sunday that Corfo had raised concerns that the slow response from Albemarle could turn off the three companies seeking to produce cathode in Chile using the discounted lithium.

The high-stakes feud comes as Albemarle pushes to expand production in Chile and take control of Australia\u2019s Greenbushes, the world\u2019s largest lithium mine, to meet an expected tripling in demand for the key battery metal by 2025 as automakers produce more electric vehicles.  Globally, both companies and countries are racing to secure the resources necessary to ramp up EV production, including copper, cobalt and lithium.  Albemarle submitted a report in August 2019 with estimates of its Atacama reserves, documents requested by Reuters under Chile\u2019s Transparency Act show. But when regulators questioned the firm\u2019s methodology, Albemarle declined to provide any more detail.  An attorney for the firm wrote in a December 2019 letter that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules meant Albemarle was \u201cimpeded from providing CCHEN information beyond that already delivered.\u201d  In late August CCHEN rejected that argument, according to the filing seen by Reuters. It said the \u201crequirements of foreign institutions are not enforceable or applicable in Chile.\u201d The regulator has given Albemarle until Sept. 16 to provide the additional data.  The Chilean agency said Albemarle\u2019s initial report did not include baseline data, calculations or models, making it \u201cimpossible\u201d for the regulator to establish how the company had arrived at its resource and reserve estimates.  Albemarle said in a statement sent to Reuters that it had gone above and beyond the regulator\u2019s requirements in its report and had invited CCHEN to its offices to review its \u201cmaterial and supporting documents in detail,\u201d an invitation it said had not been taken up.  \u201cWe do not understand CCHEN\u2019s insistence on this point,\u201d Albemarle said in response to questions from Reuters. \u201cWe believe that it is an artificial conflict whose origin we cannot understand.\u201d  The salt flat, home to both Albemarle and top competitor SQM, lies amid the world\u2019s driest desert and questions remain about lithium mining\u2019s impact on its fragile ecosystem. Carmakers including Volkswagen and Daimler have ratcheted up scrutiny of the region\u2019s miners ahead of the expected spike in demand.  Chilean regulators said last month they were planning a new, comprehensive management plan of the salt flat. Chile\u2019s government has also long promised, but has yet to deliver, a water study of the Atacama basin to ensure sustainability.  Albemarle has emphasized that it cares for the environment and local communities, including in the Atacama.","17":"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) refused to increase the lithium production quota for U.S.-based Albemarle Corp, which had already gotten approval for an increase from a national development agency, a local newspaper said on Saturday.  Following a request from Albemarle \u201cfor an increase of 258,446 metric tons of Metallic Lithium Equivalent ... based on a declared improvement in efficiency of its operations, it was decided that the information provided was not sufficient to justify the increase,\u201d Patricio Aguilera, executive director of CCHEN, said in a story published in the newspaper La Tercera.  Neither CCHEN nor Albemarle were immediately available for comment.  The state Corporation for the Promotion of Production (Corfo) in March had authorized an increased production quota for the company after Albemarle requested an increase to 120,000\/140,000 annual tons of lithium, from the 65,000\/80,000 originally authorized.  As global demand for lithium heats up, Albemarle Corp is investing millions of dollars to engineer specialized types of the light metal for electric car batteries, part of a strategy to remain the niche market\u2019s top producer.  The Chilean state agency that oversees lithium mining in the country\u00b4s Atacama salt flat is expected to decide whether to take Albemarle to arbitration in a contract dispute, an attorney for the agency said.  A lawyer for Corfo said Albemarle has failed to reply to questions about a contract the agency signed with Albemarle in 2016. The agreement grants the miner rights to extract lithium from the Salar, the world\u00b4s richest deposit of the metal.","18":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Guangdong Weihua Corp:  * SAYS IT AND UNIT SIGN LITHIUM SUPPLY CONTRACT WITH ALBEMARLE CORP'S LITHIUM SUBSIDIARY IN CHINA Source text in Chinese: bit.ly\/2HLvHbn Further company coverage: (Reporting by Hong Kong newsroom)","19":"May 10 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp:  * ALBEMARLE CORP CONTINUES TO SEE GLOBAL LITHIUM DEMAND AT OVER 800,000 METRIC TONS IN 2025 - CEO LUKE KISSAM  * ALBEMARLE LITHIUM EXPANSION PLAN NOT ABOUT MARKET SHARE GAIN, AIMED AT MEETING LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMERS - CEO  * ALBEMARLE LITHIUM EXPANSION PROJECTS REMAIN \u201cON TRACK\u201d WITH 2018 SPENDING SEEN AT $550-$675 MILLION - CEO  * ALBEMARLE CONTINUES TO SEE OVERALL 2018 LITHIUM PRICING RISING OVER 2017 BY HIGH SINGLE DIGITS ON PERCENTAGE BASIS - PRESIDENT JOHN MITCHELL  * ALBEMARLE SEEING BATTERY, CATHODE CUSTOMERS PUSHING FOR LONGER SUPPLY CONTRACTS, FROM 3-5 YEARS TO 10 YEARS - PRESIDENT MITCHELL  * ALBEMARLE HAS ALMOST 100 PERCENT OF 2018 LITHIUM VOLUME COMMITTED IN LONG-TERM CONTRACTS - PRESIDENT MITCHELL  * ALBEMARLE CONTINUES TO SEE 2018 LITHIUM ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN AVERAGING +40 PERCENT - CEO Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reporting by Susan Taylor)","20":"SANTIAGO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Chilean government said on Wednesday it would seek international arbitration over what it alleged was the failure of lithium miner Albemarle Corp to adhere to the terms of a contract drawn up in 2016.

Albemarle has an investment-grade credit rating and $1.7 billion in liquidity, potent tools for any large-scale acquisition. Masters said, though, that his top priority was maintaining the company\u2019s dividend.  Lithium is most commonly found in brine and hard rock. Albemarle already operates in Chile\u2019s Atacama desert, the world\u2019s largest source of lithium from brine.  By taking over Greenbushes, Albemarle would gain control over another cheap source of the white metal, and one far closer to Chinese customers than Chilean operations.

Albemarle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Albemarle had previously said it regretted the disagreement, but decried what it considered the \u201csubstantial difference\u201d between the contractual agreement and what Corfo is now demanding.  The contract clause that requires Albemarle to provide the ultralight battery metal at a reduced price is intended to help spur a value-added lithium industry.

Albemarle will take a 50 percent stake in the venture that will own and operate the Wodgina lithium mine in Western Australia and develop a plant producing lithium hydroxide, the two companies said in separate statements released late Wednesday and Thursday.  The move builds on Albemarle\u2019s presence in Australia where it is already a stake holder in the world\u2019s biggest hard rock lithium mine, and comes amid an expected boom in demand for lithium in rechargeable batteries that power everything from cell phones to electric vehicles.  Shares in Mineral Resources, which has been looking for a funding partner, surged by as much as a third on the Australian bourse on Thursday, while Albemarle shares finished flat on Wednesday.  The two companies have signed an exclusivity agreement and aimed to reach a binding agreement by Dec. 14, they said.  Albemarle already has a joint venture with China\u2019s Tianqi Lithium Corp. to develop the Greenbushes mine and processing plant in Western Australia.  However, its main operations are at the Salar de Atacama salt flat in Chile, where the pace of planned expansions has been slowed by regulatory, environmental and potential technical concerns, broker Canaccord said in a note on Thursday.  \u201cTaxation changes in Chile are also reducing investment appeal in that jurisdiction. A pivot out of Chile is, therefore, not surprising,\u201d it said.  Last week, Chilean regulators rejected Albemarle\u2019s plans to expand output from Salar de Atacama after its environmental impact statement was found to lack key information.  Regulators have cracked down on water use in the region, which lies at the heart of the world\u2019s driest desert.  The Mineral Resources tie-up also flags a move by the global battery supply chain towards Australian producers amid a shift to higher energy-density batteries using lithium hydroxide.  Australia\u2019s lithium supply comes from hard rock, which can directly produce hydroxide, while production of hydroxide from Chile\u2019s brines is a more expensive, two-stage process.  Wodgina\u2019s early stage project exports unrefined hard rock ore. The joint venture plans to build a plant to produce up to 750,000 tonnes a year of 6 percent spodumene concentrate to feed a 50,000 tonne a year lithium hydroxide plant.  Albemarle will need to spend another $300 million to $400 million to develop Wodgina, Morningstar said in a report, rating the deal as \u201cvalue neutral\u201d.  A stage two expansion of the plant could see capacity double, depending on market conditions, the companies said.  Mineral Resources shares closed up 27 percent at A$15.76.

U.S.-based Albemarle Corp and Chile\u2019s SQM operate just 3 miles (5 km) apart in the remote Salar, a basin in the Atacama that is home to one of the world\u2019s richest deposits of high-grade lithium. Lithium-ion batteries are key components for most consumer electronics, from cellphones and laptops to electric cars.  In celebrating the new contracts, the two companies said they were confident they could significantly boost output without drawing more than their current quotas of lithium-rich brine, or saltwater, that has for millennia accumulated in pools beneath the Atacama. The rivals said each had all the brine they needed for current and future production.  The Wider Image Take a look at the photo essay on Chile's Atacama  \u201cI don\u2019t see any issue with our ability to get (the brine) ... today, tomorrow and throughout the term of that agreement,\u201d which ends in 2043, Albemarle CEO Luke Kissam told investors in August.  But a Reuters review of filings with Chile\u2019s environmental regulator shows Albemarle striking a different tone, expressing concern about how much brine rival SQM had been drawing and the impact that could have on future production from the area.  The true state of the Salar\u2019s water supply, both fresh and saltwater, has become an obsession of lithium industry watchers because of the area\u2019s huge importance in satisfying soaring global demand for the powdery white metal. The area is the most cost-efficient place in the world to mine the metal, and both SQM and Albemarle have staked much of their future production on the Salar.  In the filings, which have not been previously reported, Albemarle voices concern about a 2016 investigation by Chilean authorities that found over a period of several years SQM sucked up more of the lithium-rich brine from beneath the Salar than its permits allowed.  In a March 2017 filing, for example, Albemarle said it was critical for the authorities to determine how much SQM had overdrawn because that could affect the availability of brine for other projects.  Slideshow ( 16 images )  Interactive Check out a full interactive version of this story.  That filing came a month after Eduardo Bitran, who was then head of Chile's state development agency, Corfo, raised similar concerns about the amount of brine SQM had been drawing and other infractions. In a letter to the environmental regulator, Bitran wrote that SQM's actions pose a \"severe risk\" to the ecosystem of the Salar and its brine reserves.  Chile's environmental regulator has said SQM made changes to how it monitors wells without authorization, making it difficult to track the impact of SQM's pumping on brine supplies.  SQM has not confirmed overdrawing brine. But over nearly two years it has filed four plans with regulators to bring its operations back into line with environmental approvals, which, among other things, specify how much brine SQM can pump. The first three plans were returned to SQM by regulators for further revisions; the latest, filed in September, has yet to receive a response.  Meanwhile, SQM has accused Albemarle of overdrawing brine at its mine and questioned in a filing whether its rival's actions could have repercussions on the availability of brine reserves in the Salar. Albemarle declined comment when asked by Reuters whether that was correct.  Hydro-geologists and environmental chemists consulted by Reuters on the filings said the back-and-forth between the miners underscores widespread concerns over just how much brine is left and how long it will last. They said the filings show that neither the Chilean authorities nor the companies have a clear picture of the water situation at a time when the miners have been given the green light to boost production.  Lithium analyst Joe Lowry said the filings had potential implications for the global production of lithium, which has become one of the world\u2019s hottest commodities.  Slideshow ( 16 images )  \u201cThe lithium world is on pins and needles,\u201d he said. When it comes to the Salar, \u201cWhat is SQM going to be able to do, what is Albemarle going to be able to do production-wise?\u201d  \u2018RAISES DOUBTS\u2019  In a recent interview with Reuters, Kissam, Albemarle\u2019s CEO, insisted there was \u201cno question\u201d that there was enough water in the Salar to maintain lithium operations. The company can produce 80,000 metric tons of lithium annually in the Salar - roughly 36 percent of global demand in 2017 - helped by technology it has developed that will allow it to extract more lithium from the same amount of brine, he said.  He declined to comment on the concerns expressed by his company in the regulatory filings about the area\u2019s water supplies. In one such filing, Albemarle said its rival\u2019s compliance plan failed to sufficiently address regulators\u2019 concerns and \u201craises doubts ... about the sustainability in time of both companies\u2019 operations.\u201d  Slideshow ( 16 images )  Kissam also said his company was currently using only the amount of water allowed by regulators. \u201cWe\u00b4re not overdrawing. We\u00b4re pumping at the rates well within our permits,\u201d he said.  For its part, SQM, controlled by Julio Ponce Lerou, a reclusive Chilean billionaire, says it already has all the brine it needs to produce more lithium.  SQM declined to comment on its water fight with Albemarle. It said in a statement to Reuters that its submissions to the regulator spoke for themselves. But, it added, \u201cOur conclusions indicate that neither the environmental sustainability nor productivity of the Salar de Atacama are compromised.\u201d  For Mariana Cervetto, a hydro-geologist who has reviewed technical aspects of the case for both Corfo, the state development agency, and the local indigenous communities that surround the Atacama salt flat, questions still outweigh answers.  \u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Is the water going to run out?\u2019 I tell them, \u2018The truth is, we don\u2019t know,\u201d Cervetto said.  WELL OF DISCONTENT  The spat between Albemarle and SQM can be traced back to 2013, when government inspectors arrived at SQM\u2019s installations and found something amiss.  Native Algarrobo trees - hardy desert hardwoods that survive by sending shoots deep into underground aquifers - were shedding their leaves and dying.  The 23 dead trees represented one-third of those SQM had committed to monitor. Like canaries in a coal mine, the health of the trees was meant to act as an early warning signal of water problems. Two years later, more trees were dying but SQM failed to notify authorities, according to government inspection reports reviewed by Reuters.

SQM hit back the following month. It wrote to the regulator saying it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that Albemarle was presenting itself as a defender of the environment when Albemarle had acknowledged overdrawing water in 2008 and between 2010-2012. Albemarle declined comment when asked by Reuters whether that was correct.  Corfo submitted a new study on the availability of water in the Salar to the environmental regulator in March that found more water and brine was leaving the system through pumping and evaporation than was coming back in via rain and snowfall.  In the filing, Corfo said, however, the study couldn't pinpoint which of the copper or lithium miners operating in the Salar was to blame for the imbalance. It said this uncertainty was reason enough for regulators to take steps to restrict extraction.  That process is now underway. Reuters reported exclusively in August that Chile\u2019s water regulator was preparing restrictions on new water rights in the Salar in part because of uncertainty over how much extraction it can support..","29":"(Reuters) - Albemarle Corp ALB.N said on Thursday it would delay construction plans for about 125,000 tons of additional lithium processing capacity as an oversupply of the white metal used to make electric vehicle batteries has pushed down prices.

In 2016, Chile gave Albemarle approval to hike production from the lithium-rich Atacama salt flat on condition the miner prove its reserves could sustain the increased output.  Chilean nuclear agency CCHEN, which also licenses lithium exports, said Albemarle had failed to provide adequate reserves data more than a year after the regulator requested it, according to a Jan. 4 letter obtained by Reuters under Chile\u2019s Transparency Act.  Albemarle sought to keep parts of that data confidential but the regulator has until now rejected its arguments. Market watchers, meanwhile, have obsessed over how much lithium is available to miners because the flat is crucial to satisfying a predicted boom in global demand for the electric vehicle battery metal.  \u201cTo date, your representatives have not complied with the delivery of the information requested,\u201d CCHEN wrote to Ellen Lenny-Pessagno, Albemarle\u2019s country manager in Chile. The letter gives the U.S.-based miner five days from Jan. 4 to deliver the information, or explain how and why it should remain confidential.  \u201cCCHEN reserves the right to exercise its legal powers...in the event that the information is not delivered in a timely manner,\u201d the agency said in the letter.  CCHEN head Jaime Salas told Reuters by email that such actions included any available to the agency under Chilean law.  Albemarle told Reuters in a statement that there was no conflict with CCHEN, and said it planned to issue a prompt reply.  \u201cThis letter is part of the coordination necessary so that CCHEN can access the additional information requested,\u201d the company said, noting it was contingent on the regulator \u201ccomplying with confidentiality requirements as the documents contain commercially sensitive information.\u201d  The spat began in late 2019, shortly after Albemarle submitted a report to CCHEN describing its lithium reserves.  The regulator questioned the methodology and conclusions, but Albemarle declined to provide further details, saying U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules impeded it from doing so, filings show.  CCHEN rejected that initial argument, noting that the \u201crequirements of foreign institutions are not enforceable or applicable in Chile.\u201d  In September, Albemarle said in a letter to CCHEN that officials from the agency were welcome to visit their offices to view \u201cthe additional requested documentation,\u201d but only if CCHEN agreed to \u201ccertain confidentiality requirements.\u201d  CCHEN relies in part on miners to provide data on Atacama\u2019s reserves. The deal it struck with Albemarle requires the miner to comply with its conditions or risk suspension of its export license.  Albemarle has claimed in recent years that it operates the world\u2019s \u201cbest\u201d lithium resources, while caring for the environment and local communities, including in the Atacama.  The company is one of two lithium miners permitted to operate on the coveted flat, home to nearly one-quarter the world\u2019s current supply of the white metal.","32":"Sept 27 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp, the world\u2019s largest lithium producer, aims to eventually end its dependence on two smaller units to fund growth as global appetite surges for electric-powered vehicles and consumer goods, its chief executive said in an interview.

Albemarle\u2019s lithium earnings have jumped nearly six-fold since 2014 to more than $500 million annually and should significantly exceed 50 percent of corporate earnings by 2021, Chief Executive Luke Kissam said in an interview.  For the moment, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company is relying on profits from its refinery catalysts and bromine flame retardants units to fund the breakneck growth of its lithium operations. Lithium earnings, so far, are not enough to fund expansions in Chile and other regions in which Albemarle operates, even with margins above 40 percent.  \u201cToday all parts of that puzzle fit together as part of our strategy,\u201d said Kissam, who became CEO in 2011. \u201cWe believe the way to drive the best shareholder value is to have the pieces together. That may change in the future.\u201d  There are few independent publicly traded lithium producers today, but smaller U.S.-based rival FMC Corp aims to spin off its lithium division later this year in an initial public offering in a test of whether a pure-play lithium operation can stand on its own.  Many investors and market analysts expect lithium to one day replace crude oil as the key commodity used to power transportation, a good omen for Albemarle, which expects global lithium demand to rise nearly fourfold in the next six years.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in lithium and electric vehicles, we\u2019re probably not the stock for you,\u201d said Kissam, who owns a Tesla Model S. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving our growth today is all about lithium and that\u2019s tied to the electrification trend.\u201d  Albemarle\u2019s strategy of engineering specialized types of the light metal and opening a research center hear its headquarters is aimed at setting it apart from its major competitors, including Chile\u2019s SQM and China\u2019s Tianqi Lithium Corp .  \u201cI don\u2019t worry at all about the other competitors,\u201d Kissam said. \u201cThere are only a couple players in the world that can supply the volume we can when you look out to 2025,\u201d including SQM, Tianqi and Ganfeng Lithium Co Ltd.  It is that scale that Kissam and Albemarle are aiming to use to their advantage, especially as Volkswagen AG, BMW and other automakers introduce dozens of electric-powered vehicles across the next decade.  In Chile, where Albemarle is a major operator alongside rival SQM, \u201cthe bulk\u201d of lithium carbonate produced is battery-grade, Kissam said. Some industry analysts have questioned the quality of lithium produced in the country.  Albemarle\u2019s La Negra II lithium operations in Chile produce about 15,000 to 16,000 metric tons annually and are expected to produce about 20,000 metric tons next year, Kissam said.

The spat centered around an amendment to the contract that requires Albemarle to provide as much as 25 percent of its annual production of lithium at a discount to companies seeking to produce battery metals within Chile.  Corfo and Albemarle had disagreed on how much to discount the lithium, prompting the threat of arbitration.  Albemarle\u2019s president of lithium, Eric Norris, said that Thursday\u00b4s deal with Corfo was \u201cin line with what we expected our commitment on preferential pricing and terms to be.\u201d  \u201cThe agreed upon process will have no material impact on our anticipated earnings growth, margins or other financial results,\u201d Norris said in a statement.  Albemarle operates in Chile\u2019s Salar de Atacama, a salt flat in the country\u00b4s northern desert that supplies nearly 40 percent of the world\u00b4s lithium. Corfo, which leases mining rights in the Salar, had previously threatened to cancel its contract with Albemarle over the dispute, raising the specter of potential supply disruptions amid booming demand.  The contract amendment that requires Albemarle to provide the ultralight battery metal at a reduced price is meant to spur a value-added lithium industry in Chile.  Lithium is an important ingredient in the batteries that power cell phones, electric vehicles and other consumer goods.  In March, Corfo awarded contracts to Chile\u2019s Molymet, China\u2019s Sichuan Fulin Industrial Group and a joint venture between Samsung SDI Co Ltd and South Korea\u2019s POSCO to produce battery components in Chile using the discounted lithium from Atacama, for a total investment of $754 million.  Those projects had been delayed pending resolution of the dispute between Corfo and Albemarle.  Corfo attorney Maria Elina Cruz said the new agreement would allow the three projects, which had been delayed by the contract dispute, to now move forward.  \u201cComing to agreement will allow us to roll out the value-added industry that was the heart of the contract,\u201d Cruz said in a statement.","34":"(Reuters) - Albemarle Corp, the world\u2019s largest producer of lithium for electric vehicle batteries, said on Tuesday it is experiencing a \u201cweak\u201d first quarter in China, where most of the company\u2019s processing facilities and customers are located.

Maria Elina Cruz, an attorney for Chile state development agency Corfo, said Albemarle has failed to reply to questions about a contract the agency signed with Albemarle in 2016. The agreement grants the U.S.-based miner coveted rights to extract lithium from the Salar, the world\u00b4s richest and most cost-efficient deposit of the ultralight battery metal.  In exchange, the contract with Corfo requires Albemarle to offer as much as 25 percent of its annual production capacity at a discounted rate to companies seeking to produce battery materials within Chile, a deal intended to spur a value-added lithium industry within the Andean nation.  But Cruz told the Senate\u00b4s Mining and Energy Committee that Albemarle had thus far failed to provide the agency with data it needs to set that discounted rate.  \u201cI haven\u00b4t lost hope ... that we can reach an agreement. Despite that, this week we have a meeting ... in which we\u00b4ll decide whether or not to take this to the courts,\u201d Cruz said.

China\u2019s Tianqi, one of the world\u2019s top producers of lithium chemicals used in electric-vehicle batteries, urgently needs proceeds from the sale to make loan repayments that were due at the end of November.  Perth-based IGO, which has requested a trading halt for its shares until Wednesday, pending a material acquisition, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Tianqi, whose shares rose as much as 8.9% on Monday to their highest since July, said in a filing after the market close that a wholly-owned subsidiary was planning to raise capital and expand its issued share capital but that no legally binding financing agreement had yet been signed.  Chengdu-based Tianqi, which alongside Albemarle Corp operates Greenbushes - the world\u2019s largest hard-rock lithium mine - in Western Australia, last week secured a one-month reprieve on $1.88 billion of loan repayments used to acquire a 23.8% stake in Chile\u2019s SQM in 2018.  The IGO acquisition includes a stake in Greenbushes, both sources said, with the second source adding it also included other assets, mostly in Australia.  A price has not been agreed but was expected to be slightly below A$2 billion ($1.48 billion), both sources said, asking not to be identified because the details of the deal were private and had not been signed.  The second source said the deal was expected to be structured as a joint venture in Tianqi unit Tianqi UK and include both Greenbushes and Tianqi\u2019s suspended Kwinana lithium processing plant in Australia.

REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  POSCO, together with partner Samsung SDI, won a 2018 Chilean government tender to build a battery-parts factory in the country\u2019s northern desert in exchange for a 27-year supply of low-cost lithium.  The problem, POSCO told Reuters, is that the project it proposed requires lithium hydroxide, a type of the metal increasingly favored by makers of batteries for electric vehicles (EV) but one not produced by Albemarle in Chile.  Albemarle in Chile primarily produces lithium carbonate, a variety of the metal that is widely used in smaller consumer electronics.  Samsung, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphones, told Reuters that it is still reviewing the project following POSCO\u2019s announcement.  POSCO\u2019s decision is the latest in a string of setbacks for Chile, which has struggled to modernize its lithium policies, boost output and develop a domestic battery industry, despite having the world\u2019s largest supplies of the metal and rising global EV demand.  Albemarle and the Chilean government in 2016 signed an agreement that allows Albemarle to more than triple its output of lithium, which is critically important for batteries for electric cars. But the deal requires the company reserve as much as 25% of its production for companies seeking to build batteries or their parts in Chile. The agreement does not specify whether Albemarle should produce lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide at its facilities.  Albemarle and Corfo, which leases the company its mining rights in Chile, initially disagreed on how to price the lithium it would provide to the battery makers, but have since come to agreement. Neither has offered details of the settlement.  China\u2019s Sichuan Fulin Transportation Group Co and Chile\u2019s privately held Molymet also won access to the discounted lithium in last year\u2019s tender.  An Albemarle spokesman confirmed the Posco-Samsung joint venture \u201cwas not interested in the lithium carbonate produced by Albemarle in Chile,\u201d but said the company was still in open discussions with Fulin and Molymet.  Fulin and Molymet did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the status of their projects.  Following last year\u2019s tender, Chile\u2019s government said the three projects together would bring $754 million in investment to Chile, and promised at least 664 jobs would be created.  The deals were widely seen as a foot in the door into Chile as countries and global corporations scramble to lock down supplies of key metals used in batteries that power cell phones, tablets and electric vehicles.  POSCO last summer said it would build a lithium plant in Argentina to help secure its own supply.

Albemarle has earlier said it looks to double production at its lithium facility in Silver Peak, Nevada, part of a plan to boost supply for the burgeoning electric vehicle market, while Chilean miner SQM has said its current plans to boost its production of lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide by the second half of 2021 remained on track.  \u201cLonger-term, we expect lithium demand to grow in line with greater EV adoption. We are accelerating our lithium growth projects to capitalize on this trend and generate strong investment returns,\u201d Albemarle said on Wednesday.  However, Albemarle warned that it expects pricing to be down slightly, and forecast adjusted profit in the range of $3.25 to $3.65 per share for 2021. It earned a profit of $4.12 per share in 2020.  In the lithium business, the company\u2019s largest, sales fell 12.8% in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower contract and market pricing.  On an adjusted basis, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company earned $1.17 per share, beating estimates of $1.10 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES.","52":"(Reuters) - Albemarle Corp said on Thursday it wants to take control of Australia\u2019s Greenbushes, the world\u2019s largest lithium mine, signaling it intends to block any rival from buying Tianqi Lithium Corp\u2019s controlling stake.

The companies will form a 60:40 joint venture to operate Wodgina as part of the deal, Mineral Resources said in a statement. (Reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin)","59":"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp, the world\u2019s top lithium producer, has agreed to pay $1.15 billion to form a lithium joint venture with Australia\u2019s Mineral Resources, a week after regulators rejected plans to expand its operations in Chile.  Albemarle will take a 50 percent stake in the venture that will own and operate the Wodgina lithium mine in Western Australia and develop a plant producing lithium hydroxide, the two companies said in separate statements released late Wednesday and Thursday.  The move builds on Albemarle\u2019s presence in Australia where it is already a stake holder in the world\u2019s biggest hard rock lithium mine, and comes amid an expected boom in demand for lithium in rechargeable batteries that power everything from cell phones to electric vehicles.  Shares in Mineral Resources, which has been looking for a funding partner, surged by as much as a third on the Australian bourse on Thursday, while Albemarle shares finished flat on Wednesday.  The two companies have signed an exclusivity agreement and aimed to reach a binding agreement by Dec. 14, they said.  Albemarle already has a joint venture with China\u2019s Tianqi Lithium Corp. to develop the Greenbushes mine and processing plant in Western Australia.  However, its main operations are at the Salar de Atacama salt flat in Chile, where the pace of planned expansions has been slowed by regulatory, environmental and potential technical concerns, broker Canaccord said in a note on Thursday.  \u201cTaxation changes in Chile are also reducing investment appeal in that jurisdiction. A pivot out of Chile is, therefore, not surprising,\u201d it said.  Last week, Chilean regulators rejected Albemarle\u2019s plans to expand output from Salar de Atacama after its environmental impact statement was found to lack key information.  Regulators have cracked down on water use in the region, which lies at the heart of the world\u2019s driest desert.  The Mineral Resources tie-up also flags a move by the global battery supply chain toward Australian producers amid a shift to higher energy-density batteries using lithium hydroxide.  Australia\u2019s lithium supply comes from hard rock, which can directly produce hydroxide, while production of hydroxide from Chile\u2019s brines is a more expensive, two-stage process.  Wodgina\u2019s early stage project exports unrefined hard rock ore. The joint venture plans to build a plant to produce up to 750,000 tonnes a year of 6 percent spodumene concentrate to feed a 50,000 ton a year lithium hydroxide plant.  Albemarle will need to spend another $300 million to $400 million to develop Wodgina, Morningstar said in a report, rating the deal as \u201cvalue neutral\u201d.

Maria Elina Cruz, an attorney for Chile state development agency Corfo, said Albemarle has failed to reply to questions about a contract the agency signed with Albemarle in 2016. The agreement grants the U.S.-based miner coveted rights to extract lithium from the Salar, the world\u00b4s richest and most cost-efficient deposit of the ultralight battery metal.  In exchange, the contract with Corfo requires Albemarle to offer as much as 25 percent of its annual production capacity at a discounted rate to companies seeking to produce battery materials within Chile, a deal intended to spur a value-added lithium industry within the Andean nation.  But Cruz told the Senate\u00b4s Mining and Energy Committee that Albemarle had thus far failed to provide the agency with data it needs to set that discounted rate.  \u201cI haven\u00b4t lost hope ... that we can reach an agreement. Despite that, this week we have a meeting ... in which we\u00b4ll decide whether or not to take this to the courts,\u201d Cruz said.  Albemarle did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Cruz said the dispute with Albemarle would not jeopardize its right to produce lithium from the Salar. But the impasse had unfairly slowed the country\u00b4s efforts to develop a value-added lithium industry, she said.  \u201cCorfo is profoundly concerned about this ...\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThis is the heart of the agreement.\u201d  In March, Corfo awarded contracts to Chile\u2019s Molymet, China\u2019s Sichuan Fulin Industrial Group and a joint venture between Samsung SDI Co Ltd and South Korea\u2019s POSCO to produce battery components in Chile using discounted lithium from the Atacama, for a total investment of $754 million.  But Cruz said Albemarle had yet to make a \u201cserious offer\u201d to any of the companies that have been promised the lithium.  \u201cThis has been very evasive and, in my opinion, it\u00b4s inexplicable because the clause is quite clear,\u201d she said, adding the company had not answered the agency\u00b4s phone calls on the issue for three months.  The reduced rate agreed upon in the contract must equal the lowest market price of lithium produced by the company and exported from Chile in the past six months, Cruz said.  The Atacama salt flat where Albemarle and Chilean competitor , operate produces more than one-third of the world\u00b4s lithium.

REUTERS\/Pablo Sanhueza  Both steps should, if successful, help the world\u2019s largest lithium producer solidify its operations in Chile\u2019s Atacama desert, which contains massive reserves of the white metal used to make electric vehicle batteries.  A month ago, U.S.-based Albemarle announced it had developed a process to boost Chilean lithium output by 30% without extracting more brine from the Atacama, the world\u2019s driest desert.  The company on Tuesday described a process that evokes the industry standard of using a series of evaporation ponds. Salts that dessicate in each pond typically contain some lithium molecules.  Albemarle said it will re-inject those salts into ponds to effectively boost the concentration of the white metal in successive evaporative steps.  \u201cThe technology we\u2019re looking at an investing in is essentially reprocessing some of those salts that contain some lithium,\u201d David Ryan, Albemarle\u2019s head of corporate strategy and investor relations, told the Fastmarkets Lithium Supply and Markets Conference in Santiago.  Asked how this new process differs from traditional evaporation ponds used for decades by the lithium industry, Ryan said: \u201cIt\u2019s different from the fact that I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s been a focus on reprocessing some of that byproduct.\u201d  The true state of the Atacama\u2019s water supply, both fresh and saltwater, has become an obsession of lithium industry watchers because of the area\u2019s huge importance in satisfying soaring global demand for the powdery white metal.  Albemarle\u2019s operations are now only 50% efficient in the Atacama, meaning they are able to extract half of the lithium from the region\u2019s brine.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201d said Ellen Lenny-Pessagno, Albemarle\u2019s Chile country manager.  Albemarle has been eyeing partnerships with technology firms to boost its yield, she said.  \u201cIf you have a technology that you think would be appropriate for our specific challenges and needs, I would encourage you to reach out,\u201d Lenny-Pessagno told conference attendees on Tuesday.  TORRENTIAL RAIN  Albemarle saw its first-quarter lithium sales drop 2 percent because of the torrential, weekslong January rains at its operations in Chile, which rely on evaporation ponds to produce lithium.  Rival SQM has also said that the rains had impacted \u201csome production\u201d at its northern Chile facilities.  The operations of Livent Corp in nearby Argentina were also affected by the rains earlier this year.  The intense rains in what is typically a bone-dry desert surprised the industry at the time and raised questions about how Albemarle could defend itself in the future as climates change.  \u201cWe have taken some steps to lessen as much as possible the impacts of weather on our process,\u201d Ryan said, without elaborating.  An Albemarle spokesman did not provide more details when asked for additional comment.  A typical industry practice to protect evaporation ponds against rain would be to drain ponds as storms approach, storing the concentrate until after rains pass, Lithium Chile Inc\u2019s Jose de Castro said in an unrelated presentation at the Santiago conference.

REUTERS\/Ernest Scheyder\/File Photo  The warning laid bare the tension emerging in the EV industry between the companies that supply the lithium crucial for battery development and automakers who are hunting for discounts.  Prices for lithium dropped last year due in part to the coronavirus pandemic, forcing Albemarle and peers to pause expansions, a step they will reverse only if the price is right, Eric Norris, who runs Albemarle\u2019s lithium business, told the Reuters Next conference.  \u201cWe\u2019re at the ready to expand, but it\u2019s got to be at terms that make sense,\u201d Norris said.  Global lithium supply and demand at the end of last year was nearly even, according to data from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. By 2025, though, demand is expected to outstrip supply by nearly 228,000 tonnes.  Prices have started to inch higher, especially in China, the world\u2019s largest EV market, but must rise at least 10% more in order to make any expansions worthwhile, Norris said.  Wall Street seems to be expecting higher lithium prices: Albemarle\u2019s stock price has more than doubled in the past year.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t work as a supply chain together - from the lithium supply base all the way to the EV producer - there is a risk of slowing down plans,\u201d he said.  BIDEN ADMINISTRATION  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company, Norris said, is hopeful that the U.S. EV supply chain will grow under President-elect Joe Biden, who will be inaugurated next week.  Biden has proposed a $2 trillion climate plan aimed, in part, at building a national network of EV charging stations.  To help boost U.S. lithium production, Albemarle is studying ways to produce the metal from clay reserves near its existing Nevada operations, a plan that mimics one from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.  \u201cWe agree with the assertion from Tesla and Elon Musk that there\u2019s a lot of lithium in clay,\u201d Norris said. \u201cWe cannot put a number on it, but given the demand for lithium we owe it to the industry to try.\u201d  CLIMATE PROMISES  Automakers, including Volkswagen and Daimler, have ratcheted up environmental scrutiny of Chile\u2019s Salar de Atacama salt flat, home to some of Albemarle\u2019s largest lithium operations.  While questions have lingered for years on how lithium production affects the area\u2019s fragile ecosystem, Norris said he welcomes the scrutiny and sees Albemarle\u2019s operations as helping reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.  \u201cLithium does enable our customers to deliver on their climate promises,\u201d said Norris, who drives a Tesla Model S sedan.  The London Metal Exchange, meanwhile, plans to launch a lithium contract this summer, a step long sought by automakers. Norris said that Albemarle supports more transparency but is concerned that one traded price would not reflect the many types of lithium products.  The industry could face further changes as EV battery recycling gains in popularity. Albemarle is studying ways to reuse the white metal from batteries at the end of their life - typically 10 years - a plan that will first require mass adoption of EVs to make recycling economic, Norris said.  \u201cIn the future ... we won\u2019t be talking as much about lithium resources as we will be talking about battery collection and re-processing,\u201d he said.

Brine pools from a lithium mine, that belongs to U.S.-based Albemarle Corp, is seen on the Atacama salt flat in the Atacama desert, Chile, August 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Ivan Alvarado  The development could help Albemarle cement its position as the world\u2019s largest lithium company, just as global demand for the light metal is spiking for use in batteries that power electric vehicles and consumer goods.  But if the extraction process proves less than advertised, the U.S.-based company risks ceding its crown as the world's biggest lithium producer to smaller rivals including Chile's own SQM SQMa.SN.  The lack of clarity over the issue prompted Chile\u2019s nuclear commission, which oversees the sale and export of lithium in Chile, to deny Albemarle\u2019s request to increase its production quota for the white metal. The agency says the company has yet to explain how its technology will allow it to extract more lithium from the same amount of brine in the world\u2019s driest desert.  Albemarle has been reluctant to provide specific details of the new process first announced in September 2017. The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) began asking last March for specifics on the process.  Albemarle says it \u201cis preparing a revised request addressing CCHEN\u2019s concerns, which are of a technical nature\u201d and that it expects to ultimately receive approval to produce more lithium.  Asked by Reuters in late October for more concrete details on the new technology, Eric Norris, head of Albemarle\u2019s lithium division, said the new process was \u201cvery efficient and it\u2019s obviously very sustainable\u201d but gave few other specific details.  \u201cIt\u2019s likely some process or technology where you don\u2019t lose lithium to the salts that evaporate out of the ponds,\u201d said Robert Baylis, a lithium analyst with Roskill.  Norris said Albemarle would spend \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d to build a plant in the Atacama that would further refine brine concentrate to increase the amount of lithium recovered to 80 percent, up from \u201cabout half\u201d today. Some industry analysts say the current lithium recovery figure is lower, around 30 percent.  Norris also said the company was spending $1 billion in Chile, its largest area of operations, and hiring more than 1,700 people. But he offered no timeline for the spending and hiring.  \"I don't know if they're doing anything proprietary or revolutionary,\" said David Deak, an independent battery industry consultant and former lithium buyer for electric carmarker Tesla Inc TSLA.O. \"It's unclear really what Albemarle has here, and what it means in terms of water usage.\"  That usage is closely watched by Chilean regulators, despite the $100 million in royalties the country collects annually from Albemarle, due to concerns about water and brine levels in the Atacama.  MODIFICATION  Albemarle entered Chile as part of its 2015 buyout of smaller rival Rockwood Holdings, inheriting access to massive lithium reserves.  The company\u2019s lithium process, which relies heavily on evaporation ponds, was designed to extract potash fertilizer from salts, with lithium only as a byproduct.  Tweaking that technology to boost lithium recovery has long been an obsession of Albemarle and SQM. Indeed, rivals in Argentina, including Livent Corp LTHM.N, have developed methods that allow for nearly all lithium in brine to be recovered, a step made possible in part by the different chemical composition of Argentine brine.  Norris said that Albemarle\u2019s process is not the same as Livent\u2019s, without elaborating. Livent, for its part, believes there may be some crossover.  In Chile, Albemarle has repeatedly assured regulators that it is now capable of sharply increasing the amount of lithium it can extract from brine, according to documents obtained by Reuters via a Chilean freedom of information request.  \u201cThe modification is made possible because Albemarle has developed a sustainable technology that allows us to increase the efficiency of our processes in the Salar de Atacama without using more brine or water, and as a consequence, produce more tons of lithium carbonate,\u201d Stephen Elgueta, Albemarle\u2019s Chilean manager, wrote to nuclear agency CCHEN on March 23.  On May 3, CCHEN asked Albemarle to provide \u201cdetails with respect to the technology that would enable the increase.\u201d  The following month, three executives from Albemarle met with CCHEN director Patricio Aguilera at Santiago\u2019s La Reina Center for Nuclear Studies.  According to Chile\u2019s lobbyist transparency website, Albemarle presented its production projections through 2044 during the hour-long June meeting, as well as \u201csome process improvements it is implementing.\u201d  But officials from CCHEN remained unconvinced.  \u201cThe details provided ... during the meeting are insufficient,\u201d wrote Aguilera on June 20, adding that the efficiency improvements touted by Albemarle in the meeting only \u201cjustified a percentage of the total [increase in quota]\u201d requested by the company.  Albemarle provided no more information to CCHEN during the nearly three months that followed, according to Chilean regulatory filings.  On Sept. 12, CCHEN formally rejected Albemarle\u2019s March request to increase its quota to sell lithium outside the country. The agency said in a resolution that the miner had failed to answer questions about how the \u201ctechnology would permit the increase in efficiency.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s questions across industry about what exactly Albemarle has actually developed,\u201d said Chris Berry, an independent lithium analyst based in New York.","66":"SANTIAGO\/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of Albemarle Corp ALB.N fell as much as 2.3 percent on Monday following news that Chile's nuclear regulator refused to increase the company's quota to sell lithium produced from its Salar de Atacama operation.

Shares of the world\u2019s largest lithium producer, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, pared losses and closed down 0.8 percent at $102.25.  CCHEN oversees the sale and export of lithium from Chile, though not production, which is controlled by a separate state agency.  The setback could represent a major blow to Albemarle, which aims to satisfy spiking global demand for the ultralight metal used in batteries that power products ranging from cell phones to electric vehicles.  Albemarle previously said that it could achieve an increase in production using more efficient technology, and without extracting any more lithium-rich brine, or saltwater, from the environmentally sensitive Atacama salt flats.  But Chile\u2019s nuclear agency said in the September resolution that Albemarle had failed to answer more detailed questions about how the \u201ctechnology would permit the increase in efficiency.\u201d  Cole, in an emailed statement, said Albemarle was confident the increase would be approved, \u201cas it entails a project that presents a breakthrough technology to produce more lithium without using more brine.\u201d  Cole added that the company believes its existing sales authorizations are sufficient.  Chilean newspaper La Tercera originally reported the agency\u2019s decision on Saturday, citing CCHEN executive director Patricio Aguilera.  The filing does not indicate the timeframe for the sales quota increase, although lithium companies typically seek decades-long quotas and contracts.  The request came as Albemarle has publicly touted an increase in allowed output to 145,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalent annually through 2043 from Chile\u2019s Economic Development Agency (Corfo), which oversees lithium production in the Salar de Atacama.  The reason for the discrepancy in the physical amount of lithium between the two requests to the two different agencies was not immediately clear.  Corfo declined to comment on CCHEN\u2019s decision.  In Chile, CCHEN\u2019s control over lithium exports dates back to the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, which declared lithium \u201cstrategic\u201d for its value in nuclear production processes.","67":"May 8 (Reuters) - Albemarle Corp, the world\u2019s largest producer of lithium used to make electric vehicle batteries, posted a slight rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday as sales of flame retardant chemicals offset a dip in lithium sales.

Announcing the committee during LME Week, an annual gathering in London of metals consumers, producers, traders and brokers from around the world, the LME said it was likely to include representatives of nine companies.  These include vehicle makers Tesla and Jaguar Land Rover, and lithium producers and processors Tianqi Lithium Australia, BASF and Chile-focused Albemarle, the LME said.  Demand for lithium is expected to more than triple by 2025 to 917,469 tonnes as production of electric vehicles grows, according to Canaccord Genuity.  But near-term oversupply has more than halved prices since the start of 2018, prompting major producers to scale back expansion plans.  The LME is planning a lithium contract, and in June selected Fastmarkets to provide a reference price, but has given no timeline for an official launch.  However, Albemarle, the biggest producer, has said it will not participate in the contract, depriving it of a key source of pricing data.  Its move reflects a view by some that lithium is a specialty chemical rather than a basic commodity and should be priced on a contract-by-contract basis.  The LME has committees, which perform an advisory role, for producers and users of other metals that trade on the exchange including copper, aluminum and cobalt.  The exchange is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd.","72":"(Reuters) - Albemarle Corp ALB.N, the world's largest lithium producer, on Wednesday posted quarterly profit that rose more than expected due in part to price hikes, though unexpected production problems cut its output of the white metal.

It has dedicated profit from its two other chemical divisions to bolster lithium operations.  The company posted third-quarter net income of $129.7 million, or $1.20 per share, up from $118.7 million, or $1.06 per share, in the year-ago period.  Excluding one-time items, Albemarle earned $1.31 per share, beating analyst forecasts using that measure of $1.25 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Lithium prices rose from a year earlier and the company is making \u201cmeaningful progress on extending our long-term lithium supply agreements,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Luke Kissam said in a statement.  Unlike some rivals that focus on selling lithium on a spot basis, Albemarle has largely pursued long-term contracts that guarantee its profits and supply for customers.  Lithium sales in the quarter, though, rose less than 1 percent to $270.9 million, as production slipped due to \u201cunexpected shut downs at three of our lithium manufacturing sites\u201d that have since been rectified, the company said.

The company, the world\u2019s largest producer of the white metal used to make electric vehicle batteries, has teased the industry for more than a year that it has production-enhancing technology. The lack of details, though, has irked some investors and Chilean authorities.  Chief Executive Luke Kissam said on Thursday the company has successfully tested the process in a laboratory and in field tests, has ordered equipment and plans to start construction during the second quarter.  \u201cThere\u2019s not any specially made pieces of equipment or things like that. So we feel confident in our ability to execute this project,\u201d Kissam told investors on a conference call.  The project should be commissioned by 2021, Kissam said, without providing its cost.  Lithium output is closely watched by Chile, despite the $100 million in royalties the country collects annually from Albemarle, due to concerns about Atacama water and brine levels.  Chilean regulators last year began delving into just how the new process works, ultimately rejecting Albemarle\u2019s application to produce more lithium for lack of details. Albemarle had said it would re-apply.  It was not immediately clear if the process outlined on Thursday used the same technology mentioned last year, nor was it clear if Albemarle had re-applied with Chilean officials.  Representatives for Albemarle and Chilean nuclear agency CCHEN, which oversees exports of lithium, were not immediately available to comment.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle said on Thursday that commissioning of its La Negra III and IV lithium carbonate facilities in Chile would not happen until at least the fourth quarter due to delays in shipping of equipment.  Albemarle said on Thursday it plans to produce 40,000 tonnes of lithium in Chile this year, roughly flat with 2018 levels. Albemarle has authorization to produce in Chile the equivalent of up to 80,000 tonnes annually of lithium through 2043.

FILE PHOTO: Brine pools from a lithium mine, that belongs U.S.-based Albemarle Corp, is seen on the Atacama salt flat in the Atacama desert, Chile, August 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Ivan Alvarado\/File Photo  The behind-the-scenes moves come even as Albemarle has publicly brushed off worries from analysts and investors about rising regulatory pressure in Chile, home to the world\u2019s largest reserves of lithium, a crucial ingredient in electric car batteries and mobile phones.  Ellen Lenny-Pessagno, who became Albemarle\u2019s Chile country manager in October, met with the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) on Nov. 23 to discuss the rejection, according to filings with Chile\u2019s lobbyist transparency website that have been previously unreported.  The nuclear agency, which oversees lithium sales and export from Chile, had rejected Albemarle\u2019s request in September to increase its quota to sell lithium. That effectively stunted the long-term expansion plans of the world\u2019s top producer of the ultralight metal.  Albemarle Chief Executive Luke Kissam stressed in a November conference call with investors that the rejection from CCHEN was \u201cnot a big deal, OK? It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d  But Lenny-Pessagno, a former diplomat who has held senior roles with the U.S. State Department advocating for U.S. renewable energy companies in Spain, Chile and Colombia, told CCHEN\u2019s interim director, Mauricio Lichtemberg, that the regulator\u2019s September decision was having an impact on its workers and investors, according to minutes from the meeting.  Albemarle did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Lenny-Pessagno discussed \u201chow important Albemarle is to Chile from an investment standpoint, as a source of direct employment and for contractors,\u201d the minutes show.  Albemarle pays Chile more than $100 million annually in lithium royalties, giving it some financial and political sway in the country.  Lenny-Pessagno\u2019s visit to CCHEN was the second in as many months by an Albemarle executive. Eric Norris, chief of Albemarle\u2019s lithium division, had flown to Santiago from the company\u2019s North Carolina headquarters in October, shortly after the rejection, according to the lobbyist transparency records.  AUSTRALIA VS. CHILE?  Lenny-Pessagno also referred to the U.S.-based miner\u2019s investments in other countries, meeting minutes show.  She told Chile\u2019s nuclear regulator that Albemarle was making new investments in Australia, which vies with Chile to be the world\u2019s top lithium producer.  The day before the meeting, Albemarle had announced a $1.15 billion deal to form a joint venture with Australia's Mineral Resources Ltd MIN.AX.  That venture, if finalized, would eventually produce more lithium than Albemarle has authorization to sell from Chile.  CCHEN\u2019s Lichtemberg reiterated to Lenny-Pessagno the same points it had made in the initial ruling in September, the minutes show.  The agency has not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the details of the rejection.  But it has said that Albemarle had failed to provide requested details about how it plans to triple lithium production from Chile\u2019s Salar de Atacama without using more water.  Regulators are cracking down on water use by both copper and lithium miners in the salar, which lies at the heart of the world\u2019s driest desert.  Last month, Reuters reported that environmental regulators had rejected Albemarle\u2019s plans to build a plant to process 42,500 tonnes of lithium carbonate annually on Chile\u2019s coast, another critical facet of its long-term plans.","77":"(Reuters) - The Albemarle Corp executive overseeing the company\u2019s massive lithium operations, a key supplier of the mineral used to make batteries for Tesla Inc automobiles, is leaving at the end of the month, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters.  John Mitchell will leave the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company \u201cto pursue another opportunity,\u201d Chief Executive Luke Kissam told employees in the memo.  A company spokeswoman declined to comment. Mitchell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Albemarle is the world\u2019s largest lithium producer and its annual lithium sales have spiked more than fourfold since 2015 to $1.3 billion. The company\u2019s shares, however, have plunged 29 percent this year on competition concerns as rivals have forged ahead with fresh mine developments.  With lithium mines across the Americas and Australia, Albemarle is a major supplier to Panasonic, which in turn supplies battery parts to global auto giants, including Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla.  Mitchell will be replaced as Albemarle\u2019s president of lithium by former FMC Corp executive Eric Norris, who joined the company in January as chief strategy officer.  Norris\u2019 \u201cleadership style and wealth of business experience makes him a natural fit for the role,\u201d Kissam said in the memo.  Norris previously led FMC\u2019s health and nutrition division, and had prior stints in the company\u2019s lithium unit. FMC is spinning off its lithium division this fall as a stand-alone publicly traded company.  Albemarle is also shuffling other executives, according to the memo.

BHP has long pumped water from Atacama\u2019s aquifers to feed operations at its sprawling Escondida mine. But shortly after applying to renew those permits in 2017, authorities warned the aquifer was overdrawn, stalling the process.  The global miner said in a statement Tuesday it would now substitute its pumping from Atacama with desalinated water from its coastal Chilean plants.  BHP\u2019s decision is a step toward reducing pumping pressure on the vast, lithium-rich salt flat. The basin sits amid the world\u2019s driest desert, where annual rainfall is often measured in millimeters.  Soaring demand for ultralight battery metal lithium has raised questions about whether Atacama can support future levels of production along with the needs of nearby copper mines, a booming tourism industry and indigenous communities.  \u201cBHP\u2019s decision advances by 10 years its commitment to stop extracting high Andean water for Escondida,\u201d the miner said in the statement. It had previously said it would shut off the taps in 2030.  BHP said its decision had taken into account conversations with indigenous communities around the flat.

In the filings, Corfo told Albemarle it was unable to provide the report because it was still under review and contained confidential business information.  The report, which remains under wraps, aims to stamp out uncertainty over the sustainability of mining activity that has long cast a pall over the sensitive salt flat, home to one-quarter of the world\u2019s current output of lithium, but also indigenous communities, protected areas, and endangered flamingos.  Both SQM and Albemarle, the only two lithium miners on the flat, contributed to the report. But whereas SQM\u2019s contract with Corfo allows it to review working drafts of studies commissioned by the agency and related to water in the Salar, Albemarle\u2019s contract does not include this clause.  SQM SQMB.SN objected to the study's release, the filings show, arguing the data it contained was \"sensitive and confidential.\"  Albemarle blasted Corfo\u2019s decision in an August appeal presented to Chile\u2019s Council for Transparency and seen by Reuters, calling the study long-overdue, and its contents public. The council resolves disputes related to the country\u2019s open records laws.  \u201cTheir only goal is to hide information that is, in no way, secret,\u201d Albemarle\u2019s attorney said in the filing, adding that the study in question was \u201chighly relevant\u201d to understanding the environmental effects of mining on the flat.  It said the only reason the contents might be sensitive was if they \u201crevealed non-compliance or actions that go against regulations\u201d and said SQM\u2019s exclusive right to review the study was unfair and put its top competitor in a \u201cposition of privilege.\u201d  Corfo declined to comment on the dispute.  SQM did not comment directly on Albemarle\u2019s accusations when contacted by Reuters. The Chilean miner said in a statement that Corfo had \u201cindependently contracted top-level specialists\u201d for the water study. SQM added it had adhered to the terms of its contract with Corfo and provided the agency with all of the information regulators had requested.  The study and the true state of the Salar\u2019s water supply has long been an obsession of lithium industry watchers because of the area\u2019s huge importance in satisfying soaring global demand for the white metal. Lithium is vital to the batteries that power cellphones and electric vehicles.  Lawmakers, academics, environmentalists, local communities, German carmaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and most recently, a Chilean environmental tribunal, have all emphasized the importance of the study in helping dispel lingering questions on the impact of lithium mining in Chile.

Both SQM and Albemarle are making preparations to ramp up production in Chile\u2019s Salar de Atacama, one of the world\u2019s richest lithium flats, amid a sharp spike in global demand.  SQM said in July it was seeking government approval for a $450 million expansion of its lithium carbonate plant, which could more than double its capacity to produce lithium carbonate to 180,000 tons a year by 2020.  Albemarle in March secured permits from Chilean authorities to boost production to as much as 145,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually through 2043.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle reported earlier this week that its quarterly earnings had tripled on rising sales, though its shares had lost nearly a third of their value since January on concerns new lithium projects could flood the market with fresh supply.  SQM\u2019s Jimenez also said in the presentation that global production capacity for the key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries would more than triple in four years, reaching 735,000 tonnes by 2022.  Australia will increase its share of production capacity to 46 percent by 2022, Jimenez said, cementing its position as the world\u2019s top-producing country of the white metal.  Chile\u2019s market share is expected to drop from 37 percent in 2017 to 30 percent in 2022, according to the presentation.","82":"(Repeats to widen distribution)  Aug 30 (Reuters) - As global demand for lithium hits overdrive, Albemarle Corp is investing millions of dollars to engineer specialized types of the light metal for electric car batteries, part of a strategy to remain the niche market\u2019s top producer.  The pivot comes as battery makers such as Panasonic Corp , the sole battery supplier to Tesla Inc, increasingly demand more purified versions of lithium that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery\u2019s charge, shaping Albemarle\u2019s strategy, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters and confirmed by the company.  Once used primarily as a pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder, lithium has become one of the world\u2019s most in-demand commodities thanks to the rising popularity of electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries.  Roughly 500,000 electric vehicles were sold globally in 2016, a figure that is expected to jump sevenfold by 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Albemarle\u2019s strategy, which includes developing a battery research center near its North Carolina headquarters, is aimed at setting it apart from its major competitors, including Chile\u2019s SQM and China\u2019s Tianqi Lithium Corp .  Albemarle has historically sold basic types of lithium under short-term contracts, much like rivals. Now, the company is diverging from rivals and developing dozens of lithium products that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery\u2019s charge.  \u201cWhat we are doing is not a moonshot, but rather just good engineering,\u201d Albemarle\u2019s lithium unit head, Eric Norris, said at a private dinner earlier this summer attended by State Street Global Advisors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other top shareholders, according to two sources.  As more lithium production comes online in the Americas and Asia, concerns about oversupply are high, making a push into specialized lithium a crucial step for Albemarle.  \u201cLithium is much more a specialty chemical than a mined product,\u201d said Joe Lowry, an independent lithium industry consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a commodity because it\u2019s not a fungible good.\u201d  Albemarle is now trying to use its technical know-how and clout to forge customer partnerships that it hopes guarantee profit for decades.  \u201cIf every new lithium project that\u2019s been announced does come online, that could cause market oversupply,\u201d said Deutsche Bank mining analyst Chris Terry. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bearishness in the market and differentiation is the key to success.\u201d  R&D  By treating the metal with various chemicals and other processing steps, lithium\u2019s chemical structure can be rearranged to boost electricity storage and increase charge, which Albemarle hopes will make it even more indispensable to battery makers and the electric car industry, Norris told the investor dinner.  \u201cBattery requirements are becoming more stringent and there is a definitive move towards higher energy density batteries,\u201d Albemarle spokeswoman Hailey Cobb said.  Longer term, Albemarle is studying so-called \u201csolid state\u201d batteries, which contains no liquid and theoretically can store more electricity than the lithium ion battery, Norris told investors.  While solid-state batteries are not expected to replace lithium ion batteries as the industry standard, they are seen as a promising technological evolution. And importantly for Albemarle, they will consume even more lithium.  So far, Wall Street is rooting for Albemarle\u2019s success. Seventeen of the 22 analysts that cover the stock recommend buying it. As an average, that same group thinks the stock should be trading 33 percent above current levels, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Albemarle agrees and earlier this month said it would double its stock buyback for the year to $500 million.  RELATIONSHIPS  The global lithium business is dominated by Albemarle, SQM, Tianqi and FMC Corp, which is spinning off its lithium division this fall as a stand-alone publicly traded company.  SQM has stated publicly a goal of supplanting Albemarle as the world\u2019s biggest lithium producer by the next decade, which Albemarle says is not a concern.  \u201cWe are not interested in being the largest; we are concerned about meeting the needs of our customers and being the most profitable lithium company in the world,\u201d said Hobb.  But some on Wall Street are spooked, with shares of Albemarle down 25 percent this year.  \u201cLithium has become the centerpiece for the future of the company,\u201d said Chip Skinner, a portfolio manager with the Royce Funds, which holds Albemarle shares. \u201cBut supply and demand still matter.\u201d  To help retain its crown, the U.S. company is moving customers toward long-term contracts of a decade or more, far longer than the three- to five-year contracts it currently signs. The contracts have an option to reset pricing every year, in contrast to SQM which favors shorter contracts and typically charges spot market prices.  Albemarle also poached former General Electric Co battery scientist Glen Merfeld this spring, and is hiring deputies for Merfeld to help oversee the new battery center.  Norris told large investors that the shift to long-term contracts, which would have a base price guaranteed, could be as long as a decade or more in some cases and secure Albemarle\u2019s 40 percent profit margins, regardless of market forces.  \u201cLithium is a relationship-based business, and Albemarle is betting that brings it success in the long-run,\u201d said Chris Berry, an independent energy metals analyst based in New York.","83":"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile\u2019s government said on Monday it was creating a committee to supervise lithium contracts the state has with local miner SQM and U.S.-based Albemarle Corp., deals that are key to positioning the country as a top producer of the white metal.  The committee will aim to ensure concession agreements that state development agency Corfo has with SQM SQM_pb.SN and Albemarle Corp in the Atacama salt flats are followed.  \u201cThere are many contractual clauses that require decisions on prices, quantities and allocation of resources,\u201d Economy Minister Jose Valente told journalists after a Corfo board meeting.  \u201cThis committee will be seeing how they develop and recommend to Corfo\u2019s board the fulfillment of those contracts in the appropriate manner,\u201d he added.  SQM is the world\u2019s second biggest lithium producer after Albemarle Corp.

POSCO, together with partner Samsung SDI, won a 2018 Chilean government tender to build a battery-parts factory in the country\u2019s northern desert in exchange for a 27-year supply of low-cost lithium.  The problem, POSCO told Reuters, is that the project it proposed requires lithium hydroxide, a type of the metal increasingly favored by EV battery makers but one not produced by Albemarle in Chile.  Albemarle in Chile produces primarily lithium carbonate, a variety of the metal that is widely used in smaller consumer electronics.  Samsung, the world\u2019s largest maker of smartphones, told Reuters that it is still reviewing the project following Posco\u2019s announcement.  POSCO\u2019s decision is yet another in a string of setbacks for Chile, which has struggled to modernize its lithium policies, boost output and develop a domestic battery industry, despite having the world\u2019s largest supplies of the metal and rising global EV demand.  Albemarle and the Chilean government in 2016 signed an agreement that allows Albemarle to more than triple its output of lithium. But the deal requires the company reserve as much as 25 percent of its production for companies seeking to build batteries or their parts in Chile. The agreement does not specify whether Albemarle should produce lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide at its facilities.  Albemarle and Corfo, which leases the company its mining rights in Chile, initially disagreed on how to price the lithium it would provide to the battery makers, but have since come to agreement. Neither has offered details of the settlement.  Albemarle did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Posco\u2019s decision.  China\u2019s Sichuan Fulin Transportation Group Co and Chile\u2019s privately held Molymet also won access to the discounted lithium in last year\u2019s tender.  Fulin and Molymet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Following last year\u2019s tender, Chile\u2019s government said the price tag for the three projects was $754 million. At least 664 jobs would be created.  The deals were widely seen as a foot in the door into Chile as countries and global corporations scramble to lock down supplies of key metals used in batteries that power cell phones, tablets and electric vehicles.  POSCO last summer said it would build a lithium plant in Argentina to help secure its own supply. That announcement came as POSCO also said it would buy lithium mining rights in Argentina from Galaxy Resource Ltd\u2019s in a deal worth $280 million.","91":"(Reuters) - Albemarle Corp ALB.N beat quarterly profit estimates on higher demand for bromine and raised its 2019 adjusted profit forecast on Wednesday, sending shares of the world's largest lithium producer up over 10% in extended trading.

FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows the brine pools of a lithium mine on the Atacama salt flat in the Atacama desert of northern Chile, January 10, 2013. REUTERS\/Ivan Alvarado\/File Photo  The pivot comes as battery makers such as Panasonic Corp, the sole battery supplier to Tesla Inc, increasingly demand more purified versions of lithium that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery\u2019s charge, shaping Albemarle\u2019s strategy, according to sources and documents reviewed by Reuters and confirmed by the company.  Once used primarily as a pharmacological treatment for bipolar disorder, lithium has become one of the world\u2019s most in-demand commodities thanks to the rising popularity of electric vehicles powered by lithium-ion batteries.  Roughly 500,000 electric vehicles were sold globally in 2016, a figure that is expected to jump sevenfold by 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Albemarle\u2019s strategy, which includes developing a battery research center near its North Carolina headquarters, is aimed at setting it apart from its major competitors, including Chile\u2019s SQM and China\u2019s Tianqi Lithium Corp.  Albemarle has historically sold basic types of lithium under short-term contracts, much like rivals. Now, the company is diverging from rivals and developing dozens of lithium products that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery\u2019s charge.  \u201cWhat we are doing is not a moonshot, but rather just good engineering,\u201d Albemarle\u2019s lithium unit head, Eric Norris, said at a private dinner earlier this summer attended by State Street Global Advisors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other top shareholders, according to two sources.  As more lithium production comes online in the Americas and Asia, concerns about oversupply are high, making a push into specialized lithium a crucial step for Albemarle.  \u201cLithium is much more a specialty chemical than a mined product,\u201d said Joe Lowry, an independent lithium industry consultant. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a commodity because it\u2019s not a fungible good.\u201d  Albemarle is now trying to use its technical know-how and clout to forge customer partnerships that it hopes guarantee profit for decades.  \u201cIf every new lithium project that\u2019s been announced does come online, that could cause market oversupply,\u201d said Deutsche Bank mining analyst Chris Terry. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of bearishness in the market and differentiation is the key to success.\u201d  R&D  By treating the metal with various chemicals and other processing steps, lithium\u2019s chemical structure can be rearranged to boost electricity storage and increase charge, which Albemarle hopes will make it even more indispensable to battery makers and the electric car industry, Norris told the investor dinner.  \u201cBattery requirements are becoming more stringent and there is a definitive move toward higher energy density batteries,\u201d Albemarle spokeswoman Hailey Cobb said.  Longer term, Albemarle is studying so-called \u201csolid state\u201d batteries, which contains no liquid and theoretically can store more electricity than the lithium ion battery, Norris told investors.  While solid-state batteries are not expected to replace lithium ion batteries as the industry standard, they are seen as a promising technological evolution. And importantly for Albemarle, they will consume even more lithium.  So far, Wall Street is rooting for Albemarle\u2019s success. Seventeen of the 22 analysts that cover the stock recommend buying it. As an average, that same group thinks the stock should be trading 33 percent above current levels, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Albemarle agrees and earlier this month said it would double its stock buyback for the year to $500 million.  RELATIONSHIPS  The global lithium business is dominated by Albemarle, SQM, Tianqi and FMC Corp, which is spinning off its lithium division this fall as a stand-alone publicly traded company.  SQM has stated publicly a goal of supplanting Albemarle as the world\u2019s biggest lithium producer by the next decade, which Albemarle says is not a concern.  \u201cWe are not interested in being the largest; we are concerned about meeting the needs of our customers and being the most profitable lithium company in the world,\u201d said Hobb.  But some on Wall Street are spooked, with shares of Albemarle down 25 percent this year.  \u201cLithium has become the centerpiece for the future of the company,\u201d said Chip Skinner, a portfolio manager with the Royce Funds, which holds Albemarle shares. \u201cBut supply and demand still matter.\u201d  To help retain its crown, the U.S. company is moving customers toward long-term contracts of a decade or more, far longer than the three- to five-year contracts it currently signs. The contracts have an option to reset pricing every year, in contrast to SQM which favors shorter contracts and typically charges spot market prices.  Albemarle also poached former General Electric Co battery scientist Glen Merfeld this spring, and is hiring deputies for Merfeld to help oversee the new battery center.  Norris told large investors that the shift to long-term contracts, which would have a base price guaranteed, could be as long as a decade or more in some cases and secure Albemarle\u2019s 40 percent profit margins, regardless of market forces.  \u201cLithium is a relationship-based business, and Albemarle is betting that brings it success in the long-run,\u201d said Chris Berry, an independent energy metals analyst based in New York.

FILE PHOTO: Brine pools from a lithium mine, that belongs U.S.-based Albemarle Corp, is seen on the Atacama salt flat in the Atacama desert, Chile, August 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Ivan Alvarado\/File Photo  SEA said in a resolution on Monday that Albemarle\u2019s environmental impact statement, which included plans to build a new plant to produce 42,500 tonnes of lithium carbonate in northern Chile, lacked key information to gauge the project\u2019s impact, prompting an \u201cearly termination\u201d of its review.  \u201cThe applicant [Albemarle] does not present the details necessary to rule out significant adverse impacts on the quantity and quality of renewable natural resources, including the soil, water and air,\u201d the regulator concluded in the Nov. 12 resolution, which was first reported by Reuters.  The regulator said Albemarle also failed to adequately consider threats to the Peruvian tern, an endangered species of bird that inhabits the region.  Albemarle\u2019s expansion has been closely scrutinized by regulators in Chile, who have increasingly cracked down on water use by both copper and lithium miners in the Salar de Atacama, which lies at the heart of the world\u2019s driest desert.  The company filed the environmental impact statement in September, detailing plans to build the new plant near the northern Chilean coastal port of Mejillones, as well as six new solar evaporation pools in the salar, which lies close to the border with Bolivia and Argentina.  Albemarle has told both regulators and investors the upgrades would boost output without using more lithium-rich brine, or saltwater, from the environmentally sensitive salt flats.  The September plan modified Albemarle\u2019s original Phase 3 plant expansion project, whose environmental impact assessment was approved in 2017, according to the Monday filing.  Albemarle Chief Executive Luke Kissam said in an earnings call last week that the Phase 3 and 4 projects were proceeding according to plan, but said the company had frozen engineering work on subsequent Phase 5 and 6 projects.  In an emailed response to Reuters, Albemarle said this week\u2019s decision pertained to its Phase 5 and 6 projects, \u201cwhich we already announced is on hold during last week\u2019s earnings call.\u201d  Monday\u2019s filing rejecting Albemarle\u2019s environmental impact statement did not appear to reference the Phase 5 or 6 projects. It was not immediately clear why there was a discrepancy between the regulatory filing and Albemarle\u2019s response.  The company has five days to appeal the decision, SEA said in its resolution.  Plans by Albemarle and top competitor SQM SQM_pb.SN to expand production at the Salar de Atacama are deemed critical to maintaining global supply amid spiking demand for lithium, a key ingredient in batteries that power everything from cell phones to electric vehicles.  Howard Klein, a lithium analyst and partner with New York-based RK Equity, said the regulatory decision suggested brine-based lithium suppliers would continue to face hurdles in boosting output.  \u201cFrom a market point of view, this should be positive for lithium prices,\u201d Klein said. \u201cBut ultimately, this is a reminder that brines are environmentally, technically and geopolitically challenging.\u201d  In September, Chile\u2019s nuclear commission, which oversees the sales and export of lithium in Chile, denied Albemarle\u2019s request for an additional increase to its production quota for the ultralight battery metal.

Asked by investors when the cost cutting would start, Kissam said it was not yet clear and promised answers at the company\u2019s annual investor day, planned for early December.  Despite the challenging market, Albemarle has no problems honoring existing contracts and is able to boost production should market conditions improve, Kissam said.

Albemarle said last year it had developed a process that would more than triple its lithium output in Chile without using more water, in what would be a tantalizing development for the arid region where the white metal is produced.  \u201cIf successful, and we have seen no doubt to indicate that it won\u2019t be, the project would allow us to produce more lithium from the same amount of brine that we pump a day,\u201d Chief Executive Luke Kissam said on a Thursday conference call after the company released its third-quarter results.  Reuters reported earlier this week that the claim was drawing increased scrutiny from regulators and investors pushing for more details.  On the same call, Kissam said Albemarle will stop engineering work on its planned La Negra V and VI expansion projects because it believes battery producers will want more lithium hydroxide, a type of the metal commonly found in Australia but not Chile.  Albemarle has authorization from Chilean officials to produce the equivalent of up to 80,000 tonnes annually of lithium through 2043. The La Negra V and VI projects would have taken the production above that mark, requiring regulatory approval. But when Albemarle asked for permission, regulators began delving into just how the new process works, ultimately rejecting the application for lack of details. Albemarle has said it will re-apply.  \u201cAll (Chilean regulators) want to see is some proof that it\u2019s going to work before they give (approval to produce more lithium) to us. That\u2019s it. It is not a big deal, OK? It\u2019s not a big deal. And we only need it if we build\u201d La Negra V and VI, Kissam told analysts.  Despite canceling parts of the La Negra expansion, Albemarle said it will continue to spend money to research and engineer the new technology, though it gave few details on the amount or timing. In 2017, Albemarle said that the new technology had already been developed.  \u201cIn our spending, our capital spending guidance, we are spending for that technology. That continues onwards,\u201d Eric Norris, head of Albemarle\u2019s lithium division, said on the call.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle on Wednesday posted a better-than-expected forecast helped in part by price hikes, though Hurricane Florence closed processing facilities in North Carolina for a week, denting volumes.  Shares fell 2.2 percent to $105.55 in Thursday afternoon trading.

The company said last month it would cut costs in response to challenging market conditions, but had not specified an amount.  Albemarle did not provide any further details on the program on Wednesday.  Supply of lithium, used to power electric vehicles, has outpaced demand which dampened in recent months following global trade tensions, scaling back of electric vehicle subsidies in China and higher production of the battery metal.  Albemarle reported an adjusted profit of $1.53 per share for the third quarter, in line with its preliminary estimates last month when it had also cut profit and sales forecast for the year.

Ellen Lenny-Pessagno, Country Manager of Albemarle Corporation, poses for a photo before an interview with Reuters in Santiago, Chile February 5, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlos Vera  The previously unreported move is an indication of how important it has become for miners to prove their supplies of the so-called \u201cwhite gold\u201d battery metal are sustainable as they court automakers preparing for the coming electric vehicle revolution.  Car companies have ratcheted up scrutiny in the Atacama, by far the biggest source of supply in South America\u2019s so-called \u201clithium triangle,\u201d where one lithium producer is locked in a court battle over pumping of brine and a copper miner has opted for pricey desalination over drawing water from local aquifers.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a scrutiny of how lithium is being produced, and particularly, in the Salar de Atacama,\u201d Ellen Lenny-Pessagno, Albemarle\u2019s Chile manager, told Reuters in an interview in capital city Santiago. \u201cThey want data.\u201d  She said a team from Germany's biggest car maker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE - which expects to produce 1.5 million electric autos by 2025 - visited the Atacama last month to scope out the social and environmental impact of mining operations there.  A source at Volkswagen, who asked not to be named, confirmed a recent trip had been made to Chile to check on local conditions. The carmaker declined to comment.  That came after a Chilean judge sided with local indigenous communities and knocked back an environmental remediation plan from top rival SQM SQMA.SN in December, warning of \"fragility\" in the Atacama's ecosystem.  \u201cDeveloping a greener world can\u2019t come at the cost of an entire territory... and culture,\u201d said Juan Carlos Cayo, an attorney for communities in Atacama, following that decision.  The battle for water in Chile\u2019s salt flats has intensified. Residents and environmental groups worry that mining of lithium and copper is damaging a regional ecosystem home to an ancient indigenous culture and turquoise lagoons inhabited with rare pink Chilean flamingos.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  For Albemarle, the world\u2019s largest producer of lithium, resolving the water issue is a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d, Lenny-Pessagno said, adding the firm was open to working with other miners on the matter including rival SQM.  \u201cWhatever happens in the salar will ultimately impact our business,\u201d she said, confirming the plan for a two-decade monitoring network, beyond what its environmental permits call for, to get a fuller picture of the issue.  SQM said it too was constantly \u201cseeking to improve its production and make it increasingly sustainable.\u201d  \u201cThe company supports any initiative that gives more transparency,\u201d SQM said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday.  A separate, government-funded study intended to bolster publicly available information about the salt flat has been repeatedly delayed since 2018, sowing uncertainty. A spokeswoman for Chile development agency Corfo, which is managing that process, said the report was nearing completion.  HIDDEN IN THE BRINE  Salt-rich brine holds in suspension the lithium that automakers covet. Miners use freshwater beneath the flats for industrial processes. Both water and brine are scarce commodities in the world\u00b4s driest desert.  Last week miner BHP BHP.AX scrapped plans to continue pumping water from the Atacama basin to feed its massive Escondida copper mine, the world's largest. It said it would use desalinated water instead.  Albemarle, too, shelved longer-term plans to expand its operations at Atacama following questions from regulators in 2018 about technologies that would allow the company to produce more lithium without pumping more brine.  Rival SQM\u2019s operations are also in limbo after a plan to lessen its environmental impact was thrown out by judges who said a green light from regulators had relied on junk science and warned about a \u201chigh level of scientific uncertainty\u201d about the behavior of the Atacama\u2019s water table.  SQM has criticized the court\u2019s ruling and appealed to the Supreme Court. A decision is pending.  Lenny-Pessagno said Albemarle\u2019s near-term focus would be developing technologies to extract more lithium from the brine it already had permits for. She said the company had \u201cno intention of asking to increase our pumping rate.\u201d  She confirmed plans to open the La Negra III and IV lithium processing plants in Chile by next year, boosting the firm\u2019s production capacity in the country to 85,000 tonnes.  Last May, Albemarle announced a project to boost its Atacama lithium production by 30% without extracting more brine.  When asked if that technology, or others, might help revive plans to produce over 85,000 tonnes, she said both the market and technology would dictate timing.  \u201cThese technological improvements take time, it\u2019s still a work in progress. We want to be rational in terms of what our goals are,\u201d she said."}}
