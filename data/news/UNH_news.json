JPMorgan Chase & Co gained 1.9% after beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit by a wide margin, underpinned by strength in bond trading, underwriting and home lending revenue.  But Goldman Sachs slipped 0.9% as it reported a 27% slump in quarterly profit, hit by lower fees from advising on deals and weakness in underwriting.  Collectively, banks are expected to report a 1.2% decline in earnings, their first year-on-year drop in three, due in part to low interest rates and trade tensions.  Wells Fargo and Citigroup are also due to report on Tuesday, followed by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley later this week.  Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc and Johnson & Johnson rose 2.9% and 1.7%, respectively. The healthcare companies reported strong quarterly results and raised their full-year profit forecasts.  The earnings reports will indicate the fallout from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war on U.S. companies. The tit-for-tat tariff moves have already hit domestic manufacturing, dented business sentiment and rankled financial markets.  S&P 500 companies were set to report their weakest quarterly performance in about three years for the September quarter, with industrial companies among those most at risk from the trade dispute.  President Donald Trump announced a partial trade deal with China on Friday, but concerns linger as no agreement has been signed yet and most tariffs on Chinese imports remain in effect.  The S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes, which gained nearly 2% last month, are off about 0.4% in October. The benchmark index is now more than 2% away from its record high after coming within striking distance in September.  At 7:00 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 102 points, or 0.38%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 10 points, or 0.34% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 24.25 points, or 0.31%.  Other companies reporting results this week include Netflix Inc, Abbott Laboratories and Union Pacific .  Shares of BlackRock Inc, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, rose slightly after its quarterly profit beat analysts\u2019 estimates.  Home-furnishing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc was up 4% after Keybanc upgraded the stock to \u201coverweight\u201d.  Shares of mobile game developer Glu Mobile jumped 9% as it is set to replace SolarEdge Technologies in the S&P SmallCap 600.  On a sour note, U.S. advertising company Omnicom Group Inc dropped 0.9% after falling short of estimates for quarterly revenue.

In comparison, rivals UnitedHealth UNH.N and Centene Corp CNC.N have warned of continuing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Committing to a growth rate for next year above the levels discussed by peers, reflects Humana\u2019s leverage to the Medicare Advantage business, Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said.  Shares of Humana were up 4.09% at $425.80.  Humana said enrollment in individual Medicare Advantage health plans for people older than 65 or with disabilities, would grow by about 9% to 10% in 2021.  It also said the business will benefit from permanently repealing industry-wide health insurer fee (HIF), put in place to help implement former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, next year.  Humana expects the midpoint of its 2021 adjusted profit per share range to be at least 15% above its initial 2020 forecast of $18.50.  It also tightened its adjusted profit outlook for 2020 to $18.50 and $18.75 per share, compared with its previous estimate of $18.25 to $18.75, as it benefited from a slower recovery in demand for healthcare services, delayed during the height of the pandemic.  The company, which beat third-quarter profit estimates on deferred medical care, said it expected to post adjusted loss per share of $2.40 in the fourth quarter due to normalizing demand for discretionary healthcare services and COVID-19 testing and treatment costs.  Humana said it saw an increase in the use of COVID-19 related healthcare services in the third quarter and expected costs related to testing and treatment for the respiratory illness to touch $1 billion in 2020.","2":"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N will stick with its decision to pass on drug maker discounts to patients to help them beat rising medicine prices despite the U.S. government having withdrawn a similar proposed policy in its health programs, its top executive said on Thursday.  \u201cYou can expect us not to change our stance on rebates,\u201d Chief Executive Officer David Wichmann said on a conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings.  UnitedHealth shares were down $5.65, or 2%, at $260.94 in morning trading, after earlier rising about 1% in premarket trading on news the company beat estimates for quarterly profit and boosted its forecast for 2019 earnings.  The share decline came after the conference call, in which the company said 2019 revenue would not hit the company\u2019s original target.  \u201cWe think UnitedHealth is underperforming the peers today likely because on the call, they guided 2019 revenues to now be \u2018at or slightly below\u2019 the prior revenue guidance range of $243-245 billion,\u201d Scott Fidel an analyst at Stephens said.  Two analysts and one investor said the decision to stick with its point-of-sale rebates did not seem to be linked to the share price fall.  UnitedHealth said in March its pharmacy-benefit management unit OptumRx would only sell new health plans that give the after-market discounts it negotiates with drugmakers directly to patients. About 9 million of its customers are in such plans this year.The company is the first U.S. health insurer to report quarterly results after the Trump administration last week shelved its proposal to pass billions of dollars in rebates to Medicare patients.  Pharmacy benefits managers receive after-market discounts from drug companies and allow their clients, such as large employers, to incorporate them into overall premium pricing or share them with patients.  Wichmann said the government\u2019s decision showed that the Trump administration values pharmacy benefit managers as a \u201ccounterbalance\u201d to drug prices.  UnitedHealth and other insurers still face other potential health policy changes and pressure as rising healthcare costs take the center stage in debates ahead of the 2020 U.S. presidential elections.  Some Democratic candidates have proposed a complete ban on private health insurance in favor of a government-run Medicare-for-all plan.  REVENUE OUTLOOK LOWERED  UnitedHealth Chief Financial Officer John Rex said he expects 2019 revenue to be \u201cat or just slightly below\u201d its previously given range of $243 billion to $245 billion in 2019.  UnitedHealth raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to between $14.70 and $14.90 per share, from an earlier forecast of between $14.50 and $14.75 per share.  The company\u2019s medical care ratio, or the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services, worsened to 83.1%, from 81.9% a year earlier. Analysts had expected 83%.  Net earnings attributable to shareholders rose 12.7% to $3.29 billion, or $3.42 per share, in the three months ended June 30.  Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned $3.60 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.45, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","3":"March 14 (Reuters) -  * UNITEDHEALTH IS SAID TO DROP OUT OF BIDDING FOR ENVISION HEALTH - BLOOMBERG, CITING SOURCE Source text: bloom.bg\/2FTtHzO Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","4":"NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Prominent hedge fund managers appeared to make big first-quarter bets in UnitedHealth Group Inc, Anthem Inc and other health insurers whose shares tumbled in January after Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon in January announced a joint venture to slash U.S. healthcare costs.  Jana Partners added a new position in Anthem, while Omega Advisors and Tiger Management both added new positions in UnitedHealth Group, according to regulatory filings released Tuesday. Shares of Anthem are 10.5 percent below the high for the year reached in January, while shares of UnitedHealth are 3.1 percent below January highs.  Shares of healthcare companies have come under pressure this year due to the threat of increased competition. Buffett, famed for his love of junk food, has said spiraling healthcare costs are responsible for 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, up from 5 percent in 1960, and he wants to slash a few percentage points off.  The partnership between Amazon.com Inc, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, and JPMorgan Chase & Co - which collectively employ more than 1 million people - announced plans to reform healthcare for their own employees while simultaneously reducing their own companies\u2019 coverage costs, though it has yet to make significant progress.  \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a CEO within a couple of months,\u201d Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual shareholder\u2019s meeting earlier this month. \u201cWe want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost ... The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.\u201d  At the same time, shares of pharmacy benefits managers Express Scripts Holdings Co and CVS Health Corp have slid on concerns that Amazon.com Inc will enter the business. Glenview Capital Management Chief Executive Larry Robbins made a bullish case for both stocks at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York on April 23, one of the most prominent hedge fund conferences of the year.  Amazon\u2019s entry into the business of selling medications, is \u201cneither imminent, assured, nor likely to succeed,\u201d he said.  Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers\u2019 stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.  Along with the bets on healthcare companies, large hedge fund managers also added to so-called FANG stocks during the first quarter as the tech sector slid due to fears of increased regulatory oversight. Jana Partners added a new position in Apple Inc while selling all of its shares in Facebook Inc, while Tiger Management added to its positions in Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook.  Overall, hedge funds are up by an average of 0.4 percent for the year to date, according to Hedge Fund Research, while the broad S&P 500 is up 1.2 percent over the same time.

The Food and Drug Administration last month authorized emergency use of bamlanivimab for treating non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are at risk of becoming severely ill, either because they are over the age of 65 or because they have underlying health conditions such as diabetes.  UnitedHealth is inviting members of its Medicare Advantage program to volunteer for the study. Study participants who indicate they have symptoms of COVID-19 and test positive will be administered bamlanivimab, which is given by intravenous infusion, by a nurse sent to their home.  By treating people as early as possible in the course of illness, the study aims to determine if Lilly\u2019s drug reduces the severity of COVID-19, UnitedHealth\u2019s chief scientific officer, Ken Ehlert, said on a conference call.

In recent years, insurers have tried to guide patients toward less expensive treatments by making them pay a higher portion of a drug\u2019s costs.  Drugmakers have responded by dramatically raising the financial aid by increasingly offering the so-called \u2018copay assistance\u2019 cards, similar to a debit card, that consumers can use at the pharmacy counter to reduce their out-of-pocket costs.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  UnitedHealth is the first health insurer to report earnings, and Wall Street investors took their cue from the slight costs miss to sell shares in Anthem Inc, Cigna Corp and Humana Inc.  The Trump administration has begun to issue new rules and regulations to roll back some of the insurance coverage expansion that took place with Obamacare, former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2010 health law, and implementing new laws. UnitedHealth said it expects the debate to continue into 2019.  The government also wants to bring down high drug prices, including examining if the role of pharmacy benefit managers like UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum contributes to those price increases. The company said it is trying to lower prices on drugs for customers.  UnitedHealth\u2019s medical loss ratio, or the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services, was 81.9 percent in the quarter, short of the consensus estimate of 81.8 percent, according to healthcare investment bank Leerink.  While the ratio was actually better than the 82.2 percent a year ago, the company typically beats Wall Street estimates.

The logo of Down Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company UnitedHealthcare is shown in Cypress, California April 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The insurer\u2019s quarterly profit beat estimates as it kept medical costs within estimates and it raised its 2018 outlook.  Shares of UnitedHealth rose 3.1 percent to $237.46 and boosted other stocks in the sector on hopes that rivals would also release robust results over the next few weeks.  \u201cUnitedHealth certainly sets the tone for the group ... investors tend to look at United as the bellwether for the other companies,\u201d Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper said.  Anthem Inc ANTM.N rose 2.3 percent at $230.48, Humana Inc HUM.N was up 2.4 percent at $296.80 and Cigna Corp CI.N added 1 percent at $175.48 after rising as high as $177.81.  Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said UnitedHealth\u2019s report eased Wall Street\u2019s worries about the impact of the bad flu season, which raised insurer costs as more patients visited doctors and were admitted to the hospital.  Other potential negatives for UnitedHealth - such as federal regulation of the pharmacy benefit management business, drug pricing reform and the feared entry of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O into the pharmacy distribution business - have not materialized.  \u201cNone of that seems to be happening,\u201d Gupte said.  One of UnitedHealth\u2019s first-quarter strengths was its ability to control medical costs. The medical care ratio, or the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services, improved to 81.4 percent from 82.4 percent a year earlier.  The company expects to keep the ratio at 81.5 percent in 2018, plus or minus 50 basis points, its chief financial officer said on a conference call.  PROFIT TOPS ESTIMATE  UnitedHealth raised its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $12.40 to $12.65 per share from $12.30 to $12.60.  Aside from its large health insurance division, UnitedHealth has other businesses, such as Optum, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager, data analysis and physician groups.  UnitedHealth has added more doctors, urgent care centers and surgery centers via acquisitions, which helped drive growth during the first quarter.  The expansion of the noninsurance businesses comes as the healthcare industry addresses annual increases in costs for medical services and pharmaceuticals by moving services out of more expensive hospitals into less expensive settings, such as clinics.  Other insurers have proposed deals that would allow them to compete with UnitedHealth in these areas.  Aetna Inc AET.N is expected to be bought for $69 billion by CVS Health Corp CVS.N, the pharmacy chain and benefit manager, and smaller rival Cigna Corp CI.N has proposed acquiring Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O, the largest U.S. independent pharmacy benefit manager, for $54 billion.  UnitedHealth\u2019s net earnings rose to $2.84 billion, or $2.87 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $2.17 billion, or $2.23 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned $3.04 per share while total revenue rose 13.3 percent to $55.19 billion.  Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $2.89 per share on revenue of $54.86 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.","21":"(Reuters) - A federal judge has ruled the U.S. Justice Department can move forward with a lawsuit claiming UnitedHealth Group Inc wrongly retained more than $1 billion from the government healthcare program Medicare.  U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald in Los Angeles on Monday ruled that the department had sufficiently alleged UnitedHealth submitted invalid diagnostic data related to the health status of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.  But Fitzgerald dismissed claims that the insurer falsely attested to the data\u2019s validity, saying the key allegation that those assurances affected payment decisions by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was \u201cmissing.\u201d  Fitzgerald said that while the data itself appeared to be material to the agency\u2019s payment decisions, the allegations regarding the assurances UnitedHealth made about the data \u201cdo not suggest they are likely to influence the payment of money.\u201d  UnitedHealth in a statement on Tuesday said it rejects the Justice Department\u2019s remaining claims and will continue contesting them. The Justice Department had no immediate comment.  Fitzgerald\u2019s decision to dismiss part of the case was based on a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding what must be alleged under the False Claims Act to prove a company\u2019s false statement was material to the government paying it.  That law allows the government and whistleblowers suing on its behalf to recover taxpayer money paid to companies based on fraudulent claims.  If successful, whistleblowers receive a percentage of the recovery. The government may intervene in whistleblower lawsuits, typically a major boost to those cases.  Last year, the Justice Department intervened in a lawsuit brought by former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling, whose whistleblower case was filed under seal in 2011.  The Justice Department said UnitedHealth obtained inflated risk adjustment payments based on untruthful and inaccurate information about the health of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.  More than one-third of Medicare recipients are in Advantage plans run by private insurers like UnitedHealth.  The lawsuit said UnitedHealth failed to repay the Medicare program by over $1.14 billion from 2011 to 2014.  The case was one of two that the Justice Department announced last year against UnitedHealth related to payments it received for patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.  But a federal judge in October dismissed the other case, saying the government failed to allege CMS would have refused to make payments to UnitedHealth if it had known all the facts.  The case is U.S. ex rel. Poehling v.

The lower MLR is below consensus and much closer to normal after hitting 70.2% in the second quarter, but availing health care services remained below pre-pandemic levels, Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said.

The move by UnitedHealth and its pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) unit OptumRx comes amid widespread government scrutiny in the United States over the industry-wide system of after-market discounts or rebates.  \u201cIt is clear that UnitedHealth is taking the potential industry rebate shift into its own hands and trying to insulate itself from any upcoming regulation or legislation on rebates,\u201d Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a client note.  The health insurer earlier this year began passing the rebates to about 9 million consumers enrolled in health plans, helping them save an average of $130 per eligible prescription.  Existing members would have the choice of adopting this plan during contract renewal, the company said, adding that it will now offer only this option for new customers.  Insurers like UnitedHealth have traditionally combined all the discounts that they receive from drugmakers into one big pool of money and incorporated it when they set a health plan\u2019s premium prices.  But because of rising drug prices, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been pressured to give the discount directly to the patient who is buying the drug.  Eliminating after-market discounts has been a key element of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration plan to lower prescription medicine costs. It had in January proposed a rule to end rebates in a bid to lower prescription drug costs.  Drugmakers say they are under pressure to provide rebates to the three PBMs that dominate the market in order to have their drugs included on preferred coverage lists, ensuring patients can access them.","42":"Feb 14 (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management Llc:  * SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC TAKES SHARE STAKE OF 18,078 CLASS A SHARES IN MASTERCARD INC - SEC FILING  * SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC DISSOLVES SHARE STAKE IN DOMINION ENERGY INC  * SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC CUTS SHARE STAKE IN UNITEDHEALTH GROUP INC BY 11.1 PERCENT TO 120,000 SHARES  * SOROS FUND MANAGEMENT LLC - CHANGE IN HOLDINGS ARE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND COMPARED WITH THE PREVIOUS QUARTER ENDED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 Source for the quarter ended December 31, 2019: bit.ly\/37sCIJV Source for the quarter ended September 30, 2019: bit.ly\/2QkGgc4","43":"WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc won antitrust approval to buy DaVita Inc\u2019s primary and urgent care unit for $4.3 billion, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.

The logo of Walmart is pictured at one of their stores in Monterrey, Mexico March 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  LATEST  - Walmart\u2019s Black November  - JPMorgan\u2019s building  NOVEMBER IS THE NEW BLACK. The pandemic is creating a million problems, but Black Friday isn\u2019t one. Retail giant Walmart plans to spread its U.S. holiday sale, which typically happens the day after Thanksgiving, over several days in November, some of that online. One reason is to help keep stores clean and uncrowded.  That will make for a curious experiment in the science of shopping extravaganzas. Black Friday works on the principle that buyers come for a single blockbuster deal, and stock up on gifts for Uncle Mitch and Aunt Sally while they\u2019re at it. What\u2019s not clear is whether that creates new demand, or just reschedules buying that would have happened anyway.  This time round, investors can get a peek at what happens when a retailer tries out multiple fiestas, online and off. Shoppers may be too rational to take the bait. But with the company\u2019s shares dramatically lagging Amazon.com, Home Depot, and the S&P 500 Index over the last six months, Walmart might as well give it a try.

JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon told reporters on Tuesday that even though only one-fifth of his New York employees are back in the office, he remains committed to a new $3 billion headquarters on Park Avenue. It\u2019s contrarian, and basically in character.  Digital aspirations notwithstanding, JPMorgan still has a taste for old-world assets. It\u2019s still selectively opening new branches, even though online banking has made them less necessary. Dimon, whose senior traders were called back as early as September, also says he favors an intelligent return to work.  He is probably onto something: the pendulum swung one way, but will partly swing back. Besides, some things don\u2019t go out of fashion, like the thrill of being a bigger blot on the landscape than your rival. Dimon\u2019s rockpile will be a clear 200 feet taller than Bank of America\u2019s beveled tower just 10 minutes\u2019 walk away. What better reason to keep building? (By John Foley)  MARKET POWER. UnitedHealth has a habit of beating earnings estimates, and the $315 billion company did it again in the third quarter as revenue grew 8%. The U.S. health insurer also raised its earnings guidance for the full year. While the pandemic has been good for UnitedHealth and its rivals \u2013 closed doctors\u2019 offices and postponed surgeries mean they still collect premiums but shell out less on patients\u2019 treatments \u2013 it\u2019s also an illustration of something more durable.  The company is the biggest in a concentrated industry. For example, the individual insurance market in nearly every U.S. state is highly concentrated according to the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, one measure of how competitive markets are. That allows high returns, and UnitedHealth\u2019s year-to-date return on equity is nearly 30%. This may be unusually high, but the company\u2019s 10-year stock performance underlines the broader point. Shareholders have made more than 10 times their money, including dividends, twice as much as owners of Google parent Alphabet over a decade. Maybe Washington\u2019s lawmakers should look beyond Big Tech for their antitrust targets. (By Robert Cyran)  TWISTS AND TURNS. Infrastructure investors have spotted a pandemic opportunity. Blackstone and Macquarie are teaming up with Italian state arm Cassa Depositi e Prestiti to buy 88% of troubled motorway operator ASPI from Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family. The consortium is looking to pay up to 10 billion euros for the stake, Il Messaggero reported.  Atlantia agreed in July to a government demand to relinquish control of ASPI but rejected the proposed financial terms. On Tuesday it said would consider a CDP-led offer. A deal would end a ferocious dispute with Rome following the fatal collapse of a motorway bridge in 2018. It would also mark the latest deal for CDP, which in recent weeks acquired a stake in exchange operator Euronext and became the largest shareholder of merged payments groups Nexi and Sia. With no other bidders likely to challenge CDP, Blackstone and Macquarie may get a bargain by jumping on the state bandwagon. (By Lisa Jucca)  KEEP CALM AND CASH IN. The creator of a popular app for meditation and sleep is looking to raise $150 million at a $2.2 billion valuation, more than twice its previous value, according to Bloomberg. Like Zoom Video Communications and Netflix, Calm is a coronavirus success story. The app, which features guided meditation exercises as well as sleep stories from celebrities like Matthew McConaughey, has seen a burst of engagement during the crisis, with almost 4 million downloads in April, well over twice as many as its nearest competitor.  That\u2019s unsurprising, as insomnia and anxiety are rampant. Prescriptions for sleep medication in the U.S. jumped about 15% between mid-February and mid-March as the pandemic took hold, according to Express Scripts. And the pandemic has had a negative impact on people\u2019s sleep and psychological state in China, according to a study published in Sleep Medicine. If traders could go long on anxiety, they would, and Calm may be the nearest thing. (By Anna Szymanski)  GLASS DARKLY. Europe\u2019s semiconductor behemoth ASML made up for lost time in the third quarter. After a disappointing first half, when Covid-19 made it trickier to ship its chip-building kit to Asian customers, revenue grew by 33% year-on-year in the three months to Sept. 30. Peter Wennink, chief executive of the 144 billion euro group, reckons long-term trends like 5G mobile data and artificial intelligence will increase the need for his equipment, which uses ultraviolet light to transfer tiny designs onto chips.  That jars with his vision for 2021, however. Wennink expects revenue to grow by a \u201clow double-digit\u201d percentage, usually code for just over 10%. Analysts were hoping for almost 15%, going by the median Refinitiv estimate. ASML\u2019s shares now trade at an 11% premium to the global semiconductor sector, compared with 29% on average over the past five years. Wennink\u2019s optimism isn\u2019t necessarily shared. (By Liam Proud)  SLUGGISH FASHION. ASOS\u2019s pandemic boom may soon fizzle out. The online retailer reaped the benefits of having a captive market for selling its throwaway skirts and tops as lockdown forced high-street rivals to shut their doors. ASOS said on Wednesday that its full-year pre-tax profit surged to 142.1 million pounds in the year to Aug. 31, from 33.1 million pounds a year earlier. It also reckons there is more room for improvement.  Such optimism may be misguided. Consumers are facing a dramatic rise in unemployment. In Britain, which accounted for over a third of its 3.3 billion pounds of sales, a government scheme that covers 80% of the salary costs of furloughed staff will be dramatically scaled back at the end of October. Companies may decide to cull staff instead of signing up to the new, less generous, programme. Selling to customers who are having to watch every penny will be a much harder task.

Qantas Airways has launched a new line of expensive athleisure clothing designed by Australian Martin Grant, which features T-shirts, hoodies and cashmere sweaters, two months after it reported a net loss of nearly A$2 billion ($1.41 billion) for the 12 months to June.  This is not the airline\u2019s first creative sales foray. In September, the company successfully sold off fully stocked booze trolleys from its retired Boeing 747 planes, after selling care packages containing business-class pyjamas.

Healthcare spending, which had returned to more normal levels early in the quarter, rose in late November and December with the spike in COVID-19 costs, the company said on a conference call.

The FTC approved the deal on condition that it sell a Las Vegas facility to Utah-based to Intermountain Healthcare.  The deal was announced in December 2017 as $4.9 billion but was reduced last December to $4.3 billion.  DaVita will be rolled into UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum unit, which has some 30,000 physicians.

For the most part of last year, health insurers gained as people afraid of contracting the virus also avoided hospital visits for routine and elective medical procedures during the height of the pandemic.  UnitedHealth reported a medical loss ratio - the percentage of premiums paid out for medical services - of 79.1% for 2020, improving from 82.5% a year earlier, capped by COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccine costs.  The company said its profit was impacted by a recovery in demand for healthcare services and rise in costs related to its programs to make COVID-19 testing and treatment more accessible for its customers.

Shares of Morgan Stanley rose 2.6 percent and Goldman Sachs 1.5 percent in premarket trading after the two lenders wrapped up earnings from the top six U.S. banks, with better-than-expected quarterly profits, driven in part by higher equities trading revenue.  UnitedHealth rose 2.1 percent after the health insurer beat estimates for quarterly profit and boosted earnings forecast for the year as it added more members to its health plans.  In what could be a lift for the recently turbulent technology sector, Adobe climbed 5.9 percent after the software company reaffirmed its current-quarter forecast and provided 2019 targets that eased concerns over the impact of a recent acquisition.  \u201cA couple of inputs that caused a selloff off in the last two weeks such as rising interest rates, higher oil prices and the dollar have calmed down to rational levels and the market may be able to positively respond to that as we work our way through the earnings season,\u201d said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York.  \u201cReal focus today is on Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Adobe from last night.\u201d  Strong quarterly earnings from some of the biggest U.S. companies would help soothe nerves of investors who have been fretting over the impact of tariffs, rising interest rates and wage growth among others on corporate profits that have weighed on U.S. stocks this month.  Still, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have risen 21.6 percent in the third quarter, a slowdown from the past two quarters, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  At 8:38 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 191 points, or 0.76 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 19 points, or 0.69 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 67.5 points, or 0.95 percent.  Walmart swung between gains and losses after lowering its earnings forecast for the year and saying its e-commerce growth next year would be slower than the current fiscal year. The retailer\u2019s shares were little changed.  Hogan said focus will certainly be on large-cap tech stocks, with Adobe gaining premarket and reports coming from IBM and Netflix later in the day.  Netflix shares advanced 1.6 percent ahead of its earnings report, expected after the bell. The video streaming company will be the first to issue results among the high-flying FAANG group of stocks, which were at the center of last week\u2019s selloff.

The company in August announced a review of its options, including putting itself up for sale, in the wake of customer losses in its pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business.  Diplomat\u2019s recent woes were driven mainly by insurers aggressively directing scripts to their own in-house specialty pharmacies, which will now be mitigated with the company under the UnitedHealth roof, according to Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Insurers have gained financially as Americans have cut back on medical appointments under stay-at-home orders designed to help slow the spread of the virus and allow hospitals and doctors to focus on COVID-19 patients.  UnitedHealth said it would issue credits ranging from 5% to 20% of June monthly premiums to commercial fully-insured employer-based and individual insurance customers.  As part of its plan, UnitedHealth will also waive cost-sharing for specialist and primary physician visits in Medicare Advantage, the government healthcare program for people 65 and older or with disabilities that is managed by private insurers. UnitedHealth will stabilize premiums in its supplementary Medicare plans and expand Medicaid coverage. It has nearly 16 million members in these government plans.  UnitedHealth has 8.2 million members in at-risk insurance plans offered through employers and in individual plans created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The rebates do not apply to its largest business in which it manages health benefits for large employers for a fee and the employer covers the medical costs.  Under the 2010 health law, fully insured health plans are required to spend no less than 80% of the premiums they collect on medical care or must send rebates to customers. But the process to determine rebates takes place over several years, Chief Executive Officer David Wichmann told reporters.  \u201cAs you know, people are hurting right now,\u201d Wichmann said.  He said only a portion of the credits are related to the ACA requirement.  Wichmann said the company expected that deferred medical care would continue in the second quarter before returning in the second half of the year, an outlook he gave last month when announcing UnitedHealth\u2019s first-quarter profit.  \u201cSome of it obviously is permanently deferred,\u201d he said, adding that was part of the reason for UnitedHealth\u2019s $1.5 billion spending plan.","101":"(Adds analyst comments, background)  Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc named the head of its Optum unit, Andrew Witty, as its new chief executive officer, replacing David Wichmann, who has been at the helm for just over three years.  The appointment is effective immediately, the company said on Thursday, adding Wichmann, 59, will retire.  Witty, 56, who was the chief executive officer of British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc from 2008 to 2017, had been on an unpaid leave until December to serve as a global envoy for the World Health Organization\u2019s COVID-19 efforts.  The move surprised Wall Street analysts. BMO Capital Markets\u2019 Matt Borsch said investors are likely to respond negatively on uncertainty as Wichmann\u2019s term as CEO seems \u201ccut short\u201d at under 3.5 years.  UnitedHealth\u2019s shares fell 1% to $334.39 on Thursday.  Dirk McMahon, CEO of UnitedHealthcare unit, will be the new president and chief operating officer of the company.  The company declined to comment beyond the press release.  UnitedHealth last month reported higher-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, as medical costs came in lower than Wall Street estimates even with increased spending related to the surge in COVID-19 cases in December.  Witty was named the chief executive officer of the Optum unit, which manages drug benefits and offers healthcare data analytics, in March 2018.  UnitedHealth has been bolstering the business through a string of small deals in the past few years.  Wichmann, who joined the company in 1998 and became CEO in September 2017, will stay through March, the company said.","102":"June 4 (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc:  * UNITEDHEALTH GROUP - $100 MILLION INVESTMENT IN HEALTH & HOUSING FUND Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","103":"Oct 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened higher on Tuesday, as strong earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, UnitedHealth and Johnson & Johnson allayed concerns about the fallout from a prolonged U.S.-China trade war on corporate America.
