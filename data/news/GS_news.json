PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs GS.N will offer clearing facilities for some currency derivative products on the London-based clearing house LCH's ForexClear service, the bank said on Thursday.  Clearing or settling trades via exchanges or clearing houses is well established in equities and other asset classes. But lots of trades in financial products - particularly in the forex market - are still done \u201cover-the-counter\u201d, where there is no central clearing house backing up the deals.  Clearing ensures financial market trades are completed even if one side of the transaction goes wrong.  Centralised clearing is starting to increase in the $6.6 trillion a day foreign exchange market, but this is largely limited to currency futures which make up only a tiny fraction of the total market.  New regulations are gradually making it more expensive for investment banks to trade derivatives and this is encouraging them to send some trades for clearing to exchanges like the CME Group CME.O and the London Stock Exchange LSE.L and its clearing division LCH.  LCH\u2019s ForexClear provides clearing services for currency non-deliverable forwards as well as for the currency options spot and forwards market.  Non-deliverable currency forwards are products where participants take a bet on a currency but settle in a different currency, mostly the U.S. dollar. This has gradually shifted from a bilateral trading model to a more centralised trading structure.  NDFs are the only type of FX derivative which are showing the biggest growth rate in clearing, which has led to a greater concentration of trading in these instruments in the main currency hubs globally, including New York, London, Singapore and Hong Kong.  London dominates market share in NDF trading, with Britain more than doubling its share to 46% in 2019 from 20% in 2016, data from the Bank of International Settlements showed.","1":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

James Katzman, who led the bank's West Coast mergers-and-acquisitions practice, had used the whistle-blower hotline in 2014 to report on the investment bank trying to hire a customer's child and colleagues' repeated attempts to obtain and then share confidential client information, the paper reported nyti.ms\/2CJ9wEq.  The investigation was taken up by the bank\u2019s general counsel and Katzman was urged to move past his complaints by several senior investment banking executives, the newspaper reported, citing several people familiar with the interactions.  Katzman refused and left Goldman in 2015. He was required to sign a confidentiality agreement that he believed prevented him from sharing his concerns with board members or regulators, people close to Katzman told the newspaper.  \u201cA few years ago, Katzman raised several issues through an appropriate outside channel. In accordance with our whistle-blower policy, his concerns were thoroughly investigated by our legal department and it was determined that no additional action was warranted,\u201d Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said in an email.  \u201cAfter that, Katzman chose to leave the firm at his own initiative despite efforts to keep him.\u201d  In May, the bank enlisted reut.rs\/2CJZJOo its top management in a firm-wide initiative on conduct and culture issues.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc climbed 7.3 percent after topping quarterly revenue estimates on strength in equity trading, while Bank of America Corp also posted similar gains after reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit on growth in its loan book.  Their results drove a 1.96 percent gain in the financial sector, with the S&P banking subsector jumping 2.59 percent.  Adding to the positive mood was a $22 billion buyout offer by financial technology provider Fiserv Inc for First Data Corp, the largest deal in the financial technology sector.  First Data Corp shares soared 18.3 percent, while those of Fiserv fell 6.3 percent.  A strong start to the U.S. earnings season, coupled with trade optimism and hopes of a slower pace in interest rate hikes, has helped S&P 500 recoup some of its losses from a recent rout. The index is now about 12 percent away from its Sept. 20 record close.  \u201cThere is hope for this earnings season and Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have got it started off on the right foot,\u201d said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer at Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  \u201cAnything that the market can do to run its normal course of action like mergers and acquisitions, IPO activity will lead to more bullishness.\u201d  U.S. stocks closed up 1 percent on Tuesday, driven by technology and internet stocks as well as hopes of more stimulus for China\u2019s slowing economy  The benchmark index is now close to its 50-day moving average, a key indicator of short-term momentum, for the first time since Dec. 4. This comes after the Nasdaq crossed that milestone in the prior session.  The defensive utilities and consumer staples sectors were the top laggards among the 11 main S&P sectors.  At 11:18 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 148.27 points, or 0.62 percent, at 24,213.86, the S&P 500 was up 10.14 points, or 0.39 percent, at 2,620.44 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 33.33 points, or 0.47 percent, at 7,057.16.  United Airlines rose 7.6 percent after reporting a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street expectations, lifting shares of other airlines.  Still, expectations of fourth-quarter profit growth at S&P 500 companies has come down to 14.3 percent from a 20.1 percent increase forecast in October, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe markets have priced in decelerated earnings but stocks of companies that announce reduced outlooks are going to get hammered,\u201d Dollarhide said.  Nordstrom Inc shares slid 6.7 percent, the most among S&P 500 companies, after forecasting full-year profit at the lower end of its prior estimates.  Also on tap is a no confidence vote for British Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government at 2:00 p.m. ET (1900 GMT) after an overwhelming defeat of her Brexit deal by the parliament left Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union in chaos.  The Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book, a summary of the state of U.S. business across the central bank\u2019s 12 regional districts, is also expected at 2:00 p.m. ET.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.10-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 24 new highs and 11 new lows.

The Iran issue will be part of President Biden\u2019s early talks with foreign counterparts and allies, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.  \u201cDelays in a full return of Iran production would reinforce our bullish oil outlook since we already forecast a tight 2022 crude market with low OPEC spare capacity,\u201d Goldman said.

Instead, Goldman's top rival beat it to the punch.  FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  On Thursday, Morgan Stanley MS.N said it plans to acquire E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O for $13 billion, cementing its position as a hub where individuals manage their finances. If successful, it will be the biggest acquisition by a big Wall Street bank since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  It also underlines Goldman's position as an outlier as the only big U.S. bank to not do any transformative deals during or since that time. Unlike Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N or Bank of America Corp BAC.N, which all executed major transactions during or after the crisis, Goldman looks much the same, analysts say.  Instead of opening its own wallet to expand, Goldman is trying to grow a fledgling retail bank, create a treasury-services business, and expand in asset management, corporate lending and trading \u2014 largely all from the ground up.  Asked about the matter in January, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon dismissed the idea.  \u201cWe\u2019re not out there looking to buy a big bank,\u201d Solomon told Bloomberg TV.  A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on whether Morgan Stanley\u2019s deal affects its own strategy.  Goldman was among a litany of financial firms that were rumored as suitors of E*Trade over the past year or so, as the retail trading firm looked for an acquirer. Analysts who follow Goldman and sources inside the bank have told Reuters it would not be a good deal for a variety of reasons, including technology, culture and price.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock fell 4.5% on Thursday after announcing the deal. Goldman was down 2%.  With Goldman\u2019s stock value weak and with it doing less business with average investors, the E*Trade deal would have been too expensive, said David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors.  \u201cMorgan Stanley is better positioned to acquire E*Trade because of its higher stock valuation and more significant cross-over into its network of brokers and workplace assets than Goldman Sachs,\u201d said Hendler.  Goldman\u2019s share price as of Thursday\u2019s close was 1.1 times its stated tangible book value as of the fourth quarter compared with 1.3 times tangible book value for Morgan Stanley.  Goldman entered the retail space a long time after Morgan Stanley or other U.S. rivals.  It purchased $16 billion worth of deposits from a General Electric Co GE.N subsidiary in 2015, and has since bought a few relatively small companies to expand its presence in retail and wealth management: a personal-finance startup called Clarity Money, a retirement platform called Honest Dollar and an investment-advisory firm called United Capital.  But none of those deals gave Goldman a big pool of retail deposits or other kinds of businesses that could offset a sharp decline in trading revenue.  Michael McTamney, an analyst of big banks and brokers for credit rating service DBRS Morningstar, said Morgan Stanley\u2019s move deal puts more pressure on Goldman.  \u201cGoldman Sachs has, historically, been a build-up-themselves organization as opposed to making acquisitions,\u201d McTamney said. Now there will be more questions from investors about whether acquisitions are needed, he said.  DEALMAKER IN CHIEF  Associates say that Solomon is staking his legacy on turning Goldman into a global, full-service financial services firm that can compete with rivals. His predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein, has expressed regret about not acquiring during the crisis for the same kind of growth  A longtime dealmaker, Solomon became CEO in 2018 and was instrumental in a turnaround plan that preceded his elevation. At Goldman\u2019s first-ever investor day in late January, his management team set ambitious targets to grow the bank\u2019s consumer division over the next five years.  Goldman may be able to do that without an acquisition, but a deal would help, said Dick Bove, a senior research analyst at Odeon Capital.  \u201cIf they acquire a bank, which will bring in low-cost deposits, I think that would be a big plus,\u201d he said.  \u201cGoldman, clearly under Blankfein, missed the boat.\u201d","9":"LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs GS.N plans to expand its retail brand Marcus in Britain this year with more than 65 new staff, a mobile app and more savings products, as part of the group's global shift towards consumer banking.  FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at Marcus, a new savings and loans app recently launched by Goldman Sachs in New York, U.S., January 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  Since its British launch in 2018 Marcus has gobbled up some 13 billion pounds ($16.8 billion) in savings from competitors, by initially offering a market-leading interest rate of 1.5%.  The new hires will be across Marcus\u2019s London office and at its call center in Milton Keynes, north of London, taking the unit\u2019s total headcount to over 300 by the end of this year, from 235 now, Marcus UK\u2019s head Des McDaid told Reuters.  McDaid said he would consider expanding beyond savings products into current accounts, lending and investment products in Britain \u2013 leading to staff numbers increasing \u201cexponentially\u201d.  \u201cYou need a proposition that makes sense and can reach scale, we hope to start looking into that in the second half of the year,\u201d he said.  McDaid said Germany would be the next logical market for Marcus to enter, but that there are no immediate plans to make that move.  Goldman Sachs will launch joint accounts this week, easy access Individual Savings Accounts in the second quarter and its Marcus app by the end of the year, McDaid said.  The U.S. lender has already launched the app in its home market.  Goldman\u2019s push in Britain comes as part of one of the biggest strategic shifts in the U.S. bank\u2019s 151-year history, announced on Jan. 29, as it cuts back in its traditional strengths of trading in favor of consumer banking.  The British unit accounted for over a third of Marcus\u2019s growth last year, as it grew deposits to $60 billion.  McDaid said the bank is looking to fill all of the 250-staff capacity at its Milton Keynes customer support center and could then look to open a second such unit in Britain in the longer term.  The lender is also looking to establish a technology center in either the midlands city of Birmingham or further north in Manchester, he said.  Goldman has announced plans to launch Marcus current accounts by 2021 in the United States, but McDaid said the lender is focused for now on its savings products in Britain.  The current account, or checking, market in British banking is notoriously hard to make profitable on a standalone basis, with customers reluctant to pay for basic accounts and entrenched incumbents like Lloyds LLOY.L and Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L dominating the market.  When it launched last year Marcus initially offered a 1.5% interest rate.  It has since cut it to 1.35%, tempering its growth as it passed the halfway point to the regulatory limit on deposits of 25 billion pounds. Above that level, Goldman would have to ringfence Marcus deposits from its riskier trading arm.","10":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

Any business that supports working from home has benefited to some extent from coronavirus-induced lockdowns. But Slack Technologies, purveyor of a messaging platform that helps organize work, isn\u2019t capitalizing the way Zoom Video Communications, for example, is managing to. In the three months to July, Slack\u2019s top line increased, but growth in billings, an indicator of future revenue, slowed to an annualized 25%.  Concessions to help users through Covid-19 didn\u2019t help, but Slack also faces plenty of competition, whether from video services like Zoom or bigger rivals like Microsoft, whose Teams software provides similar functionality to Slack.

According to corporate-governance consultancy Georgeson, a respective 44%, 51% and 28% of firms in those countries slashed dividends. But only 29%, 29% and none cut executive pay. In other words, between 15% and 28% of firms in those countries chose to harm investors while leaving their bosses\u2019 pay packages untouched. The proportion was much lower in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.  One justification for the apparent disdain for shareholders is that the sums involved in dividends are simply bigger. Why risk irking a successful CEO when cutting their bonus will only save a few million euros? Yet the Georgeson data also shows that European investors were less likely to push back against executive remuneration packages than in the previous year.

The move would simplify Richemont\u2019s capital structure: the receipts trade in a ratio of 10 to one \u201cA\u201d share and are an added layer to a dual-share construct that gives Chairman Johann Rupert control.

The changes are part of Chief Executive Officer David Solomon's efforts to get Goldman in line with rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup C.N that have bigger consumer businesses and share more information with investors.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Goldman\u2019s consumer business, which includes Marcus and the bank\u2019s credit card, generated $822 million in revenue over the four quarters ended Sept. 30, representing 2.4% of the bank\u2019s total revenue during the period.  Since Goldman launched the online retail bank in 2016, analysts have repeatedly asked for more details about its credit quality and growth on earnings calls.  Some have also sounded alarms about potential risks, worried that Goldman might be expanding into consumer lending ahead of a recession, with little experience in the business.  Executives have typically said they are duly cautious about credit quality, and that the consumer business was not yet big enough to warrant routine disclosures.  Goldman set aside $302 million for potential consumer credit losses in the first nine months of 2019, compared with $338 million for 2018 and $123 million in 2017, according to its 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  As the business grows, the Wall Street bank will naturally have to boost credit provisions. Goldman reported $5.5 billion worth of consumer loans as of Sept. 30, up 22% from year-end.  Goldman unveiled Marcus as part of a broader strategy that initially planned to generate $5 billion in fresh annual revenue by entering new businesses and growing existing ones.  TRADING WOES  The bank had little choice but to change, due to huge declines in trading, which was once its main profit engine. Goldman has since backed off the revenue goal, intending to replace it with other metrics at its investor day later this month, Reuters reported in November. (reut.rs\/32y3xdi)  Its new consumer reporting line will include details about not only Marcus, but also wealth management \u2014 another area the bank is trying to expand. Goldman already has a sizable private bank that caters to the ultra-rich, but wants to start offering more services to individuals with fewer assets as well. (bit.ly\/39IGu45)  Over the four quarters ended Sept. 30, Goldman generated $5.1 billion in revenue from that segment, $822 million, or 16%, of which came from the consumer portion. The broader segment generated $540 million in pretax profit, representing less than 5% of total earnings.  The other major change Goldman announced in a filing, which was sent out late on Monday but was made public on Tuesday, is its decision to get rid of a reporting-line segment called \u201cInvesting & Lending,\u201d which detailed revenue from those activities across various businesses.  Goldman created that segment as part of another reporting-line shuffle in 2009. It aimed to clarify what the bank earned from activities with its own balance sheet, after a sweeping financial-regulatory law banned proprietary trading.  But investors and analysts have complained that the reporting line was a volatile black-box, and discounted its importance to Goldman's overall profitability. Revenue from that line will now be distributed across different segments. (reut.rs\/10ToRoR)  NEW UNITS  Goldman will now have four reporting lines: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management. Previously its results were segmented into Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending and Investment Management. The trading business, which was previously housed in Institutional Client Services, will now be part of Global Markets.  Some analysts applauded the changes.  \u201cThe new reporting structure appears more centered around its different client segments and should help drive increased accountability in how it executes on its relatively new strategy,\u201d Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said.  Goldman is expected to unveil the new targets and metrics at its first-ever investor day on Jan. 29. It is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 15.

He left Goldman Sachs in 2014.  Ng had agreed to be sent to the United States, but the proceedings were delayed after Malaysia\u2019s home minister said he should first face criminal charges in the Southeast Asian nation.

The DoJ has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped to raise.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used.  Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales.  He was also charged in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law targeting official bribery abroad.  Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs official, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB funds. Leissner has pleaded guilty.  Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-prime minister Najib Razak.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, said they had agreed to reduce output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for May and June to stem a slump in prices.  The bank saw downside risks to its short-term oil price forecast of around $20 per barrel for Brent, but projected the global crude benchmark would outperform U.S. oil because OPEC+ producers\u2019 exports would likely fall, freeing up floating storage space.  Even with core-OPEC members fully complying with the cuts, and 50% compliance by all other countries that have agreed to curb production in May, the voluntary cuts would translate into a reduction of only 4.3 million bpd from first-quarter levels, the bank said.  A bigger output cut by G20 nations would also not help much, it said.  \u201cUltimately, this simply reflects that no voluntary cuts could be large enough to offset the 19 million bpd average April-May demand loss due to the coronavirus.\u201d  Both Brent futures, which slumped a record 65.55% in the first quarter, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude posted tentative gains after the OPEC+ deal.  Goldman Sachs said, however, that risks surrounding its 2021 price outlook of $52.50 per barrel for Brent were \u201cskewed squarely to the upside\u201d, since the \u201cviolent market rebalancing\u201d will be followed by a sharp rebound once demand picks up again.  Another Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, raised its oil price forecasts, saying that while the OPEC+ deal will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, it would lead to stock reductions from the second half of 2020 onwards.  Morgan Stanley raised its third-quarter Brent and WTI price forecasts to $30 per barrel from $25, and to $27.50 per barrel from $22.50, respectively. It likewise raised its fourth-quarter outlook by $5 per barrel for both crude benchmarks, to $35 for Brent and $32.50 for WTI.

Even so, Goldman Sachs\u2019s exposure to losses from the global pandemic that has so far killed more than 131,000 people, shut down businesses and left huge portions of the workforce unemployed is small compared to big-bank rivals that have reported results this week. (here)  Loss provisions at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N were four to nine times larger than Goldman\u2019s, mostly because those banks have bigger consumer-lending businesses.

Even though Goldman\u2019s profit fell short of the average analyst prediction, its shares rose as much as 1.9% on Wednesday even as the broader market declined and other big banks fell sharply on loan-loss concerns. Goldman closed up 0.2% at $178.52.  \u201cIt really is a favorable business mix for this quarter,\u201d said David Konrad, a bank analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Goldman\u2019s $5.2 billion in trading revenue was up 28% from the year-ago period.

The irony, Konrad said, is that the market is happy about short-term gains that previously haunted Goldman Sachs as it has tried to recalibrate its business model for the long-term.  \u201cThis dynamic may shift to a far more difficult environment for capital markets and investment banking and less provision headwinds,\u201d Konrad said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of timing for all of these banks.\u201d  MOVE AWAY FROM TRADING  Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief executive officer, David Solomon, has been trying to move the bank away from trading, which has fallen out of favor due to regulations imposed since the 2008 financial crisis, and because of its inherent volatility.  Solomon has been implementing a plan to expand into consumer banking, launch a treasury services business for corporations, grow wealth management, lend more to companies and shift trading to focus on asset managers, in addition to hedge funds.  It is hard to tell from the outside exactly what transactions boosted Goldman\u2019s trading businesses, but gains seemed widespread. The bank highlighted better results in currencies, credit products, commodities, interest-rate products, market-making in equities and equities derivatives, and financing for trades. The only negative was mortgage trading.  Trading helped offset some $890 million in markdowns Goldman had to take on stocks, bonds, loans and private-equity assets it holds on its balance sheet as investments, as well as the credit-loss provisions for corporate loans it has extended.  Overall, the bank\u2019s profit fell 49% to $1.1 billion, or $3.11 per share, from $2.2 billion, or $5.71, in the first quarter of 2019.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.35 per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.  Its net revenue was flat at $8.7 billion, compared to an average estimate of $7.9 billion.  On a conference call with analysts, Goldman executives said trading activity has remained robust so far in the second quarter and that there is a strong pipeline of deal and underwriting activity that may continue to boost results in the near term.  They also emphasized that the bank has no plans to change course from the strategic vision Solomon laid out before the coronavirus pandemic began strangling the economy.  Even though its trading business stole the spotlight in the first quarter, Goldman added 80 clients to its recently launched corporate cash transactions business, grew consumer deposits by $12 billion and maintained previous operational targets.  Goldman may have to cut costs further and add to loan-loss provisions if the coronavirus downturn continues, but will not stray from a strategic plan management laid out in January, executives said.  \u201cThe strategic direction we laid out for the firm remains no less compelling,\u201d Solomon said.","17":"LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A vote in Britain\u2019s parliament on Tuesday crushing Prime Minister May\u2019s deal to leave the European Union has made a softer, later Brexit, or even no Brexit at all, slightly more likely, Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday.  \u201cWe think the prospect of a disorderly \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit has faded further,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 European economist Adrian Paul wrote in a note.  The bank maintains its base case scenario that \u201ca close variant\u201d of the current Brexit deal will ultimately command a majority in the House of Commons.  British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit divorce deal by a heavy margin on Tuesday, triggering political chaos that could lead to a disorderly exit from the EU or even to a reversal of the 2016 decision to leave.

Neither of the Boston-based companies disclosed the value of the deal that gives Circle control of a marketplace it said sometimes has daily volumes of more than $2 billion, with around 70 different digital currencies and tokens traded.  Fortune magazine said the deal was worth $400 million, citing a person familiar with the matter.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been really impressed with what they have been able to pull off,\u201d Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said.  \u201cThey defined what originally people thought of as \u2018altcoin\u2019 exchanges,\u201d he told Reuters. The term altcoin describes newer cryptocurrencies than the more established bitcoin and ether.  Circle operates an app-based peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin. It is also one of the leading players in the over-the-counter market for bitcoin trading, and is soon launching a retail-focused app for buying cryptocurrencies, Circle Invest.  One of the best-funded blockchain startups, its investors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Baidu Inc.  Circle\u2019s founders said they had discussed the acquisition with all of their investors, as well as with regulators, and that the deal was closed on Friday.  The value of cryptocurrencies - as well as the number - has ballooned since the start of 2017, when they were worth around $17 billion, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, with their total value topping $800 billion in January before slipping to around $450 billion now.  There are now more than 1,500 digital currencies and tokens, Coinmarketcap said.  REGULATORY SCRUTINY  Poloniex is well-known among cryptocurrency investors because it offers trading on a wide range of digital coins, several of which have been issued through online fundraisers known as \u201cinitial coin offerings\u201d (ICOs).  Regulators across the world have been intensifying their scrutiny of ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July warned that some of the coins issued in ICOs could be considered securities, meaning trading them would have to comply with federal securities laws.  \u201cWe intend to continue playing a leadership role when it comes to national and global regulatory frameworks for this space,\u201d Circle co-founder Sean Neville told Reuters.  \u201cThat includes meeting with the SEC as well as obtaining all relevant licensing required for us to support our customers.\u201d  Regulators are also keeping an eye on the anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) practices of cryptocurrency exchanges.  A Reuters investigation published in September showed that Poloniex had allowed some customers to trade cryptocurrencies and withdraw up to $2,000 worth of digital coins a day by providing only a name, an email address and a country.  Allaire said Poloniex had instituted full KYC checks for new customers, but he could not confirm the exchange had the identities of all existing clients.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure that 100 percent of prior clients have gone through all their identity verification requests. I know they have a huge backlog of clients in their KYC queues,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut obviously now that we operate the company we\u2019re going to ensure that the business is compliant in every way it needs to be.\u201d  The exchange is not allowed to accept New York residents because it lacks a state license to operate a cryptocurrency exchange, but the Reuters investigation found two New York residents who had claimed that they lived elsewhere and were able to trade on Poloniex.  \u201cClearly, people can get around things like IP (internet protocol) restrictions, and other restrictions, and people do it all the time. People evade geo-blocking mechanisms, and it\u2019s difficult to fully police. So it\u2019s possible that some people have snuck through that, and that\u2019s obviously something we take very seriously,\u201d Allaire said.  Circle said that in the coming years, it expected to grow the Poloniex exchange out to include other non-crypto assets, such as physical goods and financial products such as derivatives.  \u201cWe look forward to bringing Circle\u2019s experience to increase the scalability and reliability of our platform and operations,\u201d Poloniex said in a statement on its website.","19":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc will name no more than 60 partners in 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.  The bank\u2019s new class of partners, to be promoted next month, is likely to be its smallest since the mid-1990s, according to the report.  Goldman\u2019s partners collectively own a small stake in the firm and are the bank\u2019s most elite employees, typically taking home million-dollar salary packages and having access to lucrative investment opportunities. The bank currently has roughly 400 partners in its ranks.  Goldman\u2019s partnership ranks have nearly doubled since the bank went public in 1999 but have shrunk over the last decade as part of a strategy to make the Wall Street bank less top-heavy and raise the bar for employees seeking to become partners.  Under David Solomon, who took over as the bank\u2019s chief executive officer in 2018, that trend has continued. Goldman named 69 new partners two years ago during Solomon\u2019s first year as CEO, according to the report.  According to the Journal, partners will receive carried interest, a portion of future profits taxed at low rates, in four of Goldman\u2019s private investment funds starting this year.  The firm will lend partners up to half a million dollars to increase their personal investment, the report added.  Goldman declined to comment on the report.","20":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in on the floor the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N plans to move forward with \"a modest number of layoffs\", a company spokesperson said on Wednesday, months after the Wall Street bank paused job cuts due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Bloomberg News, which first reported about the layoffs, said the bank was looking to cut about 400 jobs, or roughly 1% of its workforce, citing people familiar with the matter.  \u201cAt the outbreak of the pandemic, the firm announced that it would suspend any job reductions. The firm has made a decision to move forward with a modest number of layoffs,\u201d a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said.  Many of the cuts in the current round are tied to back-office roles that had been folded into bigger money-making divisions as part of an earlier reorganization, according to the Bloomberg report Goldman Sachs\u2019 annual cull has long set it apart from Wall Street rivals, which tend to make mass layoffs periodically.  In January, Goldman said it was aiming for a 60% efficiency ratio over the next three years, compared with 68% in 2019. A lower efficiency ratio means a bank is better at managing costs relative to revenue.  Separately, the U.S. Federal Reserve will curb big bank capital distributions through the end of the year, meaning the likes of JPMorgan JPM.N, Citi C.N, Wells Fargo WFC.N and Bank of America BAC.N will be barred from share buybacks and will have to cap dividends into the new year.  Shares of big banks fell between 0.5% and 1% in extended trade following the news.","21":"NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Over the past decade or so, Goldman Sachs Group Inc has watched its annual trading profits fall a whopping 84%, as post-financial crisis regulations upended Wall Street. Now, bank executives are hoping they have figured out the key to a turnaround: asking traders to be more like investment bankers.  Over the past year, Chief Executive David Solomon and his leadership team have given the trading business a fresh mandate. They have replaced top trading executives, invested heavily in automation and turned Goldman\u2019s securities platform, called Marquee, into a product that can be sold to customers, according to interviews with six bank insiders.  Salespeople in the trading division, who used to primarily focus on hedge funds, are trying to make inroads with corporate treasurers, as well as portfolio managers at mutual-fund firms like Fidelity Investments and algorithmic trading houses like AQR or Two Sigma, one person said.  Trading staffers must often partner with Goldman Sachs dealmakers to forge those relationships. And, like bankers, they are now being judged by how many meetings they get and how much new business they can deliver with targeted clients, the same person said.  The changes bring a sales culture to the fore, but executives say it is not at the expense of the central risk trading approach that made Goldman traders famous.  \u201cThat core is the key to the investment-banker approach and technology investments resulting in success,\u201d another employee said.  On Tuesday, Goldman reported a 6% rise in quarterly trading revenue, benefiting from market volatility, as well as Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s decision to pull back from trading. But, year-to-date, the business is down 6%.  Goldman Sachs executives acknowledge that a turnaround could take years. However, they say that changes made over the past year are already making a difference, especially the efficiency savings from investments in tech.  \u201cThis quarter we saw some green shoots from the client-centric strategy we\u2019ve put in place,\u201d Jim Esposito, global co-head for the securities division said in an interview.  Most major global banks have seen their trading businesses turned upside down since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Since then, loss-stunned customers shifted product preferences and new regulations prohibited activities that had been extremely profitable or made them prohibitively expensive.  Even so, Goldman Sachs stands out among Wall Street banks because of how much its profits had been weighted in trading, and how little it changed its business model around the crisis.  Where U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co had big consumer and corporate lending operations, and even Goldman Sachs\u2019 closest rival, Morgan Stanley significantly altered its business mix through an acquisition, Goldman Sachs took years to announce meaningful changes to its strategy.  In recent years, the industry of making and managing clients\u2019 trades has consolidated around the top global banks. Goldman is one of those banks, but it will need to remain \u201con the offensive,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see the revenue pie expanding dramatically in legacy businesses like equity trading and (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cThere are opportunities. It\u2019s really in maintaining and gaining share as other firms retreat.\u201d  FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES  Goldman executives say these fundamental changes to the trading business will help the bank prosper over the long term.  In addition to new goals and performance metrics for trading staff, Goldman Sachs leadership has been meeting with major clients or prospective clients to find out what the bank could do better to win more business, according to two executives.  They are paying closer attention to \u201cbroker votes\u201d that big investors submit to learn what improvements should be made to Goldman\u2019s technology, operations or customer service, executives said.  The bank has also been working to improve trading technology to lure quantitative investors.  Pricing for investment-grade credit below $2 million is now completely electronic, with plans to expand, said Adam Korn, global head of securities division strats and technology. Goldman used the term \u201cstrats\u201d to refer to quantitative analysts.  \u201cIf you come back in a year or two, I suspect we will have automated the $2-$5 million segment of the investment grade,\u201d Korn said in an interview.  Additionally, Goldman has expanded functions of Marquee, which was once its internal trading system, and opened it up to customers.  The bank is experimenting with giving clients access to proprietary data and risk analysis for a fee, possibly a monthly subscription. The are now has 50,000 monthly active users of the service, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said during an earnings call on Tuesday.  \u201cThere is a great intensity and sense of urgency to measure and metric our progress with clients,\u201d Esposito said. \u201cTrading and sales are aligned neatly around this effort.\u201d","22":"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Malaysia is seeking $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs Group Inc over its dealings with scandal-linked state fund 1MDB, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing the country\u2019s finance minister.  Malaysian prosecutors this week filed charges against Goldman Sachs in connection with its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the first criminal action against the U.S. bank over the scandal.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of the bond sales.  In addition to the bonds\u2019 total value, Goldman Sachs should also return $1 billion to cover $600 million in fees paid to the bank and bond coupons that were \u201chigher than the market rate\u201d, the FT quoted Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng as saying.  The three 10-year bonds carried coupons ranging from 4.4 percent to 5.99 percent.  Lim also told the FT that reparations should at least be more than $1.8 billion, the sum Goldman Sachs has told investors it had set aside to cover potential losses related to 1MDB legal proceedings.  \u201cTheir figure is $1.8 billion. Ours is $7.5 billion,\u201d Lim said.  Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a Reuters\u2019 request for comment.  The bank told the FT: \u201cThe 1MDB bond offerings were meant to raise money to benefit Malaysia; instead, a huge portion of those funds were stolen for the benefit of members of the Malaysian government and their associates.\u201d  Malaysia has sought jail terms and billions in fines from Goldman Sachs and four individuals who allegedly misappropriated about $2.7 billion from the 1MDB bond proceeds.  Two former Goldman Sachs bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, were among those charged.  Singapore has banned Leissner, the bank\u2019s former Southeast Asia chairman, from its securities industry for life after he plead guilty in the United States for conspiring to launder 1MDB money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The United States is also seeking extradition of Ng, who has been detained in Malaysia.  Malaysia is not currently negotiating with Goldman, but charges filed on Monday could bring the bank to the table, Lim said.  The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and used to buy, among others, real estate in London and New York, expensive jewellery and artwork, and a private jet.

The U.S. bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping to raise $6.5 billion through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the subject of corruption and money laundering investigations in at least six countries.  But Malaysian prosecutors have said $2.7 billion of the proceeds were diverted and the offering statements filed with the regulators contained statements that were false, misleading or involved material omissions.  Friday\u2019s charges were brought under a section of the Malaysian Capital Markets and Services Act that holds certain senior executives responsible for offences that may have been committed by the firm, Attorney General Tommy Thomas said.  \u201cCustodial sentences and criminal fines will be sought against the accused ... given the severity of the scheme to defraud and fraudulent misappropriation of billions in bond proceeds,\u201d Thomas said in a statement.  Goldman Sachs said the charges were misdirected.  \u201cWe believe the charges announced today, along with those against three Goldman Sachs entities announced in December last year, are misdirected and will be vigorously defended,\u201d a Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong said.  \u201cUnder the Malaysian legal process, the firm and the individual entity directors were not afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the filing of these charges, which do not affect our ability to conduct our current business globally.\u201d  Those charged on Friday include Richard Gnodde, chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, Michael Evans, president of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N and a former director at Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC, and Michael Sherwood, former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Group.

Each charge carries a maximum jail term of 10 years and a penalty of at least 1 million ringgit ($239,000).  The charges say the Goldman Sachs units omitted material facts in the bond offerings, among them that Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho was the operator and key intermediary for 1MDB.  Low has been described by Malaysian and U.S. authorities as the central player in the 1MDB scandal. He has denied wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.  Goldman on Friday said 1MDB provided written assurances to the bank for each transaction that no intermediaries were involved.  Last year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against three Goldman Sachs subsidiaries and two of the U.S. bank\u2019s former employees in connection with 1MDB.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs, outside counsel and others about the use of transaction proceeds.  The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating the bank for its role as underwriter and arranger of the bond offer.  An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, according to the Justice Department.  Tim Leissner, a former partner of Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty last August to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.  Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then prime minister Najib Razak.  Najib, ousted in an election last year, is facing dozens of criminal charges related to 1MDB.

In an internal podcast interview to mark the anniversary, Solomon said he had focused on making sure the bank\u2019s clients were the center of its thinking.  \u201cWe\u2019re a divisional firm, we\u2019ve always been a divisional firm, but I think there\u2019s a great opportunity to make sure for our clients that we\u2019re delivering the whole firm,\u201d he added.  Goldman ranked second behind Morgan Stanley in a league table of M&A for Asia Pacific including Japan at the end of the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data, having advised on deals worth $108.4 billion.  The region has been hit harder than elsewhere by a drop in global deal volumes as uncertainties over the economic outlook and rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China weigh on M&A appetite.  Dealmaking volumes in Asia-Pacific fell 30% year-on-year to $751 billion as at end-September according to Refinitiv data, while globally volumes fell 11% to $2.8 trillion.

Malaysia had requested that a trial start in April, as the 10-month period of U.S. custody agreed to by the countries would lapse in March, Deputy Public Prosecutor Zaki Asyraf Zubir told Reuters.  \u201cProsecution requested for the trial in April,\u201d Zaki said in a text message.

Ng, along with Tim Leissner, a former partner at Goldman Sachs in Asia, received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by the then prime minister, Najib Razak.  Najib, who lost a general election last year, faces 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.  Goldman said last month it was in discussions with authorities on the possibility of a resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.  Malaysia rejected an offer from Goldman of less than $2 billion in compensation over the scandal, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told the Financial Times last week.","32":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain named former Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp as the next chairman of the BBC, tasked with agreeing a long-term funding model for the broadcaster at a time of increasing competition and political scrutiny.  FILE PHOTO: A BBC sign is displayed outside Broadcasting House in London, Britain July 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Neil Hall  Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said Sharp was \u201cexactly the chair the BBC needs right now\u201d.  \u201cI\u2019m confident he will drive forward reforms to the BBC to ensure it impartially reflects and serves the needs of all parts of the UK, and evolves to remain a global success that is central to British national life in the decades ahead,\u201d he said.  Sharp is a former donor to the Conservative Party and worked with finance minister Rishi Sunak at Goldman Sachs, according to a BBC news report. He has recently been advising Sunak.  The chairman, who is officially appointed by the queen on the recommendation of the government, is responsible for upholding and protecting the independence of the BBC, which is funded by a licence fee paid by every TV-watching household.  \u201cThe BBC is at the heart of British cultural life and I\u2019m honoured to be offered the chance to help guide it through the next chapter in its history,\u201d Sharp said.  He will join the broadcaster next month as it faces some of the biggest threats to its future since it was founded 98 years ago.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has voiced scepticism about the licence fee at a time when the BBC\u2019s TV audiences are shrinking and streaming services like Netflix are growing in popularity.  The BBC is often accused of bias by critics from both ends of the political spectrum. While some Conservatives perceive it to be London-centric and left-leaning, those on the left of the opposition Labour Party see it as biased against them.  Sharp will succeed David Clementi, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, who is stepping down next month after four years.  Sharp will be paid 160,000 pounds ($220,000) for working three to four days a week, the government said.  Clementi confirmed he would step down in June when he announced the appointment of Tim Davie as the new director general of the broadcaster.  Davie is editor in chief, responsible for the BBC\u2019s content across television, radio and online services, as well as leading its operations.  A review of the BBC\u2019s funding is due in 2022 before its royal charter needs to be renewed in 2027.  Sharp\u2019s appointment was reported by Sky News hours before the official announcement.  A committee of lawmakers that oversees the work of the department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it was disappointed to see news of the appointment leak.  \u201cThe committee previously expressed some concerns over the appointments process, calling for it to be fair and transparent,\u201d Chair Julian Knight said in a statement.

For 2018, about 48 percent of oil production is hedged at an average price of $57 a barrel, Goldman said in a note late on Monday.  Sixteen percent of 2019 oil production is hedged at $60 a barrel, versus 9 percent at the end of the fourth quarter, in line with the historic average for hedging several quarters in advance.  Oil producers use futures contracts to hedge their exposure to production, in an effort to keep themselves protected from losses should the price of U.S. crude fall suddenly.  Both hedging levels are below current futures contracts prices, which are averaging around $70 for the second half of 2018 and $66 a barrel for 2019. Hedging at lower levels limits the ability of producers to take advantage of a subsequent rally in prices - but it also protects them if the price of oil should fall to lower levels.  That kind of volatile trading pattern was present throughout 2017, so producers remained protected even after oil dropped off from an early-year rally. That in part helped production in the United States continue to grow, eventually rising to an all-time record late in 2017 of more than 10 million barrels a day.  In 2018, oil has been steadily rising, which presents a risk for producers if they hedge at levels below the current price, so some companies elected not to hedge.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t leave money on the table by hedging too soon,\u201d said Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, on the company\u2019s first quarter conference call earlier this year. The company, one of the largest shale producers in North Dakota, did not have any crude oil hedges as of the end of the first quarter.  Hedging could restrain ramping activity and increase focus on \u201ccapital discipline,\u201d Goldman said.  \u201cWe believe producers may continue to tactically add oil hedges at current futures to mitigate oil price volatility in 2019, which could support greater capex,\u201d the investment bank said in its note.  It said the majority of production growth in 2018 was expected to come from producers hedged above 50 percent.  Devon Energy Corp and Noble Energy Inc added the most 2018 oil hedging contracts after fourth quarter earnings, the bank said.","35":"Sept 15 (Reuters) - Comcast Corp said on Tuesday that its recently launched streaming service Peacock had signed over 15 million viewers since its launch.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Goldman Sachs is displayed in their office located in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo  During a conference call to discuss quarterly results, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo listed the ways Goldman is trying to generate $5 billion more in annual revenue and asked Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez whether it would simply buy a brick-and-mortar bank.  After explaining that Goldman has a history of building businesses internally, and a preference for \u201cbolt-on\u201d acquisitions, if any, Chavez suggested that management routinely considers more transformative deals.  \u201cWe are evaluating all these acquisitions, including things that you describe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are open-minded and it\u2019s all part of the consideration.\u201d  Goldman got into consumer lending much later than big U.S. banking peers, and analysts have asserted on and off through the years that acquiring a big consumer lender would help even out volatile results from businesses like trading and investment banking.  Unlike most rivals, Goldman did not make any significant acquisitions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Such a deal could be more difficult to accomplish now, as the industry has consolidated, values have risen and more regulatory hurdles have been put in place.  Since launching its digital consumer bank Marcus in 2016, Goldman has been growing the business by paying up for deposits, offering new products like home improvement loans and recently acquiring Clarity Money, a personal finance smartphone app.  Marcus is now lending out $3 billion of its more than $20 billion in deposits, Chavez said, making it a much smaller bank with a much lower loan-to-deposit ratio than lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, or even its closest peer, Morgan Stanley MS.N.  During the planning process that led to the launch of Marcus, Goldman considered \u201cwell over 100\u201d ideas in consumer finance and may still execute some of them, Chavez said. Among areas Goldman may enter: credit cards, wealth management, retirement products and personal finance.  But before doing so, management considers factors including whether a business has \u201csubstantial pain points\u201d for customers, whether it fits into Goldman\u2019s strengths and culture, and whether it would generate attractive shareholder returns, he noted.  \u201cWe still refer back to that set because it\u2019s quite comprehensive,\u201d said Chavez, \u201cand the world changes and evolves.\u201d","43":"LONDON, June 1 (Reuters) - Emerging market credit could catch up with equities in the second half of the year during an anticipated recovery from the coronavirus market rout, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research report.  Emerging market equity multiples are back to 2019 levels, while emerging market credit spreads remain near recessionary levels, the analysts said.  That divergence is an anomaly, they added in the report published on Sunday, as the two have generally moved in the same direction in the past.  \u201cGrowth data, of course, is still deeply weak across EM (apart from China), but as markets are bracing for economic recovery, we suspect EM credit does have significant catch-up room,\u201d the analysts wrote.  Emerging market credit was often the best performing asset class during the recovery phase of the economic cycle, which investors were anticipating for the second half of the year, they said.  The dislocation between equities and credit was partly due to the different country mix of the two, the report said, pointing out that Asia was a heavy contributor to MSCI\u2019s index of developing market shares, while the contribution from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa had fallen over recent years to 14%.  In contrast, Asia accounted for only 18% of JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI Global Diversified, in which Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa countries were the most significant contributors.  Economic activity in China, which holds the largest weighting in the MSCI equity index, has shown patchy signs of recovery as social restrictions linked to the pandemic have eased earlier than many other parts of the world.

Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for a comment.","46":"(Repeats with no changes)  NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Last year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc executives met with some skepticism after unveiling an ambitious plan to grow revenue by $5 billion, whether or not markets remained subdued. Now that trading has picked up, Wall Street is hoping the bank can do even better.  On Tuesday, Goldman\u2019s chief executive officer, Lloyd Blankfein, is scheduled to speak at an industry conference in Miami Beach, where he intends to provide more information about the revenue-boosting effort.  It will be the first time Blankfein himself tries to persuade investors with a formal, public presentation about the lofty goals Goldman has set. Since his deputies first laid out the revenue-growth strategy in September, analysts have peppered executives with questions about the underlying assumptions and cited concerns raised by investors.  For instance, Instinet analyst Steven Chubak told Goldman\u2019s finance chief in October that many of his clients wanted to know why Goldman thinks it can boost investment management revenue by $1 billion, given the challenges money managers are facing more broadly. In a recent report, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said shareholders remain \u201cskeptical\u201d about other components of Goldman\u2019s revenue growth plan, like consumer lending, despite assurances from senior executives.  \u201cMr. Blankfein will be providing an update on our business to investors (Tuesday), and we are in the early stages of delivering on the growth plan we outlined last fall,\u201d a Goldman spokeswoman said in an email.  Wall Street is hesitant to forecast that Goldman will be able to generate any of the promised $5 billion, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in an interview.  \u201cThis is the environment that Goldman has been waiting for all decade,\u201d said Mayo, who expects the bank to achieve $3 billion of its $5 billion target helped by volatility returning to stock and bond markets globally.  \u201cIf Goldman doesn\u2019t get it right in 2018, then management has some serious questions to ask.\u201d  Trading had been a profit engine for Goldman Sachs for the decade leading into the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but lethargic markets, new regulations and tougher competition have since upended the business.  In 2009, Goldman boasted 19 percent market share in bond trading, which generated $121 billion in revenue across Wall Street, according to the bank\u2019s September presentation. But Goldman since lost nearly half that share as the revenue pool has declined by nearly half. Last year the bank reported its worst bond trading results since 2008, with revenue dropping 30 percent.  As a result, Goldman is trying to grow businesses like investment management, while trying to generate more trading revenue from existing customers as well as new ones. It is also diving into Main Street banking, an area where it never previously had significant operations.  Goldman launched its digital consumer bank Marcus in 2016, primarily targeting credit-card borrowers who want to refinance into cheaper loans. By the end of last year, Marcus had originated $2.3 billion in loans, and management expects to grow that figure by $13 billion through 2020. The growth rate has caused concern among some investors and analysts, given recent signs across the industry that consumer credit risk is on the rise, particularly in cards.  Analysts are hoping Blankfein will talk about bond trading on Tuesday and also provide more details on the revenue growth initiative. Some said the presentation itself is a step in the right direction for a bank that historically disclosed little about its strategy and declined to issue financial targets the way rivals like Morgan Stanley routinely do.  \u201cOver the last many years, Goldman has been very shy about what it\u2019s going to do, so you never had a full score card to measure against,\u201d said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. \u201cThis is a very different Goldman Sachs today than it was 20-30 years ago.\u201d (Reporting by Catherine Ngai; editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Lisa Shumaker)","47":"(Reuters) - Big trading operations were a thorn in the side of the top U.S. banks in the fourth quarter as fears about global growth sent credit markets into a tailspin, but a \u201cdovish\u201d turn from the Federal Reserve may mean the drama is over for now.  FILE PHOTO: The Citigroup Inc (Citi) logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. Picture taken October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of America Corp all reported declines in fourth-quarter revenue from their key fixed income, commodity and currency trading arms, although overall results at most were cushioned by improving loan growth and net interest margins.  The final months of 2018 were dominated by investor worries about slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute and were further aggravated by concerns that the Fed might be pushing interest rates too high. The resulting volatility in equity, bond and commodity markets sent many investors to the sidelines, pushing down bond trading volume and hurting the value of credit market assets sitting on banks\u2019 own books.  \u201cYou had a one-two punch of market losses on inventory along with a lot of bank clients stepping back from market because you couldn\u2019t have much of an opinion given the uncertainty,\u201d said Jeffery Harte, bank analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners.  Credit spreads, the measure of additional compensation investors demand for owning riskier corporate securities over safer U.S. Treasuries, widened in the fourth quarter by the most in more than seven years both for investment-grade and high-yield, or junk, bonds, according to ICE BofAML index data.  Moreover, corporate bond issuance largely dried up, slicing into underwriting fees.  As quarterly results spilled out this week, it became clear that it all added up to a sizable hit for Wall Street\u2019s biggest players.  Bank of America said fixed income fees fell 5 percent because of lower debt underwriting and advisory fees, while its adjusted sales and trading revenue fell 6 percent, with a 15 percent fall in bond trading. Goldman Sachs\u2019 bond trading revenue slid 18 percent to $822 million, far from its peak of more than $6 billion.  In both cases, a big surge in equity trading volumes during the quarter helped offset those losses.  But JPMorgan missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as its bond trading revenue slump overpowered strong consumer loan growth.  At Citigroup, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said for much of the quarter corporate and investor clients \u201cremained on the sidelines, waiting for some clearer market conditions.\u201d Citi reported a 21 percent fall in revenue in its markets and securities business for the quarter.  After being slow to address the spasms in financial markets, Fed officials in recent weeks have said they are mindful of how such moves have tightened financial conditions. The Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018, but since the start of this year a chorus of Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have come out to pledge that they will take it slow from here.  That dovish tone has investors in a better mood so far in the first quarter.  The S&P 500 is up more than 11 percent from its Dec. 24 low and junk bonds are enjoying their strongest start to a year in a decade, according to ICE BofAML\u2019s high-yield index.  The S&P bank sector has risen 17.5 percent since its Dec. 24 low, including a 5.6 percent gain since Citigroup kicked off earnings season on Monday.  Even as \u201cthe potential for tape-bombs from trade and political developments still present challenges, the dovish pivot at the Fed has helped calmed markets,\u201d said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for U.S. fixed income strategies at RBC Wealth Management. \u201cThis has contributed to tamping down fixed income volatility, so to me it could be just a matter of one bad month\/quarter.\u201d  But no one is quite ready to dismiss the possibility that the environment could change quickly again for the worse.  \u201cThat could change tomorrow,\u201d said Sandler O\u2019Neill\u2019s Harte. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with trading revenues, they\u2019re awfully volatile. But at least today the first quarter is looking a lot better than the fourth.\u201d","48":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has signed a pact to buy out its China joint venture partner to make it the most advanced foreign bank to take full ownership of a mainland securities business.

The U.S. Justice Department announced criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers tied to the scandal, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, last year. Goldman is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice for its role. The bank has consistently tried to distance itself from the scandal, saying the criminal activities of Leissner and Ng were hidden from the bank\u2019s management.  Goldman Sachs spokesman Jake Siewert said in statement on Wednesday: \u201cWe do not believe that such a charge would be warranted by the facts of the case or the law, particularly because senior management was unaware of the criminal activity by Mr. Leissner and his associate who took extraordinary efforts to hide their part in the illegal scheme from management, compliance, and legal functions at the firm.\u201d  The staff recommendation by prosecutors is now being considered by senior officials at the Justice Department, the FT said, citing people familiar with the matter. The U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Goldman\u2019s shares fell 2 percent following the report.  According to prosecutors, the investment bank generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  Prosecutors described the bank\u2019s system of internal accounting controls as \u201ceasily circumvented\u201d and said its culture in Southeast Asia was \u201chighly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions.\u201d  The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.","51":"DUBAI (Reuters) - Credit Suisse has hired Hazem Shawki, a Goldman Sachs banker, as its new head of its Middle East, Turkey and Africa investment banking and capital markets division, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

Gmelich has been chief operating officer of fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading since 2017, and before that ran credit and mortgage trading. He joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 and became partner in 2004.  Gmelich is leaving the business at a time of transition.  Bond trading was once a key money-maker for Goldman Sachs, but rules imposed since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, as well as changing customer preferences, have crimped its profitability.  Goldman reported $6 billion in FICC revenue last year, up 11 percent from 2017, but a fraction of the $23 billion the bank generated at the business\u2019s peak. Management is aware that the revenue pie has shrunk industry-wide, Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said last week.  \u201cWe will not be complacent waiting for the market to return,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are running the business with a clear perspective of its revenue potential.\u201d  The bank embarked on a broad strategy change in 2017 to make up for the decline, partly by pursuing new customers and convincing clients of the investment bank to also trade with Goldman Sachs.  In Gmelich\u2019s current role, he worked with co-heads of the securities business to make FICC trading more electronic and responsive to customer needs. He also helped develop new trading platforms during his time in the credit business, according to the memo, which was signed by Solomon, Chief Operating Officer John Waldron and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr.  Gmelich is one of just a few senior trading executives who lasted through the financial crisis, and has been elevated since then. His departure is one of several changes in senior ranks since it became clear early last year that Solomon would become CEO.

FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The global investment banking powerhouse and fifth-largest U.S. bank, which is six months into building the required technology, aims to start the service in the first half of 2020, according to two people familiar with the plan. They agreed to discuss internal strategy on the condition they not be named.  The bank, which will earn fees and gain a captive client base for its foreign exchange business, could offer existing corporate clients more on deposits if they sign up for Goldman\u2019s cash management services, a person familiar with the plan told Reuters.  Long considered a low-margin, utility-like service, the wholesale payments and cash management business generated about $250 billion in global revenue in 2017 for big banks, according to management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.  The steady stream of income has grown more attractive to banks that have been shifting away from volatile areas such as trading and investment banking in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago.  Citigroup Inc C.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N, HSBC Holdings PLC HSBA.L, Standard Chartered PLC STAN.L and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE currently dominate the market, handling corporations' payments and receivables across different regions.  As Goldman seeks to grow stable revenue by adding a cash management service for clients whom it already offers hedging and strategic advice, the investment bank further evolves to match rival universal banks\u2019 range of businesses.  Goldman Sachs is about half way to a goal management set in 2017 to generate $5 billion more in annual revenue by next year, largely by boosting reliable, fee-based businesses.  However, rivals privately scoff at the idea Goldman can gain significant market share in a business where contracts often last five years, clients tend to stick with their banks and a global network of banking licenses greases the wheels.  \u201cThe regulatory and operational costs of building a global cash management platform will be very steep and will take many years to achieve the scale that will justify the costs,\u201d said a senior commercial banker at a large European bank.  \u201cLarge multinational companies are consolidating the number of banks they deal with, and they don\u2019t tend to switch service providers frequently for workday functions like facilitating supplier payments and managing payrolls.\u201d  FIRST CLIENT  Nonetheless, Goldman believes it can make inroads.  Its investment bankers have heard corporate treasurers at big U.S. multinational corporations complain that other banks\u2019 systems are clunky and outdated, one person familiar with Goldman\u2019s plans said. Goldman will try to woo those accounts with a user-friendly interface and other improvements, and eventually hopes to be the third or fourth bank corporate clients use, in addition to other banks, for cash management.  Later this year, Goldman will become its own first client by moving its deposits from other banks onto its own cash management platform. Goldman stands to earn money from cash management in three ways: fees earned for processing funds, fees earned on exchanging a client\u2019s cash into other currencies during a transaction, and by using deposits as operational account balances, a cheaper alternative to wholesale funding.  Oliver Wyman predicts that wholesale payments and cash management revenue will grow 5 percent annually over the next five years. Growing volumes and rising interest rates will more than offset narrowing profit margins caused by increased competition, the consulting firm said.  Paying clients more for deposits and offering new technology is a strategy Goldman used when it launched Marcus, its online retail bank, in 2016.  It has paid off. Marcus had $30 billion of deposits in the United States and the United Kingdom and $4 billion in loans as of November, and is contributing about $200 million to Goldman\u2019s revenue, according to a November presentation.  In recent months, Goldman has advertised that it is hiring cash management compliance, technology, and legal professionals.  In one LinkedIn post seeking applications for lead data architect in the commercial banking engineering team, Goldman said it was looking for \u201cinnovative solutions to traditional banking activities\u201d by combining the \u201cheritage of a 148-year-old financial institution with the agility and entrepreneurial spirit of a tech start-up.\u201d","61":"The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Gradually rising interest rates, stock market jitters amid concerns over U.S. trade policy, and new concerns about U.S. regulators moving to thwart mergers have raised questions on Wall Street on whether robust dealmaking activity will continue.  However, most transformative mergers and acquisitions are driven by industries that were static for several years and are now in the process of adjusting to changes ranging from the introduction of new technologies to demographic shifts, Goldman Sachs global M&A co-head Michael Carr told the Tulane Corporate Law Institute conference in New Orleans on Thursday.  \u201cWe are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure and that\u2019s causing M&A to happen... Transactions beget transactions. Sometimes you need to do something because your neighbor did it, \u201d Carr said.  Semiconductor company managers, for example, have recognized they are in a race to gain scale, saying to themselves and rivals: \u201cI\u2019m either in this game or I\u2019m a seller,\u201d said Carr.  U.S. merger and acquisition volumes reached $389 billion so far this year, compared with $236.5 billion in the same period a year ago, as more mega deals were announced, according to Thomson Reuters data, including U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp\u2019s $52 billion agreement to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co and Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s more than $21 billion deal to combine with soda maker Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  Given the strategic reasons companies are exploring mergers, Carr downplayed the risk of rising debt financing costs and soaring corporate valuations weighing on M&A activity. However, he acknowledged that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has increased regulatory uncertainty for deals, especially those involving China.  \u201cThe relationship between the White house and Beijing is far from great,\u201d Carr said.  With the Trump administration\u2019s tax reform set, companies will have more cash to put to work. The U.S. corporate tax rate was cut to 21 percent from 35 percent at the start of the year. Also, billions of dollars will be brought back to the United States now that companies face a one-time tax on profits stock piled abroad.  \u201cRight now this feels like a bit of a juggernaut... this is going to continue until people do stupid deals,\u201d Carr said.","63":"KUALA LUMPUR\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs will pay $3.9 billion to settle Malaysia\u2019s criminal probe over the U.S. investment bank\u2019s role in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, closing a key front in the multi-jurisdictional investigation that has hung over Goldman.  Goldman Sachs shares rose 0.68% in New York morning trading on the Malaysia news and signals the U.S. Department of Justice could be near closing a similar probe.  A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.  \u201cWe view this as positive as GS is closer to removing a key overhang for investors, and this provides added comfort that the total settlement amount should be manageable,\u201d wrote Steven Chubak, an analyst at New York-based Wolfe Research.  \u201cWe still do not know how this will impact negotiations with the US regulators, but we expect some relief to be extended to Goldman given DOJ guidance to avoid \u2018piling on\u2019,\u201d Chubak wrote.

Goldman had socked away around $3 billion in reserves for legal matters, more than covering the settlement with Malaysia.  It remained unclear whether the bank has put aside enough cash to cover a potential settlement with the Justice Department, which is reportedly looking at whether the bank violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The FCPA bars U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials for help in getting or keeping business.  In recent years, the Justice Department has pledged to take into account parallel settlements when calculating corporate penalties. A source told Reuters in December that Goldman was in talks with the U.S. government and a state regulator to possibly pay up to $2 billion to resolve the investigation.  \u201cIf past major foreign corrupt practice cases are a good indicator (which we think they are), the DOJ settlement could wipe out most of the great second quarter they just put up,\u201d wrote Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr on Friday.  MALAYSIA VICTORY  The settlement is the biggest Malaysia has reached so far in its efforts to recover funds allegedly stolen from 1MDB, and is a big victory for the four-month old administration of Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.  \u201cWe are confident that we are securing more money from Goldman Sachs compared to previous attempts, which were far below expectations,\u201d Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz said in a statement.  U.S. prosecutors said the money was used to buy artwork, including paintings by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet, luxury properties and to fund the \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d movie.  Goldman helped the fund raise $6.5 billion in two bond offerings, earning itself $600 million in fees, according to the U.S. Justice Department.

Tencent may prove to be an exception. The Chinese goliath\u2019s investment portfolio has surpassed $66 billion with stakes in music, fintech and more. Recent successes could validate the deal spree.  A Tencent sign is seen at the World Internet Conference (WIC) in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, October 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Two years ago, an essay entitled \u201cTencent has no dream\u201d went viral in China. The author, a local tech journalist, accused the company that created WeChat, the world\u2019s first all-in-one messaging \u201csuper-app\u201d, of losing its inventive spirit and turning into an investment bank.  That same year, Tencent boss Pony Ma embarked on a frenzied buying binge, snapping up stakes in everything from Amer Sports, the Finnish maker of Wilson tennis racquets and other gear, to real estate conglomerate Dalian Wanda\u2019s commercial property division. As with earlier investments, the strategic rationale was unclear. Research firm ITJuzi estimates that Tencent picked up a record 163 holdings in 2018, an average of three a week.  Even amid the pandemic, Tencent shows no signs of slowing down. Recent purchases include a Malaysian video-streaming service and minority stakes in Universal Music and Warner Music. That\u2019s on top of a flurry of deals involving video-game rivals, e-sports companies, Australia\u2019s Afterpay and Tesla\u2019s Chinese challenger Nio. It is also eyeing a piece of China\u2019s $17 billion iQiyi, according to sources cited by Reuters.  WALL STREET DNA  By global tech standards, Tencent stands out. Less acquisitive U.S. peers tend to focus on strategic targets, such as Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram or Apple\u2019s purchase of headphone-maker Beats. Others, including Alphabet\u2019s Google, have separate corporate venture arms.  In the People\u2019s Republic, only $580 billion Alibaba has pockets deep enough to match Tencent\u2019s. The e-commerce company\u2019s investments totalled $50 billion as of March, nearly a quarter less than its arch-rival. Alibaba also tends to take full control of business units, including in food delivery and video-streaming, whereas Tencent prefers minority stakes outside of video-games and entertainment.  Its M&A appetite may derive from Goldman Sachs, where two of Ma\u2019s top lieutenants worked before joining Tencent. One is Martin Lau, who chairs the investment committee. The other is the company\u2019s chief strategy officer, James Mitchell. The duo is widely regarded as the driving force behind Tencent\u2019s acquisitive nature. At a conference in January, Lau said the company had invested in over 800 companies since 2008, a fifth of which are valued at $1 billion or more. Returns last year hit some $2 billion, accounting for roughly 12% of the company\u2019s total annual earnings.  As investments play a bigger and more important role, Tencent increasingly resembles Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank. Costly misadventures in WeWork and Uber left the Saudi-backed Vision Fund valued at just $70 billion in March, not much larger than Tencent\u2019s portfolio.  Some of the deals are doing well. In 2012, Tencent bought a 40% stake in U.S.-based Epic Games at a valuation of less than $1 billion. The company behind \u201cFortnite\u201d, even more popular during Covid-19 lockdowns, is now raising fresh funds at a $17 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg. Chinese e-commerce challenger Pinduoduo, which Tencent backed in its early days, is now worth over $100 billion. Its New York-listed shares have more than quadrupled since its initial public offering in 2018.  What\u2019s more, Tencent benefits strategically too. E-commerce outfits, for example, can broaden the range of services offered on WeChat, making the all-in-one app and its mobile payments system even more indispensable to more than 1 billion monthly active users. Pinduoduo\u2019s Groupon-like site, for instance, links directly to Tencent\u2019s social network, which has benefitted both. Indeed, Lau has defended the company\u2019s investment record by saying it cannot do everything itself and relies on outside partners.  COMING CLEAN?  Opacity has been a problem for shareholders. The company is spelling out more these days, including an annual return on its investment portfolio. It also created a separate website for the holdings. Because of Tencent\u2019s size, however, even some large deals can be kept quiet.  Disclosure is also patchy. For example, a 5% stake in Tesla was revealed in 2017 with the electric-car maker\u2019s boss, Elon Musk, tweeting his delight and Tencent extolling his \u201cvision, ambition and execution.\u201d The strategic rationale was unclear, though, and Tencent won\u2019t even say if it still owns any shares. It does not appear as a significant owner, according to Eikon.  Messaging app operator Snap also said in its annual report that because of its capital structure neither it nor Tencent are obligated to say whether anything changes about the stake the Chinese company bought a few years ago.  There may have been a few visible successes, but analyst Mark Artherton, who publishes on Smartkarma, estimates that more than 80% of Tencent\u2019s balance sheet is in cash and investments that generate little meaningful profit.  That may not be much of an issue now with the company\u2019s video-games division doing so well. Tencent is expected to generate some $26 billion in operating cash flow this year, based on forecasts compiled by Refinitiv. That would be up over a quarter from 2019, but growth is expected to slow to less than 15% by 2022. As that happens, the more scrutiny there will be on the expanding investment portfolio \u2013 and whether it is the best use of Tencent\u2019s capital.","70":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that it permanently barred a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive from the banking industry over his role in Malaysia\u2019s multi-billion-dollar 1MDB corruption scandal.

Malaysian and U.S. authorities have charged Low in connection with the theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB, which was originally set up by former Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak to fund infrastructure projects.  The Federal Reserve said that Vella \u201cengaged in unsafe and unsound practices by failing to ensure\u201d that Low\u2019s involvement was \u201cfully escalated within the firm.\u201d  Vella consented to the bar without admitting or denying any of the allegations made by the regulator, according to the statement from the Federal Reserve.  Andrew Levander, a lawyer at Dechert representing Vella, said the fact that his client was not fined shows that Vella did not know about wrongdoing, such as others discussing or accepting bribes or kickbacks.  \u201cMr. Vella agreed to this limited settlement in order to move on to the next stage of his career and to avoid putting himself and his family through years of litigation,\u201d Levander said in a statement.  A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs confirmed that Vella had left the firm in recent days after being on leave since October 2018.  The U.S. Justice Department says that $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.  In November 2018, the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers tied to the scandal, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng.  Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million. Ng pleaded not guilty to charges in May, and his case is currently pending in federal court in Brooklyn.  According to the U.S. Justice Department, Goldman earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  Goldman is in ongoing discussions with U.S. and Malaysian authorities over their investigations into what the bank knew about the transactions at the time.","71":"FILE PHOTO: A Goldman Sachs sign is seen above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in the Manhattan borough of New York January 24, 2014.

Prysmian was fined 104.6 million euros ($127 million) by EU antitrust regulators in 2014 for taking part in a cartel with 10 other cable makers.  Its penalty included a joint fine of 37.3 million euros with Goldman Sachs, which had acquired the Italian company via one of its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.  The European Commission in its 2014 decision said Goldman Sachs, as the parent company, had decisive influence over Prysmian. A lower EU tribunal in 2018 backed its argument.  The Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) agreed with the reasoning and rejected Goldman Sachs\u2019 appeal.  \u201cThe General Court did not err in law in finding that, in the present case, the Commission was entitled to rely on a presumption of actual exercise of decisive influence in order to establish the appellant\u2019s liability for the infringement at issue in relation to the pre-IPO period,\u201d CJEU judges said.

FILE PHOTO: Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, pauses while playing bridge as part of the company annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska U.S. May 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Rick Wilking\/File Photo  The changes were disclosed on Tuesday in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire\u2019s U.S.-listed stock holdings as of June 30.  Investors closely watch Berkshire\u2019s quarterly stock listings for signs about where Buffett and his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler might see value.  The filings do not say which managers bought which stocks. Berkshire spent $6.08 billion on equities in the quarter.  Berkshire boosted its Goldman stake by 21 percent, owning roughly 13.3 million shares worth $2.92 billion on June 30, up from 11 million shares on March 31.  That stake had its origins in a profitable investment in Goldman preferred stock that Berkshire made during the 2008 financial crisis.  The Teva stake grew 7 percent to 43.25 million American depositary receipts worth about $1.05 billion. Teva\u2019s ADRs rose 1.2 percent after market hours.  Berkshire also said its Apple stake swelled to about 252 million shares worth close to $47 billion, up 5 percent from 239.6 million shares three months earlier.  Berkshire owns roughly 5 percent of Apple, whose market value surpassed $1 trillion last week.  Buffett, who turns 88 on Aug. 30, often buys stock when he cannot find whole businesses to add to Berkshire\u2019s stable of more than 90 companies in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors.  The billionaire has gone 2-1\/2 years since completing a major acquisition for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire.  Several of the portfolio changes affected bank and airline stocks, reflecting Buffett\u2019s usual policy not to own more than 10 percent of a company\u2019s shares.  Berkshire said it sometimes exceeds the 10 percent cap when companies whose stock it owns repurchase their own shares, forcing it to sell some of its holdings.  Buffett does make exceptions, including for longtime holdings American Express Co AXP.N and dialysis company DaVita Inc DVA.N.  In Tuesday's filing, Berkshire reported higher stakes in Axalta Coating Systems Ltd AXTA.N, Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N, General Motors Co GM.N, Liberty Global Plc LBTYA.O, Southwest Airlines Inc LUV.N and US Bancorp USB.N.

It employs 350 people at its main UK site in Renfrew, near Glasgow.  Howden, founded in 1854 and bought by Colfax in 2012, makes core earnings of more than 150 million pounds, two of the sources said, adding the business would mainly appeal to private equity funds due to lackluster interest amid industry buyers.  Goldman, which declined to comment, is expected to send confidential information to potential bidders this week, one of the sources said.  Colfax was not immediately available for comment.  The sale would cement Colfax\u2019s shift from its industrial roots following the $3.15 billion purchase of medical devices maker DJO Global Inc. in November.  Colfax, which has a market value of $2.8 billion, bought DJO - its biggest ever deal - to tap growing demand for medical devices such as knee and hip implants from aging baby boomers.  At the time, it said it would explore options - including a possible sale - for Howden, which in 2017 generated 40 percent of Colfax\u2019s total revenue of $3.3 billion.  The change of direction spooked some investors, with Colfax shares tumbling 15 percent on the news.

The investment bank has been asked to study potential options of Deutsche Post, which is shying away from making large investments in StreetScooter or taking on risks tied to large scale vehicle production, the people said.  Potential partners, including carmakers, are generally better equipped to deal with activities like sales and marketing, product liability management and procurement of parts, they added.  Private equity groups are also expected to show interest if all or part of the company is put up for sale, they said, adding that a stock market flotation also remained an option.  Deutsche Post CEO Frank Appel has said in the past that he would expect large interest from German and foreign groups, be it peers or investors, noting that analysts have valued StreetScooters at several billion euros.  Deutsche Post and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Deutsche Post initially developed the StreetScooter for its own use, but due to demand from rivals looking to reduce emissions, it has boosted production and is selling to third parties.  It put the StreetScooter business into a new unit in April and Appel has said options for the unit included an initial public offering, a sale or a partnership.  However, he also said that Deutsche Post would run StreetScooter, which Deutsche Post fully acquired in 2014, for at least two years.  Deutsche Post operates about 6,000 electric vehicles and in May opened a second StreetScooter production site. The company views its e-vans as an advantage in its day-to-day business of delivering parcels as German cities become increasingly sensitive to issues on air pollution.  StreetScooter already cooperates with Ford and has developed its StreetScooter Work XL model.

The suit alleges Goldman conspired with unidentified people from Malaysia to bribe Khadem Abdulla al-Qubaisi, former IPIC managing director and Aabar chairman, and Mohamed Ahmed Badawy al-Husseiny, former Aabar chief executive, to further the business of Goldman and 1MDB at the expense of IPIC and Aabar.  \u201cWe are in the process of assessing the details of the allegations and fully expect to contest the claim vigorously,\u201d a Goldman spokesman said.

FILE PHOTO: Outgoing European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso attends the review of the Barroso II Commission at the EU Parliament in Strasbourg, October 21, 2014. REUTERS\/Christian Hartmann\/File Photo  \u201cI have not and will not lobby EU officials,\u201d he tweeted after a European Ombudsman\u2019s report said his successor at the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, had failed to properly scrutinize whether Barroso\u2019s new job undermined fragile public trust in the European Union.  Barroso, a former Portuguese prime minister, ran into furious criticism, including from Juncker, when he joined the U.S. bank in July 2016, less than two years after leaving an EU executive that eurosceptics branded out of touch with voters.  Brussels was reeling at that time from Britons\u2019 vote to quit the bloc just two weeks earlier.  The controversy has resurfaced as Juncker faces his own troubles. The European Parliament and the Ombudsman are reviewing complaints after last month\u2019s surprise promotion of his chief-of-staff to run the Commission\u2019s civil service.  Barroso said Ombudsman Emily O\u2019Reilly made no \u201clegal assessment\u201d of his duties for the bank but said he did not oppose her call for a new review by the Commission\u2019s ethics committee which in 2016 found no reason to object to his job.  In an exchange of letters with O\u2019Reilly, published by the Ombudsman on Thursday, Barroso accused her of mounting a \u201cthinly veiled ad personam political attack\u201d.  O\u2019Reilly in turn dismissed Barroso\u2019s account that his meeting in October with former Commission colleague Jyrki Katainen was a private matter. She said Katainen, now a vice president under Juncker, had registered it in the EU public lobbying record as a meeting with \u201cGoldman Sachs\u201d.  PENSION RIGHTS  In light of that meeting, O\u2019Reilly recommended the Commission\u2019s watchdog determine whether his new employment met the obligation for former commissioners to act with integrity and not damage the EU\u2019s image. The panel can cut pension rights for any breach, but has never done so.  \u201cMuch of the recent negative sentiment around this issue could have been avoided if the Commission had at the time taken a formal decision on Mr Barroso\u2019s employment with Goldman Sachs,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said in a statement. It could have obliged him not to engage in any lobbying at the Commission, she added.  Despite vocal criticism, others have defended the right of top officials to find new work and have said attacking banks, and Goldman Sachs in particular, showed political prejudice.  Goldman Sachs said in a statement that Barroso, who left his position as president of the Commission in late 2014, had \u201cfrom the beginning of his time with us recused himself from representing the firm in any interactions with EU officials\u201d.  Juncker had criticized Barroso for taking a job with a bank accused by some of contributing to Europe\u2019s economic crisis but said he could not obstruct the move as an 18-month \u201ccooling off\u201d period to avert conflicts of interest had lapsed.  Juncker later doubled the cooling off period for himself and successors and asked the ethics committee to look at Barroso\u2019s move. The watchdog found no ground to object in late 2016 but the Ombudsman launched her own inquiry last year.  A Commission spokesman said it would consider her report and reply within her three-month deadline.

Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1 last year, shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against him, another Goldman Sachs official Tim Leissner, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho over the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).  Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, while Low has denied wrongdoing and remains at large.  Malaysian prosecutors have filed separate criminal charges against the three, as well as an application to extradite Ng to the United States.  Defence lawyer Tan Hock Chuan last week had requested for Ng to be released on medical reasons pending the extradition proceedings.  Judge Edwin Paramjothy Michael Muniandy, however, dismissed the request for bail on Monday saying there was insufficient evidence that Ng was too unfit to remain in custody.  The judge said the court also considered Ng a serious flight risk, given the gravity and high-profile nature of the cases against him in Malaysia and the United States.  \u201cWith the likelihood that the respondent will abscond, I\u2019m of the considered view that the respondent\u2019s presence (in court) cannot be secured by the setting of bail or the setting of any condition to the granting of bail,\u201d he said.

The U.S. Justice Department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise. The 1MDB scandal erupted into public view in 2015, and led to last year\u2019s electoral defeat of Najib Razak, ending his near decade long stint as prime minister. It also spelt the downfall of the United Malays National Organisation, the party that had led every government since Malaysia emerged from colonial rule.

Three of the insurer\u2019s executives were among the five other defendants sentenced to life terms in one of Indonesia\u2019s biggest anti-graft trials by a special corruption court in Jakarta, the capital.  Tjokrosaputro, who had made international headlines with a $1-billion lawsuit he once filed against Goldman Sachs, was ordered to pay compensation of 6 trillion rupiah ($410 million) at his sentencing on Monday, the agency added.  The court found Tjokrosaputro, chief commissioner of property developer Hanson International, guilty of corruption and money laundering by conspiring with other investors to inflate shares in Indonesia\u2019s main equity market.  He made arrangements with Jiwasraya executives to invest in stocks and then used gains to buy properties and foreign currencies, the agency said, citing court documents.  The businessman had used his knowledge to \u201ctarnish the reputation of, and erode public trust in, the capital market,\u201d Antara quoted Judge Rosmina, who uses one name, as saying.  Tjokrosaputro could not be reached for comment. In a statement, his lawyer, Muchtar Arifin, dismissed as baseless the accusation that his client had controlled share prices owned by other people, and added that the businessman planned to appeal.  Bad investments led Jiwasraya to default on more than 10,000 bancassurance policies in 2018 and the government has yet to resolve some of the debt outstanding to policyholders.  The case caused estimated state losses of 16.81 trillion rupiah ($1.15 billion), government auditors have said.

AccessFintech\u2019s technology will help reduce the time and resources needed to resolve these issues by helping financial institutions communicate with each other. It will also reduce the risks associated with the errors.  Large banks have become more open to collaborating with each other and with young financial technology startups on areas that do not give them an edge over rivals.  \u201cWe see a dramatic level of difference as to what banks are willing to collaborate on, or outsource to shared vendors instead of building internally,\u201d Roy Saadon, founder and chief executive of AccessFintech, said in an interview. \u201cWe see the banks in a search for efficiency in the places where things are not competitive.\u201d Saadon was one of the co-founders of market infrastructure provider Traiana.

Solomon, who is now effectively the chief executive officer-in-waiting after his rival in the succession race decided to leave the Wall Street bank, is trying to get dealmakers and traders to work together to produce more revenue. He is also pushing for growth in businesses like asset management and consumer lending, where Goldman does not have a long track record of success.  Since the strategy was unveiled in September, Wall Street has been rife with skepticism that Goldman, whose annual revenues have remained stuck below $40 billion since 2010, can make it happen. Analysts have repeatedly questioned management\u2019s underlying assumptions for the $5 billion target in research reports and on public conference calls.  Privately, many bankers and traders scoff at the idea that Solomon can get competing sides of the house to cooperate.  \u201cI have been with Goldman for 20 years and have been hearing this idea for as long as I have been here,\u201d one dealmaker told Reuters about the cross-selling plan.  \u201cI never in my 23 years here been asked by a client to be introduced to our stock brokers,\u201d said an investment banker at a rival firm.  Like several others, those bankers spoke about Solomon and the revenue strategy he helped engineer on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.  But associates who spoke to Reuters about Solomon described a direct, decisive leader who has proven he can convince clients to do more business with Goldman Sachs, and who can also get a team motivated behind an untested strategy.  For instance, as co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank from 2006-2016, Solomon is credited with bolstering the debt financing business.  NOT HOPING TO GO BACK A DECADE  Goldman had historically avoided putting its balance sheet to work to support deals because the bank usually represented acquisition targets rather than acquirers. But Solomon, who spent the early part of his career in debt markets, saw big opportunities for Goldman to be a lender at a time when low interest rates were prompting companies to borrow at an unprecedented rate.  His decision helped the broader investment banking unit\u2019s revenue soar 70 percent during the time Solomon was one of its leaders. That helped offset a sharp decline in trading revenue that has plagued Goldman since 2009.  A $5 billion increase would represent growth of around 15 percent over Goldman\u2019s 2017 net revenues of more than $32 billion. In 2016 revenues of $30.6 billion were down more than $3 billion from 2015. The firm reported $45.17 billion in revenues in 2009, second only to its record revenues of $45.99 billion in 2007.  \u201cWe don\u2019t sit around hoping that 2007 or 2009 will happen again and that the world will go back to where we were a decade ago,\u201d said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer. \u201cDavid is a leader who embraces the future without forgetting the past. And he\u2019s got a strong heritage within one of our strongest businesses.\u201d  More recently, Solomon has been encouraging investment bankers to go beyond the CEOs they typically pursue for M&A transactions, and also to develop relationships with corporate treasurers and executives who oversee operations like hedging. The idea is to convince those who choose which banks to borrow from and trade with to use Goldman Sachs instead of powerhouses like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Citigroup Inc.  Solomon is not shy about getting personally involved, associates said, leading client meetings and giving feedback. He has also been a big proponent of cross-selling for many years. When he ran investment banking, he made a particular effort to connect people within the investment banking and investment management divisions to share expertise and ensure better client coverage.  \u201cDavid has got everyone in a room talking about collaboration a lot more,\u201d another executive said.  Solomon clearly has some level of support internally \u2013 including from his boss, CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who told Goldman\u2019s board of directors last month that Solomon was his top pick as a future successor, a person familiar with the matter said. That decision prompted Harvey Schwartz, the other co-chief operating officer, to announce this week that he will leave the bank in April.  But Solomon still has work to do in winning over Wall Street, where investors and analysts remain skeptical of management\u2019s revenue plan.  Instinet analyst Steve Chubak took a close look at assumptions behind Goldman\u2019s plan to produce $5 billion more in annual revenue by 2020 in a November report titled \u201cAll That Is Goldman Does Not Glitter.\u201d He concluded that management\u2019s view on the profit potential of consumer lending was too rosy and that, overall, the new business will not make up for high-margin trading revenue that has evaporated.  Others expressed similar doubts in interviews this week.  \u201cLloyd Blankfein is a master of markets...and those are tough shoes to fill,\u201d said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo (Reporting by Catherine Ngai and Gregory Roumeliotis in New York Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Leslie Adler)","115":"David M.

Goldman\u2019s analysts said an Eskom risk gauge used by the bank was now close to its most elevated reading since it was started in 2013, suggesting that markets were currently pricing \u201cclose to peak Eskom risk\u201d.  While there was no precedent in South Africa, they said international experience with distressed quasi-sovereign entities suggested Eskom credit spreads to U.S. debt could conceivably widen to more than 1000 basis points.  \u201cIn a negative one where Eskom risk rises further, the rand could weaken by 3.5 percent and (South African government debt) yields could widen by 45 basis points,\u201d Goldman\u2019s analysts said, adding that even more outsized reactions were also possible.  In contrast, in a positive scenario where Eskom stress dropped back to 2014 levels, modelling pointed to a 4.5 percent stronger rand and a 55 basis point improvement in 10-year government yields.  Eskom said back in December it wanted the government to take on 100 billion rand ($7.2 billion) of its debts. It has been implementing power cuts in recent months and is fighting for survival after a decade of financial decline.  The next Eskom-related developments to watch include: a report from a high-level taskforce at the end of January; the finance minister\u2019s budget speech in mid- to late February; and a tariff announcement from South Africa\u2019s electricity tariff regulator, NERSA, due by March 1.  \u201cWith more acute financial and operational issues at the company and the taskforce report due at the end of the month, we think that policy decisions relating to Eskom could be more forthcoming now than they have been at times in the past.\u201d  \u201cNonetheless, given the current political constraints related to upcoming general elections (likely to take place in May 2019), any deeper-cutting and more comprehensive policies may only be possible post-elections,\u201d Goldman said.

FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The Wall-Street bank raised its May global demand estimate by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), but still sees a decline of 16 million bpd from pre-COVID levels.  However, recovering demand and lower output would push the global oil market into deficit in June, it said in a note dated May 13.  The bank said the biggest improvement in demand continues to be in gasoline road transportation, and in China, the United States and Germany, but re-iterated its view that a return to normal demand levels will take time.  Goldman expects oil prices to have limited upside in coming months, citing a big inventory overhang and the ability for shut-in production in North America to restart if prices rally further.  The bank maintained its summer price forecasts of $30 per barrel for Brent and $28 per barrel for WTI as demand uncertainty in coming months remains high.  \u201cWe believe that the next stage of the oil market rebalancing will be one of range-bound spot prices with the most notable shifts being a decline in implied volatility as well as a continued flattening of the forward curve without long-dated prices rising yet,\u201d it said.  Oil prices rose on Thursday after an unexpected drop in U.S. crude stocks. Brent crude futures were trading at $29.37 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) at $25.56 a barrel.  Brent crude prices are still down more than 50% for the year after the coronavirus pandemic slashed fuel demand, forcing oil producers, including OPEC and other producers including Russia, a grouping known as OPEC+, to scale back production.  \u201cOutside of OPEC+, production appears to have fallen slightly faster than our expectations,\u201d Goldman said, adding it expects core-OPEC production increases to occur in the final quarter of this year rather than the 0.3 million bpd previously pegged for the third quarter.  Current binding inventory constraints will keep prices capped through 2020, setting the stage for a big deficit in 2021 that will lead prices well above the forward curve, the bank added.","118":"NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday that Deborah Leone, the chief operating officer of its investment management division, will retire at the end of March after nearly 30 years at the U.S. bank.  Leone, who took the role in mid-2017, was a key leader in the group after it was split off from the trading business and merged with Marcus, Goldman\u2019s digital bank, to create the consumer and investment management business in late 2018.  The investment management division has around $2 trillion in assets under supervision, up from $1 trillion in 2014. Overall, the business contributes about 20 percent of the firm\u2019s revenues.  The division includes a private bank for ultra-rich individual clients and asset management for pension funds, insurers and other institutional clients.  Leone\u2019s retirement was announced in a memo sent to employees Thursday by Timothy O\u2019Neill and Eric Lane, investment management division global co-heads.  \u201cHer strategic thinking and broad technical skill set have been critical to both the growth and risk management of the firm,\u201d O\u2019Neill and Lane wrote in the memo.  Leone joined the bank in 1989, and was named partner in 2008. Prior to taking the COO job, she was the global head of internal audit and global head of the investment management division\u2019s controllers.  A member of Goldman Sachs Bank USA\u2019s board of directors, Leone will become an advisory director at the end of March, according to the memo.

The initiatives laid out last year have produced $2.5 billion so far in 2018, according to a presentation Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr gave at an industry event. He stopped short of increasing the target, but suggested Goldman could still do better.  \u201cThis is by no means the limit of the ambition of the firm,\u201d said Scherr, who plans to provide a strategic update in the spring.  The presentation marks the first under a new management team at Goldman Sachs. The bank is now led by a team of longtime dealmakers, including Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, who started on Oct. 1, Chief Operating Officer John Waldron and Scherr, who gave the presentation on his first day in the CFO role.  It showed Goldman making headway on plans to lend more to consumers and big businesses, with its fledgling digital bank, Marcus, now boasting 2 million customers. Goldman wants to grow market share and eventually become a \u201cone-stop shop for financial well-being,\u201d according to Scherr\u2019s presentation.  Goldman is also working to improve core areas such as trading and asset management, and to squeeze more revenue from the investment bank where Solomon and his deputies built their careers.

FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at Marcus, a new savings and loans app recently launched by Goldman Sachs in New York, U.S., January 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  The British arm of digital brand Marcus, which pays market-leading rates to savers starved of meaningful cash returns, has attracted about 21 billion pounds ($27 billion) from more than 500,000 savers since its launch in 2018.  However, British banking rules demanding ring-fencing of retail deposits totalling more than 25 billion pounds have prompted its executives to take steps to manage its growth.  \u201cWe\u2019ve really seen our growth accelerate under lockdown as people hold off on discretionary spending and take time to reorganise their finances and get the best deal for their money,\u201d Des McDaid, head of Marcus UK, told Reuters.  Ring-fencing would require Marcus in Britain to become a separate legal entity with its own board and limit how much capital it could share with the rest of Goldman\u2019s businesses.  \u201cSeparating Marcus financially and operationally from Goldman Sachs would be a significant change to our low-cost business model, which allows us to pay consistently competitive rates to existing savers,\u201d McDaid added.  Several British bank executives have said the brand named after Marcus Goldman, co-founder of the Wall Street investment bank, is one of the most potent \u201cdisruptors\u201d in the market.  An analysis last month by think-tank New Policy Institute estimated that British households had cut their spending by 57 billion pounds since lockdown began on March 23.  McDaid said that Marcus had achieved inflows of more than 8 billion pounds from about 100,000 new account holders since January, and by 4 billion pounds since the lockdown began, suggesting that a significant slice of household income is being saved.  Marcus has helped Goldman to diversify into consumer banking and provided billions of dollars of cheaper deposit-based funding to fuel its investment banking activities.  Goldman was committed to the retail savings market in Britain and was on track to launch an app and tax-efficient Individual Savings Account this year, McDaid said, adding that its 12-month fixed-rate account is still open to new savers.  The temporary shutdown could represent a blow to millions of savers in Britain by cutting competition and reducing pressure on other banks to match its rates.  Finance product provider Moneyfacts.co.uk last week warned consumers to brace for a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d on savings rates and products after average rates on easy access accounts hit record lows.

In a note to clients sent shortly after the central bank left the Selic rate on hold at its current record low of 6.50%, Alberto Ramos, Goldman\u2019s head of Latin American research, said the rate-cutting cycle will start in September with a 25-basis point cut, although he could not rule out a 50-bps cut in July.

The bank\u2019s analysts cut their baseline earnings per share estimate for S&P 500 index companies to $165 from $174 in 2020, implying that profits will likely remain unchanged from a year ago.  Analysts had forecast a 7.7% rise in earnings, according to Refinitiv data.  Goldman Sachs said the latest forecast reflects a severe decline in Chinese economic activity in the first quarter, lower demand for U.S. exporters, supply chain disruptions and a slowdown in domestic economic activity.  The virus, which is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China. In the past week, several other countries also reported a spike in cases.  Goldman said it expects the S&P 500 to trade around 2,900 points in the near-term, which is 14.4% below the index\u2019s record closing high hit on Feb. 19, assuming the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield drops to 1%.  If the yield climbs to 1.5%, Goldman expects S&P 500 to hit 3,400 by the year-end.

Joseph Jiampietro, the former Goldman executive, said the Fed\u2019s \u201cneglect\u201d has left him \u201cindefinitely to suffer the effects\u201d of findings last June by the administrative law judge who recommended the ban.  Jiampietro, who said he never engaged in wrongful conduct, said the Fed should dismiss its enforcement case, or else issue a final decision so that he can ask a federal appeals court to take up the matter.  \u201cBy neglecting to take final agency action, the Reserve Board has effectively trapped Jiampietro in an administrative purgatory,\u201d lawyers for Jiampietro said in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.  The Fed had no immediate comment.  Jiampietro\u2019s case reflected difficulties that can arise when government employees move to the private sector but continue to communicate with their former employer.  The Fed accused Jiampietro of having in 2014 asked Goldman junior banker Rohit Bansal to obtain secrets from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Bansal once worked, for use in Goldman\u2019s client advisory work and pitches to potential clients.  Bansal and Jason Gross, his source at the New York Fed, pleaded guilty in November 2015 to theft of government property. Both were sentenced to probation and received industry bans.  The administrative law judge, Christopher McNeil, concluded that Jiampietro breached duties he owed to Goldman by ignoring \u201cred flags\u201d and failing to determine the confidential nature of documents originating from the Fed.  In Wednesday\u2019s filing, Jiampietro\u2019s lawyer Adam Ford said his client had no chance to properly defend himself after the Fed changed its theory on the case.  Ford said the Fed had abandoned its theory that Jiampietro directed Bansal\u2019s theft, and had instead argued that he merely failed to detect it, yet deserved the same punishment.  \u201cThe Reserve Board has a tremendous opportunity to fix a terrible injustice,\u201d Ford said in an email.  Goldman paid $86.3 million in penalties to the Fed and New York State\u2019s Department of Financial Services in connection with the leaking. It fired Jiampietro and Bansal in 2014. Goldman, Bansal and Gross are not defendants in Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit.

In response, Apple said it does \u201cnot expect the introduction of Apple TV+, including the accounting treatment for the service, to have a material impact on our financial results.\u201d  A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment or to make the analyst available for interview. Apple also declined to comment on the Goldman relationship beyond its comment on the note.  While research departments at large Wall Street banks have Chinese walls separating them from other functions, the rare public dispute is an awkward moment between the two companies.  Goldman Sachs has underwritten more bond issuances for Apple in the last decade than any other investment bank, worth some $44 billion, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.  Goldman Sachs also advised Apple on mergers and acquisitions as recently as two months ago, guiding it through its $1 billion deal to acquire the majority of Intel\u2019s smartphone modem business, according to Refinitiv.  And just last month, the two worked together to launch both companies\u2019 first credit card -- the Apple Card.  Every bank formally separates its equity research and investment bank divisions because of laws passed in the early 2000s that aimed to protect the independence of the equity analysts from investment bankers, who are often covering the same companies with different agendas.  Corporate clients usually respect the independence of the research division. When they don\u2019t, it gets a lot of attention.  In May last year, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk refused to answer questions from analysts about the company\u2019s capital requirements, calling the questions \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cnot cool\u201d during a conference call to discuss Tesla\u2019s performance. He later criticized several analysts directly for negative calls.  At the beginning of its fiscal year, Apple changed where it accounts for the value and costs of free services - like Apple Maps - and moved it into its services segment. Previously this was accounted for under the individual products.  In his note, Goldman\u2019s Hall said Apple was likely to treat TV+ subscriptions in a similar way, by accounting for it as a discounted bundle of a free service paired with a hardware purchase. Hall said that would result in Apple investors seeing lower average selling prices for iPhones and other Apple devices but faster growth in the company\u2019s services segment.  Many Apple investors have come to focus on growth in the services segment as the global smart phone market has stagnated, with Apple shares rising this year despite year over year declines in iPhone sales for its most recent two quarters.","175":"FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.

However, thousands of U.S. banks have said they may not participate in the lending program because of the legal and financial risks involved.

The Paris-based company, founded in 2013, aims to more than double its staff to 150 by the end of the year, hiring computer engineers and managers to develop new messaging tools for its users and make better use of the data it collects.  The video game industry is a fast-growing business that has reached $100 billion in worldwide revenue last year, market research firm DFC Intelligence said.  The greater use of smartphones, combined with increased access to high-speed mobile internet, is driving up demand for mobile video games.  Voodoo\u2019s free-of-charge games are among the most-downloaded worldwide by smartphone users via Apple\u2019s App Store and Google Play. It has about 150 million regular users per month and its games were downloaded about 300 million times last year.  One of its recent successes, Helix Jump, features a bouncing ball that has to progress through a helix tower labyrinth.  The terms of the deal with Goldman Sachs\u2019 fund, West Street Capital Partners, were not disclosed. But the Voodoo\u2019s two co-founders, Alexandre Yazdi and Laurent Ritter, will keep control over a majority of the shares, according to a statement.  \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a change of scale for us,\u201d Yazdi told Reuters.  \u201cThe challenge for us now will be to attract engineers and product managers who have artistic skills and a sensibility.\u201d  The company, which only employs people in France, might build sales teams in the United States within two years to work more closely with Apple and Google, which both offer advertising and distribution tools, Yazdi said.  Voodoo competes head-to-to head with Ubisoft\u2019s Ketchapp, bought by the France\u2019s biggest video game maker in 2014. Other rivals include Vivendi\u2019s Gameloft.  The company is profitable and makes money through ads shown to its users. Users can, however, avoid watching them by paying a premium.

The percentage of customers with Goldman credit cards or loans from its online bank Marcus who had FICO scores below 660 rose to 18% as of March 31, up from 15% at the end of last year, according to a securities filing last week. A score above 670 indicates a borrower can reliably pay debts on time, while a score between 580 and 669 is shakier, according to creditcards.com.  Goldman has been careful not to grow its consumer portfolio too much in recent months, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down major economies and put millions of people out of work, executives have said. That suggests the decline in credit quality is because borrowers the bank targeted many months ago experienced some financial hardships that dinged their credit scores, said D.A. Davidson analyst David Konrad.  While Marcus remains a tiny part of Goldman Sachs, it attracts attention on Wall Street because Chief Executive David Solomon has made growing consumer deposits and lending a key pillar in his turnaround strategy for the bank.  \u201cIt will likely slow down part of (Goldman\u2019s) transformational strategic plan, given the shock to the economy,\u201d Konrad said.  The total balance of loans and credit card balances Goldman held was $6.9 billion at the end of the first quarter, up from $6.6 billion in the fourth quarter last year, the only two quarters for which the bank has disclosed this information.  Marcus offers a joint credit card with Apple Inc AAPL.O, as well as installment loans marketed for paying off credit card debt. Although the business has grown quickly since its launch in 2015, its loan book is largely uncollateralized, making it vulnerable to sharp economic downturns.  U.S. gross domestic product declined at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since late 2008. Since March 21, some 33.5 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment benefits. Goldman\u2019s chief financial officer, Stephen Scherr, said on a call with analysts last month that the bank will slow growth in consumer lending \u201cas we seek to manage our risk profile and reduce the pace of origination during this period of market and economic dislocation.\u201d","180":"FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.

Goldman's announcement followed similar moves by lenders like Citigroup C.N, which rolled out hardship assistance to customers last week, and automakers, which offered customers the chance to reschedule car loan payments.

Gold has gained about 14% so far in 2019, on track for its biggest annual rise since 2010, but is down about 6% from a six-year peak of $1,557 an ounce in early September.  Goldman, in a note dated Dec. 6, attributed this fall to rising global risk appetite on an easing in U.S.-China trade tensions and a strong U.S. labor market.  However, \u201cwithout a major growth acceleration, recession fears are likely to remain elevated supported by a low unemployment rate and an inverted yield curve,\u201d it added.  \u201cHousehold savings in major developed economies are growing strongly which, combined with a slump in global capex, resulted in a global savings glut. That should boost the demand for defensive assets such as gold,\u201d Goldman said.  The U.S. investment bank predicted a small depreciation in the U.S. dollar, which should make gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, in 2020. It also expects political uncertainty due to prolonged trade tensions and the U.S. elections, which should drive demand for gold.  Geopolitical uncertainty is already translating into greater gold demand, Goldman said, adding that 2019 will likely be a record year for global central bank (CB) buying with a target of 750 tonnes combined purchases.  \u201cNext year, we see CB purchases slightly below 2019 but likely to remain elevated due to high geological uncertainty, a low level of rates globally and a low share of gold in a number of EM CB reserves.\u201d","182":"LONDON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) plunged 16% year-on-year to $729 billion in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data, the lowest quarterly volume since 2016, as growing economic uncertainty curbed the risk appetite of companies considering deals.  FILE PHOTO: Chinese and U.S. flags flutter near The Bund, before U.S. trade delegation meet their Chinese counterparts for talks in Shanghai, China July 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/  Concerns that the trade war between the United States and China has plunged global economic growth to its lowest levels in a decade weighed on dealmaking, even as debt financing for acquisitions remained cheap and equity markets stayed robust.  \"M&A volumes have dissipated because there are concerns that risks may be rising in several spots, in markets and elsewhere,\" said Michael Carr, global co-head of M&A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N.  The United States, where consumer spending barely rose in the summer and business investment remained subdued amid the trade tensions, was particularly hit. U.S. M&A sank 40% year-on-year to $246 billion in the third quarter, the lowest such quarterly level since 2014.  Asia, which has been hit by concerns over the future of Hong Kong as a financial hub following a wave of pro-democracy protests, fared only slightly better. M&A activity in the region dropped 20% year-to-year to $160 billion, the lowest level since 2017.  Dealmakers said a mismatch between buyer and seller valuation expectations often proved hard to bridge, with some deals failing to reach the finish line.  \"Companies looking at deals have become more risk-averse, and this is likely to bring M&A volumes down for the year. But we expect M&A activity to be strong going into next year,\" said Robin Rankin, global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.S.  The only regional bright spot in the third quarter was Europe, where M&A activity reached $249 billion, up more than 45% over the same period last year.  \"In Europe we have seen a real mix of different kind of deals which were spread across various sectors and geographies,\" said Eamon Brabazon, co-head of EMEA M&A at Bank of America Corp BAC.N.  \u201cThis is a sign of a healthy market because we\u2019re not relying only on a particular strand. There\u2019s no obvious reason to believe the M&A market will turn south in the foreseeable future,\u201d he added.  BREXIT BARGAINS  Britain, where uncertainty over Brexit has turned companies into cheaper acquisition targets, remained Europe\u2019s biggest M&A market with a 6.4% share of global M&A and $177 billion worth of deals so far this year.

A big attempted transaction in the third quarter was Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's (HKEX) 0388.HK proposed $39 billion takeover approach to the London Stock Exchange Plc (LSE) LSE.L. The latter has so far rejected HKEX's overtures.  The biggest deal attempted in the quarter was Marlboro maker Philip Morris International Inc's PM.N bid to reunite with Altria Group Inc MO.N, in what would have been the biggest corporate merger since 2016, creating a tobacco giant with a market value of more $200 billion. The deal was abandoned last week amid concerns about regulators cracking down on e-cigarettes and vaping products.  Among the big deals in the quarter that made it to the finish line and were sealed with merger agreements were the $24.6 billion merger of U.S. drug giant Pfizer Inc's PFE.N off-patent branded drugs business with Mylan NV MYL.O, and U.S. media companies CBS Corp CBS.N and Viacom Inc's VIAB.O merger in a $20 billion all-stock deal.  As companies deliberate whether they should ink deals by the end of the year, dealmakers expect the M&A pipeline ahead to stay healthy, possibly matching last year\u2019s annual volumes of $3.91 trillion in announced transactions.  \u201cManagement teams are watching very closely because shareholders expect companies to take advantage of these conditions to grow their business,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Carr said.","183":"(Refiles to remove extraneous word in the headline)  NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Tuesday it is reviewing its involvement in Megvii Technology Ltd\u2019s planned initial public offering (IPO) in light of U.S. action against the Chinese artificial intelligence firm.  \u201cWe are evaluating in light of the recent developments,\u201d the bank said in an emailed statement in response to a request for comment after the Trump Administration moved to ban U.S. companies from selling technology to 28 Chinese entities, including Megvii.

But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank\u2019s fledgling consumer business through credit card lending.  Goldman has been courting consumers since the 2016 launch of its online bank Marcus, and with its first credit card it is targeting fee-conscious ones. There will be no annual or late fees, and customers will pay variable annual interest rates of between 13.24 percent and 24.24 percent, according to Apple\u2019s website.  Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday.  But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets.  \u201cAs this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,\u201d said a person involved in similar credit card deals.  Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said.  Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a \u201cmajor step\u201d in the bank\u2019s plan to grow its consumer business.  Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank\u2019s strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading.  But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.  Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon\u2019s email.  While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank\u2019s overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt.  \u201cPeople want Goldman to be Goldman,\u201d Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article.  The Apple Card\u2019s wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books.  \u201cThey might securitize the debt, which wouldn\u2019t be anything new for an investment bank,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt.\u201d  As this is Goldman\u2019s first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named.  The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take.  Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman\u2019s decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share.  While Apple says its card is \u201ccreated by Apple, not a bank,\u201d according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card.  \u201cFor Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.  \u201cIt makes their brand way better at least in the retail and mass affluent marketplace.\u201d (Reporting By Elizabeth Dilts and Anna Irrera in New Yor.

Last year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman over its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. Prosecutors in August filed criminal charges against 17 current and former directors at its units.  Malaysia had a strong case and was very confident of winning, Nikkei on Thursday cited Malaysian Attorney General Tommy Thomas as saying, but that criminal charges and settlement negotiations were taking place in parallel.  \u201cA lot of cases are even settled even after the trial begins,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the doors for discussion are still open while the prosecution readies the criminal case.\u201d  Thomas and officials in his office were not immediately available for comment.  No date has been set for the criminal trial yet.

A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. The bank said on Tuesday it was in discussions with governmental and regulatory authorities on the possibility of a resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.  Najib, who lost a general election last year, is now facing dozens of graft and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1 billion in 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty.  Thomas said the government estimated that fugitive financier Jho Low, whom investigators have named as a key figure in the scandal, stole more than $10 billion from 1MDB but that it would be impossible to recover the full amount embezzled.  Low has consistently denied wrongdoing and a spokesman for him said in July that \u201cillegitimate proceedings\u201d had been brought by the government of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, and that their outcome was \u201cpre-ordained and politically motivated\u201d.","187":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sent subpoenas to Tesla Inc TSLA.O regarding Chief Executive Elon Musk's plan to take the company private and his statement that funding was \"secured,\" Fox Business Network reported on Wednesday, citing sources.  The electric carmaker's shares fell as much as 4 percent but cut their losses after Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N said it was dropping equity coverage of Tesla because it is acting as a financial adviser on a matter related to the automaker.  Investors viewed the Goldman statement as confirming a tweet from Elon Musk on Monday about working with Goldman, even as the reported subpoenas indicated the SEC has opened a formal investigation into a matter.  The latest news extended the roller-coaster ride for Tesla investors in recent days, adding to uncertainty about the future course of the company and whether a deal can be done amid growing regulatory complications.  Tesla and the SEC declined to comment.  Musk stunned investors and sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring 11 percent when he tweeted early last week that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 per share and that he had secured funding for the potential deal.  The shares fell 2.6 percent to $338.69 on Wednesday, below $341.99, their closing price the day before Musk tweeted his plan to take Tesla private.  The Tesla CEO provided no details of his funding until Monday, when he said in a blog on Tesla\u2019s website that he was in discussions with Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and other potential backers but that financing was not yet nailed down.  Musk also tweeted late Monday night he was working with Goldman Sachs and private equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers. However, as of Tuesday, Goldman was still negotiating its terms of engagement with Musk, according to a person familiar with the matter.

REUTERS\/Yuri Gripas  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - James Gorman has greeted the new boss at Goldman Sachs by showing him a clean pair of heels. Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief executive beat his own earnings target again in the latest quarter \u2013 and his downtown rival\u2019s returns, too, after stripping out surprisingly lower pay. It\u2019s yet more confirmation that Gorman has built a strong business worthy of commanding a higher multiple than its old adversary.  At first take, Morgan Stanley\u2019s showing in the three months to the end of June doesn\u2019t look much different than Goldman\u2019s. Earnings of $2.3 billion, unveiled on Wednesday, equate to an annualized return on equity of 13 percent. That\u2019s at the top end of what Gorman\u2019s shooting for, but only just ahead of his rival\u2019s 12.8 percent.  Goldman, though, only managed that return by setting aside just 37 percent of revenue to cover compensation. Usually the Wall Street firm puts around 41 percent into the pot in the first three quarters of the year. Finance chief Martin Chavez explained the ratio drop on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call by saying \u201cit\u2019s strong revenue growth year-on-year and our emphasis on profitability.\u201d  That certainly helped. If Goldman had left the ratio at its regular level, pre-tax earnings would have been almost $400 million lower and return on equity just 11.1 percent.  Retaining more earnings for shareholders is a worthy move \u2013 and still leaves the annualized average pay and benefits package at almost $400,000 per Goldman employee. But it may just turn out to be a one-off to help with more volatile underlying earnings.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s top and bottom lines look more stable, not least because it is not experiencing such wild swings in fixed-income trading \u2013 it restructured that business after suffering similar volatility several years ago. Nor does it have the lumpy results generated by Goldman\u2019s investing and lending unit. And Gorman has put more emphasis on less risky business that requires less capital. Wealth management now accounts for 36 percent of earnings.  Goldman\u2019s departing boss, Lloyd Blankfein, belatedly started the shift away from an excessive reliance on trading a couple of years ago. David Solomon, an investment banker who officially takes over in October, wants to augment that by shaking up Goldman\u2019s processes and management structure, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The Wall Street bank forecast U.S. oil output growth at 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) and 1.2 million bpd in 2019 and 2020 respectively, which compared with its global demand growth expectations of 0.8 million bpd and 1.6 million bpd respectively for the same periods.  \u201cOPEC\u2019s willingness to continue to cede market share (is) likely to limit downside as well,\u201d the bank said.

OPEC and its allies led by Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts until March 2020 last week.  \u201cAn exit strategy from the cuts was not discussed, and it remains to be seen whether the decision to extend cuts to accommodate shale growth will ultimately drive the need for deeper cuts in 2020,\u201d Goldman Sachs Equity Research said in a note on Sunday.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The bank\u2019s shares slipped nearly 3% as revenue at three of its four major businesses fell, including a 15% drop in investment banking revenue because of lower advisory and underwriting fees.  Net revenue at Goldman\u2019s investing and lending division slumped 40% as it swallowed a loss of about $80 million on its stake in WeWork owner The We Company, along with hits from other investments.  Chief Operating Officer Stephen Scherr blamed the bank's investments in ride-hailing company Uber UBER.N, medical device maker Avantor Inc AVTR.N and trading platform Tradeweb TW.O for the $267 million markdown in the quarter.  Scherr said those investments comprise 40% of the bank\u2019s $2.3 billion invested in public companies, and they \u201cwere the largest contributors to the downdraft.\u201d  Office-sharing startup WeWork\u2019s valuation plummeted from a peak of $47 billion in January to as low as $10-12 billion, Reuters reported last month, forcing it to pull its IPO. Uber\u2019s shares are down 24% since the company debuted earlier this year.  An analyst note out earlier this month from Morgan Stanley projected that Goldman could lose as much as $264 million on its investment in The We Company. After the writedown, the bank\u2019s equity in We is worth roughly $70 million, Scherr said.  MIXED RESULTS  The only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but a 6% growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in its other major businesses.  \u201cOverall, GS posted mixed results this quarter. While the top line beat to us was a positive, it was driven by more trading which tends to be less persistent and investment banking results were weak,\u201d analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients on Tuesday.  Bond trading revenue was up 8%, while equities rose 5%. JPMorgan JPM.N also reported a surge in bond trading.  Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks are facing several challenges in growing their revenue, largely as concerns of slowing growth have deterred companies from tapping public markets for funds, but Chief Executive David Solomon sounded optimistic on a call with analysts.  \u201cThe IPO process is alive and well in the United States,\u201d he said.  Under Solomon, Goldman has undertaken a major shift in strategy from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets.  Goldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.  Solomon has pushed his top lieutenants to bring in at least $5 billion of new revenue from those businesses by 2020, while simultaneously conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a number of new efficiency initiatives and a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.  The bank\u2019s net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 27% to $1.79 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.45 billion a year ago. Earnings per share fell to $4.79 from $6.28 a year earlier.  Total net revenue fell 6% to $8.32 billion.

Richdale will be KKR\u2019s Asia-Pacific head of strategy and business development, a newly created role, and will also work with its Asia investing businesses to assist with deal origination, the U.S. private equity firm said on Monday.  Richdale, a fluent Mandarin speaker, moved to Goldman in 2013 from Morgan Stanley in one of the most senior defections seen in Asian banking circles for years.  At the time, she was Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of investment banking for Asia \u2013 a key role.  In an internal memo to staff addressing the departure, Goldman said Richdale had played an important role in building its client coverage in Asia ex-Japan.  A spokeswoman for Goldman confirmed the content of the memo.  The departure is the latest in a series of top-rank moves at the U.S. bank. Last month, Goldman announced the retirement of its chairman and chief executive officer for Asia-Pacific ex-Japan, Ken Hitchner, who joined the bank in 1991.  Richdale\u2019s departure comes nearly five months after she and co-head Andrea Vella were promoted to the largely ceremonial role of investment bank co-chairs, which does not involve running the business on a daily basis.  Late last year, Goldman placed Vella on leave over his role in the bank\u2019s work for 1MDB, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at the centre of allegations of a multi-billion-dollar theft.  The bank\u2019s Asia investment bank has been headed by Todd Leland, a 26-year veteran of its U.S. and European operations, since October last year. In November, Goldman named Aaron Arth and Iain Drayton as co-chief operating officers in Asia.  Arth is currently head of the financing group for Asia-Pacific excluding Japan while Drayton runs the bank\u2019s financial and strategic investors group.  Goldman topped the Asia-Pacific mergers-and-acquisitions league table last year with $131.2 billion worth of deals, ahead of Morgan Stanley on $119 billion, showed data from Refinitiv. The bank also topped the region\u2019s equity league tables, working on deals worth $17.2 billion.  KKR hired Richdale and created her role as part of an ongoing move to strengthen its presence in Asia and improve its ability to operate in a broader range of businesses.  Richdale will take up the post in the second quarter of this year, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  In November, KKR hired David Luboff, CEO of Macquarie Group Ltd\u2019s Asia Infrastructure Fund, as its new head of Asia Pacific Infrastructure to build out a local team and potentially raise a regional infrastructure fund.  It has also appointed new leaders for its Asia real estate and credit businesses, it said on Monday.  Last year, KKR led a consortium to acquire Taipei-listed LCY Chemical Corp in a $1.56 billion stock deal, marking it the U.S. private equity firm\u2019s first deal in the island in more than a decade.","201":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. companies with more cash on their balance sheets thanks to tax reform are coming under greater scrutiny from activist investors, a top Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N investment banker said this week.  John Waldron, co-head of the Investment Banking Division, Goldman Sachs, speaks at the Milken Institute 21st Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Some 73 campaigns by U.S. and European activist shareholders were launched in the first quarter of 2018 against the boards of companies with market capitalization exceeding $500 million, the highest quarter on record, according to data from Lazard Ltd LAZ.N.  John Waldron, the co-head of Goldman Sachs investment bank division, said at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference that U.S. tax reform was a driver behind the rise in such campaigns.  \u201cThere\u2019s excess cash for most companies laying on the balance sheet and shareholders are going to press for answers of what they are going to do with it,\u201d Waldron told the Milken Conference in Los Angeles.  Sweeping tax reform was U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s first major legislative triumph since he took office in January 2017. Among the changes were a lowering of the headline corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the introduction of a one-time mandatory cash repatriation tax.  Waldron, whose bank advises companies on how to defend themselves against activist investors, said that a big question on his clients\u2019 minds is whether shareholders are going to give companies the time they need to decide how to deploy cash.  \u201cIs pressure going to mount to come out with a capital allocation plan that\u2019s fairly defined? How much is going into the business, how much is going to return capital to shareholders and how much will go to M&A?,\u201d Waldron said.  Share buybacks have been a popular tool among companies to return money to impatient investors. For example, Apple Inc AAPL.O earlier this week promised shareholders $100 billion in additional stock buybacks, the starkest example yet of how companies are using the mountain of overseas cash suddenly freed up by the tax overhaul.  Other companies announcing plans to return cash to shareholders recently include Facebook Inc FB.O, AbbVie Inc ABBV.N and Broadcom Inc AVGO.O.  Activist shareholders are paying attention. TCI Fund Asset Management said in March that Altaba Inc AABA.O, a company with a market capitalization of $57 billion that used to be a part of Yahoo Inc and holds large stakes in Alibaba Group Holdings BABA.N and Yahoo Japan Corp 4689.T, should take advantage of U.S. tax cuts and liquidate its assets.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more (activist shareholder) campaigns this year than in the past three years,\u201d Waldron said. The proliferation of activist campaigns is like \u201cthrowing gasoline on the fire,\u201d boosting mergers and acquisitions, Waldron added.

The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Analysts have feared slower corporate issuance could weigh on Wall Street debt underwriting and also crimp credit trading as companies adjust for higher interest rates and the U.S. tax code overhaul.  Debt underwriting revenues slumped from a year earlier at other U.S. banks that reported first-quarter results.  GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs\/2qBWYWK  At Morgan Stanley, which reports on Wednesday, fixed-income underwriting revenue could fall 11 percent from the year-ago quarter, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a report earlier this month.  Goldman\u2019s debt capital markets (DCM) business fell from a record fourth quarter but notched its second-best result with $797 million in revenue.  \u201cIt\u2019s really M&A as the driver for demand, for the issuance, and you\u2019ve seen the results flow through into revenues,\u201d said Goldman finance chief R. Martin Chavez on a call with analysts.  He highlighted Goldman\u2019s role in CVS Health Corp\u2019s $40 billion bond issuance to help fund its acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc.  The bank also said credit trading, which can be supported by issuance, was a factor behind its 23 percent rebound in fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) revenue.  A rebound in commodities and currencies trading during an uptick in broad market volatility also helped the improvement from a weak year-ago period.  Structured trading in particular boosted the credit business year on year, Goldman said. Peers had called out credit as an area of weakness in first-quarter FICC trading.  Bank of America Corp Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told reporters on Monday that FICC income for credit products in particular fell from a year earlier because the bank did not see as much DCM activity.  JPMorgan Chase & Co on Friday said lower client activity in credit and rates weighed on fixed-income trading.  On a call with analysts, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said the bank missed out on some \u201clarger fee events,\u201d and its pipeline for equities underwriting was likely stronger than for DCM given rising interest rates.  New issues for corporate investment-grade debt fell in the first quarter for the first time in four years to $343.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters IFR data. That was the lowest outright value since 2014.

The move comes as British lawmakers and regulators are pushing to weaken the grip of PwC, EY, Deloitte and KPMG, the so-called Big Four accounting firms that dominate audits of top companies in Britain.  A Mazars spokesman confirmed that it would be conducting Goldman Sachs International\u2019s European audit, which is focused on activities in Britain and Germany.

The U.S.-headquartered bank said Mazars will start in 2021, while PwC will remain the company\u2019s group auditor.

British savers have got used to payouts of 1 percent or less thanks to rock-bottom central bank rates, but the launch of Marcus with a 1.5 percent rate on Sept. 27 has shaken things up.  Google searches for \"savings account\" hit a five-year peak in Britain in the week of the Marcus launch, a Reuters analysis of data from Google trends shows.

Marcus has signed up 100,000 customers since its launch, its managing director Des McDaid told Reuters, adding that it wanted to put the lethargy in Britain\u2019s savings market on the agenda.  Since the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs has been trying to attract mass-market deposits to fund its other activities. It launched Marcus, whose emphasis on a customer-friendly image and simplicity contrasts with public perceptions of Goldman Sachs as a pillar of the financial elite, in 2016 in the United States.  But while some such as Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L and Nottingham Building Society matched Marcus after its British launch, most bank rates are still well below 1.5 percent.  A top executive at another of Britain\u2019s biggest banks said he was more worried about Marcus than other rivals because of the hefty financial firepower and institutional backing that Goldman Sachs provides as one of the biggest investment banks.  \u201cWe worry more about firms who start to play that already have capital... big, meaty players that can stay the course are more concerning than what\u2019s going on in a garage in Shoreditch,\u201d he said, referring to the London home of a number of start-ups.

FILE PHOTO: A woman speaks on her phone as she passes a branded logo outside the Talktalk headquarters in London, Britain May 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Neil Hall  TalkTalk also agreed a wholesale deal with CityFibre, which will see it switch its residential and business customers to CityFibre\u2019s FTTP networks, helping underpin the fibre network operator\u2019s expansion.  TalkTalk started laying its own fibre optic cables in York in a trial, initially partnering rival Sky and CityFibre, to challenge BT BT.L, the national network operator.  BT has been criticised for dragging its heels in building its own fibre-to-the-premises networks.  TalkTalk rolled the FTTP operation, which has connected 49,000 homes to date, into a new company, FibreNation, in 2018, which has ambitions to build a network serving 3 million premises.  TalkTalk CEO Tristia Harrison, who is focusing the company on low-priced broadband, said it had been working on the deal for a long time.  \u201cWe think the value is good, it\u2019s more than three times the investment that we\u2019ve made,\u201d she said in an interview.  A deal was delayed late last year when the opposition Labour Party pledged to nationalise BT\u2019s Openreach network if it won a December election, a move that would have upended the broadband market. Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives later won a decisive victory.  TalkTalk\u2019s shares were trading 0.5% lower at 114 pence in early trade, as analysts at Jefferies said the deal terms were in line with expectations.  Lazard LAZ.N acted as sole financial adviser to TalkTalk on the deal, which will allow the company to cut its debt load while retaining access to a FTTP network for its customer base.  CityFibre CEO Greg Mesch said buying FibreNation established CityFibre as the UK's third national digital infrastructure platform, behind Openreach and Liberty Global-owned LBTYA.O Virgin Media, and a major partner in the government's ambition to roll out FTTP nationwide by 2025.  \u201cThe UK is a service-based economy, and this runs best on full fibre,\u201d he said. \u201cEnsuring national coverage is critical and this can only be achieved by driving infrastructure competition at scale. This deal demonstrates the appetite from industry to see it established.\u201d  CityFibre, which is owned by Antin Infrastructure Partners and Goldman Sachs\u2019 West Street Infrastructure Partners, will add FibreNation\u2019s ambition of reaching 3 million premises by the middle of the decade to its own 5 million target.  \u201cFive million was roughly 60 towns, 8 million is roughly across 100 towns and cities,\u201d Mesch said. \u201cOur investment commitment moves up from 2.5 billion (pounds) to now 4 billion roughly of investment.\u201d  Mesch said CityFibre had reworked an existing wholesale agreement with Vodafone VOD.L to allow CityFibre to open up its networks to other consumer broadband providers sooner than planned.","206":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N investment banker pleaded guilty on Tuesday to insider trading, as part of what U.S. prosecutors have called a wide-ranging international trading ring to generate tens of millions of dollars of illegal profits.  Bryan Cohen, 33, who had been a vice president in Goldman\u2019s consumer retail industry group before his Oct. 18 arrest, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud before U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman in Manhattan.  He is the first defendant to plead guilty among six charged last October in four separate indictments, including New York businessman Telemaque Lavidas, whose trial began on Monday in Manhattan.  A related 38-count indictment against a Geneva, Switzerland-based trader, Marc Demane Debih, was made public on Monday. His lawyer could not immediately be identified  Prosecutors said Cohen, who worked for Goldman in London and New York, gave a securities trader in Switzerland tips about corporate acquisitions in exchange for cash and other benefits from 2015 to 2017.  They said he tried to conceal his tracks by communicating through prepaid \u201cburner\u201d cellphones, and receiving cash in person and through intermediaries.  Cohen faces up to five years in prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan.  In a joint statement, his lawyers Benjamin Brafman and Joshua Kirshner said Cohen has accepted responsibility, and they hoped to show Pauley that Cohen is \u201ca fundamentally decent young man who should be sentenced in a relatively lenient fashion.\u201d  Goldman spokeswoman Nicole Sharp declined to comment on the plea, but said the bank terminated Cohen\u2019s employment last year after his arrest. The bank was not accused of wrongdoing.  Prosecutors said Lavidas, the son of an Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc board member, passed inside information about the biotechnology company to Greek businessman Georgios Nikas, who made millions of dollars on the tips and passed them to another trader.  Other defendants included Benjamin Taylor and Darina Windsor, who prosecutors said were respectively investment bankers at Moelis & Co and Centerview Partners LLC and nicknamed each other as Pops and Popsy, and trader Joseph El-Khouri.  Nikas, Taylor and Windsor live abroad and have been at large. The United States has sought El-Khouri\u2019s extradition from London following his Oct. 21 arrest there.

The bank and U.S. officials have discussed a deal in which a Goldman subsidiary in Asia would plead guilty to violating U.S. bribery laws, the Wall Street Journal first reported here on Thursday.  The discussions could also involve Goldman installing an independent monitor to oversee and recommend changes to its compliance procedures. Involved in the discussions are three federal regulators - the U.S. Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve - and New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, according to the source.  In a statement, the bank said that settlement talks are ongoing and it continues to cooperate with regulators.  The SEC and the Justice Department declined to comment. Representatives for the other regulators did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  A settlement could be announced in late January, sources familiar with negotiations said.  The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.  Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries, including the United States, Malaysia, Singapore and others, for its underwriting role and what it did and did not know at the time of the transactions.  In November 2018, the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers tied to the scandal, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng.  According to the U.S. Justice Department, Goldman earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  The bank has consistently tried to distance itself from the scandal, saying Leissner and Ng worked to conceal their criminal activities from bank management.  Leissner pleaded guilty to the charges last year. Ng pleaded not guilty to charges in May, and his case is currently pending in federal court in Brooklyn.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Joerg Kukies, formerly the co-head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, was named deputy finance minister with responsibility for financial market policy and European issues, the ministry said.  It is the first time a German government has hired a Goldman Sachs banker and signals a recovery of the sector\u2019s influence after the crash when it was shunned by politicians including Chancellor Angela Merkel.  Prior to that, Germany had a long tradition of using bankers to help steer the economy. In the 1950s, chancellor Konrad Adenauer sent Deutsche Bank chief Hermann Josef Abs, rather than his finance minister, to negotiations over pre-war debt. Decades later, Helmut Kohl was advised by another Deutsche CEO, Alfred Herrhausen, on third-world debt and industrial policy.  But Goldman Sachs is viewed by many Germans as a symbol of a more cut-throat Anglo-Saxon capitalism, especially since a former executive in the country said banks had \u201cno obligation to promote the welfare of the public\u201d.  Lawmakers skeptical of Kukies\u2019 appointment, under Social Democrat (SPD) Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, fear the appointment could anger voters who have turned away from mainstream parties in favor of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD).  \u201cSuch revolving door cases multiply distrust of citizens towards politics,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a Greens member of the European Parliament.  Timo Lange of Lobby Control, which campaigns for transparency in lobbying, said the appointment \u201cstrengthens the impression that politicians and the elite are working hand in hand and that there is little left for the ordinary person.\u201d  The elevation of a Goldman Sachs executive comes as rival Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE is struggling to rebuild its influence years after it was at the heart of German industrial and economic policy as part of a network of politicians and bankers known as \"Deutschland AG\".  Much of that network unraveled during the 1990s and early 2000s as Deutsche Bank sold down its various stakes.  Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt said in 2011: \u201cDeutsche Bank is no longer German\u201d.  Kukies joined Goldman Sachs in 2001, working in Frankfurt and London, often profiting from deals which resulted from the dismantling of Deutschland AG. He worked in fixed income, equities and structured products, and in his new post will be responsible for financial market policy.  Fabio De Masi, a lawmaker with the leftist Linke party, said: \u201cOlaf Scholz is imitating Donald Trump by putting the arsonist in the fire brigade.\u201d  Kukies\u2019 appointment coincides with a gathering momentum in Frankfurt where Goldman Sachs will be expanding its presence as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.","212":"BOSTON, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc became the latest large investor to drop Fisher Investments after allegedly sexist remarks by firm founder Ken Fisher, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.

U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against the two former Goldman bankers and a Malaysian financier linked to the alleged theft of billions of dollars from the fund.  An investigation into where 1MDB\u2019s money went became the largest carried out by the Department of Justice under its anti-kleptocracy programme, and the scandal was a major reason why Malaysian voters rejected Najib Razak, their prime minister for nearly a decade, in an election earlier this year.  \u201cIt is obviously very distressing to see two former Goldman Sachs employees went so blatantly around our policies and so blatantly broke the law,\u201d Solomon said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Singapore.  \u201cI feel horrible about the fact that people who worked at Goldman Sachs, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a partner or it\u2019s an entry level employee, would go around our policies and break the law,\u201d Solomon said.  U.S. prosecutors announced last week that Tim Leissner, former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.  Roger Ng, the other charged former Goldman banker, was arrested in Malaysia and is expected to be extradited.  Reuters was not immediately able to contact Ng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment after U.S. prosecutors unveiled the charges last Thursday.  Goldman has also placed its former co-head of Asia investment banking, Andrea Vella, on leave over his role in the firm\u2019s involvement with the case, pending a review of allegations, according to a person familiar with the decision.  The Wall Street bank said in a securities filing on Friday that it may also face penalties from dealings with 1MDB.  Asked if he could provide assurances that neither he, former CEO Lloyd Blankfein or any of the senior management team suspected illegality or compliance breaches in dealings with 1MDB, Solomon said:  \u201cWe take compliance and control in our firm extremely seriously, we always have...We are going to continue to cooperate with the authorities and there\u2019s a process in place and that process will proceed.\u201d  According to prosecutors, the investment bank generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Reuters in June that the government will be looking at the possibility of seeking claims from Goldman Sachs.  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia will look into why Goldman was paid around $600 million in fees, an amount that critics say exceeds normal levels.  Goldman has maintained that the outsized fees related to the additional risks it took on \u2013 it bought the un-rated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of the 2013 deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds in a hurry for a planned investment.  The new Malaysian government has barred Najib and his wife from leaving the country, and the former premier faces multiple charges of corruption, money laundering and abuse of power, though he has consistently denied any wrongdoing related to 1MDB.  In another interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Malaysia\u2019s Prime Minister-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim said it would be \u201cinexcusable\u201d if Goldman Sachs was complicit in the scandal.

Following an asset swap with E.ON EONGn.DE, RWE last year became Europe's third-largest renewables player after Spain's Iberdrola IBE.MC and Italy's Enel ENEI.MI, and the world's No.2 offshore wind player after Denmark's Orsted ORSTED.CO.  However, its EV\/EBITDA multiple - a valuation metric that measures the ratio between enterprise value and earnings - stands at 7, less than half of Orsted\u2019s 14.2. With a market value of less than 17 billion euros ($19 billion), RWE looks cheap when compared to its bigger rivals, Goldman Sachs said.  \u201cStrong momentum to deliver energy transition, high industry fragmentation ... and the scale-advantage typical of such a capital-intensive business could drive a wave of consolidation,\u201d the investment bank said.  \u201cThis could lead to the emergence of a handful of \u2018Global Renewable Majors\u2019.\u201d  RWE declined to comment.

Its investment bankers also handled more stock offerings than any rivals during the period, which in turn helped boost revenue from equity trading, where Goldman is also nabbing market share.  These were all bright signs in otherwise dreary results for Goldman Sachs, however. Its revenue from other major businesses, including bond trading, M&A and investment management, all fell.  Analysts warned that without more insight into how Goldman racked up equities gains last quarter and the stock market facing headwinds, they are not giving the results much weight.  \u201cWe consider these to be solid results given the operating environment ... but they underscore the importance of the firm\u2019s strategic initiatives,\u201d wrote David Fanger, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s.

Goldman\u2019s IPO investments were the biggest star of the second quarter. The investing & lending division reported net revenues of $2.5 billion, its highest in 8 years.  The bulk of revenues came from the performance and some sale of investments in Tradeweb Markets Inc, Avantor Inc AVTR.N, Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N and Headhunter Group Plc HHR.O, which together make up 55 percent of the bank's public investment portfolio.  While competitor banks JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup C.N also reported big gains this week from investments in Tradeweb, Goldman's gain had a proportionately bigger impact because it is smaller, analysts said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc and a few other primary dealers have stuck with calls that the Fed would refrain from decreasing rates until there is evidence of significant deterioration in business and consumer activities.  Goldman economists said the three-quarter point in rate cuts in 1995-1996 and 1998, which some analysts point to as recent examples of pre-emptive policy easing from the Fed, were responses to data \u201crested at least as much on observable deterioration as on an insurance motive.\u201d  They said another assumption for insurance rate-cuts is that Fed officials could reserve the moves once the risk abates.  \u201cHowever, the greater political scrutiny of Fed hikes now\u2014especially with a presidential election approaching\u2014could make this harder to do in 2020, so that overly hasty insurance cuts now might increase the risk that the funds rate gets stuck at too low a level if the economy remains resilient,\u201d they wrote.

It also lowered its full-year GDP forecast to 3% growth from an earlier estimate of 5.5%.  For the fourth straight day, imported coronavirus cases in China outnumbered cases of local transmission.  The rising risk of imported cases has prompted some parts of the country to tighten monitoring of foreign travelers, and the Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday advised its citizens to avoid travel to high-risk countries.  Mainland China had 21 new confirmed cases on Monday, the National Health Commission said, up from 16 a day earlier. Of the new cases, 20 involved infected travelers from abroad.  Raising further concerns about spread of the disease, a man recently returned from Spain has tested positive for the virus - despite showing no symptoms - and has been put under observation and into quarantine, according to a statement on the website of the city of Mianyang, Sichuan.  An additional 25 passengers who had shared a flight with the man and two of his family members have also been subject to quarantine, the statement said.  In contrast to the growing number of imported cases, mainland China had only one case of locally transmitted infection on Monday, in Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province where the flu-like disease appeared in humans late last year.  The capital Beijing accounted for nine of the imported new cases even as it imposed tough restrictions to screen out and isolate infections coming from abroad.  Beijing Capital International Airport has cordoned off a special zone for all international flights, with all disembarking passengers required to submit to health checks.  Transit passengers were sent to their connecting flights, while non-transit passengers were shuttled to a nearby processing venue from which they were dispatched to designated places for compulsory 14-day quarantine.  Beijing also closed its new Daxing airport to international flights and redirected them to the older Capital International Airport in the northeast of the city, in order to contain any new infections in one facility.  On Tuesday, Shanghai extended existing quarantine measures to travelers who have recently visited the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and Austria.  China\u2019s eastern Shandong province and southwestern Chongqing city will require all overseas arrivals to be quarantined in designated locations or residences for 14 days, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday.

The source declined to be identified because the data isn\u2019t publicly available.  \u201cBuying mortgages in March was one of the best trading opportunities in mortgages since the last financial crisis,\u201d said Daniel Hyman, head of agency MBS portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO).  The surge in demand and activity has also allowed new names to enter the space. Bank of Montreal, which acquired mortgage security broker-dealer KGS-Alpha Capital Markets in 2018, is now actively trading residential mortgage-backed securities or RMBS, according to the source.  Bank of Montreal and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs and Citi declined to comment.

They start reporting third-quarter earnings next week, with JPMorgan and Citi kicking things off on Oct. 13.  The Fed\u2019s coronavirus stimulus measures are responsible for the rally in mortgage bonds guaranteed by government agencies Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, say investors.  The premia that investors demanded to hold these bonds over risk-free Treasury debt, as measured by the Ginnie, Fannie and Freddie MBS ICE BofA indexes, were the widest since the 2007-2009 financial crisis in mid-March. That was just before the Fed announced it would increase its holdings of the securities, which are known as agency RMBS.

Graphic: U.S. March mortgage trade was golden opportunity -  But the Fed isn\u2019t the only one buying. Demand for safe-haven assets jumped when the pandemic first roiled financial markets, and has persisted since. Investors have rushed into agency RMBS, which have the benefit of government backing, while also offering a higher yield than Treasury debt.  Yields on Treasury bonds have fallen to all-time lows since the Fed cut interest rates near zero.  \u201cAgency MBS are Treasuries on steroids,\u201d said Greg Parsons, chief executive officer at Semper Capital Management, a hedge fund specializing in mortgage-backed securities.  Some investors who bought heavily in March are making more than a percentage point in yields above the benchmark, according to investors, a huge return in this rate environment. The PIMCO Ginnie Mae fund has returned 4.59% in the year through August, versus its benchmark at 3.32%.  THE PRE-PAYMENT RISK  Average daily trading volume in agency RMBS hit a peak in March of this year, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and new issuance in 2020 stood at a record $2.6 trillion by the end of September.  Agency RMBS differ from the non-agency variety which gained notoriety for their central role in the 2008 crisis. If a homeowner defaults on a mortgage that is packaged into an agency RMBS, the agency -- Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae -- makes up for that defaulted principal. Investors in non-agency RMBS, however, absorb the loss.  Though defaults pose less of a problem, agency-backed RMBS do face a significant risk from borrowers pre-paying the mortgage, which shortens the duration of the security, reducing the number of installments paid to investors.  Pre-payments increase dramatically when low interest rates enable borrowers to refinance loans.  Semper Capital is not investing in traditional agency RMBS for precisely that reason.  \u201cIf there\u2019s one specific issue that is limiting the return potential on the agency side it is that pre-payment speeds remain elevated, which on the non-agency side is a strong positive for credit quality and performance, but on the agency side is really holding back price,\u201d said Parsons.  But banks are likely to keep buying. Though they may be overtaken by the Fed this year, commercial banks are still currently the largest holders of agency MBS. Flooded with deposits during the coronavirus crisis, big banks have put that money to work in agency MBS, among other securities, bringing their holdings to $2.3 trillion according to Fed data.  \u201cIf you talk to a Wall Street firm, they\u2019re making huge money selling to banks right now,\u201d said Ken Shinoda, portfolio manager at DoubleLine, which manages strategies that invest in both agency and non-agency MBS.  \u201cThere is just insatiable demand for agency mortgages by all the depository institutions. And deposits are up. Savings rates are up. Everyone is kind of hoarding cash.\u201d","224":"NEW YORK\/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges on Thursday against two former Goldman Sachs Group Inc bankers and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho tied to the alleged theft of billions of dollars from Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.  Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Brooklyn announced that Tim Leissner, former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.  Roger Ng, the other charged former Goldman banker, was arrested in Malaysia at the request of U.S. authorities and is expected to be extradited, according to John Marzulli, a spokesman for the prosecution.  The third person, the financier popularly known as Jho Low, remains at large. Malaysian authorities have revoked his passport and issued an arrest warrant for him, and have also applied for an Interpol red notice seeking assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, India, Myanmar, China and Hong Kong.  James Haggerty, a spokesman for Low, said in an e-mailed statement that Low \u201cmaintains his innocence.\u201d  \u201cMr. Low simply asks that the public keep an open mind regarding this case until all of the evidence comes to light, which he believes will vindicate him,\u201d Haggerty said.  A lawyer for Leissner could not be reached for comment. A lawyer for Ng did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Goldman has placed its former co-head of Asia investment banking, Andrea Vella, on leave over his role in the firm\u2019s involvement with the case, pending a review of allegations, according to a person familiar with the decision.  The Wall Street bank said in a securities filing on Friday that it may also face penalties from dealings with 1MDB and is cooperating with various government probes.  The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, in 2009. An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.  Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with alleged graft involving 1MDB.  According to the indictment against him, Low never held a formal position with the fund but he worked as an intermediary in numerous 1MDB transactions involving Goldman and others.  Prosecutors say Low, Ng, and Leissner conspired to launder the proceeds of fraud involving 1MDB through the U.S. financial system. Some of the laundered funds were then allegedly used to pay bribes to obtain business for Goldman. Other funds were used for the personal benefit of defendants, including purchases of luxury U.S. real estate and art.  Goldman said in an emailed statement that it \u201ccontinues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter.\u201d It has previously denied any wrongdoing.  According to prosecutors, the investment bank generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  Prosecutors described the bank\u2019s system of internal accounting controls as \u201ceasily circumvented,\u201d and said its culture in Southeast Asia was \u201chighly focused on consummating deals, at times prioritizing this goal ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions.\u201d  On at least three occasions, Leissner and Ng tried to get the bank to accept Low as a client, according to court documents, but compliance staff blocked the efforts over concerns about the source of Low\u2019s money.  Men walk past a 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) billboard at the fund's flagship Tun Razak Exchange development in Kuala Lumpur March 1, 2015. REUTERS\/Olivia Harris\/File Photo  Nevertheless, Ng and Leissner concealed Low\u2019s involvement and pushed deals through the bank\u2019s control functions to obtain \u201cvery lucrative business for Goldman Sachs, themselves and others,\u201d according to the documents.  While U.S. prosecutors have previously filed civil asset forfeiture suits for assets allegedly bought with some of the stolen funds, these are the first criminal charges the Justice Department has brought against individuals in the case under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law targeting official bribery abroad.  At least six countries, including Malaysia, the United States and Switzerland, have been investigating alleged thefts from 1MDB.  The 1MDB investigations in the United States and Malaysia have gathered pace since Najib unexpectedly lost a general election in May to Mahathir Mohamad, who returned to power 15 years after he retired as prime minister.  Since the election, Malaysian authorities have brought 38 charges against Najib. Many of the charges \u2013 multiple counts of corruption, money laundering and criminal breach of trust \u2013 are linked to 1MDB.  Najib has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has consistently denied wrongdoing.","225":"BOSTON, April 23 (Reuters) - Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended investors cast advisory votes against the pay of top executives at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

FILE PHOTO - The logo of Goldman Sachs is displayed in their office located in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo  Jorge Alcover, a 43-year old managing director from Catalonia, is in the process of relocating to Madrid after serving the Wall Street bank for more than a decade out of its London office in Fleet Street, the sources said.  Alcover heads Goldman\u2019s debt capital markets operations for Spain and Portugal and he is also in charge of corporate and public sector derivatives in the region.  He moved up through the ranks by arranging some of Iberia\u2019s biggest government and corporate loans while being based in Britain and was named managing director in 2010.  A spokesman for Goldman Sachs confirmed that Alcover will move to Madrid in April but said the decision was not related to Brexit.  \u201cWe have a global strategy to grow and expand our footprint by getting closer to our clients,\u201d the spokesman said.  \u201cThis really has nothing to do with Brexit as you can see with what we\u2019re doing in our regional approach in the U.S.,\u201d he said pointing to cities like Seattle and San Francisco where the bank has moved its client-facing financing teams closer to the companies they advise.  Goldman has about 15 investment bankers in Madrid, the sources said, and may see more Spanish nationals, currently employed in junior roles, shifting to the local office in the coming months.  \u201cHaving senior bankers based in Spain or Italy is really important to lure back young talents,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201cThey would no longer perceived it as a demotion if they see senior staff moving out of London.\u201d  Alcover will work closely with three other managing directors in Spain, namely country head Olaf Diaz-Pintado - who also co-heads the investment banking division in Europe - Juan de Dios G\u00f3mez-Villalba and Santiago Bau.  Goldman has so far kept most of its European bankers on its British payroll but it is starting to shift some EU nationals to their home countries or to other financial hubs like Frankfurt to better serve its EU clients after Brexit, the sources said.  Such moves mark a shift away from a business model that allowed banks to streamline operations and costs by covering European markets out of Britain.  The sources said Goldman decided to accelerate its plans to decentralize its London-centric operations after British Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out retaining passporting rights for financial services.  The loss of passporting rights - which currently enable finance firms to offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states via just one local license - is a key concern for big international banks such as Goldman.  Goldman has recently put more than a dozen UK-based banking, sales and trading staff on notice to move to Frankfurt within weeks. Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S and Britain's Standard Chartered STAN.L have also braced for similar job moves.  Last year, Goldman\u2019s co-head of Italy decided to relocate to Milan alongside a handful of Italian bankers. The bank signed a lease for a new office in Milan, near the cathedral, for more than 100 people, increasing its local headcount almost six-fold.","228":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016.

The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Malaysia on Monday filed the charges in Kuala Lumpur against three Goldman Sachs units in connection with the bank\u2019s role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB.  The charges were the first criminal action against the bank over its involvement in the scandal, which the U.S. Justice Department has estimated involved the misappropriation of $4.5 billion by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.  Malaysian authorities charged the Goldman units as well as former Goldman partner Tim Leissner, 1MDB employee Jasmine Loo and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier believed to be at the heart of the scandal, as part of their investigation into suspected corruption and money laundering at 1MDB, founded by former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak.  The alleged crimes carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines of at least 1 million ringgit ($240,000), according to the charge sheets, seen by Reuters.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and on Tuesday maintained that certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of the bond sales.  In a statement responding to the Monday news, the bank added: \u201cUnder the Malaysian legal process, the firm was not afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the filing of these charges against certain Goldman Sachs entities, which we intend to vigorously contest. These charges do not affect our ability to conduct our current business globally.\u201d  Malaysia said on Monday it would seek from Goldman and the others the $600 million in fees Goldman received for the deal and the allegedly misappropriated $2.7 billion bond proceeds.

The charges claim Goldman omitted key facts on the fund\u2019s management - including the role of Low, who is described as the \u201coperator and key intermediary for 1MDB\u201d.  The charges also claim Goldman made untrue statements about the planned use of proceeds from a $3 billion bond sold in 2013.  Low maintained his innocence on Monday following the fresh charges filed by Malaysia. His spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations made in the charge sheet.  A lawyer for Leissner was not available for an immediate comment outside U.S. business hours.

On Monday, Malaysia said it would also charge Roger Ng, a former Goldman Sachs banker and colleague of Leissner, but the charges were not revealed on Tuesday.  The U.S. Justice Department announced criminal charges against Leissner and Ng, on Nov. 1.  Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and has agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.

Thomas Dubbs, a lawyer for the shareholders, said they were pleased with the decision and look forward to proceeding to trial.  The case arose from several collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, the centerpiece of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe that led to a $550 million Goldman civil settlement in 2010.  Goldman admitted it was a \u201cmistake\u201d not to reveal it had allowed hedge fund manager John Paulson to choose some mortgages to include in Abacus, and that he bet against the CDO through short sales.  Paulson made a roughly $1 billion profit at the expense of CDO investors.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The email by Frederick Baba, a managing director at the bank who is black, coincides with other Wall Street executives and companies speaking out against racial inequality after the death of an African American man, George Floyd, during an arrest by a white police officer who held a knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25.  On Tuesday, Bank of America Corp BAC.N pledged $1 billion to help communities address economic and racial inequality. Goldman Sachs on Wednesday created a $10 million fund for racial equity. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup C.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N have also made statements denouncing racism and discrimination.  Baba, who works in Goldman\u2019s electronic trading business, according to his LinkedIn, initially sent the email with the subject line \u201cHow it\u2019s going...\u201d to a group of bankers he works with on June 2 after Floyd\u2019s death led to sometimes violent protests across the United States.  But the letter ended up being so widely forwarded that it was seen by almost everyone at the bank - which employs around 38,000 people globally - including CEO David Solomon, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Solomon emailed Baba with a personal note in response, the person said without elaborating on what Solomon wrote. The letter has been posted on Goldman\u2019s internal website, the person said.  \u201cTo everyone who\u2019s asked me some variant of \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d over the past month, I\u2019ve probably lied. Or lacked the words to articulate it fully, but I\u2019m giving it a shot,\u201d Baba wrote in the email seen by Reuters.  \u201c...the past few months have been demoralizing, and family\/friends\/colleagues I\u2019ve spoken with and listened to across the firm and country seem to share this feeling,\u201d he wrote, going on to mention minorities hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.  Baba goes on to draw a detailed account of his experiences witnessing and being subjected to racial discrimination and aggression, including a 2011 encounter with Chicago police. Baba said the Chicago police slammed him against the hood of a cruiser because he matched the generic description of a black man wearing a t-shirt and shorts.  \u201cI went home and I cried for the first time in years,\u201d he wrote.  At the end of the letter, Baba calls on his colleagues to take action to counter racial inequality, including at work.  \u201cA common bit of feedback from our junior colleagues is that while our firm expresses a commitment to equality and social justice up top, they don\u2019t necessarily see commitment and support from their direct managers ... I\u2019ll be okay; look after them,\u201d he wrote.  Reuters contacted Baba and Goldman Sachs on Thursday to verify the contents of the email. Baba referred Reuters to a spokesman for the bank because he is not authorized to speak to the press.  \u201cThanks for reaching out and creating a forum to discuss these critical issues,\u201d he added.","244":"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it sees a 60 percent probability of British Prime Minister Theresa May getting her deal to exit the European Union ratified after parliament on Wednesday rejected the option of a no-deal Brexit.

The decision comes as more than 60 U.S. and European companies went public in the last two years without any female board members, the bank said.  Citing its own data, Goldman said companies with greater diversity performed better in the markets.  Those with at least one diverse board member saw a 44% jump in their average share price within a year of going public, versus 13% at companies with no diverse board members.  \u201cWe think it\u2019s the right advice and we\u2019re in a position also because of our network to help our clients if they need help placing women on boards,\u201d Solomon said on CNBC.  Goldman Sachs will not turn away companies that lack diverse boards at the outset, and it said it currently has some clients that will need help meeting this new standard. The bank said it would introduce executives of these companies to qualified potential candidates.  Ultimately, the bank will not take the company public if it does not meet this new standard, Solomon said.  On Goldman\u2019s own board, four out of 11 directors are women and its lead director since 2014, Adebayo Ogunlesi, is black.  The new policy follows similar diverse hiring targets announced at the bank last spring.  In March 2019, the bank set a goal that half of all new analysts and entry-level associates it hired would be women, 11% would be black professionals and 14% will be Latino professionals in the United States.  In Britain, the bank aims for 9% of all new analysts and entry-level hires to be black professionals.  At more senior hiring levels, the bank is requiring that at least two diverse qualified candidates are interviewed for any open role. Senior members of management are judged on whether they meet these targets in the determination of their pay.","248":"May 15 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc:  * BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY CUTS SHARE STAKE IN GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC BY 84% TO 1.92 MILLION SHARES  * BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC DISSOLVES SHARE STAKE IN TRAVELERS COMPANIES INC  * BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: CHANGE IN HOLDINGS ARE AS OF MARCH 31, 2020 AND COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS QUARTER ENDED AS OF DEC. 31, 2019 Source for the quarter ended December 31, 2019: (bit.ly\/3bzLcAX) Source for the quarter ended March 31, 2020: (bit.ly\/3dSJXhZ)  Further company coverage:","249":"FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

REUTERS\/Olivia Harris\/File Photo  Goldman is being investigated by Malaysian authorities and the U.S. Department of Justice for its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion (\u00a35 billion) for 1Malaysia Development Berhad.  U.S prosecutors last year charged two former Goldman bankers for the theft of billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the people of Malaysia were defrauded by many individuals, including the highest members of the prior government,\u201d Solomon said on conference call discussing the bank\u2019s fourth-quarter results.  Solomon said that Leissner denied the involvement of any of Goldman\u2019s intermediaries in transactions with 1MDB.  An attorney representing Leissner did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Roger Ng, the other charged former Goldman banker, was arrested in Malaysia at the request of U.S. authorities and is expected to be extradited, according to John Marzulli, a spokesman for the prosecution.  The DOJ has said that $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014.  As part of Goldman\u2019s due diligence efforts, Solomon said the bank sought and received written assurances from 1MDB and International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) that no third-parties were involved in the first two bond sales.  Abu Dhabi\u2019s IPIC had co-guaranteed the 1MDB bonds when they were issued in 2012.

Aleynikov, whose case partly inspired Michael Lewis\u2019 bestselling book \u201cFlash Boys\u201d on high-frequency trading in the U.S. equity market, previously got his conviction overturned by the judge who oversaw his 2015 trial in Manhattan Supreme Court.  A New York appeals court reinstated the conviction, and the New York Court of Appeals, the state\u2019s highest court, upheld that decision last month.  Aleynikov, a Russian-born U.S. citizen, has said he intended the code only for his own use.  Aleynikov, 48, said in the filing that although the Court of Appeals upheld his conviction, its reasoning in doing so showed that the jury had been given incorrect instructions, and that his case violated the prohibition against double jeopardy.  The office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, which prosecuted the case, could not be reached for comment.  Aleynikov, 48, was arrested on federal charges in July 2009 and convicted in December 2010. He served 11 months of an eight-year prison sentence before the conviction was overturned.  Vance filed state criminal charges against him in August 2012 and he was convicted in May 2015, but the judge who presided over the trial overturned the verdict on grounds that copied code was not \u201ctangible\u201d and therefore not covered by state law.

Apple announced the card in March, aiming to draw in iPhone owners by offering a card with 2% cash back on purchases with the Apple Pay service, no fees, an app to manage related finances, and a focus on data privacy.  For Goldman, the issuing bank, the card builds on a foray into its Marcus consumer banking brand, started in 2015.  Apple said a limited number of consumers who expressed interest in the card will start to receive sign-up invitations on Tuesday.  The card is designed to work with the iPhone, where users sign up for the card and can start using it immediately if approved via the Apple Wallet app and Apple Pay system.  Apple offers an option for a physical card made of titanium, but the physical card has no visible number. Instead, the card\u2019s number is stored on a secure chip inside the iPhone, which generates virtual numbers for online or over-the-phone purchases requiring a number.  Apple has focused on privacy, saying that purchase information is stored on the user\u2019s iPhone and that it cannot see the information.

Riyadh began issuing international bonds in 2016 after lower oil prices hit its finances. Since then, it has become one of the biggest international debt issuers, having sold nearly $60 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds.  Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in April the kingdom was considering issuing its first euro-denominated bonds this year, as it looks to diversify its funding base.  The head of the Saudi Debt Management Office (DMO), part of the Ministry of Finance, reiterated in an interview with Reuters last month that the country was looking at potentially issuing debt in euros as part of its \u201cmedium term debt strategy.\u201d  The DMO, Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale did not immediately respond to comment requests on the planned investor meetings.  It is not clear whether the meetings will lead to an actual euro-denominated bond issue, but one of the sources familiar with the matter said that was the likely outcome.  \u201cIt is not a non-deal roadshow, but it\u2019s not a deal announcement. It\u2019s in between,\u201d said the source.  So-called non-deal roadshows are investor meetings not tied to a specific issuance.  The meetings will start on Monday June 17 in London and end on June 25 in Munich, a second source said.  Representative of the Saudi government will also meet investors in Paris, Zurich, Milan, Amsterdam, The Hague, and Frankfurt.  Saudi Arabia, rated A1 by Moody\u2019s and A+ by Fitch, is also planning to issue up to $5 billion in international sukuk, or Islamic bonds, in the third quarter of this year, the head of the DMO told Reuters.  In January, the kingdom raised $7.5 billion in bonds attracting over $27.5 billion in demand in what was seen as a vote of market confidence for the kingdom after its reputation was damaged by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year.

The settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other U.S. and overseas regulators resolves a probe into the role Goldman Sachs bankers played in helping to steal cash, which Goldman helped raise, from the Malaysian state fund.  While the scandal has proved a humbling and costly saga for the Wall Street giant, the long-awaited settlement should allow Chief Executive David Solomon to accelerate his plans to turn the bank around after a decade of under-performance, analysts said. Goldman\u2019s shares were up 1.4% on the news.  \u201cGetting this overhang off the back of management and the company in general is a very big win,\u201d said Marty Mosby, an analyst at boutique brokerage Vining Sparks.  Under terms of the deal, Goldman agreed to pay a $2.3 billion fine for breaking anti-bribery laws and to disgorge $600 million of ill-gotten gains as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, which also requires it to improve its compliance controls.  The bank also agreed for its Malaysia subsidiary to plead guilty in a U.S. federal court on Thursday, in a victory for prosecutors who rarely extract criminal guilty pleas from corporate entities.  Brian Rabbitt, acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division, said the penalty was the largest ever levied for a breach of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and that the settlement reflected the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the bank\u2019s role \u201cin a massive global scheme to loot billions of dollars\u201d from 1MDB.  The scandal dates to the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009.  Between 2009 and 2014, Goldman bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win 1MDB business, including underwriting $6.5 billion in bond sales, for which it earned $600 million in fees.  But billions of the fund\u2019s money were later stolen by high-level fund officials and their associates to pay for real estate, art and other luxury items, with the help of the Goldman bankers, the Justice Department said.  In 2018, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against two of the former Goldman bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng. Leissner pleaded guilty to the charges last year, while Ng\u2019s case is pending in a New York court.  \u201cWhile many good people worked on these transactions and tried to do the right thing, we recognize that we did not adequately address red flags and scrutinize the representations of certain members of the deal team,\u201d Solomon wrote in a memo to staff on Thursday, adding the bank had already made several compliance improvements.  He said that the bank would be clawing back compensation from the three bankers involved, and its former executive team \u201cin acknowledgement of the Firm\u2019s institutional failures.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  He and other senior executives would also have their compensation for 2020 reduced, bringing the total of clawbacks and pay reductions to $174 million.  Thursday\u2019s deal follows $3.9 billion the bank paid in Malaysia in July to settle charges there related to the matter.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  RESERVES, DEALS  Since 2019, Goldman had set aside $4.39 billion to cover legal and regulatory matters. Some $2 billion was for matters it already resolved with the Malaysian government. On Thursday, it said it would increase its provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the third quarter by $250 million.  Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove scolded Goldman\u2019s management teams for allowing the 1MDB bond deals and commended the board for the clawbacks. He said he expects the financial penalties to affect fourth-quarter results despite Goldman\u2019s existing reserves.  \u201cEvery person that participated in the decisions to proceed with these offerings needs their bonuses recaptured by the company. It is very positive to hear that Goldman may actually do this,\u201d he added.  Despite the costs, analysts anticipated that Thursday\u2019s deal should allow Solomon to accelerate his plan to reshape Goldman as a more conventional bank and be less reliant on volatile trading venues. Some investors and analysts viewed the 1MDB probes as an obstacle to Goldman doing transformative deals, since U.S. regulators will often bar banks from making big acquisitions while they\u2019re being probed for serious misconduct.  With clarity over how much the bank needs to pay and a clean slate with regulators, Goldman may be able to be more aggressive on that front, said Mosby.  \u201cWhen they had this over their heads they didn\u2019t have that opportunity, they had to take a pause. This is a green light to say they can go ahead and do that.\u201d","266":"FILE PHOTO: Elon Musk, founder, CEO and lead designer at SpaceX and co-founder of Tesla, speaks at the International Space Station Research and Development Conference in Washington, U.S., July 19, 2017.

Erica P. John Fund has been, well, a flop.  But the bank told the justices they can change that! What the Supreme Court needs to do, Goldman\u2019s lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton & Garrison argued in the bank\u2019s opening brief in Goldman Sachs v. Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, is remind lower courts just how much leeway defendants are supposed to have in opposing shareholder fraud class actions.  In the 2014 decision, as you surely remember, the Supreme Court left intact the structural premise of securities class actions, in which shareholders are entitled to a presumption of reliance on defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations as long as they can show the company\u2019s shares traded in an efficient market. (That premise, in turn, is based on the idea that in an efficient market, the share price reflects all public information.)  But the Halliburton decision emphasized that defendants can rebut that presumption of reliance -- and thus prevent shareholders from being certified as a class. The Supreme Court said in Halliburton that securities class action defendants are entitled to offer evidence that their alleged misrepresentations did not actually affect the price of their companies\u2019 shares. If defendants can break the chain between its share price and the alleged fraud, the court said in Halliburton, then shareholders can\u2019t litigate as a class.  Since that 2014 decision, Goldman said in Monday\u2019s brief, Halliburton has benefited defendants in a grand total of five cases, one at the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (IBEW Local 98 Pension Fund v. Best Buy Co, 818 F.3d 775) and four in trial courts. By Goldman Sachs\u2019 reckoning, no securities class action defendant has managed to rebut the presumption of reliance since 2018. And they\u2019ve had plenty of chances: Shareholders have filed more than 2,000 securities class actions since the Supreme Court\u2019s Halliburton ruling.  The record in cases positing a so-called price maintenance theory is even worse for defendants, Goldman said. These cases, as I\u2019ve explained, are a twist on classic shareholder class actions in which plaintiffs allege that a company\u2019s share price rose in response to a fraudulent statement and then fell when the truth was disclosed. In price maintenance cases, shareholders allege that a company\u2019s misrepresentations allowed its share price to remain at an unwarranted height. The extent of the fraud, according to price maintenance theory, is revealed by the drop in the company\u2019s share price when the truth emerges.  This theory \u2013 which underlies the Goldman class action, as I\u2019ll explain \u2013 has become increasingly prevalent in shareholder fraud class actions in the last several years, with endorsements by the 2nd, 7th and 11th Circuits. A 2019 Harvard Law Review study found that 60% of a sample of shareholder class action filings between 2014 and 2017 were based on price maintenance. And Halliburton has proved to be singularly ineffective in defeating class certification in these cases. According to Goldman\u2019s brief, defendants in price maintenance cases have never successfully invoked Halliburton to defeat class certification.  The problem, according to Goldman, is that lower courts have failed to strike the proper balance between Halliburton and previous Supreme Court decisions. In 2013\u2019s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans, the court held that shareholders are not required to prove the materiality of a defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations in order to be certified as a class. And in a precursor to the 2014 Halliburton decision, the justices said in a 2011 decision known as Halliburton I that shareholders don\u2019t have to prove price impact at the class certification stage.  Goldman argued that its case exemplifies the imbalance. Goldman shareholders allege that the company\u2019s share price was artificially inflated by statements about its business principles, such as avoiding conflicts of interest and putting customers first. Shareholders posited that when Goldman fell under government investigation for an alleged conflict of interest in the structuring of four collateralized debt offerings, including the Abacus CDO that led the bank to a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the market realized the falsity of the bank\u2019s statements of business principle. They attributed declines in Goldman\u2019s share price to the allegedly fraudulent statements of business principles.  Goldman contends \u2013 and has expert testimony to back the contention \u2013 that declines in its share price were unrelated to those statements. The bank\u2019s experts offered evidence that the market did not react to dozens of news reports on Abacus and other CDOs but was spooked when the government began investigating. The share price drop, according to the bank, wasn\u2019t because investors realized Goldman\u2019s generic statements were false. Those statements, it argued, were not material to investors and had no impact on the price of its shares.  When the 2nd Circuit upheld certification of the shareholder class in Goldman\u2019s case, the majority said the bank\u2019s emphasis on the generic, anodyne nature of the alleged misstatements was an attempt to \u201csmuggle\u201d materiality into litigation over class certification.  That approach, Goldman told the Supreme Court, undermines the intent of the justices\u2019 2014 Halliburton decision, making it virtually impossible for defendants to rebut the presumption that investors relied on alleged misstatements. The bank called on the Supreme Court to make it clear to the lower courts that they must take defendants\u2019 evidence on materiality and price impact into account during class certification litigation. Amgen and Halliburton I hold that investors are not required to prove those elements at the class certification stage, but, Goldman argued, those rulings do not preclude trial and appellate courts from looking at defendants\u2019 evidence rebutting the presumption of reliance. Defendants\u2019 price impact evidence at the class certification stage, Goldman said, may overlap with evidence on the merits of shareholders\u2019 claims.  It\u2019s time, the bank said, for the Supreme Court to clarify that \u201ca court may not refuse to consider evidence relevant to price impact merely because it is also relevant to materiality and loss causation.\u201d  I asked the Arkansas pension fund\u2019s Supreme Court counsel, Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell, for comment on Goldman\u2019s brief but didn\u2019t hear back.","268":"Goldman Sachs Co-President and Co-Chief Operating Officer David Solomon plays disc jockey at a lounge called Libation in New York City, U.S. Saturday, April 7, 2018. Picture taken April 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Jennifer Ablan  ASPEN, Colo. (Reuters Breakingviews) - Goldman Sachs is playing follow-someone-else\u2019s leader. The $87 billion Wall Street firm is expected to announce early this week a career investment banker as its next chief executive. David Solomon comes from the side of Goldman that advises clients rather than the bit that trades securities and produced current chief Lloyd Blankfein. It further de-emphasizes the role that part of the business plays. It\u2019s also something Morgan Stanley did almost a decade ago.  Market making used to be the firm\u2019s powerhouse. But it\u2019s driven by clients\u2019 whims. When they\u2019re not in the mood, or the market doesn\u2019t cooperate, it suffers. Goldman\u2019s unit is also more skewed than rivals to hedge funds and other investors.  This time last year, Goldman reported a 40 percent drop in fixed-income trading as it suffered its worst quarter for commodities trading on record. In September executives put a plan in place to fix the division\u2019s troubles. This year\u2019s second-quarter results, due on Tuesday, will show how well that\u2019s working.  Trading, though, made up just $1 billion of the $5 billion in new revenue initiatives Blankfein and his lieutenants unveiled. The rest is tied to earnings streams that the bank can either control more effectively, or that are more predictable - like advising on deals, collecting commissions, and retail banking in its Marcus outfit.  Goldman is a bit slow on the uptake here. These less capricious businesses have been surprisingly stable even as market-making revenue has fallen and Goldman\u2019s own investment bets have flopped around. But they haven\u2019t really grown, sticking at or below $20 billion on a rolling 12-month basis since the financial crisis, based on a Breakingviews analysis. Trading and investments, meanwhile, fell from the majority of the top line to around 41 percent.  Morgan Stanley started 10 years ago to play down what was an admittedly weaker fixed-income trading franchise. It expanded its wealth-management business and soon promoted its boss, James Gorman, to be CEO. He talks up the benefit of stable revenue and says he wants to ensure his firm does fine in bad times. He has made its smaller bond- and currency-trading unit more profitable \u2013 and last week promoted its architect, Ted Pick, to run the entire investment bank, thus making him a candidate for the top job.  Solomon, who moonlights as DJ D-Sol and extols the benefits of a healthy work-life balance, isn\u2019t just a Gorman do-over. Goldman\u2019s bigger M&A franchise sets it apart from its rival, and the firm is much lighter on wealth management. Goldman will always be different, but Solomon\u2019s tune is one bank investors should find pleasingly familiar.","269":"David Solomon, president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, listens at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018.

Goldman Sachs has been under scrutiny for its role in helping to raise $6.5 billion through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), the subject of corruption and money laundering investigations in at least six countries.  Friday\u2019s charges were brought under a section of the Malaysian Capital Markets and Services Act that holds certain senior executives responsible for any offences that may have been committed, Attorney General Tommy Thomas said.  \u201cCustodial sentences and criminal fines will be sought against the accused ... given the severity of the scheme to defraud and fraudulent misappropriation of billions in bond proceeds,\u201d Thomas said in a statement.

Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  It has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs, outside counsel and others about the use of transaction proceeds.  Last year, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs and two of the U.S. bank\u2019s former employees in connection with 1MDB.

The fast-spreading virus is not seen as a hurdle to the fundraising as the bank is mainly targeting offshore, non-Chinese prospective investors, said one of the people.  It is aiming for a first close by the end of March - an important milestone indicating the fund has crossed a minimum threshold and can begin making investments, said the other person.  The new fund, substantially smaller than Goldman's biggest fund of $20 billion in 2007, underscored its commitment to the private equity business. Many banks, including Citigroup Inc C.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, have spun out or divested their private equity arms in recent years following the adoption of the Volcker Rule, which limited banks from investing their own balance sheets in funds.  Private equity firms have also been raising record amounts of capital globally, with Blackstone Group, the world largest alternative asset manager, last year raising a record $26 billion for its latest buyout fund.  Goldman\u2019s new fund will focus on deals where it gets majority control, with the goal of deploying 60% of the capital in America, said the first person. It also plans to make about 25 investments in various sectors, with the deal size ranging between $150 and $600 million.  Like its last fund - West Street Capital Partners VII that raised about $7 billion in 2017 - the new fund will seek capital from both intuitional investors and the bank\u2019s own employees, said the person.  Goldman declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media.  Goldman\u2019s private equity arm, established in 1986, has been managed by its merchant banking division. It has raised about $47 billion since inception across eight funds, according to industry data provider Preqin.  In 2016, the arm was named West Street Capital Partners, after Goldman\u2019s New York City address, to comply with a post-crisis rule that does not allow private equity funds to bear the parent bank\u2019s name.  It has generated a net internal rate of return (IRR), which deducts management fees, fund expenses and carried interest, of 19%, since 2000, according to the first person.

In response, Goldman issued a statement saying it revised its stress capital buffer downward to 6.6% from 6.7%, and lowered the corresponding standard common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio requirement to 13.6% from 13.7%.  Morgan Stanley meanwhile lowered its stress capital buffer to 5.7% from 5.9% and its CET1 ratio to 13.2% from 13.4%.

Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The case arose from several collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, the centerpiece of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe that led to a $550 million Goldman civil settlement in 2010.  Goldman admitted it was a \u201cmistake\u201d not to disclose that it had allowed hedge fund manager John Paulson to choose some mortgages to include in Abacus, and that he bet against the CDO through short sales.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, said they had agreed to reduce output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) for May and June to stem a slump in prices.  The bank saw downside risks to its short-term oil price forecast of around $20 per barrel for Brent, but projected the global crude benchmark would outperform U.S. oil because OPEC+ producers\u2019 exports would likely fall, freeing up floating storage space.  Even with core-OPEC members fully complying with the cuts, and 50% compliance by all other countries that have agreed to curb production in May, the voluntary cuts would translate into a reduction of only 4.3 million bpd from first-quarter levels, the bank said.  A bigger output cut by G20 nations would also not help much, it said.  \u201cUltimately, this simply reflects that no voluntary cuts could be large enough to offset the 19 million bpd average April-May demand loss due to the coronavirus.\u201d  Both Brent futures, which slumped a record 65.55% in the first quarter, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude posted tentative gains after the OPEC+ deal.  Goldman Sachs said, however, that risks surrounding its 2021 price outlook of $52.50 per barrel for Brent were \u201cskewed squarely to the upside\u201d, since the \u201cviolent market rebalancing\u201d will be followed by a sharp rebound once demand picks up again.  Another Wall Street bank, Morgan Stanley, raised its oil price forecasts, saying that while the OPEC+ deal will not prevent sharp inventory builds in coming months, it would lead to stock reductions from the second half of 2020 onwards.  Morgan Stanley raised its third-quarter Brent and WTI price forecasts to $30 per barrel from $25, and to $27.50 per barrel from $22.50, respectively. It likewise raised its fourth-quarter outlook by $5 per barrel for both crude benchmarks, to $35 for Brent and $32.50 for WTI.  Morgan Stanley projected demand to fall about 14 million bpd year-on-year in the second quarter.

The plaintiffs accused units of Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.S, Morgan Stanley MS.N and UBS Group AG UBSG.S of conspiring since 2009 to keep the stock lending market \"in the stone age\" by boycotting the startup platforms AQS, Data Explorers and SL-x.

The banks countered that the plaintiffs merely alleged that \u201ccontinuing to execute stock loans under existing standards and rules\u201d somehow amounted to an illegal conspiracy.  But in her 93-page decision, Failla found sufficient \u201cdirect evidence\u201d from the plaintiffs to suggest an illegal conspiracy and let them continue their proposed class-action case.  \u201cThis dispute boils down to whether the allegations concern conduct by EquiLend alone, or conduct undertaken by the prime broker defendants using EquiLend,\u201d Failla wrote. \u201cThe amended complaint adequately pleads that defendants\u2019 concerted actions amounted to an unreasonable restraint on trade.\u201d  Michael Eisenkraft, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email: \u201cWe are pleased with the judge\u2019s ruling and look forward to prosecuting the case.\u201d  The banks have four weeks to formally answer the complaint by the Iowa Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System; California\u2019s Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, Orange County Employees Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association; and Torus Capital LLC.

That three-year burn rate compares with 0.64 percent recently reported by Citigroup Inc, and 1.82 percent at financial companies in the S&P 500, according to proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).  Big investors take notice of a burn rate because it measures how much value a company transfers to executives, said John Roe, head of ISS\u2019s data arm.  \u201cThe faster the company is diluting shareholders, the harder the company has to work just to get up to par,\u201d Roe said.  Investors asked Goldman to put a special focus on its stock grant practices and how they dilute shareholders during feedback sessions last year, the bank said in its proxy filing. A spokeswoman declined to comment further.  If the high burn rate persists, Goldman stock could become less attractive to investors relative to its peers while potentially weighing on its operating performance.  Although Goldman slashed its annual burn rate to 2.2 percent last year from 6.6 percent in 2010, it remains elevated partly because of its business mix, which the bank is now trying to change.  Unlike rivals that have big retail operations stocked with bank tellers and other salaried branch workers, Goldman\u2019s workforce is more weighted with investment bankers and traders. They typically receive a hearty portion of their pay in stock. That is by design, to better align their interests and risk-taking with shareholders.  Goldman also has been aggressively buying back stock, which elevates the burn rate. The bank has reduced outstanding shares 27 percent since the end of 2009, giving it a historically low share count, according to its proxy.

Min, who became a partner in 2016, was also recently named co-chief operating officer of the bank\u2019s global TMT business.  \u201cThis commitment of senior bankers to our M&A franchise, with their deep experience across industries and geographies, will strategically align our team to capture the anticipated growth in merger activity in AEJ,\u201d the bank said in a memo to staff.  The news comes as Goldman chief executive David Solomon marks one year at the helm of the Wall Street giant. In an internal podcast interview to mark the anniversary, Solomon said he had focused on making sure the bank\u2019s clients were the center of its thinking.  \u201cWe\u2019re a divisional firm, we\u2019ve always been a divisional firm, but I think there\u2019s a great opportunity to make sure for our clients that we\u2019re delivering the whole firm,\u201d he added.  Goldman ranked second behind Morgan Stanley MS.N in a league table of M&A for Asia Pacific including Japan at the end of the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data, having advised on deals worth $108.4 billion.  The region has been hit harder than elsewhere by a drop in global deal volumes as uncertainties over the economic outlook and rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China weigh on M&A appetite.  Dealmaking volumes in Asia-Pacific fell 30% year-on-year to $751 billion as at end-September according to Refinitiv data, while globally volumes fell 11% to $2.8 trillion.","301":"NEW YORK\/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia on Monday filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs Group Inc related to its dealings with the sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, and Goldman Sachs fired back that the previous Malaysian government had lied to the investment bank.  Malaysia authorities charged the bank and two former Goldman employees in connection with an investigation into suspected corruption and money laundering related to the scandal.  Attorney General Tommy Thomas said in a statement that it will seek jail terms as well as billions in fines from Goldman Sachs and four other individuals who allegedly diverted about $2.7 billion from 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).  This is the first time Goldman Sachs, which has consistently denied wrongdoing, has faced criminal charges in the 1MDB scandal.  \u201cCertain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs, outside counsel and others about the use of proceeds from these transactions,\u201d Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said in a statement.  \u201c1MDB, whose CEO and Board reported directly to the prime minister at the time, also provided written assurances to Goldman Sachs for each transaction that no intermediaries were involved,\u201d DuVally said.  The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.  DuVally said the bank was not afforded the chance to be heard before the filing of the charges and will contest the allegations.  The charges do not affect Goldman\u2019s \u201cability to conduct our current business globally,\u201d he said.  Goldman Sachs shares were down 2.8 percent at $167.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, the lowest level the storied bank\u2019s stock has sunk to since late September 2016.  Goldman Sachs has been under scrutiny for its role in helping raise $6.5 billion through three bond offerings for 1MDB, which is the subject of investigations in at least six countries.  FILE PHOTO: A view of the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S. on July 16, 2013. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Analysts said on Monday that investors had expected Malaysian authorities would file charges against Goldman Sachs and that it would seek fines, including the $600 million in fees Goldman received for the deal and the allegedly misappropriated $2.7 billion bond proceeds.  Malaysia has said it will also seek prison terms of up to 10 years for each of the individuals accused.  \u201cA lot is already priced in to Goldman\u2019s shares,\u201d Jeff Harte, principal equity analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners, said in an interview. \u201cMalaysia has been talking for months about potential criminal charges.\u201d  While it is difficult to quantify the impact Malaysia\u2019s charges will have on the bank, it is likely Goldman will increase the amount of money it has dedicated to handling these issues, Harte said.  Analysts have said the bank is likely to boost its legal reserves by as much as $1 billion.  The U.S. Justice Department announced criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng, on Nov. 1.  On the same day, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Brooklyn said Leissner had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and had agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.  Ng, detained in Malaysia, is facing extradition to the United States.  John Marzulli, a spokesman for federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, declined to comment on the Malaysian charges.  Goldman Sachs stock has fallen nearly 26 percent since Nov. 1.  Goldman gets 15 percent of its revenue from Southeast Asia, which could be at risk if the scandal hurts Goldman\u2019s reputation, according to a report from UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.  \u2018COMMISSION AND ABETMENT\u2019  Malaysian Attorney General Thomas said on Monday it brought criminal charges related to securities law violations against Goldman Sachs, its former bankers Leissner and Ng, former 1MDB employee Jasmine Loo and financier Jho Low in connection with the bond offerings.  \u201cThe charges arise from the commission and abetment of false or misleading statements by all the accused in order to dishonestly misappropriate ... the proceeds of three bonds issued by the subsidiaries of 1MDB, which were arranged and underwritten by Goldman Sachs,\u201d Thomas said in a statement.  He said the offering statements filed with the regulators contained statements that were false, misleading or with material omissions.  Loo, against whom Malaysia brought other 1MDB-related charges earlier in December, has not commented on the 1MDB case and her whereabouts are not known.  Low, whom authorities have described as a central figure in the suspected fraud, maintained his innocence.  \u201cAs has been stated previously, Mr. Low will not submit to any jurisdiction where guilt has been predetermined by politics and there is no independent legal process,\u201d Low\u2019s spokesman said in a statement.","302":"The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.

The United States on Monday demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, a move to choke off Tehran\u2019s oil revenues. In response, crude prices rose to six-month highs on fears of a potential supply crunch. [O\/R]  The bank still expects declining prices into 2020 due to better supplied markets next year and high uncertainties around whether the Organziation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and fellow producers will continue to abide by their agreement to curb output to support prices after June.  The U.S. investment bank sees Iranian production declining by 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared to the immediately available global spare capacity of 2 million bpd, which is set to grow further later this year.  The U.S. policy announcement should support Middle East Dubai crude prices relative to Brent prices given the quality mismatch between the lost Iran volumes and the lighter compensating crudes from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it added.","303":"FILE PHOTO: Anti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, October 17, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: The logos of Renault and Fiat carmakers are seen in Nice, France, June 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Eric Gaillard  Goldman Sachs had elbowed out FCA\u2019s house bank UBS, which was close to FCA\u2019s late Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, to lead on the deal for the Italian-U.S. carmaker.  Helping Renault was New York-based Ardea Partners, a boutique advisory firm launched in 2016 by Chris Cole who had spent 30 years at Goldman Sachs including co-chairing the investment banking business.  \u201cThis deal was cooked up among friends who have known each other for years,\u201d said a source involved in the talks. \u201cBut despite their relationship and banking experience, it all fell apart.\u201d  Cole was directly involved in the negotiations on behalf of Renault and had Goldman\u2019s chairman of investment banking, FX de Mallmann, as his counterpart representing FCA.  The pair worked closely with another former Goldman banker, Laurent Clarenbach, who spent 10 years at the Wall Street bank between 2001 and 2011 and is now a partner at French boutique bank d\u2019Angelin & Co.  London-based d\u2019Angelin, launched by French banker Benoit d\u2019Angelin in 2017, was brought in by FCA to help market the 33 billion euro ($37 billion) deal to the French government given his founder\u2019s close ties with French President Emmanuel Macron.  The French government owns 15% of Renault and was immediately seen as a major obstacle to getting a deal done.  But advisers at both sides of the negotiating table were bullish about finding an agreement.  \u201cTheir long-lasting friendship and mutual trust played a role in keeping them upbeat, even when Paris starting demanding more control over the merged entity,\u201d one source close to the deal said.

They are currently advising advertising giant WPP on its ongoing sale of data analytics unit Kantar. Ardea\u2019s executive team mainly consists of former Goldman bankers including James Del Favero, who spent 26 years at the Wall Street bank.  The Goldman network had been expected to secure the backing of Macron\u2019s government before the deal became public, several sources said, adding Goldman deployed staff from its New York, Paris and London offices in a bid to win France\u2019s blessing.  But, this time, Goldman and its allies failed to deliver, amid demands for more control by the French state and resistance from Renault\u2019s alliance partner Nissan, which decided to abstain from a Renault board vote on the deal.  \u201cThey couldn\u2019t navigate the complexity of this deal and their plan of sidelining Nissan backfired,\u201d the first source said.  Goldman declined to comment on this report, while Ardea Partners was not immediately available for comment.  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire demanded that, as one of the main conditions for talks to progress, the deal needed the backing of Nissan.  But FCA and its banks did not lay the groundwork to secure Nissan\u2019s endorsement, having kept the Japanese carmaker in the dark about the merger plan to avoid leaks.  \u201cIt was an ill-conceived deal from the start,\u201d said a source close to Nissan. \u201cFCA\u2019s advisers thought they could corner Nissan and secure France\u2019s approval in a couple of days.

FILE PHOTO: Men walk past a 1 Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) billboard at the fund's flagship Tun Razak Exchange development in Kuala Lumpur March 1, 2015. REUTERS\/Olivia Harris\/File Photo  Malaysia is scrambling to bring home billions of dollars allegedly siphoned off from 1MDB, a state fund founded by ex-premier Najib Razak, who lost a general election last month.  His successor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, said Malaysia is also seeking to arrest financier Low Taek Jho, a central figure in the scandal who advised on investments and negotiated deals for 1MDB.  Malaysian authorities want to ask the DoJ, which is pursuing a corruption and money laundering probe at 1MDB, to get Goldman to disgorge profits it made from the sale of the bonds, after which Malaysia would claim the money, the two sources familiar with the matter said.  No formal request has been made to the DoJ on the Goldman fees, but top officials are actively discussing the plan within the government, they said.  \u201cThere have been no official requests yet, but this is being discussed,\u201d said a Malaysian government source.  A financial industry source in Malaysia, who is aware of the discussions, said back channel talks between the government and the DoJ were under way.  How Kuala Lumpur would go about claiming the funds, and the legal hurdles in the process were not immediately made clear by the sources.  A spokeswoman for Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said the minister had no comment on the matter.  The DOJ and a spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  The U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur directed Reuters to the DoJ for comment.  Goldman raised nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.  More than $2.5 billion raised from these bonds was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB officials, their relatives and associates, according to DoJ civil lawsuits filed in a U.S. court in 2016.  The U.S. bank earned almost $600 million for the three deals \u2013 an amount critics say is far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent fees a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.  A special task force set up after the election to look into 1MDB met officials from the DoJ and the U.S. FBI to discuss the probe in late May, including the process of returning the funds to Malaysia, the government has said.  WARRANTS ISSUED  Mahathir told reporters the government was trying to arrest Low, popularly known as Jho Low, but he was not in the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t have extradition rights in the country where he is staying,\u201d he said. He did not say which country Low was in.  Low was regarded as close to Najib and his family.  The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had issued an arrest warrant for Low, as well as for Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, a director of former 1MDB unit SRC International, a source familiar with the matter had earlier told Reuters.  It was also preparing an arrest warrant for Roger Ng, a former Goldman banker, the source said.  Singapore authorities said on Friday they had issued arrest warrants in 2016 for Low and his associate, Tan Kim Loong, and requested an Interpol notice. It was the first time Singapore has acknowledged it was seeking Low\u2019s arrest.  Low and 1MDB have denied any wrongdoing. Tan Kim Loong could not be reached for comment.  Low advised on investments and negotiated deals for 1MDB, though he never held any official role in the fund.  1MDB is the subject of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.  Najib has denied any wrongdoing, but has been questioned by government investigators after the election. He and his wife have been barred from leaving the country.  Goldman has always maintained that it did nothing wrong and that it had no visibility into whether some of the funds raised may have been subsequently diverted to other purposes.  In civil lawsuits filed by the DOJ to seize assets bought with misappropriated 1MDB money, U.S. authorities say investors were not properly informed about the use and nature of the bonds that Goldman helped sell for 1MDB.  The Wall Street bank however was not accused of any wrongdoing in the lawsuits.  Goldman has come under scrutiny for its involvement in the 1MDB affair, with U.S. and Singapore authorities looking into its role in helping raise funds for 1MDB through the bonds.  Goldman\u2019s former Southeast Asia chairman, Tim Leissner, was issued a 10-year prohibition order by Singapore last year and was also barred from the U.S Securities industry.  Leissner was responsible for managing Goldman\u2019s relationship with 1MDB and had helped arrange the sale of U.S. dollar bonds for 1MDB, sources have said.  Leissner, who took over the role in mid-2014, resigned in 2016 after he had allegedly violated the firm\u2019s internal rules, a source has told Reuters.","309":"April 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc:  * MARCUS BY GOLDMAN SACHS\u00ae ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF CLARITY MONEY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","310":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on Thursday a recent media report speculating about his possible retirement this year was wishful thinking, but conceded it would be difficult to decide when to leave his job.

A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Mubadala, which manages over $225 billion in assets, holds stakes in some of Abu Dhabi\u2019s biggest companies as well as stakes in global firms such as Spanish energy firm Cepsa and Austria\u2019s OMV.  For Goldman Sachs, the suspension of new business with Mubadala comes at a bad time as Abu Dhabi is embarking on a privatization spree that raises the prospect of several big deals in the offering for investment banks.  Over the last few years, Goldman has ranked among the top banks for takeover advice in Abu Dhabi, the oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates.  The suspension of business follows a civil legal action filed by International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) in New York in November against Goldman and others, alleging they played a role in trying \u201cto corrupt\u201d former executives of IPIC and its subsidiary Aabar Investments, and \u201cmislead\u201d IPIC and Aabar, aiming to further the business of Goldman and 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).

Goldman has not given hard guidance around how much the scandal could cost but the bank has said it could be underreserved by as much as $1.9 billion.  Goldman Sachs\u2019 business in Abu Dhabi in recent years included advising a government steering committee that oversaw a merger between Aldar Properties and Sorouh Real Estate in 2013. The bank also worked on a merger valuation plan for the Abu Dhabi and Dubai bourses, in 2014, which was shelved as terms could not be agreed.  Abu Dhabi\u2019s privatization program has already seen the sale of stakes in its national oil company to international partners, as well as corporate mergers including banks.

Spot gold fell 0.3% to $1,919.65 per ounce by 0750 GMT, after hitting more than a one-week high on Wednesday. U.S. gold futures slipped 0.3% to $1,923.00. \"Without stimulus, there's a lot of uncertainty and that's driving people to be a bit cautious and move towards the U.S. dollar,\" said Michael Langford, executive director at corporate advisory and consultancy firm AirGuide. Stimulus talks between U.S. lawmakers faced a setback on Wednesday when President Donald Trump accused Democrats of being unwilling to craft a compromise on aid. The news dented risk sentiment and lifted the dollar against its rivals, making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. \"The Fed is not going to ease anymore, but there's no scope for tightening and that could put a floor under gold,\" said DailyFx currency strategist Ilya Spivak, adding that the metal was unlikely to rally or fall \"catastrophically\". Widely viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, bullion has gained 26% this year as central banks and governments globally unveiled unprecedented stimulus measures to cushion the economic fallout from the pandemic. Goldman Sachs forecast gold at $2,300 an ounce over a 12-month horizon and said commodities were likely headed for a bull market next year.

Instead, Goldman\u2019s top rival beat it to the punch.  On Thursday, Morgan Stanley said it plans to acquire E*Trade Financial Corp for $13 billion, cementing its position as a hub where individuals manage their finances. If successful, it will be the biggest acquisition by a big Wall Street bank since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  It also underlines Goldman\u2019s position as an outlier as the only big U.S. bank to not do any transformative deals during or since that time. Unlike Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co or Bank of America Corp, which all executed major transactions during or after the crisis, Goldman looks much the same, analysts say.  Instead of opening its own wallet to expand, Goldman is trying to grow a fledgling retail bank, create a treasury-services business, and expand in asset management, corporate lending and trading \u2014 largely all from the ground up. Asked about the matter in January, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon dismissed the idea.  \u201cWe\u2019re not out there looking to buy a big bank,\u201d Solomon told Bloomberg TV.  A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on whether Morgan Stanley\u2019s deal affects its own strategy.  Goldman was among a litany of financial firms that were rumored as suitors of E*Trade over the past year or so, as the retail trading firm looked for an acquirer. Analysts who follow Goldman and sources inside the bank have told Reuters it would not be a good deal for a variety of reasons, including technology, culture and price.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s stock fell 4% on Thursday after announcing the deal, which will dilute its shareholders by 10%. Goldman was down 1%.  With Goldman\u2019s stock value weak and with it doing less business with average investors, the E*Trade deal would have been too expensive, said David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors.  \u201cMorgan Stanley is better positioned to acquire E*Trade because of its higher stock valuation and more significant cross-over into its network of brokers and workplace assets than Goldman Sachs,\u201d said Hendler.  Goldman\u2019s share price as of Thursday\u2019s close was 1.1 times its stated tangible book value as of the fourth quarter compared with 1.3 times tangible book value for Morgan Stanley.  Goldman entered the retail space a long time after Morgan Stanley or other U.S. rivals.  It purchased $16 billion worth of deposits from a General Electric Co subsidiary in 2015, and has since bought a few relatively small companies to expand its presence in retail and wealth management: a personal-finance startup called Clarity Money, a retirement platform called Honest Dollar and an investment-advisory firm called United Capital.  But none of those deals gave Goldman a big pool of retail deposits or other kinds of businesses that could offset a sharp decline in trading revenue.  Michael McTamney, an analyst of big banks and brokers for credit rating service DBRS Morningstar, said Morgan Stanley\u2019s move deal puts more pressure on Goldman.  \u201cGoldman Sachs has, historically, been a build-up-themselves organization as opposed to making acquisitions,\u201d McTamney said. Now there will be more questions from investors about whether acquisitions are needed, he said.  DEALMAKER IN CHIEF  Associates say that Solomon is staking his legacy on turning Goldman into a global, full-service financial services firm that can compete with rivals. His predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein, has expressed regret about not acquiring during the crisis for the same kind of growth  A longtime dealmaker, Solomon became CEO in 2018 and was instrumental in a turnaround plan that preceded his elevation. At Goldman\u2019s first-ever investor day in late January, his management team set ambitious targets to grow the bank\u2019s consumer division over the next five years.  Goldman may be able to do that without an acquisition, but a deal would help, said Dick Bove, a senior research analyst at Odeon Capital.  \u201cIf they acquire a bank, which will bring in low-cost deposits, I think that would be a big plus,\u201d he said.  \u201cGoldman, clearly under Blankfein, missed the boat.\u201d","321":"A Tesco Extra sign is seen outside a store in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, July 6, 2015. REUTERS\/Olivia Harris\/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD PACKAGE SEARCH BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD JUNE 20 FOR ALL IMAGES  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - A smooth sale of a Tesco unit will signal it\u2019s mostly back to business as usual for Goldman Sachs. The U.S. bank is advising the British grocer on a potential $9 billion exit from Southeast Asia. Up to one fifth of the operations by value sit in Malaysia. That means the Wall Street bank led by David Solomon may earn fees from the sale of assets in a country where Goldman is still tangling with authorities for its role in the multi-billion-dollar 1MDB sovereign fund scandal.  The bank is serving a long-standing client: Goldman has worked for Tesco on corporate bond issues, asset-backed securities and more over the decades. It advised on the company\u2019s 2003 acquisition, and subsequent exit, from Japan. Most of the assets now under review by the 25 billion-pound chain are headquartered in Bangkok and the rest in Kuala Lumpur.  The mandate, though, is significant for a bank that has been tied up in controversy for fees pocketed on three 1MDB bond issues totalling $6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013. The Goldman banker who led those deals, Tim Leissner, went on leave in early 2016, and eventually pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Dealogic has no record of Goldman earning investment banking fees in Malaysia between 2017 and 2019. That\u2019s a long stretch, even in a small market where business is lumpy.  Goldman is advising on the sale from London and will most likely be paid by a UK-based company. That kind of a remote setup is not uncommon for global dealmakers. Still, local authorities seeking a settlement over 1MDB may be irritated by the thought of the bank earning fees from the sale of Malaysian assets.  Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in December said that compensation of \u201cone point something billion\u201d dollars offered by the bank was too small. Meanwhile, criminal charges filed earlier by Malaysia against 17 current and former directors of the bank remain outstanding. Goldman senior executives have publicly said that the bank wants to put the issue behind it.  Goldman will be keen to demonstrate that it is ready and able to serve all the needs of its multinational clients, and the Tesco deal would test the reach of Malaysian authorities. Supermarkets might become an unwelcome reminder to politicians that capital is global.","322":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N employee pleaded guilty on Wednesday to engaging in insider trading based on non-public information about several companies that were clients of the investment bank, Manhattan federal prosecutors announced.

It\u2019s a step in our path forward.\u201d  Nearly 98% of Goldman\u2019s worldwide staff has been working remotely since mid-March.  The return-to-work plan involves bringing staff back in phases, starting with 20% and gradually ramping up to 50%.  In Hong Kong, about 25% of employees were back at work as of last week, and the bank aims to have 35% by May 11 and 50% by May 25. reut.rs\/2xjMEcB  The bank has temperature scanners at its Hong Kong office to check employees for fever, and is considering installing them at more offices, including at its New York headquarters.  Most offices will remain at about 50% capacity to allow for more space between employee desks, in accordance with social distancing guidelines, the bank has said.  Goldman has not yet decided whether to re-open office gyms or childcare centers, and it is exploring ways to provide alternatives to public transportation for employees at certain offices, according to the memo.  There is no \u201cone size fits all solution\u201d for the bank\u2019s offices worldwide, Solomon said. However, he wrote, \u201ceveryone will need to adhere to certain rules ... including strictly abiding by the firm\u2019s sick policy.\u201d","337":"LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - The protracted process of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union has caused side-effects on the domestic economy to intensify, Goldman Sachs said on Friday, pointing to dwindling company investment.  Capital expenditure by businesses has been particularly subdued, the bank said, and strong employment figures mask a misallocation of UK company resources to labour rather than capital which will ultimately hurt productivity.  Since the referendum, firms have hired workers rather than invest in capital, Goldman Sachs economists said.  \u201cThe misallocation of resources looks to have deepened.\u201d  An increasingly tight labour market - with unemployment at its lowest since early 1975 and pay growing at its joint fastest pace in over a decade - could thus be a sign of strain rather than resilience.  \u201cThe balance between weaker demand for workers and a shorter supply of workers bears the hallmarks of a Brexit-induced labour market shock,\u201d the economists said.  Low investment combined with a tight labour market are likely to \u201caccentuate the chronic underperformance of UK productivity,\u201d they added.  Goldman Sachs maintained its view that Britain is likely to leave the EU with a modified version of the current withdrawal agreement, but said that until Brexit is resolved it is hard to see a strong rebound in growth.  Next year could see a pick-up in activity as uncertainty fades, the bank added, but \u201cthe persistence of the structural headwinds facing the UK economy is likely to take longer to address.\u201d (Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Thyagaraju Adinarayan)","338":"NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has hired a top JPMorgan Chase & Co dealmaker, Kurt Simon, as a partner and vice chairman of its investment banking division, Goldman Sachs said in an internal memo on Friday.  A Goldman Sachs representative confirmed the contents of the memo. A JP Morgan representative declined to comment.  A move to a rival firm for a banker as senior as Simon, who was JP Morgan\u2019s global chairman of mergers and acquisitions, is rare and underscores Goldman Sachs\u2019 drive to be No. 1 in the global M&A league tables. It is currently second in the rankings that measure market share in M&A advisory business, behind Morgan Stanley, having worked on $846.7 billion of global deals this year and No. 1 on deals that have U.S. involvement, according to Thomson Reuters data.  JP Morgan ranks third in both global and U.S. M&A, Thomson Reuters data showed, and said last month that its M&A fees reached a record $1.2 billion in the half of the year.  \u201cKurt brings a wealth of knowledge, experience, and valuable insights to our business and his appointment underscores our continued commitment to further strengthening and developing our global team,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 senior leaders in its banking division - Gregg Lemkau, John Waldron and Marc Nachmann - said in the memo.  Simon will also become a co-chairman in the global technology, media and telecom group based in New York. At JP Morgan, he advised its largest clients such as Walt Disney Co , Dell Technologies Inc and Softbank Group . Simon was also based in San Francisco from 2010 until 2015.  Transformative tie-ups of telecommunications and media companies, including megadeals such as the sale of most of the assets from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to Disney, and the combination of Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, have been boosting worldwide merger and acquisition activity to new highs.

REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N wants women to make up half of its global workforce, starting with new analysts by 2021, the Wall Street bank said on Thursday, as it stepped up efforts to address gender and racial imbalance across the board.  \u201cThe advancement of women in the workplace \u2013 and more broadly the state of diversity at our firm \u2013 is top of mind for all of us,\u201d Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and President and co-Chief Operating Officer David Solomon said in an internal memo posted on its website.  \u201cWhile we have made progress in recent years on women\u2019s representation and ethnic and racial diversity, there is still significant progress to be made,\u201d they said.  Solomon said in January that despite some progress in recent years, the fifth largest U.S. bank had not raised the proportion of women in its workforce to an adequate level, particularly in senior management.  Sources close to Solomon, who earlier this week effectively became CEO-in-waiting after another likely successor announced his retirement, describe him as a strong advocate for diversity.  Goldman\u2019s initial target is to have 50 percent of women in its incoming analyst class by 2021, according to the memo. The percentage of women in its 2018 full-time analyst class was in the high-40s, up from the low-40s last year.  The bank is also striving to hire more women and diverse professionals from other companies, the memo said.","341":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc management is considering whether to scale back financial targets set earlier this year, as the coronavirus pandemic has hindered the bank\u2019s business model revamp, analysts and sources inside the bank told Reuters.  The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Goldman unveiled plans to boost returns on equity and cut costs during its first-ever investor day in January. To reach its goals, Goldman would squeeze more revenue from existing businesses like wealth management as well as relatively new ones like consumer lending, while launching additional corporate services like cash management.  Since then, the pandemic has slammed into the economy, crippling loan demand and causing widespread unemployment. It has also prevented Goldman bankers from drumming up business with new customers the way they could before coronavirus lockdowns.  Although Goldman\u2019s trading revenue has soared thanks to market volatility, other initiatives have stalled.  \u201cUnless there\u2019s a silver bullet vaccine cure, it looks like Goldman will not hit its targets,\u201d said Viola Risk Advisors bank analyst David Hendler. \u201cIt\u2019s behind on wealth management and it\u2019s behind on consumer.\u201d  A spokesman for Goldman referred Reuters to executives\u2019 prior statements but declined to comment further.  Goldman Sachs executives have stood by their targets, stressing that the path to achieving them in the coming years would not be \u201clinear.\u201d They are not expected to move the goalposts on Wednesday when the bank reports third-quarter results.  Instead, the bank may change targets in January, a year after they were set, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.  As it stands, Goldman pledged to produce a return on tangible common shareholders\u2019 equity (ROTE) of more than 14% by 2023, compared with 10.6% in 2019.  The bank also outlined plans to cut expenses by $1.3 billion over that time frame, producing an efficiency ratio of 60% compared with 68.1% in 2019. A lower efficiency ratio means a company is better at managing costs relative to revenue.  Failing to hit the targets would deal a blow to Chief Executive David Solomon, who has pledged to make Goldman Sachs look more like a conventional bank. However, analysts already anticipate target revisions and say there is little Solomon could do about the financial consequences of the pandemic.  Analyst estimates for Goldman\u2019s ROTE do not exceed 12% in the coming years, and the consensus for its efficiency ratio is 63.2% by 2024, suggesting a lack of confidence in the bank\u2019s targets, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken noted in a recent report.  So far this year, Goldman has had to delay the launch of a new digital wealth management initiative and slow hiring of private wealth advisors in response to the pandemic. The bank also slowed loan growth in the consumer division and set aside more money for loans that could go bad.  Helping Goldman\u2019s profits, analysts expect trading revenue to stay aloft through year-end and for the bank to see cost-cutting benefits in 2021.  Goldman has been automating more roles and recently said it was laying off a \u201cmodest\u201d number of staff, primarily in back-office functions. Automation is likely to accelerate as the pandemic continues, leading to more job cuts, the sources said.  Although Goldman may miss its pre-pandemic targets, Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove thinks Solomon is pursuing the correct strategy in shaping Goldman more like a conventional bank.  \u201cOverall, this company is moving in the right direction at the right time,\u201d he said.","342":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

Goldman Sachs added that any travel to and within all of Italy is now restricted. All of the firm\u2019s staff who have traveled to mainland China, South Korea, Iran and Italy, or have been in close contact with individuals who have been to these countries, are required to self-isolate.

Goldman\u2019s foray into retail banking began in 2015 and has accelerated under Chief Executive David Solomon, who took the helm last year. Because Goldman does not have branches, it has been trying to get attention for products offered by its consumer bank, Marcus, through promotions and partnerships.  Called Apple Card, the card will use the MasterCard payment network. While consumers will receive a physical card, Apple and Goldman hope users will store payment information in the iPhone wallet app and make purchases without needing to carry the card.  The Apple alliance will push the brand much further into the mainstream than Goldman\u2019s prior efforts, analysts said. Effectively, the Goldman Sachs-Apple card will become the vehicle for people who want to buy pricey smartphones, computers and other gadgets from one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer brands.  \u201cThere is a great deal of buzz,\u201d said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg, comparing Goldman\u2019s offering to JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s popular Sapphire credit card. \u201cWe expect solid issuance right out of the box.\u201d  There were 1.4 billion active Apple devices, 900 million of which were iPhones, as of January. The company has been emailing potential customers about the new credit card\u2019s launch, with Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook saying last week that it would soon appear in stores.  On Friday, Goldman Sachs released terms and conditions, including details on interest rates and rewards.  Although there is excitement on Wall Street, analysts have expressed concern about Goldman\u2019s plunge into retail.  For one, the bank has precious little experience dealing with Main Street borrowers. Many economists and analysts believe the United States is overdue for a recession, which makes the timing of Goldman\u2019s card roll-out less than ideal.  Bank executives said last month that they have tamped down efforts to grow consumer loans because of heightened credit risk. As of July, Marcus had a $6 billion book of unsecured loans, which mostly stem from consumers who consolidated existing credit-card debt into a cheaper product. Marcus also held more than $50 billion in retail deposits.  As the business has grown, analysts complain that Goldman is not disclosing enough details about the people it is lending to, such as their credit scores or delinquency rates. They also worry that Goldman is spending a lot on something that is unlikely generate meaningful profits for some time.  Over the past few years, Goldman has spent $1.3 billion, before taxes, on new business initiatives, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr told analysts last month. The initiatives are the Apple card, Marcus\u2019 digital offerings and a transaction banking product.  Those three projects dragged down Goldman\u2019s return-on-equity by 60 basis points in the second quarter, Scherr said. But he predicted they will bolster profits once they are running at full-scale.  Analysts believe Goldman\u2019s credit-card endeavor will be fruitful over the long-run, even if it takes awhile to get off the ground.  A few years from now, the card will only represent 1-2% of Goldman\u2019s earnings, Wells Fargo & Co analyst Mike Mayo predicted. But, he said, the bank has the advantage of starting from scratch, unlike rivals that are dealing with costly branch networks and old technology.  \u201cThese are two iconic brands that are partnering to better compete as part of the 21st century digital banking wars,\u201d May told Reuters. \u201cIt is part of Goldman\u2019s pivot.

The United States accused 46-year-old Ng last year of conspiring to launder money and bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi through bond offerings that Goldman Sachs Group Inc handled. He was extradited on May 3 to New York from Kuala Lumpur, where he had been jailed since November.  Ng pleaded not guilty to the charges on May 6 and was released in exchange for a $20 million bond.  Prosecutors are working on how to best format and organize the remaining documents, which they will likely send to Ng\u2019s lawyers on a rolling basis, Rolle said.  Prosecutors and Ng\u2019s lawyer, in a May 6 court document related to the case, had requested delaying the trial date for Ng because they believed plea negotiations \u201care likely to result in a disposition of this case without trial.\u201d  Government lawyers have said they hope to avoid a trial by reaching a plea deal though Ng\u2019s attorney.  \u201cI\u2019m not ruling anything out,\u201d said Marc Agnifilo, Ng\u2019s lawyer, to reporters after the hearing about a possible plea deal. \u201cThere is a full range of possibilities for a criminal defendant, and there are still options.\u201d  Ng, who left Goldman Sachs in 2014, faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the three charges based on alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Malaysia\u2019s home minister wanted Ng to face criminal charges there first, but agreed to temporarily surrender him to the United States for 10 months, Malaysia\u2019s attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said in a statement.  The period may be extended, Thomas has said.  But that issue is for the U.S. and Malaysian governments to discuss, Agnifilo told reporters.  \u201cGiven the complexity of the case, it\u2019s going to require us to do a lot of work up front and as soon as possible,\u201d Agnifilo said to reporters about the 10-month period.  Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak.  Najib, who lost a general election last year, faces 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities.

Tim Devaney, of free credit score app Credit Karma, said the rewards are competitive but are not what will differentiate the Apple Card. \u201cThe Apple Card is consumer-friendly,\u201d he said, noting features such as a calculator that shows how much interest a consumer will incur by paying a balance over time.  Apple did not say if the new budgeting tool would include cash and credit balances from other accounts, nor if it would come with a sign-up bonus.  The Apple Card is Goldman\u2019s first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank.  Apple\u2019s Bailey said Goldman will never share or sell consumer data to third parties for marketing.

FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  In a note to clients, the bank cut its baseline earnings per share estimate for S&P 500 .SPX companies to $165 from $174 in 2020, implying that profits would remain unchanged from a year ago.  For comparison, data provider Refinitiv\u2019s broader survey of analysts from major brokerages currently forecasts a 7.7% rise in earnings this year.  Goldman said the latest forecast reflects a severe decline in Chinese economic activity in the first quarter, lower demand for U.S. exporters, supply chain disruptions and a slowdown in domestic economic activity.  \u201cWe assume economic growth slows sharply during the first half of 2020, but rebounds in the second half of 2020 and 2021,\u201d Goldman analysts said.  However, they added a more severe pandemic could lead to a prolonged disruption and a U.S. recession.  Financial markets have been rattled by fears that the virus, which has killed more than 2,700 people, mostly in China, and spread to other countries, could undercut the longest U.S. economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.  Economists expect supply-chain disruptions to hit the struggling manufacturing sector, while pain for the services sector could come via the travel and tourism industry.  Goldman said it expects the benchmark S&P 500 index to trade around 2,900 points in the near-term, 14.4% below the index's record closing high hit on Feb. 19, assuming the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR drops to 1%.  If the yield climbs to 1.5%, Goldman expects S&P 500 to hit 3,400 by the year-end.  The S&P 500 has lost more than 10% since last Wednesday, with the index on course for its worst weekly fall since the financial crisis in November 2008.

Of the estimated cash spending in 2019, S&P 500 companies will allocate 51 percent to invest in growth, including capital expenditures, research and development and cash acquisitions, while 49 percent will go toward returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, Goldman strategists wrote on Thursday.  For 2018, total S&P 500 cash spending is rising by 19 percent, the fastest pace since 2011, they wrote.  The increased cash spending follows last December\u2019s biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code by Congress in over 30 years. The new tax law slashed the corporate income tax rate and charged multinationals a one-time tax on profits held overseas.  Goldman strategists expect S&P 500 buybacks to climb by 22 percent to $940 billion in 2019 versus 2018\u2019s estimated $770 billion.  Capital expenditures are expected to increase by about 9 percent from an estimated $715 billion in 2018 to $780 billion in 2019.  \u201cIn the near term, we expect companies prioritizing buybacks and dividends will continue to outperform firms investing for growth,\u201d Goldman wrote. \u201cReturning cash to shareholders is a winning long-term strategy and performs best when GDP growth is as strong as in 2018.\u201d  The Commerce Department confirmed last week that gross domestic product grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest pace in nearly four years.  Goldman estimated about $525 billion of the $3 trillion in spending will go toward dividends in 2019, up from an estimated $495 billion in 2018.","354":"NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u2019s Chief Executive David Solomon got a $4 million raise in his total compensation for 2019 from 2018, according to corporate filings released on Friday.

Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc added 1.6% as its fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, dwarfing estimates after another blowout performance at its trading and underwriting business.  Bank of America also topped fourth-quarter profit estimates and joined JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co in releasing some cash reserves to cover for coronavirus-driven loan losses, underscoring its confidence in the economy.  Its shares, however, dropped 1.2% after a sharp climb over the last two weeks.

Wall Street\u2019s main indexes dropped on Friday as investors booked profits after a recent rally to record highs on hopes of a speedy economic recovery fueled by a hefty fiscal stimulus package and vaccine distribution.  Yellen is set to testify to the Senate Finance Committee, starting at 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), that the government must \u201cact big\u201d with its next coronavirus aid plan.

The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The Wall Street bank is managing a private equity fund called China-U.S. Industrial Cooperation Partnership LP, which it launched with state-owned China Investment Corp (CIC) in November 2017 on the sidelines of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to Beijing.  The fund invested alongside Goldman to buy Boyd Corp, a Pleasanton, California-based manufacturer of rubber seals and gaskets, for $3 billion last September, the sources said.  Chinese efforts to invest in U.S. companies have been tripped up over the past year by Washington\u2019s concerns the Chinese were gaining control of sensitive technology or companies that played key roles in the economy.  Reuters reported on Wednesday that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. government panel that scrutinizes deals for national security risks, asked the Chinese owner of the dating app Grindr to divest it, spurred on by data privacy concerns.  Goldman successfully argued to CFIUS, however, that its plan to buy Boyd should be allowed to proceed, the sources said.  CIC's novel partnership with Goldman illustrates how China is adapting to U.S. curbs on its deal-making, which resulted in Chinese acquisitions of U.S. companies plunging by 88 percent year-on-year in 2018, according to financial data provider Refinitiv, as trade relations between the world's two largest economies deteriorated. (For a graphic on Chinese acquisitions in the United States: tmsnrt.rs\/2HzUTVE)  The Cooperation fund was set up expressly to help U.S. companies penetrate the Chinese market. And the fund is touting CIC\u2019s involvement as a strategic advantage in accomplishing this goal.  In a confidential marketing document prepared for Goldman clients and seen by Reuters, the New York-based bank highlighted CIC\u2019s \u201cefficient sourcing of commercial partners and customers,\u201d promising to \u201cbring new pathways for growth via China.\u201d  \u201cThe Cooperation fund is a U.S. fund run by a U.S. manager, and is managed to be in compliance with all laws and regulations, including CFIUS,\u201d a Goldman spokeswoman said.  A spokesman for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, said the panel does not comment publicly on individual cases.  CIC did not respond to requests for comment. The sovereign fund said last summer that it planned to press ahead with the Cooperation fund despite U.S.-China trade tensions, but details of its first deal have not been previously reported. The sources asked not to be identified because the Cooperation fund\u2019s details are confidential.  RIVAL CHINESE BIDDER BALKED  Even though Goldman received CFIUS clearance for the Boyd deal, it did not disclose publicly the Cooperation fund\u2019s involvement in the acquisition and most of Boyd\u2019s 4,200 employees were not told about the Chinese money, the sources said.  A Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc credit rating note listed Boyd\u2019s acquirer as Goldman\u2019s flagship private equity fund West Street Capital Partners VII. After the deal, that fund transferred a minority stake in Boyd to the Cooperation fund, the sources said.  A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on why Goldman\u2019s Boyd-related announcements did not mention the Cooperation fund.  One Chinese company that sought to acquire Boyd outright had balked at the regulatory hurdles.  Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co Ltd, a Chinese laminates manufacturer, said in regulatory announcements that it abandoned a bid for Boyd because it thought the \u201cChina-U.S trade friction\u201d would make regulatory approval of the deal difficult.  Kangde Xin did not respond to a request for comment. Investment bankers said the company\u2019s failure to buy Boyd showed CIC would not have been able to do the deal without the structure offered by the Goldman fund.  \u201cThis is a really innovative structure, one which could go a long way to enable them to undertake transactions that would be hard for them to do otherwise,\u201d said Euan Rellie, co-founder of BDA Partners, an investment bank that specializes in cross-border deals, referring to the Goldman fund and CIC.  ANCHOR INVESTOR  CIC, whose assets under management are approaching $1 trillion, also has investments in other private equity funds. But CIC does not typically help companies acquired by private equity funds it invests in grow in China.  CIC also calls itself an \u201canchor investor\u201d in the Cooperation fund, and the sources said it holds a sizeable minority stake that is larger than its typical private equity fund investments.  \u201cCIC is not involved in the investment management of the fund nor the operation of the fund\u2019s portfolio companies. CIC\u2019s role is to help Goldman Sachs, as the investment manager, identify and pursue opportunities for portfolio companies to do more business in China,\u201d the Goldman spokeswoman said.  The Cooperation fund, which targets $5 billion in investment capital, plans to execute between one and three deals a year on average, adding up to as many as 12 over the duration of the fund, two of the sources said.  The fund is the most advanced in a series of similar investments by CIC. In an interview with Chinese state-owned newspaper Securities Times earlier this month, CIC\u2019s president, Tu Guangshao, said bilateral cooperation funds were a strategy to \u201cachieve a more favorable foreign investment regulatory environment\u201d and \u201cremove some barriers in cross-border investment.\u201d  Tu said CIC has inked a letter of intent for a Britain-China fund, signed a contract for a Japan-China Industrial Cooperation Fund and is \u201cin preparation for\u201d China cooperation funds with Italy and France.  \u201cWhen you get a couple more cases like this that look successful, other sovereign wealth funds and foreign investors will adopt this model,\u201d said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.","358":"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N has called on Hong Kong to reconsider planned limits on how much equity company founders can hold when the city introduces dual-class shares, warning they could dent the city's competitiveness versus major centers like New York.  FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo  The new rules, due to take effect by mid-year, are designed to give greater voting rights to founding shareholders as part of efforts to attract Chinese tech and other new economy firms as Hong Kong seeks to counter New York\u2019s success in attracting headline-grabbing Chinese companies.  But under the proposals company founders seeking a dual-class listing cannot hold more than 50 percent of the firm when it floats.  Ken Hitchner, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Asia-Pacific operations told a regulatory conference that \u201cnot limiting the amount of equity that founders can hold at the time of an IPO\u201d could help attract more Chinese companies to the Hong Kong market.  \u201cThere will likely be innovative companies looking to go public where the founder owns 80% or 90%. If that founder wanted to do a dual-class listing in Hong Kong, he or she would have to sell down to 50 per cent,\u201d Hitchner told Reuters separately.  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t seem in line with what Hong Kong is trying to do here and it could hurt competitiveness versus New York.\u201d  Notwithstanding Hong Kong\u2019s role as the world\u2019s biggest equity capital-raising center for four of the last 10 years, it has fallen well behind New York, its arch-rival, in the battle for hot tech stocks and other growth sectors. Just 3 percent of Hong Kong listings in the past decade, by market value, have been so-called \u201cnew economy\u201d companies, compared with 47 percent for the New York Stock Exchange, according to a discussion paper published by the HKEX in June.  EYES ON GOVERNANCE  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd 0388.HK, the city\u2019s bourse, is currently consulting on the detailed rules for introducing dual class shares, which will upend a strict 30-year adherence to a one-share-one-vote principle and has upset corporate governance advocates.  Hong Kong is hoping that easing rules for primary listing of companies with dual-class shares will help revitalize its IPO market, which has been dominated by Chinese state firms, financial companies and property groups.  Hong Kong\u2019s rules are also being closely watched by governance experts for the safeguards and limits the city includes.  While New York, which has allowed dual-class shares for decades and operates a system based on extensive disclosures of share structures, Hong Kong has typically included tougher rule-based protections for minority shareholders.  \u201cThe US, which is the major competitor, doesn\u2019t actually have any rules - it\u2019s a rules-free situation there,\u201d said Ashley Alder, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission, speaking at the same conference, which was organized by the SFC. \u201cWhat Hong Kong is about to implement is basically the world\u2019s first set of rules for weighted voting rights.\u201d Bankers have largely backed dual-class shares and report potential listing candidates are actively debating the proposed system.  \u201cThese are real discussions in the bake offs, in the pitches that we\u2019re involved in,\u201d said Goldman\u2019s Hitchner.","359":"FILE PHOTO - A screen displays the ticker symbol and information for Goldman Sachs on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) February 9, 2016.

The Apple Card will sync with iPhone\u2019s users\u2019 Apple Wallet and work through its payment system Apple Pay, said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay. She spoke in Cupertino, California, where the company also announced the launch of a streaming television service and an online gaming arcade.  Cardholders will earn 2 percent cash back on all purchases made using their phones or 3 percent cash back on Apple products.  The physical credit card will be made of titanium - laser-etched with users\u2019 names but no numbers as a security feature. It will pay 1 percent cash back on purchases.  The card, which will be issued by Goldman Sachs Group Inc and will use the Mastercard Inc network, will come with new features in the Apple Wallet to help users track their spending with a breakdown of monthly purchasing.  Credit card industry analysts said the rewards programs were not significantly different from what is currently available in the market, but that Apple\u2019s broad consumer reach could make it a major player.  \u201cFrankly I am bit underwhelmed,\u201d said Ted Rossman, an analyst at Creditcards.com. \u201cThis card will get a lot of headlines, but its bark is greater than its bite.\u201d  He noted that the rewards for Apple\u2019s card were less attractive than benefits Citigroup Inc offers with its Double Cash Card. The U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite card gives 3 points per dollar on mobile wallet spending, worth 3 percent cash back or 4.5 percent off travel, he added.  Apple Pay is accepted by 70 percent of U.S. merchants and will be available in more than 40 countries by the end of the year. Commuters in New York, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, will eventually be able to use it to pay for public transportation, Apple said.  Cash back rewards will be credited to Apple Pay users\u2019 accounts on a daily basis, Bailey said, and the card will not charge annual fees, international fees or late fees. She did not give specific information on the interest rate cardholders will pay on balances.  Sara Rathner, credit card specialist at financial product comparison site NerdWallet, said there are \u201ca lot of cash-back cards that offer similar benefits\u201d but that the card would be convenient for consumers who purchase a lot of Apple products and services.  Tim Devaney, of free credit score app Credit Karma, said the rewards are competitive but are not what will differentiate the Apple Card. \u201cThe Apple Card is consumer-friendly,\u201d he said, noting features such as a calculator that shows how much interest a consumer will incur by paying a balance over time.  Apple did not say if the new budgeting tool would include cash and credit balances from other accounts, nor if it would come with a sign-up bonus.  The Apple Card is Goldman\u2019s first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank.  Apple\u2019s Bailey said Goldman will never share or sell consumer data to third parties for marketing. She added that the card would have privacy features, and Apple would not know what and where a purchase was made or how much it cost.

Malaysian and U.S. authorities estimate $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials in the fund, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs, and others. Najib has denied wrongdoing.  In a complaint filed in the Central District of California on Wednesday, the Justice Department said the $300 million was traceable to a line of credit extended by Venezuela\u2019s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. to Saudi\u2019s PetroSaudi Oil Services in connection with an oil drilling venture.  The companies are already embroiled in a legal dispute over the funds which the Malaysian high court has sought to freeze with cooperation from the British authorities.  The Justice Department said it was also seeking four dozen promotional movie posters that Riza Aziz, a Hollywood producer and Razak\u2019s stepson, acquired with more than $4 million in funds traceable to assets embezzled from 1MDB.  Prosecutors dropped money-laundering charges against Aziz in May after reaching a deal in which he agreed to help authorities recover 1MDB-related assets.

From the headquarters of Ford in Dearborn, Michigan and Goldman Sachs in New York to Fedex facilities across the United States, workers are returning after months of lockdowns to the new reality of social distancing, hybrid remote and office work schedules, and strict hygiene protocols.  The break room, where employees used to get their daily fix of caffeine and office gossip, is a big part of that reboot as coffee companies, such as Keurig Dr. Pepper, Lavazza and Nestle roll out new technology for the COVID-19 era.  Nestle says it has worked with manufacturers to add a function to its coffeemakers that lets users to make a selection by just hovering a finger over the menu and has been delivering those to clients since June.  Lavazza lauched a new model in September that works with a mobile app to whip up those cappuccinos and lattes without having to touch the machine.  U.S. coffee machine manufacturer Bunn has chosen a different approach, retrofitting its machines with a QR code that lets users order drinks through a webpage.  Last year, supplying offices with beans and brewers was a $5.7 billion business in the United States alone, according to research firm Packaged Facts. Coffee companies, which saw lockdowns wipe out so-called professional sales that also include the hospitality industry, bet they can revive that business by addressing workers' and employers' concerns. (Interactive graphic on U.S. coffee office service sector sales here tmsnrt.rs\/36fUSlh.)  DASH FOR AN APP  Lavazza had a new brewer slated to debut at a trade show in May, but started redesigning it to add a touchless function when the pandemic struck in March, Bruce Williamson, vice president of innovation and marketing at Lavazza Professional said.  \u201cWe had to very quickly use the weeks (we had) preparing for an app.\u201d  Williamson said a survey of about 170 consumers across the United States Lavazza commissioned in August validated its decision. It showed 40% of employees expected to leave the building less often to get a drink and to rely more on office supplies, but were nervous about infection risks.  \u201cWhat they are telling us is... \u2018I\u2019m going to come back to the office but I\u2019m nervous about touching the machine\u2019.\u201d  Employers, suppliers and designers are also experimenting with a one-stop service that allows office workers to refuel without going outside, while those working remotely can do it from the comfort of their home.  K-cup pod maker Keurig is supplying coffee for \u2018mini-marts\u2019 set up to replace office cafeterias and offering fresh fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat, coffee and other staples. It has also signed deals with several companies that have classified K-cup pods and brewers essential work items and pay for their deliveries to staff working remotely, said Phil Drapeau, the company's general manager for the 'Away from Home' business.(Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/3cFKFzF)  Ford said more than 100,000 people out of its global workforce of 190,000 have returned to its facilities since May, but cafe service remains suspended and it offers pre-packaged meals and beverages instead. The carmaker is also testing onsite grocery kiosks selling locally sourced dairy, produce, and meal prep kits.  Goldman Sachs told Reuters that 15% of its New York workforce is back with standard precautions in place - mandatory masks in all areas except employee desks and limits on the number of people in conference rooms and common areas.  RETHINK AND RECALIBRATE  Surveys and official guidelines suggest offices will fill up only gradually and might even never return to pre-pandemic capacity.  GoodFirms, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm, said this month its international survey of 168 businesses showed nearly a third of workers had already returned and nearly 60% wanted to do so, but more than half remained concerned about their safety.  A makeover of office catering was important for addressing such concerns, says Alicia LeBeouf, marketing and retail strategy executive at food service company Canteen, which counts FedEx, Pinterest, Target and UPS among its clients.  Buffets and chefs preparing meals on demand are replaced by grab-and-go food stations at Verizon and UnitedHealth Group Inc; contactless coffee machines get rolled out at Microsoft Corp; fridges get pedal-operated doors at Mohawk Industries and individually wrapped plastic utensils replace cutlery.  At a FedEx facility Canteen has replaced all card payment terminals at its grab-and-go stations with Canteen\u2019s \u201cConnect & Pay\u201d app, which also shows which items are available and their nutritional information.  The layout also needs to change, says Tom Vecchione, workplace strategist at New York architecture firm Vocon. The company is knocking down doors and removing screens for its clients to create more spacious common areas that make social distancing easier while replacing chairs with stools to discourage people from lingering for too long.  Canteen\u2019s LeBeouf said employers were banking on workers coming back, but they would not be returning to the same office they left before the pandemic.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had to recalibrate and...rethink everything.\u201d","364":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Point72 Ventures and others invested $42 million in a Mexico-based online lender called Credijusto.com, the companies said on Thursday.

Credijusto is tackling the financial inclusion gap for small and medium-sized companies, which comprise 99% of Mexico\u2019s businesses but get just 15% of loans issued by major banks, according to the statement.  \u201cHere\u2019s this big market that\u2019s largely under-served and inefficient, and this modern lender can make sense of data that\u2019s available,\u201d Pete Casella, a partner at Point72 Ventures, said in an interview. \u201cIf you can better underwrite a customer and do it faster then you\u2019re going to capture share.\u201d  Companies may wait five months to get approved for a loan by a Mexican bank, and interest rates may be five times as much as those offered by U.S. banks, according to the statement.  Credijusto speeds up the process by checking a company\u2019s creditworthiness by looking at invoices it filed with the federal tax authorities.  Using traditional underwriting methods and key invoice data, Credijusto can view a company\u2019s spending and income patterns and business partners before deciding on issuing the loan, which typically ranges from $20,000 to $500,000.  \u201cThis financing round is a validation of Credijusto\u2019s rapid growth ... and will further support our aim of building a world-class tech company that empowers (companies) through access to credit,\u201d said Credijusto co-Chief Executive Allan Apoj.  The company plans to use the money, in part, to launch a credit card offering.

Solomon, President and Chief Operating Officer, Goldman Sachs, speaks at the Milken Institute's 21st Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N President David Solomon said on Thursday that second-quarter market activity had decreased from the first quarter, when heightened volatility helped Wall Street banks record huge profits.  The comment comes two days after JPMorgan Chase JPM.N said second-quarter markets revenue looked like it will be flat compared with a year earlier.  Investors have questioned the viability of Wall Street banks\u2019 trading business, which saw big declines last year as volatility mired near historically low levels.  The backlash from the investing community has forced Goldman and others to rethink their strategy, and explore businesses such as investment banking and consumer lending, which are not heavily reliant on market activity.  Activity across investment banking is robust, Solomon said at a Bernstein conference in New York on Thursday, adding that the investment banking backlog was close to an all-time high.  IPO activity, particularly in the United States and China\u2019s tech sector, was starting to pick up, Solomon said. Investment banks make big bucks on underwriting initial public offerings and providing financial counsel.  Solomon also emphasized on growth in its consumer banking business, and said the bank was building a digital finance platform to meet consumer demand and connect customers to other parts of its businesses. However, he added that Goldman did not have to be one of the \u201cbig leading consumer banks\u201d.  \u201cWe could have a narrow slice of share and have a very big, very profitable, very differentiated business over a period of time,\u201d Solomon said.","366":"LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has partnered with card issuing startup Marqeta to build the U.S. bank\u2019s Marcus checking accounts set to launch this year, the companies said on Thursday.  The bank, an investor in California-based Marqeta, hopes that the partnership will enable it to create more personalized and feature-rich digital banking services for its customers, it said.  Launched in 2016, Marcus has allowed Goldman to diversify its revenue and funding sources by offering savings accounts and personal loans to retail customers. Until then, the bank had operated largely as an investment bank and trading house, relying on money from the wholesale market.  Goldman, which had amassed more than $96 billion in consumer deposits through Marcus as of September 2020, has been investing heavily in its retail business. It bought a personal finance app in 2018, launched a credit card with Apple Inc in 2019 and has been offering lucrative savings rates to draw in more customers.  It launched an app for Marcus a little over a year ago, finally meeting demand from frustrated smartphone users who had to view account information, make loan payments or balance transfers on the bank\u2019s website.  Marqeta\u2019s clients include well-known digital payments companies like Square Inc and Klarna. Its platform has become popular with young tech-savvy financial companies, as it claims its technology makes it easier for fintech software developers to build new products and services.  Marqeta, whose backers also include Mastercard Inc and Visa, has seen business boom this year, with COVID-19 lockdowns leading to a surge in demand for digital payments.

The outbreak began in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei and has spread to the rest of the country, with 440 confirmed cases and nine deaths so far. It has also spread to the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.  The new virus, which health officials have said can be passed from person to person, has worried financial markets as investors recalled the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2002-2003, also a coronavirus outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide.  \u201cTranslating the estimated SARS demand impact into 2020 volumes points to a potential 260,000 barrels per day negative shock to global oil demand on average,\u201d Goldman said in a note dated Jan. 21. The estimate includes a 170,000 barrels per day loss of jet fuel demand, it added.  The bank expects jet fuel markets, including cracks, regrade and Asian differentials, to be hit the most if the outbreak leads to a decline in regional air travel.  While a supply response from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries could limit any fundamental impact from such a demand shock, the initial uncertainty could lead to a larger oil price sell-off, Goldman added.  Brent crude prices LCOc1 are currently just below $65 a barrel, while U.S. oil CLc1 is at about $58 a barrel.","370":"NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc told employees on Wednesday it will no longer carry widely used, throw-away plastic items like water bottles or silverware in its offices and cafeterias as the U.S. bank tries to cut the amount of trash it puts in landfills.  Starting last week, Goldman cafeterias and vending machines globally swapped out plastic soda and water bottles for aluminum cans, glass bottles and compostable cups to be used for fountain drinks, said Cindy Quan, Goldman Sachs Global Head of Environment Social and Governance.  Throw-away plastic items have been the subject of bans by a growing number of countries and corporations because they often end up littering oceans and waterways.  In December, the European Union agreed to ban by 2021 a list of 10 single-use plastic products, like plates, straws and drink stirrers.  The operator of luxury hotel chain Peninsula Hotels, The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited, said it will stop using plastic bottles, packaging and bathroom amenities by 2020.  Quan said Goldman is banning single-use plastics because they often ended up in the company\u2019s garbage instead of the recycling bin.  The bank has said it is trying to divert 100 percent of its business waste from landfills by 2020, and is 93 percent of the way there, Quan said.  This step will reduce the amount of single-use plastics bank employees throw away by 85 percent or to 6 tons, the bank said.","371":"KUALA LUMPUR\/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N \"cheated\" the country in dealings with state fund 1MDB and that U.S. authorities have promised to help return the fees the Wall Street bank earned from the fund.  FILE PHOTO: Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad gives a speech at Chulalongkorn University, in Bangkok, Thailand October 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Soe Zeya Tun  The U.S. investment bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping raise funds through bond offerings for 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) [TERRN.UL], which is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.  Goldman\u2019s stock fell to a near two-year low on Monday after Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said his country would seek a \u201cfull refund\u201d of the around $600 million in fees the bank earned from raising $6.5 billion for the fund. The stock eased 0.5 percent on Tuesday.  A Goldman Sachs spokesman on Monday said in an email to Reuters that the bank denied any wrongdoing.  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has said about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, including some money that Goldman Sachs helped raise, by high-level officials of the fund and their associates from 2009 through 2014.  U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against two former Goldman Sachs bankers earlier this month. One of them, Tim Leissner, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  \u201cThere is evidence that Goldman Sachs has done things that are wrong,\u201d Mahathir said in an interview with U.S. news channel CNBC aired on Tuesday.  \u201cObviously we have been cheated through the compliance by Goldman Sachs people,\u201d he said, without specifying details.  The bank\u2019s compliance controls \u201cdon\u2019t work very well\u201d, he added.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  A second Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment on Mahathir\u2019s comments in the interview.  Asked by reporters later in Singapore if he had officially requested the DOJ to help return money that Goldman earned from 1MDB, Mahathir said: \u201cIt takes a little bit of time but they (DOJ) have promised that they will give back the money.\u201d He was speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Singapore.  A DOJ spokeswoman said the United States continued to pursue justice with respect to its 1MDB investigations. Whenever possible, recovered assets would be used to \u201cbenefit the people\u201d harmed by corruption and abuse of office, she added.  Anwar Ibrahim, appointed successor to 93-year-old Mahathir, told parliament on Tuesday that Malaysia needed to take \u201cmore aggressive measures\u201d to reclaim the fees and losses due to the harm the scandal had done to the country\u2019s image.  Finance Minister Lim told reporters the country would seek consequential losses as well as the return of fees.  \u201cThe Malaysian government will want to reclaim all the fees paid, as well as all the losses including the interest rate differential,\u201d Lim told reporters. He said the rate Malaysia had paid was about 100 basis points higher than the market rate.  Critics have said the fees earned by Goldman Sachs were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.  Goldman has said the outsized fees related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds quickly.  Citing sources, Reuters reported in June that Malaysia was considering asking the DOJ to get Goldman Sachs to return the fees it had earned from the 1MDB deals.  The 1MDB scandal was a major reason for former premier Najib Razak\u2019s shock election loss in May. He has been charged with corruption over the scandal and has pleaded not guilty.  Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, described by U.S. and Malaysian authorities as central to the 1MDB fraud, was charged by U.S. prosecutors this month. He remains at large.","372":"July 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has hired Erika Irish Brown to head the Wall Street bank\u2019s efforts to recruit, retain and advance diverse professionals, according to an internal memo circulated on Wednesday and obtained by Reuters.

Berkshire has sold more than 86 million shares, or 21%, of its Wells Fargo stake since June 30, as the bank tries to restore its reputation following scandals over its mistreatment of customers.  Since the scandals began erupting in September 2016, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has risen 55%, while Wells Fargo is down 3%. Berkshire began investing in Wells Fargo in 1989.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  That gulf in pay comes close to the 59 percent gap revealed on Thursday by HSBC HSBA.L - the biggest yet reported by a British financial firm according to government data.  Thousands of large UK employers have been ordered to disclose their gender pay gaps by April, almost 50 years on from the passage of Britain\u2019s equal pay act.  Goldman Sachs said its gap reflected the fact that there were more men than women in senior positions at the firm.  It also reported a mean gender pay gap of 16.1 percent and a mean bonus gap of 32.5 percent in Goldman Sachs (UK) SVC Limited, which it said employs around 1,600 individuals from non-revenue divisions.  The bank employs 6,000 people in London. The remainder of its UK employees work in its international business.  Other large banks have also been disclosing their gender pay gaps ahead of the April deadline set last year by Prime Minister Theresa May.  The continued gulf in earnings between men and women has attracted significant public attention over the past year or so.  The gender pay gap measures the difference between the average salary of men and women, calculated on an hourly basis.  In Goldman Sachs\u2019 international business, 83 percent of the group earning the highest hourly pay were men, the bank said, while 62.4 percent of those on the lowest hourly pay were women.  This compared with 77.4 percent men in the highest paid group in Goldman Sachs (UK) SVC Limited, and 48.9 percent women in the lowest paid group.  The Wall Street bank said it is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels of the firm. On Thursday, it said it wanted women to make up half of its global workforce, starting with a target of 50 percent of its new analysts being women by 2021.","387":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s protracted divorce from the European Union is hurting the world\u2019s fifth largest economy as dwindling company investment, signs of a looming labour market shock and poor productivity hinder growth, Goldman Sachs said.  FILE PHOTO: Anti-Brexit protesters hold EU flags as they demonstrate outside the Houses of Parliament, as uncertainty over Brexit continues, in London, Britain, April 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes\/File Photo  The United Kingdom was due to have left the EU on March 29, though Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to get her divorce deal approved by parliament. Now the new deadline is Oct. 31, more than three years since the 2016 referendum.  It is now unclear when, how and even if Brexit will happen.  Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients that its base scenario was the divorce deal would be ratified by May 22 but that there was a risk of Britain\u2019s exit being delayed until much closer to the new Oct. 31 deadline.  \u201cThe politics of Brexit have become more protracted and, as a result, the side-effects of Brexit on the UK economy have intensified,\u201d Goldman said in a note entitled \u201cBrexit \u2014 Withdrawal Symptoms\u201d.  \u201cFrom both a top-down and a bottom-up perspective, Brexit has taken a toll on the UK economy \u2014 even though it has not yet happened,\u201d Goldman said.  It said Britain\u2019s economy has underperformed other advanced economies since mid-2016, losing nearly 2.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product relative to its pre-referendum growth path, in large part due to weaker investment.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in February that Britain had lost around 1.5 percent of GDP compared with the central bank\u2019s expectations before the referendum. Carney said this month that uncertainty facing British businesses has gone \u201cthrough the roof\u201d due to Brexit.  Capital expenditure by businesses has been particularly subdued, Goldman said, and strong employment data masks a deepening misallocation of resources to labour rather than capital which will ultimately make the economy less efficient.  Since the referendum, firms have hired workers rather than invest in capital, Goldman economists said.  \u201cBREXIT TAKING A TOLL\u201d  Business investment has grown by just 0.3 percent in cumulative terms since June 2016, and 2018 was the first year in at least half a century during which business investment contracted in every quarter without a recession, Goldman said.  An increasingly tight labour market - with unemployment at its lowest since early 1975 and pay growing at its joint fastest pace in over a decade - could also be a sign of strain rather than resilience.  \u201cThe balance between weaker demand for workers and a shorter supply of workers bears the hallmarks of a Brexit-induced labour market shock,\u201d Goldman economists said.  Low investment combined with a tight labour market are likely to hurt the economy\u2019s overall efficiency and thus \u201caccentuate the chronic underperformance of UK productivity,\u201d they added.  Britain\u2019s productivity has lagged that of the U.S., Germany, and France, for the past decade.  Business leaders have already triggered contingency plans to cope with additional checks on the post-Brexit UK-EU border they fear will clog ports, silt up the arteries of trade and dislocate supply chains in Europe and beyond.  Opponents fear Brexit will make Britain poorer and divide the West as it grapples with both the unconventional US presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China.  Brexit supporters say there would be short-term disruption but in the long-term the UK would thrive if cut free from what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending.  \u201cUntil the UK\u2019s departure from the EU is resolved, it is difficult to have conviction in a strong rebound in growth,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cIn 2020, with Brexit resolved, we do expect a pick-up in activity as uncertainty abates.\u201d","388":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs kept its odds on different Brexit outcomes unchanged on Thursday after British lawmakers failed to coalesce around a single proposal in indicative votes on the process of leaving the European Union.  The U.S. bank said the inconclusive process did underscore the lack of support in parliament for a no-deal Brexit, while the most popular options were only slightly different to the withdrawal agreement currently agreed with the EU.  \u201cThe options that attracted the most support... necessitate only minimal changes to the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement already negotiated between the UK and the EU,\u201d wrote Goldman Sachs European economist Adrian Paul.  Parliament plans to take control of parliamentary business on Monday April 1 again in order to find a compromise through further votes.  \u201cWe think the outcome of that concluding phase is likely to emphasise support for soft Brexit end-states while undermining support for more abrupt versions of near-term exit,\u201d wrote Paul.  Goldman Sachs still sees a 15 percent chance that Britain leaves the EU without a deal, a 35 percent chance that Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU is overturned, and a 50 percent chance that lawmakers eventually agree on a close variant of the current EU withdrawal agreement.","389":"(Repeats March 26 story with no change to text)  NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u2019s credit card deal with Apple Inc is the latest move by the Wall Street investment bank to court mass-market consumers, potentially connecting Goldman with hundreds of millions of iPhone users.  But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank\u2019s fledgling consumer business through credit card lending.  Goldman has been courting consumers since the 2016 launch of its online bank Marcus, and with its first credit card it is targeting fee-conscious ones. There will be no annual or late fees, and customers will pay variable annual interest rates of between 13.24 percent and 24.24 percent, according to Apple\u2019s website.  Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday.  But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets.  \u201cAs this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,\u201d said a person involved in similar credit card deals.  Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said.  Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a \u201cmajor step\u201d in the bank\u2019s plan to grow its consumer business.  Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank\u2019s strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading.  But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.  Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon\u2019s email.  While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank\u2019s overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt.  \u201cPeople want Goldman to be Goldman,\u201d Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article.  The Apple Card\u2019s wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books.  \u201cThey might securitize the debt, which wouldn\u2019t be anything new for an investment bank,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt.\u201d  As this is Goldman\u2019s first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named.  The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take.  Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman\u2019s decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share.  While Apple says its card is \u201ccreated by Apple, not a bank,\u201d according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card.  \u201cFor Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.  \u201cIt makes their brand way better at least in the retail and mass affluent marketplace.\u201d","390":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016.

Foreign investors and institutions interested in non-performing loans (NPL) were to attend the meeting in Istanbul arranged by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the people said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.  A currency crisis saw the lira fall nearly 30 percent against the dollar last year. That raised the cost of servicing foreign debt to surge resulting in a surge in problematic loans at banks.  Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said last month that Turkey would offer a nearly $5-billion injection for state banks in order to help them improve their balances. He said problematic loans in the energy and construction sectors would be moved to two off-balance sheet funds to relieve banks.  The Thursday meeting is aimed at bringing together domestic and foreign investors to discuss the sale of companies and assets with high debt, one source close to the matter said, adding that potential obstacles and solutions were to be discussed.  Asset management companies and portfolio managers will join the meeting, as well as the International Finance Corporation and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, high-ranking banking officials and foreign funds, the source said.  \u201cInternational investors will discuss the process of transferring bad loans which is being planned by banking officials and the government,\u201d another source said.

The loans in Turkey\u2019s banking sector amount to 2.5 trillion lira as of end-March, with 100 billion lira re-structured. The NPL ratio stands at 4.04 percent and is generally expected to rise to 6 percent by year-end, though some analysts predict it could double to 8 percent.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The central bank on Friday released the results of its second bank \u201cstress test\u201d for 2020, the first time it has put banks through their paces twice in one year since it began the annual health checks following the decade-ago financial crisis. The Fed had previously barred banks from buying back stock to help them build capital reserves during the coronavirus pandemic.  The relaxed restrictions were met quickly with announcements from some large firms, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, that they planned to buy back stock beginning in the new year.  The results of the second test of 2020, which the Fed pursued to reflect the severe economic impact of the pandemic, found that banks suffered more severe losses than under the previous, pre-pandemic test.  But months of building up reserves helped ensure they were positioned to weather the downturn well, with firms building capital reserves in 2020 despite setting aside nearly $100 billion in loan loss reserves.  The Fed found all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking those hypothetical losses, leading the central bank to relax its restrictions on capital payouts by banks, allowing them to buy back stock in the first quarter of 2021, after barring them in June.  \u201cThe banking system has been a source of strength during the past year and today\u2019s stress test results confirm that large banks could continue to lend to households and businesses even during a sharply adverse future turn in the economy,\u201d said Fed Vice Chairman Randal Quarles in a statement.  Under the new restrictions, a bank would be allowed to pay out dividends and buy back stock so long as such sums did not exceed its net income from the last year. The Fed also announced it would not use the new results to tweak how much it ordered each bank to hold as a \u201cstress capital buffer\u201d following the previous test results.  See FACTBOX for more on how this year\u2019s tests have changed  The new leeway from the Fed will send bank analysts off to calculate how much each bank might be able to spend on share buybacks in coming months based on their estimated fourth quarter earnings.  Shortly after the results were released, JPMorgan announced it would begin buying back stock in the first quarter under a new $30-billion repurchase program.  \u201cWe are pleased that the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s latest stress test demonstrate the resilience of the largest US financial institutions in the midst of a devastating pandemic. Based on the results and guidance from the Federal Reserve, we intend to resume share repurchases next quarter,\u201d said a Goldman Sachs spokesman in a statement.  Analysts will also be comparing details of loan losses that the Fed estimated with provisions the banks have made this year for losses they expect. Shares of banks that seem to have put aside more reserves than they will likely need could get a lift from the comparisons.","393":"FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.

(For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, tmsnrt.rs\/2HOVt1D)  \u201cThe Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they\u2019re saying about the economy,\u201d said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \u201cFlat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It\u2019s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.\u201d  The central bank\u2019s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth.  Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond\u2019s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits.  \u201cThat\u2019s why the estimates are going down,\u201d Carlson added. \u201c(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there\u2019s an underlying concern about loan growth.\u201d  In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks.  Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings \u201crecession\u201d that ended in 2016.  The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates.  In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter.  \u201cWithin financials, the industry that\u2019s been hit hardest is capital markets,\u201d said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. \u201cThose downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines\u201d in first-quarter earnings estimates.  But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated.  Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note \u201cto be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.\u201d But he called the impact from the Fed\u2019s decision \u201ca minor one,\u201d and wrote that aside from these impacts, \u201cbank fundamentals are remarkably stable.\u201d  Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data.  (For a graphic on 'U.S. banks beat\/miss track record' click, tmsnrt.rs\/2Vmv2DP)  In today\u2019s late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations.

The Southeast Asian nation has charged Goldman and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totalling $6.5 billion that the U.S. bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).  Mahathir said they have demanded $7.5 billion from Goldman and negotiations were ongoing.  \u201cWe would like to avoid having to go to the courts, but if they come up with a reasonable sum I think we will agree,\u201d Mahathir, 94, said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.  \u201cBut at the moment their offer is too small. We\u2019re continuing to talk with them to explain why they should pay what we demand. Of course it\u2019s not the full amount, that they may be able to bring down, but we think that we can reach some agreement at a later stage.\u201d  A spokesman for Goldman declined comment.  Mahathir said he hoped an agreement with Goldman would be reached \u201csoon\u201d.  \u201cYes, I want to achieve a settlement. We are progressing, if we fail then we\u2019ll go to the courts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot preempt by going to the courts.\u201d  Goldman said in October it was in discussions with authorities on a possible resolution of investigations relating to 1MDB.  The bank could separately end up paying less than $2 billion to U.S. authorities to resolve criminal and regulatory probes connected to the scandal, Bloomberg reported last week.  U.S. authorities say about $4.5 billion was siphoned from 1MDB, founded in 2009 by then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. The scandal helped Mahathir unexpectedly defeat Najib in a general election last year.  Mahathir said Malaysia would not agree to a settlement with fugitive financier Jho Low, accused of playing a central role in the scam. Low has consistently denied wrongdoing and says he does not expect a fair trial in Malaysia as long as Mahathir is in power.  \u201cWe think he is very guilty. We have proof of that,\u201d Mahathir said of Low. \u201cWe want to settle it according to the law.

FILE PHOTO: David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  Solomon made the comments in a voicemail sent to employees on Wednesday, weeks after U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers tied to the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1MDB, according to a transcript of a voicemail sent to employees on Wednesday which the bank gave to Reuters on Thursday.  The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, in 2009.  An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged. Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with alleged graft involving 1MDB.  Tim Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.  Roger Ng, the other charged former Goldman banker, was arrested in Malaysia at the request of U.S. authorities.  \u201cIt goes without saying that they (the former employees) violated the firm\u2019s policies and procedures and acted in conflict with all that we stand for,\u201d Solomon said in Wednesday\u2019s voicemail to Goldman staff.  Goldman has been under scrutiny for its role in helping 1MDB raise funds through bond offerings, from which it earned around $600 million in fees, an amount critics said exceeded the normal level for fees.  Goldman has previously said that it \u201ccontinues to cooperate with all authorities investigating this matter.\u201d It has denied any wrongdoing.  \u201c1MDB remains an ongoing investigation, and we will continue to work with the Department of Justice and other authorities to get to the bottom of what happened and to move forward,\u201d Solomon added in Wednesday\u2019s voice mail.  Malaysia\u2019s current Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday said Goldman\u2019s bankers \u201ccheated\u201d the country in dealings with the state fund, while Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said his country would seek a \u201cfull refund\u201d of fees the bank earned.  Goldman\u2019s shares have fallen nearly 10 percent since the U.S. prosecutors filed a lawsuit against two former Goldman bankers. The stock has fallen more than 20 percent this year.  While U.S. prosecutors have previously filed civil asset forfeiture suits for assets allegedly bought with some of the stolen funds, the action against the former Goldman bankers are the first criminal charges the Justice Department has brought against individuals in the case under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a federal law targeting official bribery abroad.  At least six countries, including Malaysia, the United States and Switzerland, have been investigating alleged thefts from 1MDB.  The 1MDB investigations in the United States and Malaysia have gathered pace since Najib unexpectedly lost a general election in May to Mahathir Mohamad, who returned to power 15 years after he retired as prime minister.

FILE PHOTO: Oil pours out of a spout from Edwin Drake's original 1859 well that launched the modern petroleum industry at the Drake Well Museum and Park in Titusville, Pennsylvania U.S., October 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Rattled by the recent downturn in the sector and long-term concerns over oil demand and the switch to renewables, Big Oil is facing an unprecedented challenge.  \u201cWe\u2019re firmly through that survival phase and the better capitalized players are now positioned to do well on the other side of it,\u201d Andrew Fry, global head of energy at Goldman said at the Oil & Money conference in London.  Companies typically seek to increase spending as they emerge from a downturn in order to capture low drilling costs and an expected supply shortage.  But this time round, the barriers for investments are high, with investors seeking returns of as much as 15 to 20 percent from multi-billion dollar oil and gas projects, Fry said.  \u201cIn the near term the focus is on returns as opposed to growth for the sake of growth,\u201d he said.  As a result, companies are currently focusing on buying back shares and paying dividends to investors with the excess cash they generate.  \u201cFor the first time since the downturn, the oil companies now have their balance sheets in order. They are all starting to think about growth but it is very conservative,\u201d James Janoskey, global co-head of oil and gas at JPMorgan, said.  \u201cWhen we came out of downturns in the past, we didn\u2019t have energy transition issues and there probably wasn\u2019t that much pressure from investors.\u201d  M&A  Capital expenditure among the world\u2019s top oil companies is expected to rise to $140 billion by 2021, from the current $100 billion, but will remain well below the $200 billion before the 2014 oil price collapse, according to Adam Brett, HSBC global head of natural resources advisory.  That means oil majors will show very healthy returns on capital invested, he added.  He said that even in the United States, where oil output has resumed spectacular growth on the back of high oil prices, large companies will try to maintain capital discipline and focus on returns rather than pure production growth.  \u201cFor Big Oil, value will prevail over volume,\u201d Brett said, adding that most remuneration reports now made clear that top executives at oil majors are being rewarded for delivering robust cash flows rather than production increases.  Acquisitions, another way to boost production and reserves, are also expected to be constrained and focused.  Energy mergers and acquisitions amounted to $360 billion last year and stand at $280 billion so far this year, said Brett.  Although the volume of M&A has been relatively stable in recent years, the structure has changed since China largely suspended its buying spree over the past three years, he said.  An anti-corruption drive and revisions of overly expensive deals have prompted China to cut down on buying resources around the world in the past three years.  Brett said that M&A were currently dominated by downstream and mid-stream transactions with the share of upstream declining to 35-40 percent, from as high as 60-70 percent when China was an active asset buyer.  \u201cYou see much more downstream M&A activity. And I expect this to continue in the years ahead,\u201d Brett said.","408":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N was sued on Thursday by a former managing director who said the Wall Street bank retaliated against him and fired him after he complained about its dealings with an unidentified, \"notorious European businessman.\"  FILE PHOTO: A view of the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S. on July 16, 2013.

DuVally referred to a filing with a U.S. brokerage regulator that said Goldman discharged Rollins after he allowed unauthorized trades by a counterparty that had been denied a trading account because of compliance concerns.  Lawyers for Rollins did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Rollins had been Goldman\u2019s co-head of trading execution for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Gucci\u2019s owner Kering said on Tuesday online sales increased nearly 50% in the first half of 2020. They now represent 13% of revenue, up from 6% last year.  Reopening physical outlets, even in the all-important mainland Chinese market, has not slowed the digital exuberance, says Kering. No wonder Italy\u2019s Moncler, whose puffer jackets sell for $1000 or more, announced on Monday plans to double online business within three years, from what analysts estimate is currently 10% of revenue.

The world\u2019s best-known maker of protective masks has an oddly high-end challenge: a flourishing grey market. 3M told investors on Tuesday that it is ploughing resources into hotlines, social media monitoring and lawsuits to combat price-gouging and counterfeiting. Demand for life-saving respirators has soared far beyond what it can supply. While the group\u2019s second-quarter revenue fell 12% year-on-year, sales of Covid-related masks grew by $225 million.  Luxury brands like Burberry and Louis Vuitton know the feeling. When a desire outpaces production, the market often finds a way. And winning back control comes at a cost. LVMH spent 43 million euros in 2019 on anti-counterfeiting. Burberry used to literally burn products to keep them out of dishonest hands. Of course, 3M can\u2019t do that. Moreover, it can\u2019t respond to demand by jacking up the price, as luxury houses do. That leaves it with the pitfalls of producing objects of desire, without one of the benefits.

GIC foresees major changes in the global investment environment as a result of higher debt. Major central banks will now accommodate periods of above-target inflation, even during economic upswings.

REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  Hong Kong is formulating new rules for early-stage drug developers in an effort to woo companies in the fast-growing sector - notably those in China - into choosing the city over New York, the traditional hub for initial public offerings from the industry.  Shanghai-based Hua, a diabetes-focused drug developer, had considered both locations but selected Hong Kong because of the city's proposed new listings regime, which Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing 0388.HK expects to have in place within a couple of months, said a source with direct knowledge of the deliberations.  Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is leading the transaction while CLSA, the offshore platform of China's Citic Securities600030.SS, is also working on the deal, the sources added. The company plans to go public in the second half of the year, said one of them.  Goldman and CLSA declined to comment. Hua didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Hua will be joining a slew of biotechs interested in Hong Kong\u2019s less-demanding listing rules. Other hopefuls include Shanghai Tasly Pharmaceutical, the biopharma unit of Tasly Pharmaceutical Group, Shanghai Henlius Biotec, a subsidiary of Fosun\u2019s pharmaceutical unit and U.S.-based cancer detection start-up Grail.  Hua\u2019s likely valuation and the size of the stake to be sold are not yet decided, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with the media. The company is also yet to decide whether to sell existing shares, new shares, or a combination of both, the people said.  The company\u2019s development pipeline includes a novel diabetes treatment which is expected to be approved in China by 2019, its chief financial officer George Lin told Reuters in December.  Many Chinese biotechs keen to float are at an early stage and as yet have no sales - a long-running hurdle for floats in Hong Kong, where its main listing rules demand profits as well as sales. Currently, China\u2019s securities laws do not allow firms that have yet to turn profitable to go public on the mainland.  Hong Kong\u2019s new rules are expected to allow so-called \u201cpre-revenue\u201d biotechs to list subject to certain extra criteria, including that the firms must have developed at least one core product beyond the concept stage. Applicants must also have a minimum market capitalization of HK$1.5 billion ($191.30 million).  The plans are part of HKEX\u2019s broader move to attract blockbuster Chinese \u201cnew economy\u201d companies, from biopharma firms to online retailers.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of the Sydney offices of Goldman Sachs in Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo  After months of patience and private lobbying, the U.S. investment bank has decided it can no longer wait for clarity from lawmakers on how its business might be impacted by Britain\u2019s exit from the trading bloc and is taking the steps to minimize disruption to clients.  It has informed members of its London-based derivatives and debt capital markets teams working on German accounts that their activities will be relocated to its base in Frankfurt and to make the necessary preparations to move to those offices by end-June, the sources told Reuters.  Several members of those teams have already negotiated and signed new German employment contracts, one of the sources added. Goldman declined to comment.  Goldman\u2019s decision to reissue some staff contracts and set a timeline to move teams to the continent marks one of the first tangible signs that banks are starting to execute on Brexit contingency plans after British Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out retaining passporting rights for financial services.  The loss of these passporting rights - which currently enable finance firms to freely offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states via just one local license - is a key concern for banks such as Goldman.  It is unclear how deeply the loss of those privileges will affect London-based bankers, but Goldman felt that an initial relocation of a small number of staff providing such services was the best way to protect clients, one of the sources said.  The bank has been looking to expand its workforce in Frankfurt to 400, a third source said, as part of a strategy to increase its presence more broadly across the continent.  Jens Hofmann will assume responsibility for the bank\u2019s Financing Group activities for Germany, Austria and Switzerland and will relocate to Frankfurt from London, the third source said.  The imminent relocations are set to ring alarm bells among British financial regulators hoping that banks will hold back on any \u201cirreversible\u201d steps, given that Britain and the EU aim to agree a transition deal this month to keep business as usual between Brexit Day on March 29, 2019 until the end of 2020.  PRIMARY DEALERS  Banking sources said last year that EU officials could impose rules to require investment banks to move positions from London to continental Europe if they want to retain their role as primary dealers for EU governments after Brexit.  Primary dealers help national governments manage their borrowing by buying bonds from them in auctions and selling these on to investors. It\u2019s high-profile work that helps banks win other public and private sector business in those countries.  In January, the president of Morgan Stanley MS.N, Colm Kelleher, said his bank would make its decisions about redeploying staff \"very early this year\".  Goldman Sachs backed the ill-fated campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, arguing that the UK\u2019s thriving financial services industry and the two million people it employs would be significant casualties of Britain\u2019s decision to leave.  Since the 2016 vote, the bank has reiterated its commitment to London and pledged to keep its primary European base in the UK irrespective of the nature of Brexit.  It is midway through a multi-million pound development of a new headquarters building in London and, like other U.S. investment banks, continues to recruit more staff in the capital than anywhere else in Europe.","421":"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Roger Ng, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker caught up in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fraud scandal, will be allowed to return to the United States to face criminal charges against him there, a Malaysian court ruled on Friday.

Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. Class actions can allow plaintiffs to seek larger recoveries at lower cost than if they sued individually.  The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and other investors from February 2007 to June 2010 claimed to have lost more than $13 billion because Goldman had in regulatory filings and public comments overstated its ability to manage conflicts.  They said Goldman did this while concealing short positions that the Wall Street bank or hedge fund manager John Paulson had made in four subprime mortgage collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).  These CDOs included Abacus 2007 AC-1, the centerpiece of a probe that led to Goldman\u2019s $550 million settlement of civil claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.

Back in 1987, when the U.S. Supreme Court was contemplating the fraud-on-the-market principle that is the framework for securities fraud class actions, the Justice Department, on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed an amicus brief in Basic v. Levinson, advising the justices to adopt the presumption that in an efficient market, shareholders rely on a defendant\u2019s misrepresentations.  A quarter-century later, when the Supreme Court revisited the Basic presumption in 2014\u2019s Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund, DOJ and the SEC reminded that justices that the government relies on investor class actions to help police the market. DOJ filed its Halliburton amicus brief in support of shareholders, arguing that the Supreme Court should leave intact the Basic fraud-on-the-market presumption.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  The Justice Department and the SEC weighed in Monday in Goldman Sachs v. Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, the Supreme Court case that Goldman Sachs has billed as the most important shareholder class action to come before the justices since Halliburton. I\u2019ll admit: The government\u2019s brief surprised me. DOJ and the SEC are backing shareholders on some key points, as I\u2019ll explain. But the government is also urging the Supreme Court to vacate the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision certifying investors as a class, arguing that the justices should instruct lower courts to consider the nature of a defendant\u2019s alleged misrepresentations at the class certification stage of shareholder class actions.  The government said the 2nd Circuit may have viewed the bank\u2019s evidence too narrowly \u2013 and it wants the Supreme Court to adopt Goldman\u2019s position that defendants should be permitted to rebut the presumption of reliance by arguing generic statements didn\u2019t impact share price.  In case you\u2019re wondering, the brief was signed by the Biden administration\u2019s acting Solicitor General, Elizabeth Prelogar, as well as career lawyers from the SEC and Justice Department. (One of the signers is deputy solicitor general Malcolm Stewart, who argued for the government when the Supreme Court heard the Halliburton case.)  As you probably know if you\u2019ve been reading my many, many stories about the Goldman securities case, the bank\u2019s shareholders allege that Goldman lied when it said in public statements before the mortgage crisis that it put customers\u2019 interests before those of the bank and that it strived to avoid conflicts. Those statements, according to shareholders, were proven false by revelations that Goldman sold doomed-to-fail collateralized debt securities, including the notorious Abacus CDO that led to a $550 million settlement between the bank and the SEC. Shareholders claim Goldman shares' value plunged \u2013 by as much as $13 billion \u2013 when investors realized the falsity of the bank\u2019s assurances of principled business practices.  Goldman, which denied deceiving investors, argued during class certification proceedings that its allegedly fraudulent statements of business principles had no impact on the company\u2019s share price. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 ruling in the Halliburton case permits defendants to defeat class certification by breaking the link between alleged misrepresentations and a drop in the defendant\u2019s stock. Goldman offered expert evidence that it was news of a government investigation of the bank\u2019s CDOs \u2013 and not investors\u2019 loss of faith in the bank\u2019s generic statements about avoiding conflicts \u2013 that erased billions from its market capitalization. Anodyne statements of principle, the bank argued, simply can\u2019t be the basis of a shareholder class action because no reasonable investor places any value on them.  The majority in a divided 2nd Circuit opinion rejected Goldman\u2019s argument, reminding the bank that in 2013\u2019s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Systems, the Supreme Court said investors don\u2019t have to prove the materiality of a defendant's misrepresentations in order to be certified as a class. Goldman, the 2nd Circuit majority said, was trying to \u201csmuggle\u201d materiality into the class certification stage of the litigation by arguing that generic statements can\u2019t underlie shareholder class actions.  In DOJ\u2019s new Supreme Court brief, the government told the justices that it believes Goldman overreached in the lower courts when it argued that generic statements should be considered immaterial as a matter of law. The 2nd Circuit correctly rejected that argument, the DOJ brief said.  The government also agreed that the 2nd Circuit applied the correct standard of proof in evaluating Goldman Sachs\u2019 evidence rebutting the price impact of its alleged misstatements. The bank has asked the Supreme Court to hold that defendants must only show by a preponderance of evidence that their misstatements didn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s share price. The 2nd Circuit said defendants bear a burden of persuasion to rebut the presumption that shareholders relied on fraudulent statements. The government\u2019s amicus brief urged the justices to confirm that more stringent standard.  But DOJ agreed with Goldman\u2019s lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Sullivan & Cromwell that, despite Amgen, lower courts can consider the nature of a defendant\u2019s alleged falsehoods when they\u2019re deciding whether to certify a shareholder class. That inquiry, the brief said, might overlap with the court\u2019s consideration of the materiality of the statements, which is not a matter to be determined in class certification litigation. But the overlap, DOJ said, doesn\u2019t mean courts should ignore the nature of the alleged misrepresentations in weighing their impact on share price.  \u201cEspecially if the other evidence about price impact (is) conflicting or ambiguous, evidence about the nature of the misstatement \u2014 i.e., evidence about whether the misstatement involved the sort of information that was inherently likely to affect the market price \u2014 might reasonably influence the court\u2019s determination whether the defendant had disproved price impact by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d the DOJ brief said.  It\u2019s not clear, the government said, whether the 2nd Circuit majority took into account that Goldman is accused of deceiving investors in generic, anodyne statements of business principles. To the extent that the majority meant to suggest that any consideration of the generic quality of the statements was impermissible under Amgen, DOJ said, the 2nd Circuit was wrong.  The Supreme Court, DOJ said, should vacate the 2nd Circuit ruling and instruct lower courts that they may consider the nature of the alleged misstatements as relevant evidence reviewing defendants\u2019 rebuttal evidence.  I\u2019m sure shareholders\u2019 Supreme Court counsel from Goldstein & Russell will argue in their merits brief that the DOJ brief underscores that plaintiffs have already won the battle against any Supreme Court ruling that generic corporate statements cannot, as a matter of law, be the basis of a shareholder class action. And, as I mentioned, DOJ is also siding with plaintiffs on defendants\u2019 burden.  But shareholders\u2019 lead counsel from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd were gearing up for a potential trial against Goldman Sachs before this 11-year-old case went to the Supreme Court. And now the government is calling for the justices to send it back to the 2nd Circuit for another look at class certification. That can\u2019t be good news.  (This story has been corrected. A previous version incorrectly reported that the Justice Department agreed with Goldman Sachs that the 2nd Circuit viewed the bank\u2019s evidence too narrowly.)","426":"Feb 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Monday Stefan Bollinger will take charge as co-head of its private wealth management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England back into a national lockdown from Thursday as a second wave of infections threatened to overwhelm the health service. The move brought England into alignment with France and Germany which imposed nationwide restrictions early last week.  U.S. investment bank Goldman said it expects the euro area\u2019s real gross domestic product (GDP) to shrink 2.3% in the fourth quarter, a sharp reversal from its earlier projection of 2.2% growth. Similarly, it cut UK GDP growth forecasts to minus 2.4% from a 3.6% expansion it had earlier expected.  \u201cLooking ahead, we assume that the new restrictions will last for three months before they are gradually rolled back starting in February,\u201d the bank\u2019s economists wrote in a note to clients.  Morgan Stanley called for a modest GDP contraction for the euro area during the fourth quarter, while cutting its UK GDP growth forecast to minus 3% from minus 0.2%.  \u201cWe now see a more complex W-shaped recovery, in place of our previous assumption of an asymmetric V,\u201d said Morgan Stanley, sticking to its expectations for the euro area economy to recover to pre-Covid levels in the second quarter of 2022.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Portuguese bank Novo Banco is seen on one of its offices in downtown Lisbon, Portugal, March 31, 2016. REUTERS\/Rafael Marchante\/File Photo  The decision, announced by the court on its website, sets a precedent that could help Portugal fend off other lawsuits involving major bondholders in BES, such as Pimco and Blackrock, which have challenged similar decisions by the Portuguese central bank in 2015 not to transfer liabilities to Novo Banco.  The loan arranged by Goldman Sachs GS.N was extended to BES by Luxembourg-based vehicle Oak Finance in 2014, shortly before the bank went bankrupt under the weight of the debts of its founding family, and Goldman has sought compensation from Novo Banco, which took over the healthy operations of BES.  Britain\u2019s Supreme Court said it unanimously rejected the appeal, even though the original loan agreement was governed by English law. Novo Banco declined to comment.  After the collapse of BES in August 2014, Portugal\u2019s central bank transferred some assets and liabilities to Novo Banco, which took over BES operations after an injection of about 5 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of public funds. It was acquired last year by U.S. private equity firm Lone Star.  In December 2014, the central bank specified the Goldman Sachs loan was not eligible for the transfer and had never been transferred, to which Goldman objected.  The court said it understood \u201cthat an English court must treat the Oak liability as never having been transferred to Novo Banco. It was therefore never party to the jurisdiction clause.\u201d  It added there were ongoing administrative law proceedings in Portugal challenging the December 2014 decision, which have not yet been resolved.  A range of other lawsuits by bondholders in BES and Novo Banco also challenge a central bank decision at the end of 2015 to transfer more than 2 billion euros of bonds from the rescued Novo Bank back to BES, which is being liquidated.  London-based hedge fund Winterbrook Capital said last week it considered several notes issued by Novo Banco to be in default as a results of the resolution measures taken by Portugal\u2019s central bank in 2014 and 2015.  Despite the warning, Novo Banco placed 400 million euros worth of subordinated debt notes just two days later on June 29, its first issue since the rescue, to strong investor demand.

Ramaphosa\u2019s reform drive suffered a setback last month when data showed the economy entered recession in the second quarter, but he has since unveiled a \u201cstimulus and recovery plan\u201d to try to get it back on track.  Coleman said in an interview that this was a \u201cshot in the arm\u201d which had encouraged investors by giving certainty on mining and visa rules and by emphasizing skills development and education, areas where South Africa lags other African states.  \u201cPart of the reason why Goldman Sachs is quite bullish on our ability to get back to 2.8 percent growth next year and 3.2 percent in 2020 is that the global backdrop is constructive. The two largest economies, USA and China, are doing well,\u201d added Coleman, who heads Goldman\u2019s Johannesburg office.  Since the upbeat mood that accompanied Ramaphosa\u2019s replacement of Jacob Zuma in February, business confidence has fallen as the scale of the challenges facing him became clear.  LIQUIDITY CHALLENGE  One area of particular concern has been struggling state-owned firms, several of which were embroiled in corruption scandals during Zuma\u2019s nine years in power and which have been grappling with severe liquidity challenges.

Hong Kong is formulating new rules for early-stage drug developers in an effort to woo companies in the fast-growing sector - notably those in China - into choosing the city over New York, the traditional hub for initial public offerings from the industry.  Shanghai-based Hua, a diabetes-focused drug developer, had considered both locations but selected Hong Kong because of the city\u2019s proposed new listings regime, which Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing expects to have in place within a couple of months, said a source with direct knowledge of the deliberations.  Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is leading the transaction while CLSA, the offshore platform of China\u2019s Citic Securities, is also working on the deal, the sources added. The company plans to go public in the second half of the year, said one of them.  Hua, Goldman and CLSA didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Hua will be joining a slew of biotechs interested in Hong Kong\u2019s less-demanding listing rules. Other hopefuls include Shanghai Tasly Pharmaceutical, the biopharma unit of Tasly Pharmaceutical Group, Shanghai Henlius Biotec, a subsidiary of Fosun\u2019s pharmaceutical unit and U.S.-based cancer detection start-up Grail.  Hua\u2019s likely valuation and the size of the stake to be sold are not yet decided, said the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with the media. The company is also yet to decide whether to sell existing shares, new shares, or a combination of both, the people said.  The company\u2019s development pipeline includes a novel diabetes treatment which is expected to be approved in China by 2019, its chief financial officer George Lin told Reuters in December.  Many Chinese biotechs keen to float are at an early stage and as yet have no sales - a long-running hurdle for floats in Hong Kong, where its main listing rules demand profits as well as sales. Currently, China\u2019s securities laws do not allow firms that have yet to turn profitable to go public on the mainland.  Hong Kong\u2019s new rules are expected to allow so-called \u201cpre-revenue\u201d biotechs to list subject to certain extra criteria, including that the firms must have developed at least one core product beyond the concept stage. Applicants must also have a minimum market capitalisation of HK$1.5 billion ($191.30 million). The plans are part of HKEX\u2019s broader move to attract blockbuster Chinese \u201cnew economy\u201d companies, from biopharma firms to online retailers.  Chinese immunotherapy company BeiGene, Shanghai-based Zai Lab and Hutchison China MediTech, are all listed on Nasdaq, previously the preferred listing venue for mostly as-yet unprofitable biotech drug developers.

The bank, like its rivals, is facing several challenges in growing its revenue in the face of rising geopolitical uncertainties and concerns about the impact of future interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Goldman is also shifting its business model away from a focus on trading to a more stable, consumer-focused revenue stream.  Revenue fell at three of its four major businesses, with the biggest declines in trading and investment management.  Institutional client revenue, which includes trading, slipped 3%, while investment banking revenue was down 9%. However, revenue from the bank\u2019s investing and lending business rose 16%.  \u201cGiven the strength of our client franchise, we are well positioned to benefit from a growing global economy,\u201d Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said in a statement.  While revenue slipped in the quarter, lower compensation expenses provided some relief. Total operating expenses were nearly flat at $6.12 billion.  The bank is aiming to generate $5 billion in new revenue by 2020, and is currently undergoing a front-to-back review of all its businesses started last October when Solomon took control as CEO.  While the final strategy is not expected until early next year, the bank has already made moves to expand its consumer division, by growing online bank Marcus and launching a credit card with Apple Inc. It also announced plans in May to acquire United Capital, a boutique wealth management firm.  The bank\u2019s net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 6% to $2.20 billion in the quarter ended June 30. Earnings per share fell to $5.81 from $5.98 a year earlier.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The Wall Street bank set a lofty-sounding target of $750 billion. The figure is a mix of loans, underwriting, advisory services and investments related to projects Goldman expects to be involved with by 2030.  It reflects the total size of loans, deals and other arrangements Goldman expects to perform as a bank or intermediary with companies and projects focused on renewable energy, sustainable transportation, affordable education and several other areas, the bank said.  Goldman also implemented a formal ban on financing certain drilling and coal activities.  The moves come as pressure from activists and some investors has ratcheted up globally on banks\u2019 activities financing fossil fuels or other sectors that have come into the political crosshairs, like gun makers. Banks have also faced more scrutiny over their role in increasing economic inequality by catering to wealthy customers while shunning patrons who need access to financial services to better their lives.  Goldman catered almost exclusively to the elite until it was forced to rethink its business model in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In recent years, management decided to launch a retail bank and has tried to spruce up Goldman\u2019s image among Main Street consumers.  On a call with reporters, Goldman executives declined to break down specifics about the $750 billion target in terms of revenue or the bank\u2019s own exposure.

The Global Markets Division Sustainable Solutions Council\u2019s roughly 20 members will meet every few weeks to share information about strategies and what is working for trading teams based across the Americas, Europe and Asia, said Stacy Selig, co-head of Goldman\u2019s global markets structuring and solutions business.  \u201cThe council pulls together a collection of people who have the perfect expertise to share information more widely across the division and firm,\u201d Selig said in an interview with Reuters.

Investing research firm Morningstar Inc said in early April that sustainable equity funds and ESG-tilted index funds did suffer large losses during the first quarter because of the coronavirus outbreak, but that returns at most of these funds held up better than returns from conventional funds.  Selig said the bank\u2019s institutional investors have put more money into sustainable portfolios since ESG funds showed resilience during recent market turmoil.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The new targets, to be outlined by Chief Executive David Solomon\u2019s management team in January at Goldman\u2019s first-ever investor day, could include a broad efficiency ratio and profitability measures, four sources familiar with the matter said.  They could also include narrower items, such as goals for Goldman\u2019s fledgling retail bank, Marcus, according to some of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The change of focus signals that Goldman wants to match rivals that disclose progress toward broader targets, and satisfy demand among investors for transparency across all the bank\u2019s businesses, according to the sources, who cautioned that plans for the investor day are still taking shape and could change.  The shift also illustrates how, under pressure from investors unhappy with a near-20% fall in its share price since March last year, Goldman is having to overhaul the way it communicates with shareholders.  \u201cRight now the story is we\u2019re Goldman Sachs, trust us and we\u2019ll generate good returns. The collective investment community is saying that doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. \u201cThey need to provide something that increases confidence so, for the first time ever, they\u2019re going to lift the curtain behind the scenes at Goldman Sachs.\u201d  Goldman declined to comment on the $5 billion goal or what new targets might be unveiled at the investor event in January. It referred Reuters to an interview on Tuesday in which Solomon said there would be no major disclosures.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got very, very good businesses that we\u2019re very proud of and we\u2019d like to evolve those businesses a little bit. I wouldn\u2019t expect any big reveal,\u201d he told Bloomberg TV.  The $5 billion target was at one time a crucial benchmark for whether Goldman could transform itself from a Wall Street trading house with stalling profits into a more diversified bank with potential to grow, analysts said.  In the early days of his tenure it was also an important metric for Solomon, who took the reins from longtime CEO Lloyd Blankfein in October 2018. The 57-year-old was a key architect of Goldman\u2019s overhaul plan in his prior role as operating chief, sources within the bank said.  Goldman executives said a year ago that the bank was ahead of schedule on the $5 billion goal.  There is a lot of appetite among investors for information about Goldman\u2019s progress reducing its reliance on unpredictable trading revenues and growing more stable businesses, some analysts said.  Solomon had initially planned to launch a strategic update in the spring of 2019. But he postponed it until January, saying he wanted to get it right rather than rush it.  Goldman has had little choice but to re-invent itself.  The bank\u2019s profits were stifled by tougher regulations after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, changing customer preferences and technology shifts that made some businesses less profitable.  Goldman was also more skewed than its rivals toward trading, and it has seen pretax earnings in that part of the business fall 84% from 2009 to 2018, according to regulatory filings. Those profits are down another 7% so far this year.

Goldman, which was not even among the top ten brokers in Saudi Arabia in April, handled 18.6% of trades by value and 12.3% by volume in May, according to data from Tadawul, the Saudi bourse.  It was followed by HSBC Saudi Arabia, which handled 9.4% of trades by value last month.  In 2017, Goldman received approval to trade equities in Saudi Arabia, joining the growing band of western investment banks and fund managers expanding in the kingdom.  \u201cThey managed to make inroads to both local and foreign businesses,\u201d said a financial industry executive.

Goldman has said it may seek to expand its consumer bank through acquisitions or even buying a traditional lender.

Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  The commodities trading business was once one of Goldman\u2019s largest, most active units and a significant driver of profits earned by the Wall Street bank until tighter regulation curbed the risks it could take on proprietary bets.  Cuts were accelerated as competition with trading houses and oil majors increased and as profits shrank.  Three out of the 10 people being let go held senior roles or managing director positions within the company\u2019s commodities unit, a source with knowledge of the cuts said.  The cuts are global and will involve merging the commodities unit\u2019s metals trading desks, the source said.  Banks do not disclose their commodities revenues but financial analytics firm Coalition estimates the top 12 banks generated commodities trading revenue of less than $4 billion in 2018, down from nearly $16 billion in 2008.  Fixed income, currencies and commodities revenues across all major investment banks dropped to their lowest levels seen since the financial crisis in the final quarter of 2018, the Coalition data showed, with oil trading suffering significant declines across the year.  Goldman launched a months-long review of the commodities division to evaluate its profitability and the use of capital.  The review began under Goldman\u2019s previous chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, who was once a commodity trader himself and was seen as a big supporter of the division, but was completed under the new chief, David Solomon, who has never traded commodities.  The review showed the business was using too much capital for too little profit, the Wall Street Journal reported in February, citing people familiar with the matter.

FILE PHOTO: A trader works at the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, April 16, 2012. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said serious lapses and deficiencies in management controls at Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. had contributed to the misappropriation of $2.6 billion raised by the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.  1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) raised the funds in three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013.  A Goldman Sachs spokesman said the Wall Street bank would issue a statement in due course.  The 1MDB scandal has been a costly and long-running sore for the U.S investment bank, though there are signs it may be close to drawing a line under the affair.  In July, Goldman agreed to pay $3.9 billion to settle Malaysia\u2019s criminal probe and this week it is expected to agree to pay more than $2 billion to settle U.S. charges over its role in the scandal.  Malaysian and U.S. authorities estimate $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials in the fund, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman staff and others.  The three bond offerings, which raised a combined $6.5 billion, were arranged and underwritten by UK-based Goldman Sachs International, with work conducted by deal team members in multiple jurisdictions, who shared the revenue generated.  The SFC said Goldman Sachs Asia, the bank\u2019s Hong Kong-based compliance and control hub for the region, had significant involvement in the origination, approval, execution and sales process of the three bond offerings.  The bank\u2019s Asia hub had earned $210 million from the offerings, the largest share among the various Goldman entities.  \u201cThis enforcement action is the result of a rigorous, independent investigation conducted by the SFC,\u201d said Ashley Alder, the SFC\u2019s chief executive.  RED FLAGS  The 1MDB bond deals were obtained for Goldman by its banker Tim Leissner, who in August 2018 admitted here that he had conspired with Malaysian financier Jho Low and others to pay bribes and kickbacks to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials to obtain and retain the business from 1MDB for the bank.  Low denies any wrongdoing.  U.S. court documents show Low was rejected as a private wealth management client on several occasions as his source of wealth could not be verified, resulting in a potential money laundering risk.  Nonetheless, Goldman\u2019s regional and firm-wide committees that vetted the bond offerings accepted Leissner\u2019s false assertions that Low had no roles in the bond offerings without making further inquiries, the SFC said.  \u201cApart from the involvement of Low, there were a number of red flags present in the bond transactions which should have called for a closer examination of the corruption and money laundering risks involved,\u201d its statement of disciplinary action said.  These included the fact that the amount raised far exceeded the actual needs of 1MDB, and the sovereign wealth fund\u2019s willingness to pay high fees and repeated emphasis on confidentiality and speed of execution, the SFC said.  \u201cDespite the scrutiny of the bond transactions by various regional and firm-wide committees, ... these issues had not been looked into in-depth and properly addressed before the deals were approved.\u201d  Thursday\u2019s fine from the SFC dwarfed the previous record of $51 million, which it levied on a private banking unit of HSBC in 2017, and on UBS last year.","451":"BOSTON\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended investors cast advisory votes against the pay of top Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N leaders, putting millions of dollars of compensation under scrutiny at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has led to soaring unemployment.

Technically the pay was awarded for Goldman\u2019s performance in 2019, a period for which Solomon\u2019s total compensation rose 19% to $24.7 million, including a $7.65 million bonus.  But in practice many investors will also evaluate the pay in the context of the current economic crisis stemming from the pandemic, said Yonat Assayag, partner at pay consultant ClearBridge Compensation Group.  A stunning 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since mid-March, according to the latest Labor Department figures released on Thursday, wiping out all the jobs gained during the longest employment boom in U.S. history.  \u201cShareholders will have that in their minds,\u201d Assayag said. She added, \u201cThat\u2019s where it becomes a bit of a conundrum, because the decisions for bonuses were based on prior year\u2019s financial results.\u201d  As a cash crunch takes hold, hundreds of executives at other U.S. companies across nearly every economic sector have taken salary cuts and outlined further pay reviews as the scope of the crisis becomes clear.  Top banks in late March sought to reassure staff that they would not cut jobs.  And last week, Goldman executives said they were focused on controlling costs and may reevaluate the \u201ctiming, magnitude and pace\u201d of expenses and investments this year.  ISS wrote that its concerns about Goldman \u201care underscored by a significantly increased CEO bonus for a period when several key financial metrics were down year-over-year.\u201d The company\u2019s pay programs appear to give its directors too much discretion, ISS wrote.  Goldman Sachs spokesman Patrick Scanlan said the bank\u2019s compensation structure incentivized long-term growth and the meeting of financial targets, and did not place \u201cundue emphasis on shorter term results.\u201d  \u201cCompensation for 2019 reflects the significant achievements of our executives, including the development of a long-term growth strategy, implementation of a new operating approach, and consistent, solid net revenue performance,\u201d Scanlan said.  Solomon\u2019s 2019 raise stood out among compensation packages for CEOs at top U.S. banks.  Though the banks mostly ended the year with near-record profits, executive compensation remained stagnant as boards became more cost-conscious, reflecting a weaker revenue outlook.  JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N raised its CEO's pay by 1.6%, while Bank of America BAC.N and Citigroup C.N held CEO pay flat. ISS has recommended investors support pay proposals at the latter two banks, while its report for JPMorgan is not yet out.  ISS recommended Goldman investors vote with management on other items, including backing the election of all directors, including Solomon.","452":"A former senior Goldman Sachs Group Inc in-house attorney suing the bank for allegedly covering up sexual misconduct claims in its legal department has landed a new job, joining electronic discovery software provider Compliance as general counsel.

Najib, who is on bail after being sentenced to 12 years in jail in July on charges of corruption and money laundering, is expected to appeal the conviction in February and faces four more trials related to the scandal.  The U.S. Justice Department has said about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which Najib co-founded in 2009, including some funds Goldman had helped raise for the firm.  In a court filing in New York, Najib said Goldman Sachs and its former Southeast Asia chairman, Tim Leissner, probably had evidence that 1MDB officials schemed to defraud the fund and were now falsely implicating him to avoid responsibility.  Najib added that efforts by Leissner and others to hide the money trail misled him to believe that 1MDB funds that went into his accounts were political donations from the Saudi royal family.  \u201cThis effort spanned continents and multiple jurisdictions, included the deployment of an array of shell companies, and involved numerous individuals,\u201d Najib said in the filing.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  HONG KONG (Reuters) - Global financial firms including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and Fidelity International are poised to add hundreds of staff in China this year as they look to take advantage of the opening up of its $40 trillion financial sector.  Beijing in the last one-and-a-half years stepped up the pace of liberalisation mainly as part of a trade deal with the United States, and allowed foreigners to fully own their local ventures in areas including investment banking and asset management.  After having won regulatory approval to raise holdings and dealt with the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Western firms are now readying plans to boost their onshore presence, representatives and headhunters said.  Foreign financial firms have long coveted a bigger presence in China, and their expansion comes against the backdrop of a revival in its economy, increased onshore deal activities, and a rapid pace of wealth creation.  Goldman is leading the charge of the Wall Street banks operating in China - the first to move towards taking full ownership of its securities business after it was fully opened up to foreigners last April.  It aims to hire 70 staff in China in 2021, a Goldman spokesman said, as it seeks to double headcount to 600 by 2024. The bank has about 400 staff now and the new hiring round will target investment bankers, brokers, analysts and technology staff.  Fidelity tripled its office space in Shanghai in September to accommodate a fast-growing workforce as it prepares to launch its wholly owned mutual fund unit after China scrapped foreign ownership caps in the sector last year.  The fund manager plans to expand its workforce to about 100 people in China this year, not including its operation and technology centre in Dalian, the company told Reuters. That compares with just 45 people at the start of 2020.  \u201cWe hope to hire high-end talents with both global perspective and local insight, which is in short supply in the current market,\u201d it said.  BlackRock, which is setting up a 51%-controlled wealth management venture with Temasek Holdings and China Construction Bank Corp 601939.SS in China, is hiring at least a dozen senior roles for the business, according to global recruiting site Glassdoor.  Vacancies include vice president of trading, vice president of marketing strategy, head of risk and quantitative analysis and fund operation manager, according to newly posted job ads over the past month.  BlackRock declined to comment.  TALENT WAR  Besides opening up of its financial sectors for foreigners, Beijing also initiated a slew of reforms in the last couple of years across capital markets, asset management and insurance businesses, boosting the earnings prospects of Western firms.  That has also resulted in increased activities in the Chinese financial market - Shanghai\u2019s Nasdaq-style STAR Market was ranked fourth last year in the global bourses league table with $20.3 billion worth of deals in 2020, according to Refinitiv.  The hiring plans have raised the prospect of a talent war with most looking to raid other foreign firms in China. Some of them are also looking to tap into their existing staff in other locations to build out their China workforce.  Goldman, for example, is planning to hire domestically while also tapping overseas talent networks to find the 70 new staff, the spokesman said.  UBS China country head David Chin said the jostle to hire staff by Western financial firms had not only triggered a talent war but meant banks had to work hard to stop their staff being poached by rivals.  UBS said in January it was planning to double its investment banking workforce in three to five years.  \u201cOf course, we regularly transfer employees from Hong Kong to China but it needs to be done in a measured way. Many Hong Kong employees are not the best fit for mainland China, so the number of prospective candidates is limited,\u201d Chin said.","461":"Nov 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Thursday it has invited 60 executives to become partners, effective Jan. 1, 2021, making it one of the bank\u2019s smallest batches since the mid-1990s.

Analysts had expected a profit of $4.45 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Analysts said the bank handily beat consensus expectations when taking into account one-time items.

The biggest line-item gain was the $1.2 billion of M&A advisory fees Goldman reported.  The bank\u2019s $1.6 billion of quarterly equities trading revenue was up 17 percent, with bond trading revenue dropping 18 percent to $822 million. Goldman took in more than $6 billion in quarterly bond-trading revenue at the business\u2019s peak.  Goldman tends to be more sensitive to market fluctuations than peers that have large, stable revenue streams from other businesses.  Even so, Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N reported similar trends this week, with their bond trading down 15 percent to 21 percent. The industry also reported declines in stock and bond underwriting revenue, which was expected.  Under Solomon\u2019s plan, Goldman is trying to look more like its rivals by growing its fledgling consumer bank, expanding further into wealth management and building a corporate cash management business.  Growing deposits from consumers and businesses will also help Goldman lessen its cost of funding. The bank has so far gathered $35 billion in deposits from its Marcus consumer business, including $7 billion from its recent expansion into the United Kingdom, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on the call.  Despite its efforts, Goldman\u2019s shares have been underperforming peers due to worries about its possible exposure to 1MDB-related costs.  \u201cThe 1MDB situation is like the real hold up for people right now,\u201d said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr.  The bank added $844 million to its legal and regulatory provisions last year, more than four times what it set aside in 2017, though it did not specify the purpose.  Goldman\u2019s stock has fallen 30 percent over the last 12 months, and is trading at a discount to its tangible book value.

After a string of weak economic indicators, culminating in a fall in the central bank\u2019s IBC-BR economic activity for March, they lowered their first-quarter gross domestic product growth forecast to -0.1% from +0.2% and their 2019 forecast to +1.2% from +1.7%.  \u201cThe economy continues to operate with a very high degree of slack in terms of resource utilization,\u201d Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American economic research at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote in a note on Wednesday.  \u201cProgress towards fiscal consolidation ... remains ... quintessential to anchor market sentiment, support consumer and business sentiment, and leverage what has been so far a very shallow and disappointing recovery,\u201d he said.  Ramos and colleagues revised their outlook immediately after the central bank\u2019s monthly IBC-BR economic activity index showed a stronger-than-expected fall in March, giving a 0.68% decline in the Jan-March period.  Not only have first-quarter indicators been much weaker than anticipated, survey indicators continue to point towards sluggish activity in the second quarter. Echoing central bank policymakers, Ramos also said there will be a \u201cnegative statistical carry\u201d over into the April-June quarter from Jan-March.  On Tuesday the central bank said there was a \u201crelevant probability\u201d that GDP contracted in the first quarter, and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said the government will cut its 2019 growth forecast to 1.5% from 2.2%.  Goldman\u2019s 2019 GDP growth forecast of 1.2% is lower than the average market consensus of around 1.5%, and barely above the 1.1% growth registered in 2018 and 2017.

Plea negotiations are not yet on the agenda, a lawyer for Ng and a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice said. Instead, they plan to only discuss scheduling for case proceedings at a Brooklyn federal court.  Prosecutors and Ng\u2019s lawyer, in a May 6 court document related to the case, requested delaying the trial date for Ng because they believed plea negotiations \u201care likely to result in a disposition of this case without trial.\u201d  The U.S. Department of Justice accused 46-year-old Ng last year of conspiring to launder money and bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi through bond offerings that Goldman Sachs handled. He was extradited on May 3 to New York from Kuala Lumpur, where he had been jailed since November.  Ng pleaded not guilty to the charges on May 6 and was released in exchange for a $20 million bond.  Government lawyers have said they hope to avoid a trial by reaching a plea deal, though Ng\u2019s attorney, Marc Agnifilo said this month it was too early to tell.  Ng, who left Goldman Sachs in 2014, faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the three charges based on alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Malaysia\u2019s home minister wanted Ng to face criminal charges there first, but agreed to temporarily surrender him to the United States for 10 months, Malaysia\u2019s attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said in a statement.  The period may be extended, Thomas has said.  The 1MDB case has shaken Goldman Sachs, which is also being probed by the Justice Department for its role as underwriter and arranger for some $6.5 billion worth of 1MDB bond offerings.  Prosecutors estimated that high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates misappropriated $4.5 billion between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used.  Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales.  Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs banker, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB. Leissner has pleaded guilty.  Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has consistently denied wrongdoing through spokesmen.  Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak.  Najib, who lost a general election last year, faces 42 criminal charges related to losses at 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty.

To combat air pollution, the United Nations\u2019 shipping agency has set global regulations to cap sulfur content in marine fuel at 0.5 percent from 2020, down from 3.5 percent now.  Ships without sulfur-stripping technologies, or scrubbers, would have to burn costlier low-sulfur fuels such as marine gasoil or low-sulfur fuel oil to comply with the clean air rules.  \u201cWe expect scrubber installations to rise quickly, with scrubbed ships keeping a third of current high-sulfur fuel in compliant use,\u201d Goldman said in a note on Thursday.  \u201cOngoing refinery capacity additions and the redirection of fuel oil and crude flows should go a long way to balancing the global fuel markets, with more onerous utilization and yield shifts making up the difference,\u201d the bank said.  Shippers and refiners were initially slow to make investment decisions to comply with the upcoming sulfur cap due to uncertainty around the enforcement of the rules and costs of compliance.  Goldman forecasts scrubber installations at 3,125 in 2020 and 4,450 in 2022. It expects scrubbed high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) consumption at a total of 1 million barrels per day (mbpd) by 2020 and 1.4 mpbd by 2025.  The global shipping industry burned a total of 3.3 million barrels per day (mbpd) of high-sulfur marine fuels in 2017, according to the bank.  Goldman\u2019s forecasts for higher than expected HSFO consumption mirrors similar outlook revisions from other energy researchers in August amid changing attitudes to scrubbers from shippers.  \u201cAt an 80 percent compliance rate, we model that the market can reach equilibrium at a distillate-HSFO spread near current forwards, although at higher distillate cracks,\u201d Goldman Sachs said.  \u201cWe highlight, however, that this regulation\u2019s costs may end up varying sharply with global growth and oil prices.\u201d","476":"Aug 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group plans to name Jim Esposito as global co-head of its trading business, according to a story published on the Wall Street Journal website on Sunday.

Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Reuters in June that the government will be looking at the possibility of seeking claims from Goldman Sachs.

Goldman was accused of systematically paying women less than men, and giving them weaker performance reviews that impeded their career growth.  Class certification can help plaintiffs achieve greater awards at lower costs than if they sued individually. Kelly Dermody, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, estimated that more than 2,000 people are in the certified class.  Goldman had no immediate comment.  The lawsuit is one of the highest-profile cases targeting Wall Street\u2019s alleged unequal treatment of women, a claim raised in a variety of litigation against many banks for decades.

NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - The headline number in Goldman Sachs\u2019s settlements on Thursday over the 1MDB bribery scandal is the $3 billion or so it agreed to pay to regulators from Washington to Hong Kong. There\u2019s a smaller number, though, that\u2019s arguably much more significant. Goldman plans to claw back around $174 million from current and former executives. The catch is that not all the money is still within the firm\u2019s control.  Goldman last year tweaked some awards granted almost a decade ago so it could hold back payments depending on how the Malaysian 1MDB saga panned out. The recipients include Chief Executive David Solomon\u2019s predecessor Lloyd Blankfein. Another who has already cashed out is former Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. Goldman says it is in talks to recover past payments to a retired executive \u2013 that\u2019s Cohn, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Cohn is, in theory, beyond the reach of Goldman\u2019s clawback. He cut direct ties when he left the firm in 2017 to head President Donald Trump\u2019s National Economic Council. As is normal with the revolving door to D.C. \u2013 partly for the valid reason that it avoids future conflicts of interest \u2013 he was paid out in full. Cohn\u2019s 2011 award was worth $12.9 million according to a 2017 proxy filing, just a small part of an overall cash payout of around $65 million.  All of these numbers are a pittance next to the $5 billion or so that investors have forgone as a result of 1MDB. But there\u2019s a principle at stake, because a shift to the White House or any government position shouldn\u2019t allow a former top executive to escape past sins. While the retired Goldmanites weren\u2019t directly involved in the 1MDB scandal, they ran the company during the time when rogue employees went undetected.  Cohn, meanwhile, is still trading on his contacts and reputation. Last month a blank-check company he is backing raised $720 million in an initial public offering and the sponsors, including Cohn, could collect as much as 20% of that amount as compensation. Against that backdrop, it wouldn\u2019t cost him much to do the right thing. Next time an executive heads for the revolving door, though, Goldman should make sure it isn\u2019t up for debate.","484":"* Berlin startup developing \u2018deposits-as-a-service\u2019 platform  * Targets U.S. market launch in 2020  * Has brokered 14 billion euros in deposits  FRANKFURT, July 16 (Reuters) - Raisin, a Berlin-based savings and investment marketplace, said it had tapped investment bank Goldman Sachs for top-up funding as it joins other European fintech players in targeting the U.S. market.  Goldman\u2019s investment of 25 million euros in Raisin follows a recent Series D funding round that raised 100 million euros. All in, the seven-year-old startup has won 195 million euros ($220 million) in backing from investors.  Raisin declined to give a valuation that the investment put on the business but said Goldman\u2019s resulting percentage shareholding would be in the low single digits. Based on a rough calculation, that means Raisin is worth more than 500 million euros.  In an era of very low interest rates, Raisin is positioning its \u201cdeposits-as-a-service\u201d model as a chance for savers to scour the market for better deals, and as a way for banks that need liquidity to access additional funding.  Raisin, which collects an undisclosed margin on deposits sourced via its platform, has brokered a total of 14 billion euros in deposits for 185,000 European customers, on behalf of 80 banks. That\u2019s up from 10 billion euros at the start of 2019.  Frank Freund, co-founder and chief financial officer, said the $12.7 trillion U.S. savings pile was too big an opportunity to ignore. \u201cThe deposit base in the United States is larger than in all of Europe combined,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  While large U.S. banks are typically overliquid, said Freund, Raisin would offer a route for smaller banks to grow and manage their deposit bases once it launches there next year.  Raisin follows Berlin-based smartphone bank N26, with which it partners, in expanding into the United States - part of a wider push by European fintechs seeking to achieve scale, generate meaningful revenue and turn a profit.  Goldman has launched an online bank called Marcus and while its investment in Raisin is not directly tied to that venture, it did show that the investment bank \u201cunderstood the power of retail\u201d, said Freund.

Investors this week will be scrutinizing data - including Germany\u2019s ZEW survey and Chinese gross domestic product due on Wednesday - for signs of whether a global economic slowdown is turning around.  U.S. retail sales and housing data, which will give a glimpse into whether the U.S. economy is withstanding that broader slowdown, are also scheduled for release this week.  Ahead of those data, U.S. Treasury yields fell from four-week highs on Monday, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, dropped slightly.  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1\/32 in price to yield 2.5561 percent, from 2.56 percent late on Friday.  The dollar index fell 0.05 percent.  In U.S. equities, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 50.34 points, or 0.19%, to 26,361.96, the S&P 500 lost 5.52 points, or 0.19%, to 2,901.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.85 points, or 0.31 percent, to 7,959.31.  In commodities, oil provided big milestones last week, with Brent breaking through the $70 threshold and the U.S. benchmark posting six straight weeks of gains for the first time since early 2016.  On Monday, though, Brent crude futures fell 37 cents to $71.18 a barrel, a 0.5 percent loss, on signals that Russia may exit production cuts. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 65 cents to $63.24 a barrel, a 1.0 percent loss.

The much anticipated titanium credit card, part of a broader effort by Apple to derive greater revenue from services after years of heavy reliance on iPhone sales, was launched in August, in partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N.  In an email, Goldman said Apple Card applicants were evaluated independently, according to income and creditworthiness, taking into account factors such as personal credit scores and personal debt.

They expect the Latin American economy as a whole to shrink 1.2% this year, compared with their previous forecast of 1.1% growth.","492":"NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - As Goldman Sachs Group Inc approaches its first-ever investor day on Wednesday, all eyes are on its tiniest business division, the consumer bank, and how the Wall Street powerhouse will get it to grow.  While Goldman will present broad financial targets and details on many of its other multi-billion-dollar businesses, analysts and investors told Reuters they are eager to hear more about the consumer bank, which consists of Goldman\u2019s online bank Marcus and its credit card with Apple.  At the moment, that consumer bank generates just 2.4% of Goldman\u2019s annual revenue, compared to almost 40% of revenue that comes from the bank\u2019s securities division. Analysts believe it will take at least a decade for the consumer bank to become as substantial as other major businesses.  But Marcus is a central pillar of Chief Executive Officer David Solomon\u2019s vision for Goldman Sachs, whose 151-year history has had very little to do with Main Street. The consumer unit generates an outsized share of the Wall Street bank\u2019s publicity.  \u201cWhile Goldman has lots of good ideas, it needs to execute, especially in certain areas that are somewhat new to it,\u201d Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said.  Goldman unveiled Marcus in 2016 as a way to supplement falling income from trading, which has declined across Wall Street because of new regulations and shifting customer preferences.  The bank has invested heavily in the business, advertising lucrative savings rates, buying a personal-finance app and launching a credit card with Apple Inc last year to lure customers.  Those efforts have helped gather $60 billion in deposits and issue $7 billion in loans and credit card balances as of year-end.  Analysts characterize that as fast growth for a bank that only entered the scene a few years ago, but they note that it came at a hefty cost and still represents a fraction of the balance sheets of big universal lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Bank of America Corp.  Goldman set up a particular challenge for itself by not opportunistically buying a big retail bank or brokerage firm during the financial crisis when they had the chance, DBRS, Inc analyst Mike McTamney said.  Even its closest rival, Morgan Stanley, went through a transformative deal that changed the composition of its customers and revenue streams.  Even after hundreds of millions of dollars invested in Marcus, several analysts noted, trading accounted for 40% of Goldman\u2019s annual revenue last year.  \u201cGoldman Sachs failed to evolve as quickly as it should have,\u201d said Mike Mayo, analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. \u201cThey were strategically complacent.\u201d  Although Goldman has been publicly traded since 1999, a bank since 2008 and part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 2013, it has only recently come around to the idea that it needs to act more like peers. The investor day itself came after years of analysts and investors demanding more disclosures and transparency.  As Reuters reported in November and management confirmed this month, Goldman plans to move away from a hard-to-measure $5 billion revenue target executives had outlined in 2017. Instead, they plan to offer metrics like a bank-wide efficiency target and granular details about individual businesses, the way rivals do. (reut.rs\/32y3xdi)  But the central question remains how Goldman will transform itself from a Wall Street bank into something that looks more like universal rivals, especially without performing an acquisition, analysts said.  Management has toyed with the idea since the crisis, even publicly musing about it from time-to-time. Solomon's predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein, has said that not acquiring a big retail bank was his biggest regret as CEO, and former finance chief Marty Chavez said in 2018 that Goldman still had interest in doing so. (reut.rs\/2vkXq0p)  However, it would be much much more expensive and difficult for Goldman to do such a deal today.  Although the regulatory environment has eased during the Trump administration, there would be heavy political pressure against Goldman buying one of its peers, especially ahead of the 2020 elections. And, despite being the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, Goldman\u2019s market value of $84 billion is comparable to smaller regional rivals it might want to buy, which makes such a transaction financially difficult.  Goldman\u2019s share price of $238.14 as of Monday\u2019s close means investors value it at less than what it says its stated assets are worth. That \u201cmultiple\u201d harms its ability to buy banks that are valued more richly.  Solomon, a longtime investment banker, might seem like the most likely person to do such a deal, but he might be stuck growing Goldman\u2019s consumer bank from the ground up, analysts said. Sources inside the bank said he thinks Goldman would need to be trading around $400 to think about doing a big deal.  \u201cIt would be really challenging to grow 50% through an acquisition,\u201d said David Konrad, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. \u201cGoldman doesn\u2019t really have the multiple.\u201d (Reporting By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall, additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra, David French and Greg Roumeliotis; editing by Lauren LaCapra and David Gregorio)","493":"NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc told employees on Monday that a worker in the bank\u2019s health center at its New York headquarters is suspected to have contracted COVID-19, according to a memo seen by Reuters and verified by the bank.

Goldman is appealing an April decision from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan allowing a class action accusing the bank of hiding conflicts of interest when creating risky subprime securities before the 2008 financial crisis.  A decision is likely before the end of the court\u2019s current term in June.  The case stemmed from Goldman\u2019s sale of collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, which it assembled with help from hedge fund manager John Paulson.  In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve charges it cheated Abacus investors by concealing Paulson\u2019s role, including how he made a $1 billion profit by betting the CDO would fail.

Goldman described its appeal as \u201cthe most important securities case\u201d before the Supreme Court in several years, and drew support for it from business and financial industry groups.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Under the agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators, the bank will admit fault for its role in underwriting bond offerings that raised $6.5 billion for the Malaysian state fund, according to media reports on Tuesday.  One of its Asia subsidiaries is expected to plead guilty for its role in the scandal, but the bank group overall will avoid a guilty plea, which could have crippled its business, the reports said.  The long-awaited deal would allow Goldman to move beyond a saga that has threatened to derail Chief Executive Officer David Solomon\u2019s efforts to turn around the Wall Street investment bank after a decade of under-performance.  \u201cGetting this overhang off the back of management and the company in general is a very big win,\u201d said Marty Mosby, an analyst at boutique brokerage Vining Sparks.  Some investors and analysts viewed the 1MDB probes as an obstacle to Goldman doing deals to accelerate Solomon\u2019s plan to reshape it as a more conventional bank, and reduce its reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues.  U.S. regulators will often not allow a bank to do deals while it is the subject of investigations into past misconduct. With clarity over how much the bank needs to pay and a clean slate with regulators, Goldman may be able to be more aggressive on that front, said Mosby.  \u201cWhen they had this over their heads they didn\u2019t have that opportunity, they had to take a pause. This is a green light to say they can go ahead and do that.\u201d  The settlement may also boost the bank\u2019s share price, which has been under pressure due to the probe, said Mosby. Goldman\u2019s share price lags its rivals, trading at just 0.8 times the value of its assets.

The agency estimated that $4.5 billion of the fund\u2019s money was looted by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.

FILE PHOTO: David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, at the Bloomberg Global Business forum in New York, U.S., September 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  The executives invited, however, were not among the buyout industry\u2019s power players Goldman is known for banking, such as Blackstone Group LP CEO Stephen Schwarzman or KKR & Co Inc co-CEOs Henry Kravis and George Roberts.  Instead, the guests included the bosses of private equity firms such as H.I.G. Capital, Olympus Partners and Charlesbank Capital Partners. These firms focus on \u201cmiddle-market\u201d transactions, which Goldman classifies as acquisitions between $500 million and $3 billion in size, a far cry from the mega-deals it has built its investment banking brand on.  Over a meal of Atlantic halibut and dry-aged ribeye steaks, Gregg Lemkau, co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank, and Alison Mass, in charge of the financial sponsors coverage group, pressed one message: Goldman is serious about advising on relatively small leveraged buyouts.  The bank has sought to back up this claim with a major hiring spree. It created a dedicated team for M&A execution within its \u201cfinancial sponsors\u201d group covering private equity clients, and has grown this group from zero to 27 bankers in the last three years. Previously, M&A execution was handled by the bank\u2019s sector teams.  The initiative illustrates how Goldman, already the No. 1 bank for private equity firms by fees earned, is looking between the sofa cushions for any new source of income to hit its goal, unveiled last year, of growing revenues by $5 billion by 2020.  Goldman\u2019s new chief executive, David Solomon, is seeking to remove the bank\u2019s reliance on volatile trading revenue, making expanding the already dominant investment bank a key part of this strategy.  Goldman has already been scoring its fair share of smaller deals. League table data from industry tracker Dealogic show Goldman has held a top three position in fees earned from U.S. private equity-related deals between $500 million and $3 billion since at least 2013. However, in 2018, the bank is on track to have its highest fee share in that segment since 2014, Dealogic data showed.  \u201cWe had a look within the investment bank where we could grow our share of the pie and they saw an opportunity in the middle market,\u201d Goldman\u2019s Mass said in an interview.  ATTRACTING SENIOR BANKERS  One hurdle Goldman faces in implementing this strategy is attracting enough senior talent. Traditionally, the financial sponsors team was seen internally as training ground for many investment bankers, who learned to work on deals before they cultivated relationships with the corporate world\u2019s movers and shakers, bank insiders said.  Many investment banks that are focused on the middle market, on the other hand, often boast careerists who have spent decades cultivating relationships with private equity firms that do smaller deals.  To counter this, Goldman Sachs has poached senior bankers covering private equity firms from the likes of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG.  There are plans to grow the M&A team further, especially in Europe, Mass and David Friedland, global head of the sponsor M&A team, said, without elaborating on the potential new hires.  \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve tried to address is the misperception, often put forth by our competitors, that our most experienced M&A people were not also working on these (middle-market) deals,\u201d said Friedland.  T. J. Maloney, chairman and CEO of Lincolnshire Management, a private equity firm specializing in the middle market, said he had seen more deal flow from Goldman in the last couple of years.  \u201cThey made a push by hiring some pretty good people in the middle market, people who are really focused on covering sponsors like us,\u201d said Rich Lawson, co-founder and CEO of HGGC, another private equity firm which invests in middle-market businesses.  The new M&A group for private equity firms at Goldman was the brainchild of Stephanie Cohen, who last year was tapped by the bank to be its head of strategy. The group has helped diversify the bank\u2019s fee revenue from private equity firms beyond the sector\u2019s biggest players, such as Blackstone, Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR.  \u201cOver the course of the last two or three years, they\u2019ve done a very good job reestablishing the connection with folks like us,\u201d said Scott Sperling, co-president at Thomas H. Lee Partners, another U.S. private equity firm.","507":"NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is likely to expand its consumer bank through small acquisitions, its finance chief said on Tuesday, without ruling out the idea that it might buy a traditional lender, too.  During a conference call to discuss quarterly results, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo listed the ways Goldman is trying to generate $5 billion more in annual revenue and asked Chief Financial Officer R. Martin Chavez whether it would simply buy a brick-and-mortar bank.  After explaining that Goldman has a history of building businesses internally, and a preference for \u201cbolt-on\u201d acquisitions, if any, Chavez suggested that management routinely considers more transformative deals.  \u201cWe are evaluating all these acquisitions, including things that you describe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are open-minded and it\u2019s all part of the consideration.\u201d  Goldman got into consumer lending much later than big U.S. banking peers, and analysts have asserted on and off through the years that acquiring a big consumer lender would help even out volatile results from businesses like trading and investment banking.  Unlike most rivals, Goldman did not make any significant acquisitions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Such a deal could be more difficult to accomplish now, as the industry has consolidated, values have risen and more regulatory hurdles have been put in place.  Since launching its digital consumer bank Marcus in 2016, Goldman has been growing the business by paying up for deposits, offering new products like home improvement loans and recently acquiring Clarity Money, a personal finance smartphone app.  Marcus is now lending out $3 billion of its more than $20 billion in deposits, Chavez said, making it a much smaller bank with a much lower loan-to-deposit ratio than lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, or even its closest peer, Morgan Stanley.  Goldman looked at \u201cwell over 100\u201d businesses to potentially acquire before launching Marcus, Chavez said, but none were the right fit. The company is still examining whether and how to expand offerings in credit cards, wealth management, retirement products and personal finance, he said.

The promotions to the bank\u2019s most powerful committee, which includes top executives, signal Goldman\u2019s increased focus on technology and retail clients in its overall strategy.  The new members are Tucker York, global head of private wealth management; George Lee and Marco Argenti, co-chief information officers; Asahi Pompey, global head of corporate engagement and president of the bank\u2019s foundation; and Bentley de Beyer, the new head of human capital management, according memos seen by Reuters.  Argenti, 52, is a first-year partner who joined the bank in September from Amazon Web Services, where he was vice president of technology in charge of Amazon.com Inc\u2019s cloud product services.  Lee, 53, has been with the bank since 1994, and most recently was co-head of the investment bank\u2019s engineering division and co-chairman of its global technology, media and telecom group.  The elevation of York, 59, to the committee follows the bank\u2019s announcement last week that it will start reporting more details about revenues generated by its private wealth management business, which York heads.  The new reporting line, called Consumer & Wealth Management, was created in response to investors\u2019 demands for more information about these businesses that the bank says play a key role in its plans to build more sources of sustainable revenue and gain more client deposits.  Pompey has been with Goldman since 2006 and was previously co-chief compliance officer for the bank\u2019s Goldman, Sachs & Co division and global head of compliance for the investment banking unit.  De Beyer, whose hiring was announced on Monday, will join Goldman from Johnson & Johnson where he was the head of human resources for the global business unit. De Beyer takes over as the head of human capital management from Dane Holmes, who retired in September.  The appointments increase the size of Goldman\u2019s management committee to 35 and follow the departure of around a dozen partners who left the bank in 2019.

Canteen is a division of Compass Group. Canteen\/Handout via Reuters  From the headquarters of Ford in Dearborn, Michigan and Goldman Sachs in New York to Fedex facilities across the United States, workers are returning after months of lockdowns to the new reality of social distancing, hybrid remote and office work schedules, and strict hygiene protocols.  The break room, where employees used to get their daily fix of caffeine and office gossip, is a big part of that reboot as coffee companies, such as Keurig Dr. Pepper KDP.O, Lavazza and Nestle NESN.S roll out new technology for the COVID-19 era.  Nestle says it has worked with manufacturers to add a function to its coffeemakers that lets users to make a selection by just hovering a finger over the menu and has been delivering those to clients since June.  Lavazza lauched a new model in September that works with a mobile app to whip up those cappuccinos and lattes without having to touch the machine.  U.S. coffee machine manufacturer Bunn has chosen a different approach, retrofitting its machines with a QR code that lets users order drinks through a webpage.  Last year, supplying offices with beans and brewers was a $5.7 billion business in the United States alone, according to research firm Packaged Facts. Coffee companies, which saw lockdowns wipe out so-called professional sales that also include the hospitality industry, bet they can revive that business by addressing workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 concerns.

It showed 40% of employees expected to leave the building less often to get a drink and to rely more on office supplies, but were nervous about infection risks.  \u201cWhat they are telling us is... \u2018I\u2019m going to come back to the office but I\u2019m nervous about touching the machine\u2019.\u201d  Employers, suppliers and designers are also experimenting with a one-stop service that allows office workers to refuel without going outside, while those working remotely can do it from the comfort of their home.

Goldman Sachs GS.N told Reuters that 15% of its New York workforce is back with standard precautions in place - mandatory masks in all areas except employee desks and limits on the number of people in conference rooms and common areas.  RETHINK AND RECALIBRATE  Surveys and official guidelines suggest offices will fill up only gradually and might even never return to pre-pandemic capacity.  GoodFirms, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm, said this month its international survey of 168 businesses showed nearly a third of workers had already returned and nearly 60% wanted to do so, but more than half remained concerned about their safety.  A makeover of office catering was important for addressing such concerns, says Alicia LeBeouf, marketing and retail strategy executive at food service company Canteen, which counts FedEx FDX.N, Pinterest PINS.N, Target TGT.N and UPS UPS.N among its clients.  Buffets and chefs preparing meals on demand are replaced by grab-and-go food stations at Verizon VZ.N and UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N; contactless coffee machines get rolled out at Microsoft Corp MSFT.O; fridges get pedal-operated doors at Mohawk Industries MHK.N and individually wrapped plastic utensils replace cutlery.  At several FedEx facilities, Canteen has replaced card payment terminals at its grab-and-go stations with Canteen\u2019s \u201cConnect & Pay\u201d app, which allows consumers to scan and pay with their mobile device, and access nutritional informational on products.  The layout also needs to change, says Tom Vecchione, workplace strategist at New York architecture firm Vocon. The company is knocking down doors and removing screens for its clients to create more spacious common areas that make social distancing easier while replacing chairs with stools  to discourage people from lingering for too long.

David M. Solomon of Goldman Sachs speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, May 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Schwartz and Solomon were named co-COO in December 2016 in a setup that appeared to pit the two against each other to eventually lead what is viewed as the most powerful U.S. investment bank.  The Wall Street bank\u2019s board had discussed choosing a single COO at a meeting in February as part of ongoing succession planning and decided on Solomon, a person familiar with the matter said.  Speculation over the next leader had intensified after the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Blankfein, 63, was expected to retire as soon as this year and the bank was not looking beyond Schwartz and Solomon to replace him. Goldman did not comment on that report.  Schwartz\u2019s retirement eliminates a presumptive CEO candidate with a strong trading background and comes as Goldman Sachs has been trying to reinvent itself after market trends and regulations sapped profits from its once-lucrative trading business.  Schwartz, 53, will leave on April 20. He had been co-head of the bank\u2019s trading division before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2013, while Solomon, 56, had been a co-head of investment banking at Goldman since 2006 until becoming co-COO.  In September, Schwartz had outlined a target to grow revenue by $5 billion a year, after investors pressured the bank to be more transparent about its strategy outlook after two quarters of weak trading results.  Setting up an investment banker to lead the firm would better align leadership with the bank\u2019s focus and highlights the waning influence of the trading business, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said.  \u201cThis will be the first time in over a decade that a banker will be heading Goldman instead of a trader,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sets a tone that the bankers are going to steer the ship incrementally more than the traders.\u201d  The bank typically maps out its succession planning by naming two or three candidates to top roles. Schwartz and Solomon were named to the co-COO roles after Gary Cohn left Goldman to become U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser.

Goldman shares rose nearly 1.4 percent to hit a lifetime high in morning trade, and last traded up 0.7 percent at $272.69 by midday.

Goldman's policy changes come just as the United Nations concludes a conference that failed to ramp up efforts to combat global warming. (reut.rs\/2YPhjry)  Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon announced the plans in an editorial in the Financial Times, where he wrote that there is \u201ca powerful business and investing case\u201d for the bank to take steps to address climate change and the growing worldwide opportunity gap.  Goldman emphasized that it will not pass up any significant amount of revenue as a result of the $750 billion commitment and the ban on financing certain drilling and coal activities.  A Goldman Sachs executive said on a call with reporters that the bank has not financed any projects like those in recent memory. The bank has a rigorous due-diligence process that takes into consideration, among other things, impacts on endangered species and indigenous populations, the executive said.  The $750 billion commitment will be deployed in several ways, including by investing in and advising companies to take steps to reduce their carbon emissions and become more sustainable, the bank said.  For example, earlier this year Goldman worked with Italian electricity company Enel to raise $1.5 billion through a bond offering that linked the investments to Enel\u2019s commitment to increase its renewable energy base by 25% before 2022.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Most of the banking debt had already been refinanced by the end of the second quarter, the company announced earlier this month, with the extension of maturities by one year on average and variable grace periods in banking debt and local bonds.  But the company has failed to find a partner as yet, added the sources, who asked for anonymity because talks are private.  Netshoes and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Chances of closing a deal with an investor are small, one of the sources said, because Kumruian is pressing for a valuation that is considered unrealistic. The source did not elaborate on the expected price per share.  Netshoes\u2019 key shareholders, such as investment firm Tiger Global Management LLC and Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd, are not willing to inject more cash into the company at the moment, the sources added.  Tiger and GIC did not respond to requests for comment.  Since the company\u2019s initial public offering in New York 16 months ago, Netshoes shares have lost around 90 percent of their value, and the current market capitalization is $67 million.  Investors have been dumping the stock as promises of growth have not been delivered and the company kept piling up losses and burning cash.

Solomon, 56, is widely expected to become the next CEO (reut.rs\/kPAtnJ) of Goldman Sachs after his boss, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, told the bank's board of directors earlier this year that Solomon should be the top pick.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst\/File Photo  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has settled foreign corruption charges against former Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N executive Tim Leissner for his involvement in Malaysia's multibillion-dollar 1MDB corruption scandal, the agency said on Monday.  The SEC has permanently barred Leissner from the securities industry for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by allegedly receiving more than $43 million in illicit payments for helping to facilitate a bribery scheme involving high-ranking government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi.  As part of the settlement, Leissner consented to the SEC\u2019s order that he violated antibribery, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.  The settlement also requires Leissner to give up ill-gotten gains of $43.7 million.  That amount will be offset by money paid as part of an action by the U.S. Department of Justice, which in November 2018 filed criminal charges against Leissner and fellow former Goldman banker Roger Ng. Leissner pleaded guilty to those charges. Ng pleaded not guilty, and his case is pending in federal court in Brooklyn.  Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries, including the United States, Malaysia and Singapore, over its involvement in the scandal. According to the Justice Department, the bank earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB. Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  The bank has consistently tried to distance itself from the scandal, saying Leissner and Ng worked to conceal their criminal activities from the bank\u2019s management.  Both bankers have already been sanctioned by U.S. Federal Reserve for their roles in the scandal.","527":"(The story was refiled to correct the nationality of Ng in paragraph 3)  Ex-Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng and his lawyer Marc Agnifilo leave the federal court in New York, U.S., May 6, 2019. REUTERS\/Jeenah Moon  (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Roger Ng pleaded not guilty to criminal charges linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at the Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB in an appearance at federal court in New York on Monday.  The U.S. Department of Justice accused 46-year-old Ng last year of conspiring to launder money and bribe government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi through bond offerings that Goldman Sachs handled. He was extradited on May 3 to New York from Kuala Lumpur, where he had been jailed since November.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo, of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York, allowed Ng, a Malaysian citizen, to be released in exchange for a $20 million bond. He was fitted for an ankle bracelet, and will be staying at an undisclosed location in the New York City area that the court approved.  His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said he convinced Ng to \u201ccome to the U.S. and face the music\u201d because it was evident that prosecutors were not going to drop the case, and his client had become very ill. Ng appears to have lost weight, based on photos of him before his arrest.  \u201cHe was in a very difficult situation,\u201d Agnifilo told reporters. Being detained in New York \u201cis better than a Malaysian jail,\u201d he added.  Ng, who left Goldman Sachs in 2014, faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of the three charges against him in the United States, based on alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Prosecutors and Ng\u2019s lawyer are trying to negotiate a plea bargain. Government lawyers said they hope to avoid a trial by reaching a deal, though Agnifilo said it was too early to tell.  Malaysia\u2019s home minister wanted Ng to face criminal charges there first, but agreed to temporarily surrender him to the United States for 10 months, Malaysia\u2019s attorney general, Tommy Thomas, said in a statement.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cThe period of temporary surrender may be extended upon mutual agreement by Malaysia and the U.S.,\u201d Thomas added.  The 1MDB case has shaken Goldman Sachs, which is also being probed by the Justice Department for its role as underwriter and arranger for some $6.5 billion worth of 1MDB bond offerings.  Prosecutors estimate that high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates misappropriated $4.5 billion between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to it about how the bond proceeds would be used.  Ng was charged in Kuala Lumpur with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for 1MDB bond sales.  Tim Leissner, another former Goldman Sachs banker, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho have also been charged in the United States over 1MDB. Leissner has pleaded guilty.  In a statement, Low\u2019s spokesman Paul Caminiti criticized the Malaysian government for \u201cinhumane prison conditions\u201d and called its motivation with the United States politically motivated.  Low, whose whereabouts are unknown, has consistently denied wrongdoing through spokesmen.  Malaysia has said it was seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman over its dealings with 1MDB, set up in 2009 by then-Prime Minister Najib Razak.

India, the world\u2019s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, wants to raise its renewable energy capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW), or 40% of total capacity, by 2030.  The southern state of Andhra Pradesh is among the largest adopters of renewable energy and ReNew Power, about 49% owned by Goldman Sachs, is India\u2019s largest renewable energy company.  But the state has been curtailing power procurement from renewable energy companies, citing high prices, and pushed to renegotiate its supply contracts with them.  \u201cThere are questions on what this means for sanctity of contracts in India. That has made investors jittery,\u201d Sinha told Reuters.  Foreign investment is central to India\u2019s green energy ambitions, and a slowdown in overseas funding could hurt Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s commitment to increase adoption of renewable energy.  \u201cThe longer the issue carries on, the less likely (the renewable energy) target will be met,\u201d Sinha said.  ReNew has an installed capacity of over 5 gigawatts (GW) and plans to add another 3 GW by mid-2021.  India\u2019s federal government, the state-controlled NTPC Ltd, Solar Energy Corp of India and the Japanese ambassador of Japan have all asked Andhra Pradesh not to try to renegotiate renewables contracts.  And in August, a court in Andhra Pradesh ordered the state transmission companies to refrain from \u201carbitrary and discriminatory\u201d curtailing of power from generating companies.  Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for about a 10th of India\u2019s renewable energy capacity, owes green energy generators 25.1 billion rupees ($353.5 million).  That is the highest by any state in India and accounts for a over fourth of all dues owed by province-owned distribution companies, according to latest data published by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).  But Sinha said late payment by distribution companies overall was not as severe as it had been a few years ago. Along with land acquisition, delayed payment is seen as a major challenge to growth of the renewable energy sector in India.  \u201cWith the exception of states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, most states have started paying on time,\u201d he said.","530":"British Prime Minister Theresa May is seen outside Downing Street in London, Britain March 13, 2019.

Brent was set for its biggest weekly loss since 2008 as oil prices plummeted this week after top producer Saudi Arabia slashed its selling prices amid a price war with Russia and pledged to unleash more supply onto a market already reeling from falling demand due to the virus. [O\/R]  \u201cThe high-cost producer response at our second quarter 2020 $30\/bbl Brent forecast will not be sufficiently fast to offset the record large inventory builds set to occur in coming months,\u201d the Wall Street bank said in a note dated March. 12.  The jump in inventories could also force some inland high-cost producers to shut production, since storage logistics may be stretched, the bank\u2019s analysts added.  While all production limits have been scrapped due to the collapse of the OPEC+ deal, prompting Riyadh and the UAE to say they would both ramp up output to record levels, the top producers also promised to expand capacity, suggesting a longer term strategy to win market share from U.S. companies and other producers.  The bank pegged the demand loss due to the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak at about 4.5 million bpd, though it also pointed to some signs of improving Chinese oil demand.  The accumulation of oil inventories over the next six months could be similar to a build up over 18 months in 2014-16, it said.  Global demand growth, on the other hand, would see a reduction of about 310,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 and comfortably offset any fast supply response from high cost producers, especially with the shale output now forecast to drop by 900,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2021, the bank added.  \u201cFinally, any potential re-escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East would not prevent the bearish pressure of quickly accumulating inventories unless it led to a historically large outage.\u201d","532":"Feb 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' merchant banking unit and medical charity Wellcome Trust have agreed to sell here the British student accommodation company iQ to Blackstone for 4.66 billion pounds ($6.06 billion), the companies said.

Developing economies\u2019 assets were especially hard hit by a deep market sell-off in March and face rising borrowing costs.  That makes it more challenging for them to fund a stimulus spree on the scale of those by major governments, with interest rates near record lows, that are pumping trillions into their ailing economies.  How well-placed local debt markets across developing nations are to absorb heavy government debt issuance depends on factors such as domestic pension funds and insurance companies, the presence of local commercial banks and the buying power of central banks, Goldman Sachs said in a note.  \u201cA key question is whether local markets are equipped to absorb the additional issuance if foreign portfolio investment is constrained or whether this will cause further increases in bond premia and renewed upward pressure on yields,\u201d Goldman Sachs\u2019 Kamakshya Trivedi wrote.  Brazil faced a \u201cmedium-to-high risk\u201d from a potential surge in local government debt, he said.  \u201cAlthough local markets are liquid relative to peers, it is highly likely that the local banking sector (both commercial banks and the central bank) will eventually have to increase their purchases to counterbalance the high bond supply and the foreign outflows driven by the low FX (forex) carry,\u201d Trivedi said.  Over the medium to long term, risks could escalate without meaningful fiscal adjustments, he said, adding the weakness of the currency over the last few months was a warning of domestic investors\u2019 low confidence in local assets.  Brazil's real BRL= has been the worst performer among emerging markets. The currency has weakened by around 30% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year.  Frontier markets - a subset of smaller and riskier emerging economies - faced a high risk from any local sovereign debt surge because of their relatively small number of institutional investors, relatively small banking sectors and because their central banks need to preserve foreign asset buffers to prevent pressures on the currencies.  The lack of a private sector counterweight to mop up a possible debt splurge means support from the official sector was likely to be inevitable, Trivedi said, adding he would also put Turkey in this group.  Turkey's lira TRY= fell to fresh record lows in early May although it has recovered since. Still, since the start of the year it has lost 14% against the dollar.","538":"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N will set an expense target at its investor day later this month, management said on Wednesday, after the bank missed Wall Street profit expectations due to inflated costs.  FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  A big portion of Goldman\u2019s bloated expense line came from setting aside another $1.1 billion to cover legal and regulatory costs related to the 1MDB Malaysian corruption scandal.  However, Goldman also spent more on compensation, technology, occupancy costs and professional fees, some of which pertained to new businesses, like the credit card it launched with Apple Inc APPL.O and its transaction banking business.  The bank\u2019s operating expenses rose 42% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year.  Overall, the bank spent 68 cents for every dollar of revenue it produced in 2019, up from 64 cents per dollar the prior year. Investors watch that efficiency metric closely, to gauge how well a company manages costs.  Several analysts quizzed Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr about costs on an earnings call, asking when the bank\u2019s investments in various businesses will start paying off. Goldman spent roughly $700 million on growth initiatives in 2019, before taxes.  Management plans to offer an expense target \u201cin very concrete terms\u201d at its investor day on Jan. 29, Scherr said.  He also said Goldman will move away from a $5-billion fresh annual revenue target it outlined in 2017, confirming a Reuters report from November. The bank will instead set measures for returns and efficiency, which better represent its goals, Scherr said.  Scherr also mentioned that of its equity investments, which are investments the bank makes with its own money, it dumped its shares of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N and reduced the amount of shares it owned in Tradeweb Markets Inc. TW.O.  Goldman shares rose 0.3% to $246.34 in afternoon trading.  During the fourth-quarter, Goldman\u2019s profit fell 26%, to $1.7 billion, or $4.69 per share, from $2.3 billion, or $6.04 per share in the same period of 2018.  Analysts had expected a profit of $5.47 per share, on average, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Some said the bank beat estimates by a stretch when excluding legal and regulatory provisions.  All but one of Goldman\u2019s four new business units reported better quarterly results.  Global markets, which houses the trading business, reported $3.5 billion in revenue, up 33%, thanks to easy comparisons with the year-ago period. The strong trading performance mirrored trends at major rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N.  The only sore spot for Goldman during the quarter was investment banking, where revenue fell 6% to $2.1 billion, hurt by lower M&A advisory fees, as well as a slowdown in corporate lending.  Goldman changed its reporting lines this month in response to long-standing requests for more transparency from analysts and investors.  The new structure offers more insight into consumer banking, a pillar of Solomon\u2019s strategy to offset sharp declines in trading revenue over the past decade or so.  That business is a tiny but fast-growing part of Goldman Sachs. It represented just 2.4% of the bank\u2019s revenue in 2019, at $864 million, which was up 41% from the prior year.  Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr characterized the results as encouraging, because of Goldman\u2019s revenue growth, its progress in building out new businesses and signs that it is getting closer to resolving 1MDB matters.  The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries for its underwriting role.  Solomon said the bank is actively engaged with authorities to settle as quickly as possible, though he cautioned that there is no guarantee of a settlement or when one might occur.  Schorr said it could take time before the bank is generating significantly better returns for investors.  \u201cMarkets won\u2019t always be this strong and the new builds will take years to achieve scale and materially contribute,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.","539":"Feb 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it expects losses related to ongoing lawsuits to be about up to $1.9 billion more than the money it set aside for legal matters.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Trading revenue could be up from 8% to 20% when the five big Wall Street banks \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N \u2013 report results this week, according to five estimates gathered by Reuters.  A note of caution was sounded by a sixth, Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co, who penciled in double-digit revenue declines for some banks because \u201cthese kinds of markets almost always lead to some trading inventory losses.\u201d  Nonetheless, Kotowski favors banks with heavy exposure to trading, betting they will fare better than those with large lending businesses.  That dark optimism reflects the state of banking today.  Bread-and-butter businesses that take in, lend out, process and manage money for individuals and companies are struggling as the novel coronavirus has infected hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone, shut down businesses and set the stage for a global recession. (tmsnrt.rs\/2RqR9sT)  Shifting updates about the novel coronavirus and government responses during the first quarter created volatility that allowed trading businesses to perform well, analysts said.  Stock markets plunged and soared day-to-day in a manner not seen in at least a decade, while bond markets reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s cutting interest rates and pouring trillions of dollars into financial markets to address liquidity issues.  Teams that handle stocks, Treasury bonds and foreign-exchange swaps likely did better than those in corporate credit, where there was severe stress at times, analysts said.  Average daily volumes on Tradeweb Markets Inc TW.O, which operates electronic trading platforms for fixed income and equities, were up 39% in the quarter from a year earlier, the company reported.  But activity began dissipating by late March, and few expect it to return as the year goes on.  \u201cGood temporary news for the big banks is trading was really good in 1Q,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a recent report.  The last time Wall Street banks experienced this kind of dynamic was the first quarter of 2009. Investors were worried that banks were in serious trouble, only to learn that government stimulus programs had created a trading boon, which held up through most of that year. But coronavirus volatility may turn out to be quite different, analysts said.  Banks have dramatically restructured their trading businesses since then, and bursts of trading activity have become much more fleeting, even when they are extreme. \u201cIf we look back to, like, 2Q \u201818 when we had that sharp market correction, it took several quarters in a good economy for that trading activity to come back,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in an interview. \u201cWith this economy it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer.\u201d","543":"NEW YORK, June 26 (LPC) - Blackstone\u2019s credit platform GSO Capital Partners has appointed Dan Oneglia as senior managing director and co-head of its distressed investing business, the firm said in a press release on Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Leah Millis  It also added its voice to the growing chorus of those predicting a globally coordinated rate cut among the world\u2019s largest central banks.  As stock markets sank for a seventh straight day on worries the coronavirus outbreak will hurt the global economy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday afternoon said the Fed is \u201cclosely monitoring\u201d developments and \u201cwill use [its] tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201d  Goldman economists Jan Hatzius and Daan Struyven said in a note that \u201cstrongly hints at a rate cut at or even before the March 17-18 FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting.\u201d  Goldman, which last week had already increased its forecast for Fed easing in response to the coronavirus outbreak, took it up a notch in its revised forecast on Sunday, which came out shortly before financial futures markets resumed trading for the week ahead. U.S. equity index futures were down by 1.3% and Treasury futures were higher as investors sought safety in government bonds.  Goldman said it now expects a cut of a half percentage point by March 18, the last day of the Fed\u2019s next scheduled policy meeting. It also forecast an additional half percentage point in the second quarter for a total reduction of 1 percentage point from the Fed\u2019s current target range of 1.50-1.75%.  Moreover, Goldman does not expect the Fed to act in a vacuum.  \u201cSpecifically, we see a high risk that the easing we expect over the next several weeks occurs in coordinated fashion, perhaps as early as the coming week,\u201d the two economists said. \u201cChair Powell\u2019s statement on Friday suggests to us that global central bankers are intensely focused on the downside risks from the virus.\u201d  \u201cWe suspect that they view the impact of a coordinated move on confidence as greater than the sum of the impacts of each individual move.\u201d  Goldman said it expects a total of 100 basis points of cuts in the near term from the Bank of Canada, which meets this week.  It then sees 50 basis points of easing from central banks in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, India and South Korea; and 10 basis points from the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank.  One bank left out of its forecast for cuts was the Bank of Japan, which it sees leaving rates on hold.  Goldman said it agreed with commentators who argue that central banks are not well equipped to combat the effect a global health crisis has on the economy.  \u201cCentral bankers will still want to do their part to support the economy, especially at a time when few of them worry about inflation rising too much,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis implies that if the news on the virus and the economy remains negative in the near term, central banks may well react aggressively even if the impact on economic growth is limited.\u201d","549":"HONG KONG, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Hong Kong\u2019s markets watchdog has fined Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. $350 million for its role in Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB scandal.

Goldman\u2019s digital bank, known as Marcus, has in recent weeks hatched deals with AARP, a U.S. organization geared toward older, retired individuals, and with JetBlue Airways Corp , said Harit Talwar, head of consumer banking. Goldman plans to launch a checking account and wealth-management product later this year or early next year, he said.  \u201cOne of our big advantages is we are housed in Goldman Sachs and have relationships with some of the biggest companies in the world,\u201d Talwar said.  He declined to name companies Goldman may partner with, but he said the bank is targeting companies it already works with to find consumers that are likely to have solid credit once global businesses get back to action.  Goldman\u2019s consumer bank is small and only five years old, which is why it is looking for customers to grow deposits and loans through partnerships with companies, a strategy larger retail banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have used for decades.  The coronavirus has already infected 2,410,208 people around the globe and a deadly respiratory virus associated with it, called COVID-19, has killed 165,854. In response, governments ordered the closure of huge swaths of the global economy, putting many millions of people out of work, but there is now talk of re-opening major cities and businesses. reut.rs\/2Kmkhxw  While it is still a tiny portion of Goldman\u2019s overall revenue, the consumer bank is growing fast.  Consumer banking generated $864 million in revenue last year, roughly 2.4% of Goldman\u2019s total revenue. That figure was $282 million, or 3.2%, at the end of the first quarter.  Despite the coronavirus\u2019 effect on consumers\u2019 finances, Marcus added $12 billion in deposits during the first three months of the year, arriving at $72 billion by March 31 and inching toward management\u2019s goal of $125 billion by 2025.  Goldman\u2019s Chief Executive David Solomon has encouraged bankers in all divisions to use conversations with corporate clients to open doors for their colleagues in divisions. When the bank helps arrange financing, investments or other services for a big organization, it can sometimes seal a partnership where that organization\u2019s employees are offered a special deal for deposits or loans.  For instance, Goldman is giving discounts on personal loans and extra interest on savings products for AARP members, according to the group\u2019s website. JetBlue is Goldman\u2019s first partner for Marcus Pay, a new product where customers can pay off big purchases in installments over 12 or 18 months at a fixed rate of 10.99% to 25.99%, according to Goldman\u2019s website.  Since the coronavirus took hold in the United States, where Goldman has centered its consumer banking efforts, roughly 22 million people there have pursued jobless claims. Aware that surging unemployment and business disruptions could hinder its Main Street banking ambitions, Goldman is also tightening standards for borrowers, Talwar said.  He would not give specifics about credit standards for customers, but in January the bank said the average FICO score across the consumer bank\u2019s loan and credit cards is 740.  In the fourth quarter last year, banks tightened underwriting requirements on credit cards by the greatest amount since 2009, according to a survey of credit card customers conducted by Moody\u2019s.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always been prudent in our credit standards,\u201d Talwar said.","552":"Feb 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Wednesday appointed Susie Scher as chairman of its global financing group, tasked with using her background in capital markets to serve clients across industries globally.

Leland was named a co-president of the bank for Asia Pacific excluding Japan in September last year, a designation that he will retain, the memo said. He had previously worked in London for 10 years.  A Goldman spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed the content of the memo.  Leland takes over at a time when China\u2019s aggressive outbound push for mergers and acquisitions has slowed this year amid an escalating trade war with the United States, and weaker markets are expected to weigh on the appetite for new equity offerings.  In the first nine months of 2018, Goldman\u2019s revenue in Asia, which is smallest of its three regions, rose 9 percent to $3.9 billion. Asia\u2019s share of group sales fell by 1 percentage point to 14 percent in that period, its filings showed.  Richdale, a fluent Mandarin speaker with experience in Southeast Asian dealmaking, joined Goldman from Morgan Stanley in March 2013.  Before taking over the Asia leadership role, Vella had been co-head of the financing group in the region since January 2014.

It also comes after Malaysia\u2019s former prime minister, Najib Razak, who founded the fund and lost his re-election bid earlier this year, was charged with abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in relation to SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.  Najib pleaded not guilty to those charges and has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to 1MDB.  Tim Leissner, a one-time Goldman partner and Southeast Asia chairman hasn\u2019t been charged. He is seeking an agreement with prosecutors that would involve his co-operation with the government\u2019s criminal fraud probe into 1MDB and Goldman, the report said.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) declined to comment. A lawyer for Leissner also declined to comment.  A Goldman Sachs spokesman told Reuters: \u201cSince we suspended Mr. Leissner, we have discovered certain activities he undertook that were deliberately hidden from the firm, which we have brought to the attention of the relevant authorities who continue to receive our full cooperation.\u201d  Last month, citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that Malaysia is considering asking the DoJ to get Goldman Sachs to return nearly $600 million in fees it earned from bonds raised for 1MDB.  Goldman raised nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB. More than $2.5 billion raised from these bonds was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB officials, their relatives and associates, according to DoJ civil lawsuits filed in a U.S. court in 2016.  Goldman earned almost $600 million for the three deals \u2013 an amount critics say is far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent fees a bank could expect for helping sell bonds.  Goldman has maintained that the outsized fees related to the additional risks it took on \u2013 it bought the un-rated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of the 2013 deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds in a hurry for a planned investment.  The WSJ said one potential charge Leissner could ultimately plead guilty to would be a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans the use of bribes to foreign officials to get or keep business.

FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at Marcus, a savings and loans app by Goldman Sachs, in New York, U.S., January 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  Goldman management has put an \u201cextremely high\u201d bar for any deal to be large and transformational, the sources cautioned. One of the sources said the bank had M&A bankers crunching numbers on \u201cdifferent ideas.\u201d  Digital banking is one area of interest. The pandemic has strengthened management\u2019s belief that online activity will be central to future growth within the industry and branches will continue to have a diminished role, the source said.  As a result, executives are ruling out any deals that involve acquiring branches. Digital businesses that bring in new customers or unique technologies would be attractive to the bank, the source said.  Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  Building out Marcus, which is named after one of the bank\u2019s founders, is a key plank of Chief Executive David Solomon\u2019s plan to reduce Goldman\u2019s reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues. To do so, Solomon wants to build businesses with predictable revenues such as consumer banking and mass-market wealth management, which most of its main rivals now have.  In January last year, Solomon set out three- and five-year financial goals for Marcus as well as the overall profitability of the firm. The three sources said booming investment banking and trading businesses during the pandemic and cost cuts made possible by remote working have helped Goldman make significant progress on its profitability and cost-cutting goals.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  However, worried about the quality of loans in the middle of a recession, executives have said they slowed loan and deposit growth at Marcus.  When Goldman reports its fourth quarter results Tuesday, it is expected to say that loan growth at its consumer business, which includes Marcus and a credit card joint venture with Apple Inc, has been slower than anticipated, the three sources said.  The bank may warn that a target it set to grow consumer loans and credit card balances to over $20 billion over five years, from $7 billion in January 2020, could take longer to achieve if the economic slowdown persists, the sources said.  It is expected to stick with a target to achieve $125 billion of deposits over the same period, anticipating that market conditions will improve, the sources said. Total deposits were $96 billion at the end of third quarter.  Goldman plans to keep the deposit target despite regulatory restrictions in the United Kingdom and its decision to cut rates on U.S. savings accounts slowed growth dramatically in the second half of 2020, the sources said. The bank added just $4 billion of deposits in the third quarter after adding $32 billion during the first half.  Rival Morgan Stanley spent more than $20 billion last year acquiring discount brokerage E*Trade and investment management firm Eaton Vance.  Analysts and industry insiders have long expected Goldman to try to grow its consumer business through acquisitions, and some said the time was right for the bank to do so now.  Last year, the bank settled long-pending corruption probes involving Malaysia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, lifting a cloud that can often keep regulators from signing off on major acquisitions.  At the same time, regulatory sources said President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s administration may take a more restrictive stance on allowing bank deals than the Trump administration did, meaning there might be a limited window to do large banking deals.  Moreover, the bank has excess capital following U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s decision last year to restrict payouts.","565":"(Reuters) - Abu Dhabi\u2019s International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) said on Wednesday that it was dropping a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc to recover losses suffered from the U.S. investment bank\u2019s dealings with Malaysian state fund 1MDB.  FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016.

Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Co, which controls IPIC, had suspended business dealings with Goldman after the lawsuit.  \u201cFollowing collaborative discussions, the International Petroleum Investment Company is dismissing its lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, related to issues regarding 1MDB,\u201d IPIC said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday.  Goldman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  The scandal dates back to the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009. The Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014.  Malaysia in September dropped criminal charges against three Goldman units after the bank agreed to pay $3.9 billion to settle the probe.  The investment bank has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries, including the United States, Malaysia and Singapore, for what its leadership did and did not know about the transactions.  Goldman is expected to settle with U.S. authorities later this week, resolving a probe into the bank\u2019s role in underwriting three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion for Malaysia\u2019s government.

AstraZeneca has struck a deal with Oxford University researchers to produce and distribute the latter\u2019s potential Covid-19 vaccine. The treatment, developed by the Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group, is already being tested in England. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot reckons the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker could produce 100 million doses by year end.  Flu vaccines alone bring in at least $4 billion a year, and demand for a Covid-19 version will be much higher. It could also require a new dosage every two years, Bernstein reckons. Still, it\u2019s not clear if AstraZeneca will have exclusive production and distribution rights. Many other players, including GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, are working on rival products. And even if the Oxford vaccine works, the 107 billion pound group will only be pricing to cover its costs for as long as the pandemic rages.

Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s first-quarter earnings report, unveiled on Thursday by Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, was a tale of two numbers: a 1.4 billion pound impairment charge for bad debt, and a bumper 14.2% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Investors and analysts were eager to hear Goldman\u2019s announcement because the bank fared worse than rivals on the Fed\u2019s stress test last week, sending its share price tumbling.  The Fed examined big banks\u2019 balance sheets to see if they had enough funds on hand to handle losses during two years of severe economic and market stress.  Goldman\u2019s loan portfolio suffered much higher hypothetical loss rates than peers. Its key measure of common equity capital as a portion of assets dropped to 12.5% in March compared with the Fed\u2019s requirement that it have 13.7% by the start of October.  The bank has already bolstered that measurement, known as a \u201cCET1 ratio,\u201d to \u201cabove 13%\u201d so far this quarter, Chief Executive David Solomon said in the statement.  \u201cWe have a track record of rebuilding capital when necessary,\u201d he said.  Goldman\u2019s shares rose 0.7% to $194.73 in after-hours trading on Monday. They had dropped 8.6% on Friday following the stress test news.  Although Goldman\u2019s improved ratio is a good sign, it does not satisfy all the outstanding concerns, analysts said.  The bank has been trying for years to transform itself into a full-service commercial bank: unveiling a consumer brand called Marcus, launching a cash-management business and promising to generate more, and less-volatile, revenue from its investment banking and trading arms.  Those changes remain a work in progress with an unclear trajectory, analysts said.  Goldman is still so exposed to trading that its recent success in the business probably helped it build capital so quickly, Wolfe Research analyst Steven Chubak said. It also still has meaningful exposure to private equity and leveraged loans, which were treated more harshly in this year\u2019s stress test, he noted.  \u201cGoldman didn\u2019t have the best mix for this year\u2019s test,\u201d Chubak said.  Goldman was already pulling back on private equity and leveraged loans. Speeding up that process would help meet the Fed\u2019s capital measure, but also hurt earnings.

Bash-Polley joined Goldman in 1994 and held several roles in its fixed-income trading business before becoming head of client relationship management four years ago in what was then a newly created role.  She now oversees a team of 12 senior leaders globally who talk to executives at large investment firms to figure out how Goldman Sachs can better cater to them.  Bash-Polley decided to leave now because the team is running well and, at 49, after spending nearly half her life at Goldman Sachs, she wants to think about her \u201csecond act,\u201d she said.  \u201cAt some point you have to leave,\u201d Bash-Polley said. \u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet for me because what I do for a living is even more valued now.\u201d  David Solomon, who will become Goldman\u2019s chief executive officer on Oct. 1, shares her vision for how to treat clients, Bash-Polley said. Solomon plans to generate $5 billion more in annual revenue by entering new businesses, finding new clients and providing more products and services to existing ones.  Bash-Polley became a managing director in 2002 and partner in 2004. She was a member of Goldman\u2019s inaugural Client and Business Standards Committee, and was also a member of the partnership committee and was co-chair of its diversity committee.

In the latest development of a case that partly inspired Michael Lewis\u2019 bestselling book \u201cFlash Boys\u201d on high-frequency trading in the U.S. equity market, the New York Court of Appeals rejected Aleynikov\u2019s argument that the code was not \u201ctangible,\u201d and thus not covered by a state law criminalizing \u201cunlawful use of secret scientific material.\u201d  \u201cThis unanimous decision makes abundantly clear that unlawful appropriation of intellectual property is a crime, whether that information is obtained by traditional or more modern means,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a written statement.  \u201cWe are disappointed in the Court of Appeals decision,\u201d said Kevin Marino, Aleynikov\u2019s lawyer.  However, Marino said the decision left room for a new motion to overturn the conviction for unlawful use of secret scientific material. He cited grounds that the jury had been told that \u201ctangible\u201d could mean \u201ccapable of being understood by the mind,\u201d and the appeals court did not adopt that definition. He said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that motion would succeed.  Aleynikov, 48, was arrested on federal charges in July 2009 and convicted in December 2010, only to be exonerated by a federal appeals court in February 2012 after serving 11 months of an eight-year prison sentence.  Vance then filed state criminal charges against Aleynikov in August 2012. He was convicted by a jury in May 2015, but the judge who presided over the trial overturned the verdict, finding the copied code was not tangible.  However, the Appellate Division, First Department, a mid-level state appeals court, reinstated the conviction in January 2017, saying a copy on a disk could be tangible. The Court of Appeals agreed to review the case in April 2017.  Aleynikov, a Russian-born U.S. citizen, has said he intended the code only for his own use.","580":"FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Italian Grand Prix - Circuit of Monza, Monza, Italy - August 30, 2018 General view of Pirelli tyres REUTERS\/Stefano Rellandini  BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italian tyremaker Pirelli PIRC.MI on Wednesday lost an appeal against a European Union cartel ruling after Europe's highest court rejected its argument that it should not bear liability for its former subsidiary and cartel member Prysmian PRY.MI.  The European Commission in its 2014 decision fined Prysmian, Nexans, investment bank Goldman Sachs GS.N and eight other cable firms 301.6 million euros ($357 million) for operating a 10-year power cable cartel.  Pirelli, which sold Prysmian to Goldman Sachs in 2005, challenged the antitrust decision, saying there were no grounds to charge it with parental liability and that the company directly involved in the cartel should bear sole responsibility.  The Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) dismissed its appeal.  Judges said there was already well-established case law that competition violations by subsidiaries can be imputed to the parent company and that the EU competition enforcer does not need to prove that parent companies are involved in wrongdoing.  Pirelli reiterated that it had set aside a provision for potential liabilities from the EU decision and had already provided a bank guarantee for 33.7 million euros plus interest to the Commission for its share of the fine.  \u201cFrom the financial point of view, if payment of the fine takes place before Dec. 31, 2020, the net cash flow target announced to the market on Aug. 5, 2020 (net cash flow between about +190 and about +220 million euros), would be respected in the lower part of the range,\u201d it said in a statement.  In 2014, Pirelli went to a Milan court to ask for a declaration that Prysmian is obliged to relieve the company from any claim related to the cartel, including the fine. A judgment is pending.

Jet fuel prices have dropped and refiners\u2019 profits for the product have slumped to the lowest in more than 2-1\/2 years, while industry analysts are cutting their 2020 forecasts for jet fuel and overall oil demand.  Airlines and passengers are on guard against the respiratory coronavirus that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, so far killing more than 100 people in China and spreading to more than 10 countries, including France, Japan and the United States.  Passengers have called off travel plans for the Lunar New Year holiday, prompting airlines to offer refunds.  \u201cMarket participants, already wary of slow demand growth from last year, are weighing the effects on global oil demand of the lockdown in several cities in China, and likely reduced travelling in the broader Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Barclays analyst Amarpreet Singh said in a note.  During the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - also caused by a coronavirus that originated in China and which killed nearly 800 people globally - air passenger demand in Asia plunged 45%. And now, the travel industry is more reliant on Chinese travellers, and China\u2019s share of the global economy has quadrupled.  If air passenger traffic in China were to decline by half in the first quarter of this year, it would likely lead to a 300,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) decline in jet kerosene demand from China from a year ago, Barclays analyst Singh said.  Several airlines across Asia have suspended flights to Wuhan, and some tour operators are cancelling trips to China.  \u201cFlight departures from the top five biggest Chinese airports fell by nearly 800 flights this past weekend relative to (the previous) weekend, while traffic in the five airports closest to Wuhan have fallen by nearly 50% over recent days,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note.  Jet fuel demand over the past five years has been a bright spot for global oil demand growth, accounting for some 15% of Chinese demand growth, the analysts said.  Refiners\u2019 profits for producing a barrel of jet fuel from Dubai crude fell to $9.25 a barrel on Monday, the lowest level since June 2017 and down nearly 40% since the start of this year, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.  A milder than normal winter in Asia has also weighed on margins for kerosene, which belongs to the same grade of oil products as jet fuel.","584":"FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.

Kukies, who was formerly co-head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, left the Wall Street firm a year ago to become deputy German finance minister.  Kukies has since advocated a merger between Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which unions warn could mean up to 30,000 job cuts, people familiar with the matter say.  Goldman Sachs is advising Commerzbank on the $28 billion plus deal deliberations, people familiar with the matter said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a conflict of interest,\u201d Fabio De Masi, a prominent leftist lawmaker in the German parliament, said, pointing to the state\u2019s 15 percent stake in Commerzbank.  A spokesman for Kukies told Reuters there was no conflict of interest and that he had worked in the trading department at Goldman Sachs, which was \u201cstrictly separated\u201d from bankers who advised on mergers.  Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  \u201cIn his 17 years at Goldman Sachs, Joerg Kukies exclusively worked for the sales and trading sector with no responsibility for the advisory\/mergers and acquisitions section,\u201d the spokesman for Kukies said.  Although confirmation of merger talks between Germany\u2019s two largest banks, following months of speculation, has boosted their share prices, it has also triggered opposition and concerns over the impact on employment.  The issue is a highly emotive one in Germany and in its Tuesday edition, top-selling tabloid newspaper Bild raised a question mark over Kukie\u2019s future in the government.  \u201cWhen 30,000 jobs are on the line, the government must avoid the impression of a conflict of interest,\u201d De Masi added.  This was echoed by Danyal Bayaz, a German parliamentarian and finance expert from the country\u2019s Green party.  \u201cIn the financial crisis, we saw that government and finance were too interconnected. Ten years later, we don\u2019t want to have the same.

Foreign investment interest in Saudi Arabia picked up ahead of the inclusion of the country\u2019s stock market in global index provider MSCI\u2019s emerging market indexes last month.  Goldman, which was not even among the top 10 brokers in Saudi Arabia in April, handled 18.6% of trades by value and 12.3% by volume in May, data from the Tadawul bourse showed.  It was followed by HSBC Saudi Arabia, which handled 9.4% of trades by value last month.  \u201cThis ranking is a reflection of our international client base\u2019s confidence in Saudi Arabia \u2013 in its stock market, economic prospects and the 2030 Vision economic plan,\u201d said Khalid Albdah, CEO of Goldman Sachs Saudi Arabia.  In 2017 Goldman received approval to trade equities in Saudi Arabia, joining a growing band of western investment banks and fund managers expanding in the kingdom.  Goldman has been on a hiring spree since gaining its Saudi equities trading licence in August 2017 and has added about seven people to its Saudi sales trading team.  \u201cThey managed to make inroads to both local and foreign businesses,\u201d one financial industry executive said.  Of the 10 top brokers in May, five were foreign, the data showed.  Goldman was a joint financial adviser for the initial public offering (IPO) of Arabian Centres, which listed last month. The offering was the kingdom\u2019s first IPO under its Rule 144a, which allows the sale of securities primarily to qualified institutional buyers in the United States.  Goldman also acted as a stabilising agent for the company after it began trading, buying its shares on the market.  Saudi securities firms such as NCB Capital and Al Rajhi Capital have traditionally been the leading brokers in the domestic market, which first opened to foreigners in 2015.  Late last month the Saudi equity market joined the first phase of passive fund inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Market Index, which is expected to trigger billions of dollars of foreign fund inflows.  In May foreigners bought a record 17.62 billion riyals ($4.7 billion) of Saudi stocks, according to Saudi stock exchange data. Foreign ownership of Saudi stocks stood at 6.6% at May 30, the data showed.  The Saudi index has gained mopre than 12% this year, placing it among the Gulf region\u2019s best performers.

OPEC+, comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers, is scheduled to meet on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, and is likely to discuss extending oil output curbs into next year due to weak demand amid surging COVID-19 infections.  \u201cPotentially complicating the meeting could be a push by the UAE to raise its baseline quota which screens as low relative to that of Saudi and Russia, although we don\u2019t think this will derail an extension,\u201d Goldman said.

Goldman expects OPEC+ to delay its production ramp-up for three months, helping bring the global market deficit back to 1 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2021.  The bank expects Brent prices to average $47 per barrel in the first quarter, if production curbs are extended.  UK bank Barclays also said on Monday it expected OPEC+ to delay ratcheting up production by three months.

Tim Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, was also charged this week.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing and on Monday said certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of the bond sales.  The U.S. Justice Department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.  On Wednesday, Malaysian prosecutors charged the second former Goldman banker, Roger Ng, a Malaysian, with four counts of abetting the bank to provide misleading statements in the offering prospectus for the bonds that the bank helped sell for 1MDB.  Ng, who appeared in court to hear the charges, pleaded not guilty to all of them.  The case will be heard next on March 18, with prosecutor Manoj Kurup saying he needed time to ensure the attendance of Goldman Sachs.  \u201cThey did the principal offense that he abetted. So they must have a chance to defend themselves too,\u201d Kurup told reporters after the court hearing.  \u201cWe already have a summons against Goldman Sachs, but because they\u2019re outside Malaysia, it takes time to do the legal process.\u201d  Kurup did not elaborate when reporters asked which Goldman Sachs officials would be summoned. He said Malaysia would be considering mutual legal arrangements with other countries.  A Goldman Sachs spokesman said none of the Goldman Sachs entities named in the Malaysia charges had received any summons.  In the charge sheets, Malaysia alleged that three units of Goldman Sachs made untrue statements and omitted key facts in offering circulars for the bonds on the 1MDB management and use of proceeds.  Leissner, Malaysian financier Jho Low and a former 1MDB official Jasmine Loo were charged with abetting the bank to commit the offense.  Leissner and Ng were charged by the U.S. Justice Department on Nov. 1.  Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and has agreed to forfeit $43.7 million.  Singapore\u2019s central bank on Wednesday said it had issued a lifetime prohibition order against Leissner.  Malaysia had said Ng would be extradited to the United States to face the charges there, but it was unclear how the new charges against Ng would affect that process.

For 2018, total S&P 500 cash spending is rising by 19 percent, the fastest pace since 2011, they wrote.  The increased cash spending follows last December\u2019s biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code by Congress in over 30 years. The new tax law slashed the corporate income tax rate and charged multinationals a one-time tax on profits held overseas.  Goldman strategists expect S&P 500 buybacks to climb by 22 percent to $940 billion in 2019 versus 2018\u2019s estimated $770 billion.  Capital expenditures are expected to increase by about 9 percent from an estimated $715 billion in 2018 to $780 billion in 2019.  \u201cIn the near term, we expect companies prioritizing buybacks and dividends will continue to outperform firms investing for growth,\u201d Goldman wrote. \u201cReturning cash to shareholders is a winning long-term strategy and performs best when GDP growth is as strong as in 2018.\u201d  The Commerce Department confirmed last week that gross domestic product grew at a 4.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, the fastest pace in nearly four years.

Goldman also said it benefited from higher revenues in client execution including an improved performance in cash products and derivatives.  Shares of the bank were up 1.1% at midday.  However, Goldman\u2019s fixed income business suffered another disappointing quarter with net revenue falling by 13 percent. The bank said that reflected significantly lower net revenue from interest rate products and currencies.  Goldman is shifting the focus of its business model away from trading to a more stable, consumer-oriented revenue stream. Despite the better-than-expected performance, revenue still fell at three of its four major businesses, with the biggest declines in trading and investment management.  Rising geopolitical uncertainties and the impact of future interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve present challenges to efforts by Goldman and its rivals to increase revenue.  Institutional client revenue, which includes trading, slipped 3%, while investment banking revenue was down 9%. However, revenue from the bank\u2019s investing and lending business rose 16%, its highest quarterly performance in eight years.  Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said Goldman had delivered a \u201cpretty good quarter\u201d with most business lines performing \u201ca little better than expected.\u201d  \u201cLooking ahead, we expect management to continue to invest in new initiatives and businesses and return plenty of capital,\u201d Schorr said.

It also announced plans in May to acquire United Capital, a boutique wealth management firm. Solomon said on an analyst call discussing earnings that the United deal would close Tuesday.  Goldman is aiming to generate $5 billion in new revenue by 2020.  While overall revenue slipped in the quarter, lower compensation expenses provided some relief. Total operating expenses were nearly flat at $6.12 billion.  The bank\u2019s net earnings applicable to common shareholders in the second quarter fell 6% to $2.20 billion. Earnings per share fell to $5.81 from $5.98 a year earlier.  Total net revenue fell 2% to $9.46 billion.

Solomon\u2019s promotion from his current role as president and chief operating officer comes months after the 56-year-old investment banker was first reported as next in line to succeed longtime CEO Lloyd Blankfein. His first day in charge is October 1.  \u201cDavid is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs,\u201d Blankfein said in a statement. \u201cHe has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy. Through the talent of our people and the quality of our client franchise, Goldman Sachs is poised to realize the next stage of growth.\u201d  The change comes at a turning point for Goldman Sachs, which is trying to generate another $5 billion in annual revenue by growing its fledgling consumer bank, squeezing more from businesses like asset management and changing the way it approaches trading.  Management detailed parts of that plan last September after years of insisting that Goldman\u2019s once-lucrative trading business would come roaring back to life when markets picked up. Instead, since 2009, Goldman\u2019s annual trading revenue has declined by $20.8 billion.  Unlike Blankfein, who rose through the trading ranks to become CEO, Solomon made a name for himself advising corporations on financing and strategy in Goldman\u2019s investment bank. He joined as a partner in 1999 after working in commercial paper, junk bonds and leveraged finance at firms including Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns.  Alan Schwartz, executive chairman at Guggenheim Partners who worked with Solomon at Bear in the 1990s, said he showed natural leadership qualities early in his career.  \u201cDavid is a very good big picture thinker while at the same time staying on top of all the details,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cFinding both in one individual is unusual.\u201d  Several Goldman bankers who spoke to Reuters said employees in the business have been celebrating Solomon's triumph in a long succession race.

Solomon, President and Chief Operating Officer, Goldman Sachs, speaks at the Milken Institute's 21st Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S. April 30, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Though he was considered a \u201cdark horse\u201d candidate years ago, Solomon managed to outlast a number of rivals, including several from the trading business. Among them are former longtime chief operating officer Gary Cohn, who left Goldman last year for a role in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House that he has since departed, and former co-chief operating officer Harvey Schwartz, who left the bank in April after Solomon was chosen as Blankfein\u2019s successor.  Through most of its history, Goldman has alternated between traders and bankers as CEOs. There is natural tension between the two sides of the house at most Wall Street banks, especially after the trading losses and scandals that stemmed from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Nonetheless, Solomon will have to get traders and bankers to cooperate on the revenue growth plan, which depends partly on the idea that customers should rely on Goldman Sachs not just for merger advice or stock offerings, but for all their borrowing, trading and money management needs.  He may also pursue acquisitions to bolster Goldman\u2019s consumer banking operation, or expand into areas like corporate cash management.  News of Solomon\u2019s appointment came on the same day Goldman reported second-quarter results, which showed a 44 percent profit rise but ongoing struggles in trading.  Beyond the business turnaround, Solomon\u2019s legacy will depend on whether he can fill Blankfein\u2019s shoes.  The 63-year-old CEO, who took the helm in 2006, oversaw Goldman Sachs through its most difficult period in modern history, involving a taxpayer bailout during the financial crisis, protests over Goldman\u2019s role in the crisis and massive regulatory changes that curtailed some of its most lucrative businesses.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had tough days (or a crisis or two),\u201d he joked in an internal memo viewed by Reuters announcing the succession plan.  Blankfein resisted pressure to leave during some of those moments, saying there was no better job to have. But in more recent years, he has joked that he does not want to die on the job like one of his predecessors, Gus Levy, who suffered a fatal stroke at a meeting.  He is stepping away at a time when Goldman Sachs is on steadier footing, but needs fresh leadership to reinvent itself, said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst at Vining Sparks.  \u201cThat is what David Solomon\u2019s challenge is,\u201d said Mosby. \u201cThat is why they\u2019re changing the management team.\u201d","615":"FILE PHOTO - A pump jack stands idle in Dewitt County, Texas January 13, 2016.

The consortium, jointly owned by Goldman Sachs' GS.N West Street Infrastructure Partners and private equity firm Antin, will pay 81 pence a share, a 93 percent premium to Monday's closing price of 42 pence, CityFibre said.  CityFibre, which listed in 2014, is building its own fiber-optic broadband network in Britain, taking on national provider BT BT.L in selected towns and cities.  It signed a partnership last year with Vodafone VOD.L that will see the mobile company market its ultra fast broadband networks in around 12 British towns and cities, starting with Milton Keynes, Aberdeen and Peterborough.  Infrastructure funds are targeting opportunities to invest in Britain\u2019s communications networks, which the government wants to upgrade to \u201cgold standard\u201d fiber connections.  M&G Prudential tied up with broadband provider TalkTalk in February to build a network connecting 3 million British homes and businesses, with an equity investment of up to 500 million pounds and borrowing of around 1 billion pounds.  CityFibre\u2019s chairman Chris Stone said the Goldman Sachs deal would provide long-term funding.  \u201cUnder private ownership, CityFibre will be able to gain alternative and potentially easier access to the financing required for its announced FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) deployment,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis will strengthen the company\u2019s ability to deliver on its vision to provide full fiber infrastructure to 20 percent of the UK market.\u201d  The buyers both said they wanted to support CityFibre\u2019s vision to extend fiber-based broadband networks across Britain.  CityFibre\u2019s shares jumped 89 percent to 79.2 pence a share after the offer, which is backed by 68 percent of existing shareholders, was announced on Tuesday.  Analysts at Macquarie, who rate the company \u201coutperform\u201d, said CityFibre was at the vanguard of FTTH in Britain, but the project was in its infancy and the potential was significant.  \u201cThe offer price of 81 pence (...) is attractive reflecting the early stage of the business, but is well below our long-term target of 150p and significantly undervalues the business in the long term we believe,\u201d they said.  CityFibre\u2019s Chief Executive Greg Mesch said the company had raised 325 million pounds as a listed group, but it was now looking for long-term capital.  \u201cWe think it\u2019s a perfect time to shift from public ownership and public scrutiny to private long-term patient capital while we go through this mass period of construction,\u201d he said.  Its ambitions extend to 5 million premises, which based on average build costs of 500 pounds per premises, would require investment of up to 2.5 billion pounds.  CityFibre also said on Tuesday that its turnover more than doubled last year to 34.8 million pounds, helped by the acquisition of wholesale fiber company Entanet.  Adjusted core earnings for the year to end-December rose to 4.5 million pounds from 2.5 million pounds in 2016, it said.

Blankfein, 63, one of the longest-serving CEOs on Wall Street, has led what is viewed as the most powerful U.S. investment bank for nearly 12 years. He has outlasted calls for his departure in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and stayed in the job even as he battled cancer.  Blankfein appeared to distance himself from the Journal\u2019s report on Friday afternoon.  \u201cIt\u2019s the @WSJ\u2019s announcement...not mine. I feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy,\u201d he tweeted, referring to an incident in the Mark Twain novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment. The bank\u2019s shares closed up 1.6 percent on Friday.  The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Goldman was not looking beyond presidents and co-chief operating officers Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon to replace him. on.wsj.com\/2GapHsu  The two men were promoted to their current positions in December 2016. It follows a typical succession plan pattern at the Wall Street bank, which tends to name two or three people into co-head roles until one of them proves to be the right choice for further promotion.  Schwartz, 53, had been a co-head of trading for several years before being named chief financial officer in 2012.

For years leading into the crisis and coming out of it, the bank relied heavily on trading to bolster its bottom line. But market trends and regulations implemented since 2010 have sapped profits from the trading business.  After long insisting conditions would eventually reverse, management last year outlined a plan to change the nature of Goldman\u2019s trading business by targeting new customers and launching new products, drive more revenue from units such as investment management and push further into consumer lending, a relatively new business for the bank.  Schwartz outlined a target to grow revenue by $5 billion a year in September, after investors pressured the bank to be more transparent about its strategy outlook.  Even with its business challenges, Goldman has remained one of the most profitable big U.S. banks in terms of core earnings relative to shareholder equity. Its stock price has risen 73 percent since Goldman announced in 2006 that Blankfein would become its next CEO through its close on Friday at $270.77.  \u201cOur growth is dependent on the talent of our people, the strength of our culture and the depth and breadth of our client franchise,\u201d Blankfein said last month. \u201cI have enormous confidence in our ability to deliver superior returns to the shareholders over the cycle, as I believe we have.\u201d  Blankfein plans to retire at some point in 2019, which will be Goldman\u2019s 150th anniversary year, the Journal reported. He was named CEO in June 2006 after Hank Paulson left to become U.S. Treasury Secretary.  His former chief operating officer, Gary Cohn, had waited years to succeed Blankfein and left Goldman to join the Trump administration as White House economic adviser. He said on Tuesday he is resigning, without saying what he would do next.","618":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

The headquarters of Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) is seen in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia April 19, 2016. REUTERS\/Faisal Al Nasser  Citigroup Inc C.N has won the mandate to advise Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE, two of the sources said on Monday, while Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are advising Aramco.  Goldman GS.N, Citigroup and BAML BAC.N declined to comment. Michael Klein, whose firm is also known as M. Klein & Company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  State-owned oil company Aramco plans to buy a controlling stake in SABIC, possibly taking the sovereign Public Investment Fund\u2019s (PIF) entire 70 percent holding.  The deal mandate is a major win for Goldman Sachs, which like other Western investment banks has built up its Saudi business to capitalize on the government\u2019s plans to privatize assets and diversify the oil-dominated economy.  Klein was previously picked to advise Saudi Arabia on its planned flotation of Saudi Aramco and has experience working on big chemicals deals, including acting for Dow Chemical on its $130 billion merger with DuPont in 2015.  Investment banking fees in Saudi Arabia are modest compared to elsewhere, while risks are high, making the SABIC deal an especially coveted prize. Riyadh recently shelved plans to float Aramco and has postponed an airport privatization on which Goldman was advising.  Goldman began operating in Riyadh in 2009 and obtained new licenses in 2014 and 2017 that have allowed it to expand. It bought a portion of Aramco\u2019s $10 billion credit facility last year in an attempt to secure a role in the IPO.  Citigroup has also sought to rebuild its presence in Saudi Arabia after an absence of almost 13 years. In January, it won approval to begin investment banking operations there.  M&A RECORD  If Aramco acquires the full SABIC stake, valued at around $70 billion, it will be the kingdom\u2019s biggest M&A deal and provide a boost to the oil major\u2019s downstream business.  SABIC has recently boosted its own holdings, buying a 25 percent stake in Swiss specialty chemical maker Clariant in January. That deal initially faced regulatory delays, but has now been cleared to proceed.  The deal will also provide an alternative source of cash to the PIF, after an initial public offering of Aramco that was supposed to raise $100 billion was shelved.  Analysts estimate the PIF has around $250 billion worth of assets under management. It said last year that it aims to increase its financial clout to around $400 billion.  It already owns stakes in many companies across the kingdom and plans to beef up its overseas expansion, including pledges of $20 billion to a fund with U.S. private equity firm Blackstone and $45 billion to SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund.  Proceeds from the sale of Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world\u2019s fourth largest petrochemicals company, are likely to help fund planned investments at home and abroad.  The PIF and SABIC were not available for immediate comment.","620":"FILE PHOTO: Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, speaks at the Boston College Chief Executives Club luncheon in Boston, MA, U.S., March 22, 2018.

The bank was investigated for its role in raising $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) state fund.  WHAT IS 1MDB?  1MDB is a state fund launched in 2009 by former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak to promote economic development.  HOW DID BILLIONS GO MISSING?  1MDB raised billions of dollars in bonds, ostensibly for investment projects and joint ventures between 2009 and 2013.  Malaysian and U.S. authorities say $4.5 billion, including some of the money Goldman helped raise, was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials of the fund, Najib and others.  The siphoned funds were used to buy luxury assets and real estate, including hotels, a private jet, art by Picasso and Monet, and to finance Hollywood films, U.S. lawsuits said.  The U.S. Department of Justice has sought to recover about $2.1 billion in assets linked to diverted 1MDB funds - the largest ever asset recovery action brought by the agency.  HOW IS GOLDMAN SACHS INVOLVED?  Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries for its role in underwriting the 1MDB bond issues.  The work earned the bank $600 million in fees and led to large bonuses for some of its executives, officials have said, although the bank has disputed that figure.  The Justice Department said on Thursday that Goldman violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials for help in getting or keeping business. Malaysian prosecutors also said bank misled investors over the bond sales.  Goldman has in the past said that certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB officials lied to it about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used.  On Thursday, Goldman\u2019s Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to violating U.S. foreign bribery rules.  HOW MUCH WILL GOLDMAN PAY?  Goldman will pay a $2.3 billion fine to the Justice Department and other regulators, and a further $600 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains to settle the U.S. probe and avoid a criminal conviction at the group level.  This is in addition to the $3.9 billion that Goldman has agreed to pay Malaysia in exchange for dropping all criminal charges against the bank.  On Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s markets watchdog also fined Goldman\u2019s Asia unit $350 million for serious lapses and deficiencies in its management controls that contributed to the misappropriation of $2.6 billion in funds it helped raise for 1MDB.  ARE THERE ANY OTHER CASES AGAINST GOLDMAN?  The Justice Department has filed criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers tied to the scandal, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng.  Leissner plead guilty to the charges last year, while Ng\u2019s case is pending in a New York court. Ng is expected to face separate charges in Malaysia after his U.S. trial concludes.  This week, Abu Dhabi\u2019s International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) dropped a lawsuit against Goldman to recover losses suffered from the bank\u2019s dealings with 1MDB.  The lawsuit alleged that Goldman conspired with unidentified people from Malaysia to bribe two former IPIC executives to further their business at its expense.  HOW MUCH MORE IS BEING SOUGHT?  The Justice Department has recovered or assisted Malaysia in recovering nearly $1.1 billion in 1MDB-linked assets.  Malaysian authorities say at least $4.3 billion more are still unaccounted for.  WHO ELSE HAS BEEN IMPLICATED?  After losing an election in 2018, Najib has been charged with 42 criminal offences in Malaysia, mostly linked to losses at 1MDB and other state entities.  In July, he was found guilty of corruption and money laundering for illegally receiving $10 million from a former 1MDB unit and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Najib denies wrongdoing and has filed an appeal.  Elliott Broidy, a former fund-raiser for U.S. President Donald Trump, pleaded guilty this week to a charge that he illegally lobbied Trump to drop an investigation into 1MDB.  Malaysian and U.S. authorities have also filed charges against Malaysian financier Jho Low for his alleged central role in the 1MDB fraud. Low has denied wrongdoing and his whereabouts is unknown.","622":"DUBAI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has added U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs as a bookrunner for a planned bond which it will use to help finance its acquisition of a stake in Saudi Arabian Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) , two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  U.S. banks advised on 56 percent of Brazilian share offerings this year, the data shows, after trailing local banks last year with only 29.7 percent. That means American banks have grabbed a much higher portion of the $280 million in fees paid by Brazilian companies so far this year.  About 27 percent of that went to Goldman Sachs, which managed the country\u2019s two largest IPOs of the year: card processing companies PagSeguro and StoneCo Ltd, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq respectively, followed by Morgan Stanley, with 21 percent.  PagSeguro Digital Ltd's PAGS.N listing in particular was pivotal to convincing Brazilian companies they could win better valuations abroad, bankers say.  The credit card processor is valued at $6.8 billion, ahead of its largest competitor, Cielo SA CIEL3.SA.  PagSeguro, which describes itself as a \"financial technology solution company\" was compared by its bankers to companies like digital payments platform PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O, which trades at over 45 times earnings.  Even after its shares swooned following its third-quarter earnings report, PagSeguro still trades at 24 times earnings, more than triple Cielo\u2019s multiples.  The offering showed the benefit of a U.S. listing for companies with a strong technology component. U.S. exchanges offer more \u201ccomparables\u201d like PayPal to help define the stock price and access to technology investors, bankers say.  \u201cWe are starting to see Brazilian clients tap NYSE or NASDAQ for their IPOs, especially the tech-related companies. Therefore, it is natural that U.S. banks lead transactions more often\u201d, said Pedro Juliano, Brazil head of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The improving IPO scenario reflects wider optimism about recovering capital markets that has several U.S. banks hiring again after slashing staffing during the country\u2019s deepest recession in a generation.  Goldman, for example, opened a new office in Rio de Janeiro, the center of Brazil\u2019s oil industry, in October, and has hired 15 senior bankers in its Sao Paulo office over the last 18 months.  U.S. listings command higher fees - usually more than 4 percent of the IPO\u2019s value - than Brazilian ones, which rarely top this percentage.  For example, Brazilian educational software firm Arco Platform Ltd ARCE.O paid banks 6 percent of its September Nasdaq IPO proceeds.  The shift is also a sign that Brazilian companies have grown less reliant on local banks, which in the past often demanded a piece of any capital markets transaction - like an IPO - as a condition to increase or keep loan lines open.  \u201cCompanies do not need so much credit now, and are less inclined to pick banks for their equity transactions based on loans availability,\u201d said Hans Lin, head of investment banking in Brazil for Bank of America.  Still, some domestic banks are fighting back.  Itau Unibanco Holding SA, for example, which was named global coordinator for Arco\u2019s $220 million IPO, is working to increase its knowledge about tech companies in Brazil to grab potential deals.  \u201cIt is counter-intuitive to think that a Brazilian bank will lead a share offering outside Brazil, but it is the case as offerings in Brazil are placed mostly with international investors as well. We are very active in both the U.S. and Brazilian markets,\u201d said Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Ita\u00fa BBA.  But local banks may have a tough time reeling in deep-pocketed investors like Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Alibaba\u2019s payment affiliate Ant Financial, both cornerstone investors in StoneCo\u2019s $1.5 billion IPO in October.  A final lure of U.S. markets to certain Brazilian startups are capital structures that allow controlling shareholders to keep most voting power. PagSeguro, Stone and Arco all used such structures, which are barred locally.","624":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia\u2019s new government would not be willing to accept even compensation of $3 billion from Goldman Sachs in a settlement over the 1MDB scandal, the finance minister told Reuters, ruling out a figure that is far higher than the bank offered last year.  The Southeast Asian nation has charged Goldman Sachs and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totalling $6.5 billion that the U.S. bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Bhd).

Rattled by the recent downturn in the sector and long-term concerns over oil demand and the switch to renewables, Big Oil is facing an unprecedented challenge.  \u201cWe\u2019re firmly through that survival phase and the better capitalized players are now positioned to do well on the other side of it,\u201d Andrew Fry, global head of energy at Goldman said at the Oil & Money conference in London.  Companies typically seek to increase spending as they emerge from a downturn in order to capture low drilling costs and an expected supply shortage.  But this time round, the barriers for investments are high, with investors seeking returns of as much as 15 to 20 percent from multi-billion dollar oil and gas projects, Fry said.  \u201cIn the near term the focus is on returns as opposed to growth for the sake of growth,\u201d he said.  As a result, companies are currently focusing on buying back shares and paying dividends to investors with the excess cash they generate.  \u201cFor the first time since the downturn, the oil companies now have their balance sheets in order. They are all starting to think about growth but it is very conservative,\u201d James Janoskey, global co-head of oil and gas at JPMorgan, said.  \u201cWhen we came out of downturns in the past, we didn\u2019t have energy transition issues and there probably wasn\u2019t that much pressure from investors.\u201d  M&A  Capital expenditure among the world\u2019s top oil companies is expected to rise to $140 billion by 2021, from the current $100 billion, but will remain well below the $200 billion before the 2014 oil price collapse, according to Adam Brett, HSBC global head of natural resources advisory.  That means oil majors will show very healthy returns on capital invested, he added.  He said that even in the United States, where oil output has resumed spectacular growth on the back of high oil prices, large companies will try to maintain capital discipline and focus on returns rather than pure production growth.  \u201cFor Big Oil, value will prevail over volume,\u201d Brett said, adding that most remuneration reports now made clear that top executives at oil majors are being rewarded for delivering robust cash flows rather than production increases.  Acquisitions, another way to boost production and reserves, are also expected to be constrained and focused.  Energy mergers and acquisitions amounted to $360 billion last year and stand at $280 billion so far this year, said Brett.  Although the volume of M&A has been relatively stable in recent years, the structure has changed since China largely suspended its buying spree over the past three years, he said.  An anti-corruption drive and revisions of overly expensive deals have prompted China to cut down on buying resources around the world in the past three years.  Brett said that M&A were currently dominated by downstream and mid-stream transactions with the share of upstream declining to 35-40 percent, from as high as 60-70 percent when China was an active asset buyer.  \u201cYou see much more downstream M&A activity. And I expect this to continue in the years ahead,\u201d Brett said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Stock trading and equity underwriting helped Goldman top profit estimates in the third quarter which was the first for Solomon who aims to reduce the bank\u2019s reliance on trading revenues after they were crimped by tougher regulations in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  A key part of the plan has been to deliver $1 billion in extra revenue from its new consumer banking business, Marcus, by 2020. Some analysts question how Marcus will be able to compete with rivals, such as Citigroup C.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N which have full retail banks, without sacrificing credit quality.  Goldman\u2019s incoming chief financial officer Stephen Scherr, who will take up the position in November, said the bank would slow Marcus\u2019s expansion if credit conditions deteriorate and borrowers show signs of defaulting in loans.  \u201cIf, in fact, the market and the environment is not hospitable to us, we will watch it carefully, but not grow against the gale,\u201d he told analysts on a call on Tuesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t see that wind yet so we\u2019ll continue to grow.\u201d  Rising wages and tax cuts have fueled a U.S. consumer spending splurge, and Scherr, currently head of Goldman\u2019s consumer and commercial lending operation, acknowledged there are concerns the credit cycle is nearing a peak, although there was no \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d conditions would take a turn for the worse.  Marcus, launched in 2016, had handed out $4 billion in loans as of June 30, a number dwarfed by JP Morgan\u2019s $400 billion consumer loan book.  Goldman Sachs said net earnings attributable to common shareholders rose to $2.45 billion, or $6.28 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $2.04 billion, or $5.02 per share in the year-earlier period. Analysts on average were looking for $5.38 per share, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  Net revenue rose 3.8 percent to $8.65 billion.  Equities trading revenue drove part of the beat, rising 8 percent to $1.79 billion. However, bond trading revenue fell 10 percent to $1.31 billion.  Scherr will take over from current chief financial officer Marty Chavez as CFO on Nov. 5 when Chavez becomes co-head of Goldman\u2019s trading business.  Shares of Goldman closed up 3.0 percent.

Like fellow Wall Street trading powerhouse Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley capitalized on a flurry of activity in financial markets. Clients bought and sold securities in response to the coronavirus pandemic, and many companies went public or raised fresh capital.  While Morgan Stanley\u2019s trading unit did not hit the record highs of the previous quarter, the latest performance was still good enough to help the bank comfortably beat expectations.  Striking an upbeat tone about future growth, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said the bank was encouraged by client engagement across all its businesses in the first few weeks of the fourth quarter.  Even as trading returns to the spotlight amid the pandemic, Chief Executive James Gorman has been taking steps to shore up Morgan Stanley\u2019s asset and wealth management businesses to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking.  Gorman engineered two large back-to-back acquisitions recently - a $7 billion deal to buy Eaton Vance Corp to expand its investment-management business immediately after closing its $13 billion acquisition of discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp. Executives said they are done with deals for awhile as they integrate those companies.  \u201cWe clearly have our plate full,\u201d Pruzan said in an interview.  FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Morgan Stanley shares rose 1.5% to $51.40 in afternoon trading.  The bank\u2019s wealth management arm also turned in a solid quarter with a 7% jump in revenue to $4.7 billion.  Its return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profits, came in at 15%, in line with the target Gorman had set out earlier this year.  In contrast to Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, other big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup C.N, Bank of America BAC.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N are more exposed to weak activity in the real economy, plus historically low interest rates. They have collectively set aside tens of billions of dollars' worth of provisions this year to cover bad loans.  Even so, most large banks beat profit estimates this quarter, partly due to muted expectations.  ANOTHER STRONG QUARTER  Revenue from Morgan Stanley\u2019s institutional securities division, which is houses its investment banking and trading businesses, rose 21% to $6.1 billion.  Equities underwriting revenue more than doubled to $874 million due to handsome fees from a number of high-profile initial public offerings such as Snowflake Inc SNOW.N, Royalty Pharma RPRX.O, KE Holdings Inc BEKE.N and Warner Music WMG.O.  But revenue from underwriting bonds dropped from last year due to declines in loan issuances and muted dealmaking activity.  Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 26% to $2.60 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Earnings per share rose to $1.66, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.28 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue also comfortably beat estimates, rising 16% to $11.7 billion, as all three of its main businesses posted gains.

Bankers working on sensitive deals were told to seek special permission from top management if they still wanted to fly into Milan, Bologna or other northern Italian towns, the sources said.  Goldman said its travel restrictions applied to Italy\u2019s Lombardy and Veneto regions, and South Korea. It also advised staff against travel to, from and within the rest of Italy. Those who recently visited affected areas were told to isolate themselves and stay away from the office for at least 14 days.

Paris-based bankers have been urged to follow recommendations issued by the French government for people returning from \u201crisky countries\u201d - now including northern Italy - to stay home for 14 days, two of the sources said.  STUCK AT HOME  Nearly 300 people in Italy have come down with the virus since Friday, latest data showed, the vast majority of them in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto.  Most financial institutions have told their employees living near the affected areas to work from home rather than the office and postpone business trips.  Morgan Stanley, Lazard and Barclays have empty offices in Milan as most staff are working remotely, three other sources said.  Credit Suisse has also encouraged local bankers to stay home and avoid face-to-face client visits, they said.  The banks declined to comment.  Milan-based Mediobanca and UniCredit issued statements to emphasize their respective commitment to keeping employees safe at home.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Goldman\u2019s Ayco unit provides high-end tax and wealth advice to top executives at some 400 companies, including 60 Fortune 100 companies. According to the bank\u2019s estimates these firms employ at least 8 million people and Goldman now wants them as clients, too.  Goldman began rolling out a new Ayco personal finance website for rank-and-file workers in October and has so far signed up 70 companies. By the end of 2019, the bank hopes to have signed up around 100 companies, which employ 2 million employees, Larry Restieri, the unit\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview this month.  In recent weeks, it has also started pitching high-yield savings accounts and personal loans from its online bank Marcus through the Ayco website, Restieri added.  The rollout is the latest effort of the Wall Street trading and advisory firm to reposition itself as a traditional bank.  Goldman seeks to reach a wider customer base. Its trading business has been shrinking. In the first quarter, the bank\u2019s corporate clients helped it grow mergers and acquisitions revenue but overall revenue slumped.  Chief Executive David Solomon must deliver on a target of $5 billion in new annual revenue by 2020 or risk getting squeezed by rival behemoths like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp . [tmsnrt.rs\/2H81K9a]  The bank took its first step toward that goal with the creation of Marcus in 2016. In March, Goldman announced a co-branded credit card with Apple Inc, which will connect it to hundreds of millions of iPhone users.  Expanding Ayco is the next step into the $9 trillion U.S. mass affluent customer market and offers the bank an opportunity to gain new clients cheaply.  The primary cost to the bank - developing the online platform - will be offset by fees companies will pay to offer the service to their workers, Goldman executives said.  Some investors fret Goldman is expanding into an area where it has little experience. They worry the bank is making $40,000 personal loans and extending credit card debt to iPhone users when the economy is showing signs of slowing.  Goldman thinks otherwise. Executives there say the Ayco expansion is part of a bigger plan, culminating with the launch of a retail wealth management offering later this year.  Restieri said it is too early to put numbers on the contribution the expanded Ayco could make toward Goldman\u2019s $5 billion goal.  In November, the bank said that it was halfway toward meeting that target and that Ayco, along with private wealth management and asset management, had so far contributed $400 million.  ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE  Ayco\u2019s website, called Financial Wellness, starts with an online questionnaire. Employees of corporate clients such as Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc answer questions like, \u201cDo you generally live within your means?\u201d and \u201cDo you have an emergency fund?\u201d  After workers answer questions about their savings, credit card debt, student loans and other finances, Ayco offers what it calls solutions such as Marcus savings accounts, personal loans or products from other financial institutions.  Adoption rates are a question. One company that offered a financial incentive got as much as 60 percent of its employees to use Financial Wellness. Others have seen lower pick-up rates.  But as Ayco rolls out its mass-market offering, Restieri thinks it will benefit from brand cachet of having already served the bosses.  \u201cWhen this offering is presented to employees, the top C-suite of those companies would have already been using us for 10-15 years,\u201d Restieri said.","641":"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs signaled Friday that it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review a decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholding certification of a class of investors who contend the bank lied about putting clients\u2019 interests ahead of its own in advance of revelations about Goldman\u2019s controversial Abacus CDO offering.  The hint came in the form of a motion asking the 2nd Circuit to stay the case in advance of Goldman's petition for Supreme Court review. I sincerely doubt the 2nd Circuit will grant the stay. As I\u2019ll explain, the court has twice agreed to Goldman\u2019s interlocutory requests to review class certification rulings by the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty of Manhattan. And after the 2nd Circuit\u2019s ruling in April, the bank asked for a rehearing, mustering considerable amicus support from the business lobby. The 2nd Circuit denied that request on June 15. The new stay motion, in other words, isn\u2019t telling the 2nd Circuit anything it hasn\u2019t already heard from Goldman and its supporters.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  But the stay motion serves as a preview of the arguments that Goldman Sachs will eventually make at the Supreme Court in a case that \u2013 at least according to the bank and the business lobby \u2013 gives shareholders nearly unfettered power to win certification of class actions based on anodyne and ubiquitous corporate mission statements. The Supreme Court, as you know, held in 2014\u2019s Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund that defendants are entitled to attempt to rebut the presumption that investors relied on corporate misrepresentations, the keystone of shareholder class actions. Goldman is poised to argue that the 2nd Circuit has tied defendants\u2019 hands by refusing to consider the nature of the alleged corporate lies.  I reached out to Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell, who successfully represented the shareholders suing Goldman at the 2nd Circuit. He did not provide comment on Goldman\u2019s motion. The lead plaintiff in the class action is the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Labaton Sucharow are lead counsel.  The case is based on Goldman Sachs\u2019 notorious Abacus collateralized debt obligation, a subprime mortgage-based financial instrument that Goldman assembled in 2007 at the request of, and with assistance from, the hedge fund Paulson & Co. In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the Securities & Exchange Commission to resolve allegations that it duped Abacus investors by failing to disclose Paulson\u2019s involvement \u2013 and failing to reveal that the hedge fund had simultaneously bet on the CDO to fail. (Goldman acknowledged in the settlement that its marketing materials contained incomplete information.)  The Arkansas Teachers\u2019 case alleges that Goldman Sachs misled its shareholders in corporate statements about the bank\u2019s robust conflict of interest policies and commitment to putting its clients\u2019 interests ahead of its own. The shareholders\u2019 theory is that Goldman\u2019s share price remained artificially high because investors believed the bank\u2019s allegedly false statements and ultimately fell when revelations about Abacus and related CDOs proved the falsity of those assurances.  Goldman has long argued, among other points, that generic statements about business integrity were immaterial to investors. Broadly speaking, the bank contended that its share price did not fall because investors suddenly realized they\u2019d been misled about Goldman\u2019s commitment to clients\u2019 interests \u2013 but rather because shareholders were rattled by news of the government\u2019s investigation of Abacus and other Goldman CDOs.  The class action first came to the 2nd Circuit in 2018. The appeals court vacated Judge Crotty\u2019s original class certification decision and remanded the case with instructions that he decide whether Goldman could meet a burden of persuasion to rebut the presumption that shareholders relied on its alleged misrepresentations.  In the case\u2019s second interlocutory trip to the appeals court, the 2nd Circuit majority, Judges Richard Wesley and Denny Chin, said Judge Crotty had fairly weighed the evidence when he concluded that the bank failed rebut the presumption. In dissent, Judge Richard Sullivan said the majority had looked at the issue from the wrong vantage point. No reasonable investor, Judge Sullivan said, could have relied on Goldman\u2019s generic assurances about its business practices.  That\u2019s the theme Goldman is emphasizing in the new stay motion, seemingly in a preview of the points it will eventually argue to the Supreme Court. (The bank has added counsel from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to the Sullivan & Cromwell team that has represented it throughout this decade-long case.) According to Goldman, the 2nd Circuit majority disregarded the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in the 2014 Halliburton decision by failing to consider whether the bank\u2019s allegedly deceptive representations about its business practices were inherently immaterial and therefore had no impact on Goldman\u2019s share price.  \u201cThis case is an excellent vehicle for the Supreme Court to address whether the nature of challenged statements may be used to show lack of price impact at the class-certification stage, because that issue is outcome-determinative,\u201d the motion said. \u201cIf the court had allowed itself to consider the nature of these generic statements, this case would have been decided in defendants\u2019 favor.\u201d  The Supreme Court held in 2013\u2019s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans that shareholders need not prove the materiality of alleged corporate misrepresentations in order to win class certification. But Goldman\u2019s stay motion argues that the 2nd Circuit went too far by deciding not even to consider materiality, ignoring Halliburton\u2019s holding that (in the bank\u2019s description) \u201cdefendants are entitled to present price impact evidence at the class-certification stage even if such evidence also bears on a merits issue.\u201d  As I said, I don\u2019t think the 2nd Circuit will be swayed by the motion. Will the Supreme Court? Goldman Sachs does not cite a circuit split on whether courts can consider the materiality of alleged misstatements in deciding if defendants have rebutted the presumption of reliance. Instead, Goldman appears to be hoping that the justices will take note of its argument that the 2nd Circuit has drastically expanded corporate exposure to shareholders by making it impossible to defeat class certification in cases based on generic statements of business principles.  That seems like a tough sell, but you can be sure Goldman won\u2019t settle this case until it has made its pitch at the Supreme Court.","642":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

Erica P. John Fund. The justices will review a split 2020 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the certification of a class of Goldman Sachs shareholders to proceed with claims that the bank lied to shareholders when it touted its business principles and procedures for averting conflicts with investors.  Goldman\u2019s counsel at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison pitched the case to the Supreme Court as an opportunity to correct a misreading of its Halliburton precedent before plaintiffs lawyers run wild with a theory of shareholder class actions that the Supreme Court has never even recognized. In Halliburton, Goldman argued, the Supreme Court held that defendants can defeat class certification by showing that their alleged misrepresentations did not impact their share price. According to Goldman, there\u2019s no way that investors relied on its anodyne statements of business principles. By refusing to consider the nature of the alleged misrepresentations in the Goldman case, the 2nd Circuit majority defied Halliburton and gave shareholder lawyers a glide path to class certification, Goldman argued.

Connecticut Retirement Plans. \u201cIn Amgen, this court could not have been clearer that plaintiffs are \u2018not required to prove the materiality of (a defendant's) alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the class-certification stage,\u2019\u201d the opposition brief said, quoting the Supreme Court\u2019s Amgen ruling. Shareholders downplayed the significance of the question Goldman presented, arguing that defendants in securities class actions can contest the materiality of alleged misstatements when they first move for shareholder cases to be dismissed. And if the statements are truly immaterial, shareholders said, then defendants ought to be able to muster evidence that the revelation of their falsity did not impact share price.  At least four justices agreed with Goldman that the Supreme Court has to look again at the interplay between its Halliburton and Amgen precedent \u2013 which, as the 7th Circuit held in July in In re: Allstate Securities Litigation requires trial judges to \u201csplit some very fine hairs.\u201d (Notably, Justice Amy Coney Barrett was on the 7th Circuit\u2019s Allstate panel before she was elevated to the Supreme Court, although she did not write the opinion.) The Allstate decision -- which Goldman and shareholders both cited throughout their briefs \u2013 was refreshingly frank about how hard it has been for lower courts to reconcile Amgen\u2019s prohibition on considering the materiality of alleged misstatements with Halliburton\u2019s leeway for defendants to contest the price impact of alleged misrepresentations.  The case, in other words, should bring some clarity to a murky aspect of securities class action litigation. The question is whether that clarity will help shareholders or defendants.  The Goldman case, as you probably recall, stems from the bank\u2019s sale of complex collateralized debt obligations it assembled with the assistance of the hedge fund Paulson & Co. Goldman did not disclose to investors that Paulson was involved in structuring the CDOs \u2013 not that Paulson had essentially bet on the CDOs to fail. Goldman ended up reaching a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010 over the CDOs, which included the infamous Abacus security. The bank\u2019s shareholders, led by the Arkansas Teachers Retirement System, alleged that revelations about the CDOs exposed the falsity of Goldman Sachs\u2019 statements about avoiding conflicts of interest and putting its clients\u2019 interests first. Goldman\u2019s exposure in the shareholder class action, according to the bank\u2019s filings at the Supreme Court, is as much as $13 billion.  Shareholders\u2019 theory in the Goldman case is a bit of twist on the classic model of securities fraud class actions, in which a defendant\u2019s share price rises in response to a corporate announcement and then falls when the announcement turns out to be false. Goldman\u2019s shareholders instead asserted that the bank\u2019s share price was maintained at an artificially high level because investors trusted Goldman\u2019s long-running assurances about its ethical conduct. When news of Paulson\u2019s influence on the CDOs emerged, shareholders alleged, the fall in Goldman\u2019s share price revealed the impact of the bank\u2019s alleged misrepresentations.  Price-maintenance class actions like the Goldman case are increasingly common. That\u2019s why Goldman contends the stakes are so high at the Supreme Court. According to the bank -- and the business lobby, which has stood by Goldman\u2019s side during two trips to the 2nd Circuit and in certiorari briefing at the Supreme Court \u2013 price-maintenance theories allow shareholders to claim fraud without showing that a specific corporate announcement drove the share price up. And, according to Goldman and its amici, by allowing shareholders to proceed as a class based on the alleged falsity of generic statements of business principles, the 2nd Circuit has exposed companies to price-maintenance securities class actions whenever their share price falls in response to negative news.  \u201cThis theory,\u201d said Columbia law professor John Coffee in an email to my colleague Nate Raymond, \u201cspares the plaintiffs from having to prove a specific impact on the stock price.\u201d The Supreme Court has never examined a shareholder class action asserting that the defendant\u2019s share price was artificially propped up by misrepresentations, Coffee said, so the justices\u2019 eventual decision could thwart this burgeoning form of securities litigation.  Or not. Shareholders, after all, argued in their brief opposing certiorari that Goldman had plenty of chances to show that the statement at the heart of the case didn\u2019t matter to shareholders. It argued as much in its motion to dismiss the suit, which failed. And it had an opportunity, as required by the Supreme Court\u2019s Halliburton decision, to rebut shareholders\u2019 evidence of price impact in contesting class certification, shareholders said. The bank\u2019s evidence, including expert studies on why its share price dropped after Abacus revelations, simply failed to persuade the 2nd Circuit that its alleged misrepresentations didn\u2019t affect the share price, according to shareholders.  Shareholder counsel Thomas Goldstein told me by email that the Supreme Court, after all, has already heard defendants argue back in the Amgen case that they should be permitted to challenge materiality to defeat class certification. The court rejected those arguments then, Goldstein said, and should do so again in the Goldman case.  \u201cGoldman\u2019s concern that it needs to be able to disprove materiality early in the case is a red herring, because a defendant can make that motion at any time in a motion to dismiss, including pre-certification,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cGoldman tried that here, and the district court correctly found that its statements were material.\u201d Goldstein also said that it is \u201cbizarre\u201d for the bank to insist that its shareholders \u201cwould have disbelieved its own denials that it had massive, undisclosed conflicts of interest in betting against its own customers.\u201d  Goldman Supreme Court counsel Kannon Shanmugam of Paul Weiss and longtime counsel Robert Giuffra of Sullivan & Cromwell declined to comment.","644":"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Monday refused bail to former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng, pending his extradition to the United States where he faces charges related to suspected money laundering of funds siphoned off from state fund 1MDB.  Ng has been detained in Kuala Lumpur since Nov. 1, shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against him, another Goldman Sachs official Tim Leissner, and Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho over the alleged theft of billions of dollars from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).  Leissner, a former partner for Goldman Sachs in Asia, pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, while Low has denied wrongdoing and remains at large.  Malaysian prosecutors have filed separate criminal charges against the three, as well as an application to extradite Ng to the United States.  Goldman Sachs has consistently denied wrongdoing.  Defense lawyer Tan Hock Chuan last week requested that Ng be released on bail on medical grounds, pending the outcome of the extradition proceeding.  Judge Edwin Paramjothy Michael Muniandy, however, dismissed the request on Monday saying there was insufficient evidence that Ng was not fit enough to remain in custody.  The judge said the court also considered Ng a serious flight risk, given the gravity and high-profile nature of the cases against him in Malaysia and the United States.  \u201cWith the likelihood that the respondent will abscond, I\u2019m of the considered view that the respondent\u2019s presence (in court) cannot be secured by the setting of bail or the setting of any condition to the granting of bail,\u201d he said.  Tan said he would appeal the judge\u2019s ruling and that a reply against Ng\u2019s extradition would be filed by Feb. 15.  According to prosecutors, Goldman Sachs generated about $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB, which included three bond offerings in 2012 and 2013 that raised $6.5 billion.  Leissner, Ng and others received large bonuses in connection with that revenue.  Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing saying certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to the bank about the proceeds of bond sales.  The Malaysian government has said it is seeking up to $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs over its dealings with 1MDB.  The U.S. Justice Department has estimated that a total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level 1MDB fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014, including some of the funds that Goldman Sachs helped raise.  The 1MDB scandal erupted in 2015, and led to last year\u2019s electoral defeat of Najib Razak, ending his near decade long stint as prime minister.  The new government led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reopened investigations into 1MDB and charged Najib, who is now facing four trials involving a total of 39 criminal charges related to the fund\u2019s losses.  He has plead not guilty to all charges.  In a separate court on Monday, a judge fixed July 8 for the opening of one of those trials.  Najib, along with his former treasury chief Mohamad Irwan Serigar Abdullah, were each charged with six counts of criminal breach of trust in the case, which involves the alleged misappropriation of about $1.5 billion in government funds.  Prosecutors have prepared a list of 138 witnesses for the trial, which is scheduled to run until Aug. 22, government lawyer Jamil Aripin told the court.","645":"Goldman Sachs Co-President and Co-Chief Operating Officer David Solomon plays disc jockey at a lounge called Libation in New York City, U.S. Saturday, April 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Jennifer Ablan  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - David Solomon is like the owner of a Ferrari who hasn\u2019t been given the keys. The new Goldman Sachs boss starts 2019 with one of Wall Street\u2019s most prestigious jobs, and something to prove. This could be the first year in over a decade that the $63 billion bank starts with a smaller market capitalization than its chief rival, Morgan Stanley.  Goldman set out in 2017 to create $5 billion of new revenue streams, and Solomon starts with half that figure already in the bag. But there\u2019s a lot to play for. Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman runs a bank with earnings that are lower but less subject to the vicissitudes of the market. Goldman makes around 57 percent of its revenue from predictable businesses other than trading and investment. At Morgan Stanley it\u2019s nearly two-thirds.  Solomon is growing Goldman\u2019s private wealth business, which services the ultra-rich, adding almost one-third more advisers by 2020. He could go further by addressing one of Goldman\u2019s least lustrous businesses: asset management. That generates stable, predictable fee income. But its operating margin of just over 20 percent is half what the group\u2019s investment bank makes, and below the 33 percent industry average, as measured by McKinsey.  The bar for doing a big deal is extremely high, Solomon has said. But buying a rival like the $22 billion T. Rowe Price, which has double Goldman\u2019s profitability in asset management, would help. It would take Goldman\u2019s client assets to $2.6 trillion and boost stable revenue sources to over 60 percent of the total.  There\u2019s one big, shadowy problem: 1MDB. Goldman is being investigated by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve for its role raising funds for the Malaysian fund in 2012 and 2013, some of which ended up paid out as bribes. Two former Goldmanites have been indicted; others knew about the misdeeds, the DOJ says. A 10-digit fine is likely, but a time-suck for Solomon is certain.  Expect Goldman to settle as early as it can. But Solomon will probably have to oversee a sweeping internal cleanup, and \u2013 even though not implicated in 1MDB himself \u2013 could be called to Washington to answer publicly to a newly Democrat-run House of Representatives. All when he\u2019d rather be growing his way to greatness, and showing Morgan Stanley a clean pair of heels.  - This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2019.

The bank on Tuesday confirmed Solomon will take over from Lloyd Blankfein, who has held the position for 12 years, on Oct. 1, ending months of speculation. Solomon is tasked with executing a plan to boost revenue by entering new businesses and refashioning old ones.  The bank has pledged $5 billion more in annual revenue by growing its fledgling consumer bank, squeezing more from businesses like asset management and changing how it approaches trading.  Once considered the most savvy Wall Street trading house, it has suffered because of tougher regulation since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and low market volatility crimping revenues.  Goldman\u2019s quarterly profit topped analyst estimates, but equities trading was flat and higher fixed-income trading followed a notably weak year-ago period.  Its shares, down 10.6 percent since the start of the year, were down 1.6 percent at midday.  In a research note, Wells Fargo analysts attributed the decline to questions about the bank\u2019s shift in focus and noted Solomon\u2019s absence from the earnings call.  Goldman Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez told analysts on the call that Solomon\u2019s promotion was \u201call part of the strategy.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ll see here the emphasis on more recurring fee-based revenue and you\u2019ve seen that in the results. The emphasis on the growth plan, on driving revenue and earnings growth,\u201d he said.  FILE PHOTO: A view of the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S. on July 16, 2013. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Chavez was also questioned on whether the bank was looking to improve disclosure and transparency for newer businesses.  The bank gave some details on its new consumer lending business, Marcus, for which it has big ambitions, including a planned launch in Britain. Marcus\u2019 loan book currently totals just $3.1 billion compared with rival JP Morgan\u2019s $400 billion consumer loan book.  Chavez was asked why Marcus has yet to offer a banking app at a time when mobile banking is becoming the primary way customers transact.  Analysts also asked why Goldman\u2019s compensation ratio had declined and for details on Goldman\u2019s investing and lending division and planned cash management push.  Second-quarter profit rose 44 percent to $2.3 billion, or $5.98 per share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.95 per share. Analysts\u2019 average estimate was for $4.46 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Analysts suggested investing and lending business and the bank setting aside less money for bonuses fueled the profit beat.  Goldman said bond trading revenue climbed 45 percent from an unusually weak year-ago quarter.  In equity trading, Goldman Sachs lagged rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, all of which reported gains.  Total revenue rose 19 percent to $9.4 billion, including increases in everything except fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.  The bank\u2019s compensation ratio, which measures dollars per revenue set aside for pay and benefits, declined to 39 percent from 41 percent in the prior and year-ago quarter.","647":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

Now that trading has picked up, Wall Street is hoping the bank can do even better.  On Tuesday, Goldman\u2019s chief executive officer, Lloyd Blankfein, is scheduled to speak at an industry conference in Miami Beach, where he intends to provide more information about the revenue-boosting effort.  It will be the first time Blankfein himself tries to persuade investors with a formal, public presentation about the lofty goals Goldman has set. Since his deputies first laid out the revenue-growth strategy in September, analysts have peppered executives with questions about the underlying assumptions and cited concerns raised by investors.  For instance, Instinet analyst Steven Chubak told Goldman\u2019s finance chief in October that many of his clients wanted to know why Goldman thinks it can boost investment management revenue by $1 billion, given the challenges money managers are facing more broadly. In a recent report, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said shareholders remain \u201cskeptical\u201d about other components of Goldman\u2019s revenue growth plan, like consumer lending, despite assurances from senior executives.  \u201cMr. Blankfein will be providing an update on our business to investors (Tuesday), and we are in the early stages of delivering on the growth plan we outlined last fall,\u201d a Goldman spokeswoman said in an email.  Wall Street is hesitant to forecast that Goldman will be able to generate any of the promised $5 billion, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in an interview.  \u201cThis is the environment that Goldman has been waiting for all decade,\u201d said Mayo, who expects the bank to achieve $3 billion of its $5 billion target helped by volatility returning to stock and bond markets globally.  \u201cIf Goldman doesn\u2019t get it right in 2018, then management has some serious questions to ask.\u201d  Trading had been a profit engine for Goldman Sachs for the decade leading into the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but lethargic markets, new regulations and tougher competition have since upended the business.  In 2009, Goldman boasted 19 percent market share in bond trading, which generated $121 billion in revenue across Wall Street, according to the bank\u2019s September presentation. But Goldman since lost nearly half that share as the revenue pool has declined by nearly half. Last year the bank reported its worst bond trading results since 2008, with revenue dropping 30 percent.  As a result, Goldman is trying to grow businesses like investment management, while trying to generate more trading revenue from existing customers as well as new ones. It is also diving into Main Street banking, an area where it never previously had significant operations.  Goldman launched its digital consumer bank Marcus in 2016, primarily targeting credit-card borrowers who want to refinance into cheaper loans. By the end of last year, Marcus had originated $2.3 billion in loans, and management expects to grow that figure by $13 billion through 2020. The growth rate has caused concern among some investors and analysts, given recent signs across the industry that consumer credit risk is on the rise, particularly in cards.  Analysts are hoping Blankfein will talk about bond trading on Tuesday and also provide more details on the revenue growth initiative. Some said the presentation itself is a step in the right direction for a bank that historically disclosed little about its strategy and declined to issue financial targets the way rivals like Morgan Stanley routinely do.  \u201cOver the last many years, Goldman has been very shy about what it\u2019s going to do, so you never had a full score card to measure against,\u201d said Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg. \u201cThis is a very different Goldman Sachs today than it was 20-30 years ago.\u201d (Reporting by Catherine Ngai; editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Lisa Shumaker)","651":"STOCKHOLM, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are expected to lead preparations for the planned IPO of Swedish buyout firm EQT, two sources told Reuters, after the company earlier this month invited banks to bid for the mandate.

The suit alleges that Goldman Sachs is violating a 2001 agreement reached when it acquired Epoch Partners, an online investment bank that Schwab, TD Waterhouse and Ameritrade founded for their investors to buy into initial public offerings.  Investment banks like Goldman Sachs make big money advising companies on IPOs, and in exchange they get a portion of shares to sell to their own clients or to other firms.

Now, bank executives are hoping they have figured out the key to a turnaround: asking traders to be more like investment bankers.  FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Over the past year, Chief Executive David Solomon and his leadership team have given the trading business a fresh mandate. They have replaced top trading executives, invested heavily in automation and turned Goldman\u2019s securities platform, called Marquee, into a product that can be sold to customers, according to interviews with six bank insiders.  Goldman plans to invest as much as $200 million in securities division technology over the next three years, a person familiar with the matter said. Much of that will go toward hiring people who know how to code.  Salespeople in the trading division, who used to primarily focus on hedge funds, are trying to make inroads with corporate treasurers, as well as portfolio managers at mutual-fund firms like Fidelity Investments and algorithmic trading houses like AQR or Two Sigma, one person said.  Trading staffers must often partner with Goldman Sachs dealmakers to forge those relationships. And, like bankers, they are now being judged by how many meetings they get and how much new business they can deliver with targeted clients, the same person said.  The changes bring a sales culture to the fore, but executives say it is not at the expense of the central risk trading approach that made Goldman traders famous.  \u201cThat core is the key to the investment-banker approach and technology investments resulting in success,\u201d another employee said.  On Tuesday, Goldman reported a 6% rise in quarterly trading revenue, benefiting from market volatility, as well as Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s decision to pull back from trading. But, year-to-date, the business is down 6%.  Goldman Sachs executives acknowledge that a turnaround could take years. However, they say that changes made over the past year are already making a difference, especially the efficiency savings from investments in tech.  \u201cThis quarter we saw some green shoots from the client-centric strategy we\u2019ve put in place,\u201d Jim Esposito, global co-head for the securities division said in an interview.  Most major global banks have seen their trading businesses turned upside down since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Since then, loss-stunned customers shifted product preferences and new regulations prohibited activities that had been extremely profitable or made them prohibitively expensive.  Even so, Goldman Sachs stands out among Wall Street banks because of how much its profits had been weighted in trading, and how little it changed its business model around the crisis.  Where U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co had big consumer and corporate lending operations, and even Goldman Sachs\u2019 closest rival, Morgan Stanley significantly altered its business mix through an acquisition, Goldman Sachs took years to announce meaningful changes to its strategy.  In recent years, the industry of making and managing clients\u2019 trades has consolidated around the top global banks. Goldman is one of those banks, but it will need to remain \u201con the offensive,\u201d said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see the revenue pie expanding dramatically in legacy businesses like equity trading and (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cThere are opportunities. It\u2019s really in maintaining and gaining share as other firms retreat.\u201d  FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES  Goldman executives say these fundamental changes to the trading business will help the bank prosper over the long term.  In addition to new goals and performance metrics for trading staff, Goldman Sachs leadership has been meeting with major clients or prospective clients to find out what the bank could do better to win more business, according to two executives.  They are paying closer attention to \u201cbroker votes\u201d that big investors submit to learn what improvements should be made to Goldman\u2019s technology, operations or customer service, executives said.  The bank has also been working to improve trading technology to lure quantitative investors.  Pricing for investment-grade credit below $2 million is now completely electronic, with plans to expand, said Adam Korn, global head of securities division \u201cstrats\u201d and technology. Goldman used the term strats to refer to quantitative analysts.  \u201cIf you come back in a year or two, I suspect we will have automated the $2-$5 million segment of the investment grade,\u201d Korn said in an interview.  Additionally, Goldman has expanded functions of Marquee, which was once its internal trading system and opened it up to customers.  The bank is experimenting with giving clients access to proprietary data and risk analysis for a fee, possibly a monthly subscription. There are now 50,000 monthly active users of the service, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said during an earnings call on Tuesday.  \u201cThere is a great intensity and sense of urgency to measure and metric our progress with clients,\u201d Esposito said. \u201cTrading and sales are aligned neatly around this effort.\u201d","662":"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N is ditching plans to open a desk for trading cryptocurrencies as the regulatory framework for crypto remains unclear, Business Insider reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  In recent weeks, Goldman executives have concluded that many steps still need to be taken, most of them outside the bank\u2019s control, before a regulated bank would be allowed to trade cryptocurrencies, the financial news website reported.  \u201cAt this point, we have not reached a conclusion on the scope of our digital asset offering,\u201d Goldman Sachs spokesperson Michael DuVally told Reuters.  Major cryptocurrencies plunged on the news. Bitcoin BTC=BTSP fell nearly 5 percent to touch five-day low at $6,985 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. Ethereum slid 9 percent, Litecoin 7.1 percent and Ripple 7.7 percent.  In October, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein had tweeted, \u201cStill thinking about Bitcoin. No conclusion - not endorsing\/rejecting. Know that folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold.\u201d  Blankfein's tweet was in sharp contrast to comments made by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N CEO Jamie Dimon, who called bitcoin a \"fraud.\" It is worse than tulips bulbs,\" Dimon had said, referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s.  Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley MS.N had spoken in favor of the currency, with CEO James Gorman calling it \"more than just a fad.\"  The virtual currency can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. A fund holding the currency could attract more investors and push its price higher.  Bitcoin had rocketed to a record high of $16,000 in December. Several small U.S. firms reshaped their business models to capitalize on the craze for blockchain technology, which supports cryptocurrency.  Beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea Corp's LTEA.O shares jumped nearly 300 percent in late December after the company said it would rebrand itself Long Blockchain Corp.  However, regulators across the world have been intensifying their scrutiny of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency exchanges.  Last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned that some of the coins issued in ICOs could be considered securities, implying that trading them would have to comply with federal securities laws.","663":"A former Goldman Sachs banker facing criminal charges in the United States over his alleged involvement in Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB corruption scandal has told a Brooklyn federal court that the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s settlement with the bank violates his right to a fair trial.  In a motion made public on Friday, Roger Ng, represented by Brafman & Associates argued that the deferred prosecution agreement Goldman entered in October prevents the bank\u2019s employees from testifying on his behalf because it bars Goldman and its agents from contradicting the facts set out in the settlement.

The 53-year-old Australian will oversee the implementation of Goldman\u2019s new post-Brexit structure out of London.  The appointment - announced in a memo sent by Goldman CEO David Solomon, CFO Stephen Scherr and Waldron - comes as markets recoil in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, which has left 2020 economic growth forecasts in tatters.  Under Solomon, Goldman has shifted its focus from its money-spinning trading business to building a bigger consumer bank to shield its revenue from swings in financial markets.  Trading makes up roughly 40% of Goldman\u2019s revenues but margins are shrinking in the face of tougher competition and a sustained shift toward passive investing.  Net revenue at Goldman\u2019s global markets business was up 2% last year to $14.78 billion, split equally between equities and fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC).  Goldman competes head to head with Morgan Stanley MS.N and JPMorgan JPM.N, with Refinitiv data showing Morgan Stanley tops the league tables for global equity and equity-related products so far this year.  Brexit poses further challenges for global banks, with EU authorities still not decided on whether the likes of Goldman can trade EU stocks and bonds outside the bloc.  \u201cWe want to serve our clients better and more effectively after the end of the transition period in Britain,\u201d Waldron said.  Since Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the EU, Goldman has beefed up its European outposts, particularly in Frankfurt, which serves as its EU trading hub. It recently poached Sara Woerner from Morgan Stanley to lead equity execution for Germany and Austria.  Daffey will help Goldman \u201cplan for further changes\u201d during the transition period, the memo said, as top rainmakers and traders are expected to be more scattered across the continent.  \u2018ONE GOLDMAN\u2019  Waldron said Daffey\u2019s promotion is part of the bank\u2019s \u201cOne Goldman\u201d strategy, in which senior leaders from all parts of the bank work closely to address clients\u2019 priorities.  This approach - outlined by Solomon at an investor day in January - seeks to end the siloed trader versus dealmaker structure that prevailed under former boss Lloyd Blankfein.  Daffey has built his career in the trading division, rising to top roles including running equities sales globally as well as fixed income and foreign exchange sales for Europe, Middle East and Africa.  His promotion adds another layer to the markets leadership structure where a trio of senior executives - Ashok Varadhan, Marc Nachmann and Jim Esposito - are splitting responsibilities as global co-heads of the securities business.  Waldron said the power-sharing structure in markets will stay, calling Daffey\u2019s appointment a \u201clong-term investment.\u201d  \u201cThis is not about expanding our footprint. The goal is to improve the quality of our relationships and services,\u201d he said.","667":"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is nearing a deal to buy boutique wealth management firm United Capital Financial Partners Inc for several hundred million dollars, a source told Reuters.

Under the current timetable, London and Brussels hope to get a final deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by exit day, though May\u2019s minority government faces a series of make-or-break moments in the Brexit process over coming months.  \u201cOur own base case is for an orderly withdrawal, although the tail risks have admittedly increased,\u201d Goldman said in a research notes for clients. \u201cWe see the UK and EU settling on a free trade deal covering goods but excluding most services.\u201d  Ultimately, Goldman said, May will probably be able to get such a Brexit deal through the British parliament in December.  \u201cWhile there may be no clear majority in parliament for any specific Brexit proposal, there is a majority to avoid the no deal outcome,\u201d it said.  It forecast the pound would rise to $1.36 in a year with the euro at 0.92 pence in a year. Sterling is currently trading at $1.27, and at 89.9 pence per euro.  Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain\u2019s most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.9 trillion UK economy and the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc.  Opponents say it is folly that will diminish Britain\u2019s standing in the world, cost hundreds of billions of dollars in lost growth over the decades ahead and delay much needed reforms.  Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for the economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU, which some of them cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.  But if May does not get the deal approved, then Britain could face a national election and the prospect of a Labour government, a scenario that could lead to extending Brexit negotiations or even stopping Brexit altogether, Goldman said.  \u201cAlthough UK political dynamics have raised the likelihood of a no-deal scenario, we continue to believe it is relatively low,\u201d Goldman said.  There is deep concern in boardrooms about the prospect of Britain leaving the bloc without a deal, or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade.

Unless Prime Minister Theresa May can get a Brexit deal approved by the British parliament, then she will have to decide whether to delay Brexit or thrust the world\u2019s fifth largest economy into chaos by leaving without a deal.  Goldman Sachs said it sees a 50 percent probability of May getting a Brexit divorce deal ratified, adding that lawmakers would ultimately block a no-deal exit if needed.  Goldman said it saw the probability of a no-deal exit at 15 percent and the probability of no Brexit at around 35 percent.  \u201cThere does exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to avoid a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit (if called upon to do so), but there does not yet exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to support a second referendum (at least at this stage),\u201d Goldman said in a note to clients on Friday.  \u201cThe prime minister will repeatedly try to defer the definitive parliamentary vote on her negotiated Brexit deal, and the intensification of tail risks will continue to play a role in incentivising the eventual ratification of that deal.\u201d  May suffered a defeat on her Brexit strategy on Thursday that undermined her pledge to EU leaders to get her divorce deal approved if they grant her concessions.  She has promised that if parliament has not approved a deal by Feb. 26, she will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress on that day and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Feb. 27 to debate and vote on the way forward.  JPMorgan said that it thought May would now seek an extension to the March 29 deadline.  BREXIT MAZE  The divergent views from two of the most powerful Wall Street banks indicates just how hard investors are finding it to read the labyrinthine plots and counterplots of Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant political and economic move since World War Two.  \u201cHaving chosen to afford the PM extra time this week, our expectation is that a majority of MPs will finally be prepared to begin to take action to attempt to ensure that a \u201cno deal\u201d exit does not occur at that point,\u201d JPMorgan said.  \u201cWe continue to think it likely that, rather than allowing the vote and consequent ministerial resignations to occur, PM May will attempt to forestall by stating that she will seek an extension herself.\u201d  Most major banks got the 2016 referendum wrong.  The consensus then was that the United Kingdom would not vote to leave but as results came in showing that it had, sterling had its biggest one-day fall since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced in the early 1970s.  In private, though, many bankers are still deeply worried about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  \u201cThe more messy this gets the more worried I am that we are heading for no deal,\u201d said an executive at one investment bank in London who spoke on condition of anonymity.  \u201cWe still expect a last-minute deal, but the closer we get to exit day we become less sure,\u201d the banker said.  Berenberg, one of Europe\u2019s oldest banks, said it saw the chances of May getting a majority for her deal at just 10 percent. It sees a 30 percent chance of a hard Brexit and a 20 percent chance of no Brexit.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - Goldman Sachs may wind up paying twice for 1MDB. Abu Dhabi\u2019s sovereign fund is suing the U.S. investment bank in New York for its role in the Malaysian fund scandal. The damages sought could exceed Goldman\u2019s average annual net profit over three years of $5.4 billion. The longer the fight drags out, the worse the fallout looks.  Aggrieved investors smell blood after former Goldman partner Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and other charges filed by U.S. authorities. New revelations in the New York Times that then-Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein met privately with Jho Low, the alleged mastermind of the scandal, alongside an Abu Dhabi fund executive will weaken any defence that this was the work of rogue employees.  Abu Dhabi\u2019s lawsuit comes on top of growing expectations of a hefty settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Goldman could pay a fine of up to $1.2 billion plus return $600 million in fees and revenue the bank made arranging three 1MDB bonds, reckons a Morgan Stanley banks analyst. Two of those bonds were jointly guaranteed by International Petroleum Investment Company, which has now been folded into Mubadala, another Abu Dhabi fund.  The round-robin of accusations is growing. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad\u2019s new administration in Malaysia wants back fees it paid Goldman, and is also trying to wriggle out of a separate settlement with Abu Dhabi it says is worth about $5.8 billion. Under that London consent award, 1MDB and Malaysia agreed to take responsibility for the principal and interest of the $3.5 billion IPIC-guaranteed bonds.  Goldman is now caught in the middle as neither Abu Dhabi nor Malaysia wants to be left holding the embarrassing liabilities due in 2022. It\u2019s not clear how well Abu Dhabi\u2019s claim will hold up given it is also accusing others in the same lawsuit, including two of IPIC\u2019s own former top employees allegedly bribed by Goldman. The bank says it expects to vigorously contest the charges.  The emirate also has tried and failed to take on Wall Street before. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority lost its case against Citigroup over its $7.5 billion crisis-era investment in the then-struggling mega-bank.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  (Reuters) - Slack Technologies Inc, a provider of chat and direct messaging services for businesses, has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N to lead its initial public offering (IPO) next year as an underwriter, people familiar with the matter said.  The San Francisco-based company is among a string of Silicon Valley unicorns expected to debut in the stock market in 2019. Other IPO hopefuls include apartment-rental service Airbnb Inc, analytics firm Palantir Technologies and Stripe Inc, a digital payment company.  Ride-hailing company Lyft Inc beat bigger rival Uber Technologies Inc in filing for an IPO this week, defying the recent market jitters that have weighed on corporate valuations.  Slack is rounding up its underwriting syndicate and hopes to fetch a valuation of well over $10 billion in its IPO, whose exact timing will depend on market conditions, the sources said on Friday.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Slack and Goldman Sachs both declined to comment.  Slack is competing against the likes of Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Teams, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Hangouts Chat and Cisco Systems Inc's CSCO.O Webex Teams in the so-called workplace collaboration market, which research firm IDC has projected will be worth $3.2 billion by 2021.  Slack last raised $427 million in August in a private fundraising round, led by Dragoneer Investment Group and General Atlantic, giving it a valuation of more than $7.1 billion. It previously raised $250 million in 2017 at a $5.1 billion valuation, in a fundraising round led by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T.  It is unclear how market turmoil fueled by the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China could impact Slack\u2019s IPO plans.

Goldman is the first bank to have such a partnership with Bloomberg, and the tie-up will make its analytics visible on Bloomberg\u2019s terminal in FXGO, a global foreign exchange trading platform. Bloomberg is a competitor with Thomson Reuters for news and information services.  Trading clients are demanding greater access to decision-making tools like Goldman\u2019s analytics, as the industry faces increasing pressure to cut costs, increase speed and prove that every trade is executed in the most efficient way possible.  The new tool is aimed at breaking down barriers between companies that previously may not have worked together in this way, both companies said on Monday.  \u201cHistorically, Bloomberg and Goldman might have liked to own the whole process independently,\u201d said Damien Vanderwilt, global head of Goldman\u2019s FICC execution services.  The partnership comes six years after tension between Bloomberg and big Wall Street banks, including Goldman, over its journalists accessing client data. (reut.rs\/YQR02H)  The benefit for Goldman this time around is that its trading clients who also use Bloomberg\u2019s terminal no longer have to log in to both systems to access both firms\u2019 analytics.  Vanderwilt called the new platform attractive to traders \u201ctrying to reduce the number of systems that they need to operate in (on) any given trading day.\u201d  Goldman, which also offers equities execution services to clients of Bloomberg\u2019s Tradebook product, expects to gain new clients as Bloomberg\u2019s sales team markets the terminal and these new analytics tools. The bank declined to comment on business targets.  Bloomberg said it is open to similar partnerships with other banks, and that FXGO is open to any liquidity providers.  Tod Van Name, global head of FX electronic trading at Bloomberg, said that including the new analytics service on FXGO will give traders access to Goldman\u2019s proprietary analytics on liquidity and order execution in real time.","684":"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc offered new tidbits about its sweeping operational overhaul when reporting first-quarter results on Monday, but investors focused on revenue declines across nearly all its main businesses, sending shares lower.  FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The fifth-largest bank by assets said it plans to grow retail deposits by $10 billion a year and shift more business into its banking units to lower its funding cost by one percentage point.  Top executives also explained in more detail how they plan to make Goldman Sachs more efficient by flattening internal org charts, getting rid of old technology and shifting more staff to low-cost operational hubs. They expect these steps to save another dollar of expenses for every $100 in revenue Goldman produces, and improve returns on shareholder equity by four-tenths of a percentage point.  The bank also revealed that it has been actively slashing risk-weighted assets in its fixed-income trading business since 2013, by some 40 percent so far. Goldman does not disclose the total sum of that wind-down portfolio, which is largely comprised of capital-intensive, long-dated derivatives, a person familiar with the matter said.  But those disclosures did little to ease concerns about the struggles Goldman Sachs faces as it works through its business model revamp.  On a call to discuss quarterly results, analysts peppered Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and his finance chief, Stephen Scherr, with questions about ongoing revenue weakness and requests for more information. They asked what the bank\u2019s total technology spending budget is, when its results will look more like universal banking rivals and why it is taking so long.  \u201cYou all want more quicker, and we understand that,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cBut we are going to make sure we do it in the highest quality where we can.\u201d  The bank\u2019s shares were down 3.1 percent to $201.28.  Goldman Sachs was once considered a black box of profits, disclosing little about management\u2019s goals or how core units functioned. Investors and analysts generally accepted that secrecy, since Goldman routinely generated higher returns than peers.  But regulations imposed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, combined with changing market trends, put some of its core businesses in peril.  The bank embarked on a plan in 2017 to generate $5 billion in additional annual revenue, partly by diving into consumer banking, where it had never previously operated. It also promised to disclose more about its progress.  The bank has doubled down on that strategy under Solomon, who started a \u201cfront-to-back\u201d operational review after taking the helm in October.  Management is now putting in place the conclusions of that review, and plans to offer bank-wide performance targets early next year, Goldman said in a presentation on Monday. Investors had been expected a full report this spring.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that needs to be done at this company to reposition it for growth over the next decade,\u201d said David Hendler, an analyst at Viola Risk Advisors. \u201cNot completing the strategic review until 2020 is ridiculous. It should be done by the next quarter.\u201d  Analysts also noted it was hard to find evidence that the overhaul was bearing fruit in the first quarter.  Declines in trading, underwriting, investment management and investing and lending all contributed to a 13 percent slump in first-quarter revenue, which missed Wall Street expectations.  One bright spot was Goldman\u2019s financial advisory business, where revenue soared 51 percent on higher deal volumes. However, the bank\u2019s backlog of deals declined, indicating revenue may be subdued in future quarters.  Total revenue of $8.81 billion missed Wall Street\u2019s $8.99 billion estimate. The biggest drop came from trading, which was hurt by lower market volatility and the impact of the U.S. government shutdown.  Rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc reported declines in trading revenue of 10 percent and 6 percent, respectively.  Despite sour revenue, Goldman\u2019s profit beat Wall Street\u2019s view, which analysts attributed to a sharp drop in compensation expenses.  Earnings attributable to common shareholders fell 20 percent to $2.2 billion, or $5.71 per share, from $2.7 billion, or $6.95 per share, in the year-ago period. (bit.ly\/2Pc3You)  Analysts had expected a profit of $4.89 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Asked whether his review would result in Goldman looking more like JPMorgan, Citigroup or Bank of America Corp in the next three to five years, Solomon said that was unlikely. Capital markets businesses make up 61 percent of Goldman\u2019s revenue, more than double the portion of rivals with bigger consumer and corporate banking arms.  \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have any expectation ... we\u2019re heading anywhere close to that direction quickly,\u201d he said.","685":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors charged a vice president at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N on Thursday with insider trading by illegally using non-public information about several companies that were clients of the investment bank.  Prosecutors said Woojae \u201cSteve\u201d Jung, a 37-year-old Korean citizen, made more than $130,000 by trading illegally on confidential information relating to upcoming transactions and merger negotiations that he was privy to through his job.  Authorities said Jung, who joined Goldman in 2012 and worked in San Francisco, conducted his trades through a brokerage account in the name of a friend living in South Korea. The brokerage account was accessed from internet addresses that were traced to Jung, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cWoojae Jung violated his duty to his company and traded on stolen insider information, over and over again,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement.  Christopher Steskal, a lawyer for Jung, declined to comment.  A Goldman representative said the company had placed Jung on leave.  \u201cWe are aware of the situation regarding Mr. Jung and are cooperating with legal authorities on the matter,\u201d the person said in a statement.  Jung, who was arrested on Thursday morning in San Francisco, was expected to appear in federal court later in the day, according to prosecutors.  He was charged with six counts of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy. He also faces related civil claims from the SEC.  Prosecutors accused Jung of illegally trading ahead of announcements or reports of a reorganization by W.R. Grace & Co GRA.N; Foresight Energy LP's FELP.N acquisition by Murray Energy Corp; SanDisk Corp's acquisition by Western Digital Corp WDC.O; KLA-Tencor Corp's proposed acquisition by Lam Research Corp LRCX.O; Microsemi Corp's MSCC.F proposed acquisition by Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS.O; and CA Inc's CA.O proposed acquisition by BMC Software Inc.  The SEC said Jung also traded improperly in other companies, including NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI.O and WebMD Health Corp.  Authorities said Jung\u2019s scheme began in early 2015 and continued until the middle of 2017, when the SEC sought information from Goldman about which employees had access to confidential information about certain transactions.  Following that request, according to prosecutors, someone called the brokerage firm whose account was used to make the illegal trades.  Using the name of Jung\u2019s friend in Korea, the caller said the account had been opened using stolen personal information, and that he was concerned about the transactions in the account, prosecutors said.","686":"May 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Friday reported a significantly reduced stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc, and that it no longer invests in the insurer Travelers Cos and oil refiner Phillips 66 .

As stocks tumbled to their worst weekly performance since the financial crisis, the firm's $60 billion portfolios bought shares of Japanese cosmetics-maker Shiseido Co Ltd 4911.T and events promoter Live Nation Entertainment LYV.N, as well as companies in the travel and hotel sector, Katie Koch, Goldman Sachs' global co-head of equities for its asset management business, said in an interview with Reuters.  \u201cWe recognize the seriousness (of the coronavirus concerns), and we would never celebrate a sell off of this magnitude,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this dislocation provides active managers a great opportunity.\u201d  The S&P 500 fell for the seventh straight day on Friday and the benchmark index suffered its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis on growing fears the fast-spreading coronavirus could lead to a recession, although stocks cut losses at the end of the day\u2019s session.  Koch said the firm\u2019s clients have largely remained sanguine throughout the selloff, deploying more cash this week into the bank\u2019s active management portfolios.  \u201cWe have not seen great outflows from our clients. We have seen higher engagement- more people calling and asking questions. This week we are going to end up in pretty strong net inflows into our active portfolios from clients globally,\u201d she said.  The firm\u2019s purchase of shares of Shiseido is a bet that demand from Chinese consumers for the high-end brand will continue after the outbreak passes, Koch said.

Morgan Stanley's MS.N gains from investment banking and trading businesses outstripped those of traditional rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, which reported its last results under long-time Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein.  However, Goldman\u2019s equity trading and underwriting revenue came in much better than that of Morgan Stanley in a quarter that was marked by uncertainties in global financial markets stemming from an ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington.  Talking to analysts on a post-earnings call, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jon Pruzan said he expects the firm to be the leader in equities trading by market share globally this year.  Strength at equity trading desks of both banks dwarfed weakness in bond trading, in line with a broader trend across the industry during the third quarter.  Both banks lack big consumer lending units that have fueled profits at rivals such as Citigroup C.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, and instead rely heavily on their trading desks.  To offset the ups and downs of the trading business, Morgan Stanley and Goldman have been trying to diversify into lending and wealth management.  A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Shares of Morgan Stanley were up 2.4 percent, while those of Goldman were up about 1 percent in early trading.  Bank stocks have been under pressure this year as investors and analysts have questioned their future growth strategies.  The S&P Financial Index .SPSY has fallen 6 percent this year, vastly underperforming the broader market. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman have lost more than 15 percent of their value this year, making them the two worst performing stocks among the big six banks.  EQUITY UNDERWRITING SHINES  Investment bankers helped the banks bring in big gains during the quarter. Goldman\u2019s investment banking revenue rose 10 percent to $1.98 billion as advisory revenue hit its highest in three years, and the bank earned more from helping companies go public.  This compares with a 15 percent jump in Morgan Stanley\u2019s revenue from the business to $1.46 billion.  Credit Suisse analysts had expected investment banking revenue at Goldman and Morgan Stanley to be $1.73 billion and $1.34 billion, respectively.  Equity trading desks at both the banks also booked gains of between 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively.  Bond trading business, however, did not fare as well.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s bond trading revenue rose just 1 percent, but outperformed Goldman, which reported a 10 percent fall in revenue from the business.  \u201cPretty good results considering the choppy backdrop and we like how Morgan Stanley continues to produce strong results,\u201d Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note.  Overall, Morgan Stanley reported net profit of $1.17 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.01 per share, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  Goldman\u2019s per share profit came in at $6.28, compared with the estimate of $5.38.","690":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc rolled out a virtual credit card on Tuesday, which will help the iPhone maker diversify from device sales and also build out the Wall Street bank\u2019s new consumer business.  With the card, Apple aims to draw in iPhone owners with 2% cash back on purchases with the Apple Pay service, no fees and an app to manage related finances.  For Goldman, the card will enhance the bank\u2019s focus on its Marcus consumer banking brand, which it started in 2015 to even out volatile results from businesses such as trading and investment banking.  Apple shares were up about 1 percent at $195.30 in trading before the bell.  The company said a limited number of the people who had expressed interest in Apple Card would start receiving sign-up invitations on Tuesday.  \u201cThe Apple Card doesn\u2019t play in the same league as premium rewards credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or AmEx Platinum,\u201d said Sara Rathner, an expert on credit cards at NerdWallet.  \u201cThose cards charge ultra-high fees, but in return you get some pretty sweet perks: massive sign-up bonuses, annual statement credits, free Global Entry, and a higher point-earning rate for travel expenses.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Apple will offer an option for a physical card made of titanium, but with no visible number. Instead, the card\u2019s number is stored on a secure chip inside the iPhone, which will generate virtual numbers for online or over-the-phone purchases that require a number.  Apple said purchase information would be stored on the user\u2019s iPhone and that it cannot see the data. Goldman will not be allowed to use data for marketing purposes, even for selling its other products.  Gene Munster, managing partner with Loup Ventures and a longtime Apple watcher, said the card\u2019s adoption is likely to be low in the first year, but it could generate about $1.4 billion of high-margin revenue by 2023.  That would add about 1.8% to Apple\u2019s overall earnings and complement the much larger Apple Pay business for total payments revenue of $5.38 billion by 2023. Apple has roughly 50 million U.S. Apple Pay users now.  But at Apple\u2019s size - $265.6 billion in sales for fiscal 2018 - the revenue matters less than the effect on keeping Apple customers tied to its brand, said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies.  \u201cIf it works, it\u2019s one more thing that causes you to stay deeply loyal and entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, even if something better comes along,\u201d he said.","691":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018.

The Wall Street bank was planning to clear bitcoin futures for some clients as the new contracts were going live on exchanges when the cryptocurrency rocketed to a record high of $16,000 in December.  Regulators across the world have been intensifying their scrutiny of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency exchanges.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had warned last year that some of the coins issued in ICOs could be considered securities, meaning trading them would have to comply with federal securities laws.  The virtual currency can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. A fund holding the currency could attract more investors and push its price higher.  Bitcoin was trading down nearly 4.8 percent at $7,007 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange on Wednesday.

FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  Analysts expressed relief that the LSE had finally been able to find an external candidate after a boardroom battle involving activist hedge fund TCI led to the departure last November of CEO Xavier Rolet.  Schwimmer, a 49-year old New Yorker who has been with Goldman for 20 years and most recently served as global head of market structure and global head of metals and mining in investment banking, takes up the role at the start of August.  Schwimmer, who attended Harvard Law School and Yale University, will earn an annual salary of 775,000 pounds ($1.11 million), with a bonus of up to 225 percent of his salary, LSE said.  He will also get 1.05 million pounds in compensation in March next year for giving up his 2018 cash awards at Goldman.  Frenchman Rolet left after almost a decade at the helm, during which he transformed the company with a string of deals, lifting its market value to almost 14 billion pounds from less than 1 billion.  Schwimmer takes charge as Britain\u2019s planned departure from the European Union in 2019 raises questions about the LSE\u2019s strategy at the heart of Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre.  Although the LSE owns the Milan Exchange and has clearing operations in Paris, it is unclear how much direct access financial firms in Britain will have to EU customers after Brexit.  Schwimmer will have to protect LSE's dominance in euro clearing as rival Deutsche Boerse DB1Gn.DE in Frankfurt is already seeking to exploit uncertainty to build up business.  He will also lead the LSE's efforts to woo oil giant Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE to London for what is expected to be the world's largest initial public offering.  \u201cDavid is a leader with great experience in the financial market infrastructure sector ... as well as capital markets experience in both developed and emerging markets,\u201d LSE Chairman Donald Brydon said in a statement.  \u201cHe is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike,\u201d Brydon added.  Group CFO David Warren, who was acting CEO, will continue as the company\u2019s finance boss.  TAKEOVER TARGET?  The LSE is seen in the market as a takeover target rather than a predator with rivals Intercontinental Exchange ICE.N and CME CME.O in the United States long seen as suitors, analysts said.  \u201cWe think the appointment of Mr. Schwimmer, a former M&A banker, will allow LSE to continue to look for inorganic growth opportunities, in line with LSE\u2019s strategy,\u201d UBS analyst Michael Werner said in a note to clients.  UBS sees no big change in the LSE\u2019s focus on developing its suite of indexes and the LCH clearing unit.  Hedge fund TCI, an LSE investor, predicted a 15 billion pound bid for the group from ICE and CME during an investor conference call earlier this year.  Rolet\u2019s exit triggered a fight between Brydon and TCI, whose attempt to push him out was eventually defeated at a shareholder meeting in December.  Brydon has said he will not stand for re-election at the annual general meeting in 2019.  Since TCI\u2019s defeat, LSE shares have risen more than 14 percent as investors bet on a takeover approach after a planned tie-up with Deutsche Boerse collapsed. LSE shares were up marginally at 4240 pence at 1010 GMT.  TCI holds a 5.18 percent stake in LSE, and its founder Chris Hohn, declined to comment on Friday when contacted by Reuters.  Rolet was credited with turning LSE into a diversified exchange group by buying a controlling stake in LCH, one of the world\u2019s biggest clearing houses, and expanding the bourse\u2019s activities in stock indexes.  Under Rolet\u2019s leadership, LSE was unable to seal a merger with Deutsche Boerse, the third attempt at an Anglo-German tie up.  \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an orthodox transition, but we\u2019re pleased to see clear leadership being put in place,\u201d said a top-20 investor in LSE.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  In 2019 Goldman advised on 48 campaigns to capture the top spot while Morgan Stanley advised on 37 campaigns, the data shows.  Goldman worked on some of the year\u2019s biggest campaigns, helping defend Sony against hedge fund Third Point, AT&T against Elliott Management, and eBay against Elliott and Starboard Value.  In 2018, the two New York-based investment banks advised on roughly the same number of campaigns each with Morgan Stanley having been involved in 33, compared with Goldman Sachs\u2019 32, Refinitiv data shows.  Spotlight Advisors, founded by Greg Taxin, a lawyer who worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Securities, captured the No. 3 spot last year with 31 campaigns.  Spotlight works for both companies and activists, while most banks work only for corporations.  Lazard and Evercore followed on the list with 10 and 9 campaigns, respectively. Both banks worked on more deals in 2018, with Lazard having handled 16 engagements and Evercore having handled 18, Refinitiv data shows.  League tables are compiled by various providers and are often used as data points in trying to woo new clients. But they seldom tell the entire story, bankers have said, noting that discrepancies can arise because many companies fend off activists privately and ask their advisers to stay silent about their involvement.  Activists mounted 400 campaigns last year pushing companies to spin off divisions, put themselves up for sale or give them board seats. The number represents a 21% decline from campaigns mounted in 2018, but activists also went after big companies like AT&T, which were long thought to be out of activists\u2019 reach.  Consumer cyclical companies were the most heavily targeted last year, Refinitiv said, with 68 campaigns in the sector.  Elliott Management ranked as the busiest activist, having launched 13 campaigns in 2019.

FILE PHOTO: A woman looks at Marcus, a new savings and loans app recently launched by Goldman Sachs in New York, U.S., January 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Segar  \u201cWe are planting seeds that will take time to mature and grow,\u201d Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said in an address to investors, some of whom have complained the Wall Street powerhouse has been too slow to shift its focus away from volatile trading into the more stable consumer area. Solomon succeeded Lloyd Blankfein in October 2018.  Goldman shares, which have underperformed rivals, gave up early gains and closed down 0.9 percent.  The investor day event gave executives an opportunity to present their plans to grow consumer deposit balances to $125 billion or more over the next five years. They said the plans include Goldman offering checking accounts through its consumer bank Marcus by 2021.  Goldman also targeted increasing consumer loans and card balances to more than $20 billion during the same period.  Despite solid growth since its launch in 2016, Marcus is still a fraction of the size of competitors\u2019 consumer businesses and Solomon sought to downplay expectations on how big it could become.  \u201cIt\u2019s not going to take share from the big guys,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to continue doing great but we think it could be a nice business for us.\u201d The consumer bank currently generates just 2.4% of Goldman\u2019s annual revenue.  Goldman also unveiled financial targets and details on its other multibillion-dollar businesses. Its decision to hold an investor day and to set broad goals was an effort to address grievances about a lack of transparency. However, investors now want to see the plans come to fruition.  \u201cThey need to execute,\u201d one investor at the bank\u2019s presentation said after reviewing the targets.  Goldman said it was aiming for a 60% efficiency ratio over the next three years, while it projected an over 13% return on equity (ROE) and over 14% return on tangible equity, key measures of profitability. A lower efficiency ratio means a bank is better at managing costs relative to revenue.  Analysts noted that Goldman's improved shareholder returns target was still short of the 17% medium term target set by rival JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N.  In the longer term, defined as five years or more, Goldman said it was aiming for \u201cmid-teen returns\u201d of newer businesses such as transaction banking and the consumer bank.  Goldman also plans to pull in $1 billion in revenue through lower interest expenses, according to its presentation.  \u201cWe view these targets as approximating expectations,\u201d Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note.  Solomon said the bank\u2019s third-party alternatives investment business could add $100 billion in net inflows over time.  Trading revenues still make up roughly 40% of Goldman\u2019s revenues, but securities division executives said they are \u201cacutely aware\u201d the market for trading is shrinking and growing more competitive with the trend toward passive investing.  Chief Operating Officer and President John Waldron said the bank was taking a \u201cpatient, methodical, long term approach\u201d.  Investors had been eager to hear more about Goldman\u2019s consumer business, which consists both of the online bank Marcus and its credit card with Apple.  Marcus is a central pillar of Solomon\u2019s vision for Goldman, whose 151-year history has had very little to do with Main Street. Solomon said Marcus was looking to capture business from smaller lenders who may have less resources to invest in offering better digital services.  \u201cWe\u2019re a big bank with a big balance sheet,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cWe have the capital to allocate to really disrupt.\u201d  In the year ended Dec. 31, Goldman\u2019s consumer deposits stood at $60 billion and it issued $7 billion in loans and credit card balances during the fourth quarter.","708":"March 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc:  * HARVEY M.

FILE PHOTO - David M. Solomon, President and Co-Chief Operating Officer of Goldman Sachs, speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 1, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Solomon, who is now effectively the chief executive officer-in-waiting after his rival in the succession race decided to leave the Wall Street bank, is trying to get dealmakers and traders to work together to produce more revenue. He is also pushing for growth in businesses like asset management and consumer lending, where Goldman does not have a long track record of success.  Since the strategy was unveiled in September, Wall Street has been rife with skepticism that Goldman, whose annual revenues have remained stuck below $40 billion since 2010, can make it happen. Analysts have repeatedly questioned management\u2019s underlying assumptions for the $5 billion target in research reports and on public conference calls.  Privately, many bankers and traders scoff at the idea that Solomon can get competing sides of the house to cooperate.  \u201cI have been with Goldman for 20 years and have been hearing this idea for as long as I have been here,\u201d one dealmaker told Reuters about the cross-selling plan. \u201cI never in my 23 years here been asked by a client to be introduced to our stock brokers,\u201d said an investment banker at a rival firm.  Like several others, those bankers spoke about Solomon and the revenue strategy he helped engineer on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.  But associates who spoke to Reuters about Solomon described a direct, decisive leader who has proven he can convince clients to do more business with Goldman Sachs, and who can also get a team motivated behind an untested strategy.  For instance, as co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank from 2006-2016, Solomon is credited with bolstering the debt financing business.  NOT HOPING TO GO BACK A DECADE  Goldman had historically avoided putting its balance sheet to work to support deals because the bank usually represented acquisition targets rather than acquirers. But Solomon, who spent the early part of his career in debt markets, saw big opportunities for Goldman to be a lender at a time when low interest rates were prompting companies to borrow at an unprecedented rate.  His decision helped the broader investment banking unit\u2019s revenue soar 70 percent during the time Solomon was one of its leaders. That helped offset a sharp decline in trading revenue that has plagued Goldman since 2009.  A $5 billion increase would represent growth of around 15 percent over Goldman\u2019s 2017 net revenues of more than $32 billion. In 2016 revenues of $30.6 billion were down more than $3 billion from 2015. The firm reported $45.17 billion in revenues in 2009, second only to its record revenues of $45.99 billion in 2007.  \u201cWe don\u2019t sit around hoping that 2007 or 2009 will happen again and that the world will go back to where we were a decade ago,\u201d said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer. \u201cDavid is a leader who embraces the future without forgetting the past. And he\u2019s got a strong heritage within one of our strongest businesses.\u201d  More recently, Solomon has been encouraging investment bankers to go beyond the CEOs they typically pursue for M&A transactions, and also to develop relationships with corporate treasurers and executives who oversee operations like hedging. The idea is to convince those who choose which banks to borrow from and trade with to use Goldman Sachs instead of powerhouses like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N or Citigroup Inc C.N.  Solomon is not shy about getting personally involved, associates said, leading client meetings and giving feedback. He has also been a big proponent of cross-selling for many years. When he ran investment banking, he made a particular effort to connect people within the investment banking and investment management divisions to share expertise and ensure better client coverage.  \u201cDavid has got everyone in a room talking about collaboration a lot more,\u201d another executive said.  Solomon clearly has some level of support internally \u2013 including from his boss, CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who told Goldman\u2019s board of directors last month that Solomon was his top pick as a future successor, a person familiar with the matter said. That decision prompted Harvey Schwartz, the other co-chief operating officer, to announce this week that he will leave the bank in April.  But Solomon still has work to do in winning over Wall Street, where investors and analysts remain skeptical of management\u2019s revenue plan.  Instinet analyst Steve Chubak took a close look at assumptions behind Goldman\u2019s plan to produce $5 billion more in annual revenue by 2020 in a November report titled \u201cAll That Is Goldman Does Not Glitter.\u201d He concluded that management\u2019s view on the profit potential of consumer lending was too rosy and that, overall, the new business will not make up for high-margin trading revenue that has evaporated.  Others expressed similar doubts in interviews this week.  \u201cLloyd Blankfein is a master of markets...and those are tough shoes to fill,\u201d said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo.","710":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sits outside its headquarters ahead of the OPEC and NON-OPEC meeting, Austria December 6, 2019.

Citing Wall Street Journal reports that the United States was considering intervening in the ongoing Saudi-Russian price war and Texas regulators may curb oil output, the U.S. investment bank said such action would reduce global and U.S. domestic supplies.  U.S. crude oil prices rose more than $1 on Friday, extending steep gains from the previous session, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would \u201cget involved\u201d in the price war at an \u201cappropriate time\u201d.  While any U.S. measures could support the oil market into the second half of the year, however, Goldman Sachs said accompanying supply cuts would still not be enough to offset the 8 million barrels per day (bpd) demand loss - brought about by countries slowing economic activity to halt the spread of the coronavirus which has caused nearly 10,000 deaths worldwide.  \u201cMedium-term, the impact of such policies will depend on their political viability given the upcoming presidential election,\u201d Goldman Sachs said in the note issued on Thursday.  U.S. production quotas could create a $5 to $10 upside to Goldman Sachs\u2019 West Texas Intermediate price forecast of $40 to $45 a barrel in 2021, the bank said.  While a return to U.S. oil supply management policies of the 1970s and 80s would \u201chelp support prices in the third and fourth quarter above our $30 and $40 a barrel Brent forecast, they would simply replace OPEC\u2019s arti\ufb01cial price support policy with another,\u201d the bank said, referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is a key member.","711":"(Repeats for wider distribution)  Sept 29 (Reuters) - Out with grimy microwaves and sticky coffee machines with worn-out buttons, in with stylus pens, QR codes, no-touch water coolers and mobile apps that pick what brew the machine will make for you.

The break room, where employees used to get their daily fix of caffeine and office gossip, is a big part of that reboot as coffee companies, such as Keurig Dr. Pepper, Lavazza and Nestle roll out new technology for the COVID-19 era.

RETHINK AND RECALIBRATE  Surveys and official guidelines suggest offices will fill up only gradually and might even never return to pre-pandemic capacity.  GoodFirms, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm, said this month its international survey of 168 businesses showed nearly a third of workers had already returned and nearly 60% wanted to do so, but more than half remained concerned about their safety.  A makeover of office catering was important for addressing such concerns, says Alicia LeBeouf, marketing and retail strategy executive at food service company Canteen, which counts FedEx, Pinterest, Target and UPS among its clients.  Buffets and chefs preparing meals on demand are replaced by grab-and-go food stations at Verizon and UnitedHealth Group Inc; contactless coffee machines get rolled out at Microsoft Corp; fridges get pedal-operated doors at Mohawk Industries and individually wrapped plastic utensils replace cutlery.

Canteen\u2019s LeBeouf said employers were banking on workers coming back, but they would not be returning to the same office they left before the pandemic.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had to recalibrate and...rethink everything.\u201d","712":"FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo adorns an office door at the SEC headquarters in Washington, June 24, 2011.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said here Asante Berko, a former employee at a subsidiary of the U.S. lender, arranged the bribes for a Turkish energy company to funnel the money to a Ghana-based intermediary, which then paid the local officials.  \u201cGoldman Sachs fully cooperated with the SEC\u2019s investigation and as stated by the SEC in its press release, the firm\u2019s compliance personnel took appropriate steps to prevent the firm from participating in the transaction,\u201d company spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said.  Berko helped the Ghana-based intermediary pay more than $200,000 in bribes to various other government officials, and personally paid more than $60,000 to members of the Ghanaian parliament and other government officials, the SEC statement said, adding that Berko took deliberate measures to prevent his employer from detecting the bribery scheme.

Martin Chavez said on a call with analysts to discuss Goldman\u2019s first-quarter results, which blew past Wall Street expectations.  Goldman reported gains in all four of its major business units, especially trading, as a surge in volatility led customers to transact more in capital markets.  Net income rose 27 percent to $2.7 billion, or $6.95 per share, easily topping the average analyst estimate of $5.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Its return-on-equity, a closely watched measure of how much profit a bank can generate from shareholder money, was 15.4 percent, the highest in more than five years. Investors generally like to see the figure above 10 percent.  Even so, Goldman shares fell 1.9 percent in afternoon trading, with analysts citing concerns about the volatile nature of its core businesses. Some said the first quarter of 2017 had set a particularly low bar for improvement.  \u201cHigh capital market volatility and engaged client activity in trading is challenging to predict and difficult for Goldman Sachs to execute consistently,\u201d said CFRA analyst Kenneth Leon.  A Goldman Sachs sign is displayed inside the company's post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Historically, Goldman offered little in the way of disclosures or business targets, but maintained a premium on its stock price because investors had faith the Wall Street bank would generate best-in-class results.  That has changed over the past year or two as its bond trading business stumbled and investors demanded better explanations.  In September, Goldman outlined how it aimed to add $5 billion in annual revenue by 2020, but even that plan has faced skepticism.  That is especially true of Goldman\u2019s aspirations in consumer lending, where it has a relatively small business that analysts say will take time, or a significant acquisition, to grow meaningfully.  The $3 billion worth of loans Goldman\u2019s Marcus business has generated since launching in 2016 compares with more than $400 billion in consumer loans at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N.  Trading remains Goldman\u2019s biggest business, and revenue there soared 31 percent in the first quarter as investors reacted to volatility across stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.  Overall revenue rose 25 percent to $10 billion, with investment banking, investment management and investing and lending each reporting better results. Financial advisory, which handles M&A transactions, was the only sub-segment to report a year-on-year decline.  The uptick seems sustainable because it is based on global economic growth, rising interest rates, positive labor data and the U.S. tax code overhaul, Chavez said. The last time the bank reported such strong results, three years ago, most of the surge came from one-time oddities.  Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr described the $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion in revenue Goldman generated from each of its units as \u201cpretty impressive.\u201d  \u201cObviously it won\u2019t always be this good,\u201d he said in a note to clients, \u201cbut sure is cool to see a good old Goldman beat in a quarter that was far from the perfect backdrop.\u201d  Investors have been underwhelmed by earnings beats and record profits from other big U.S. banks in recent days.

British and EU flags flutter outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain January 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Toby Melville  Unless Prime Minister Theresa May can get a Brexit deal approved by the British parliament, then she will have to decide whether to delay Brexit or thrust the world\u2019s fifth largest economy into chaos by leaving without a deal on March 29.  Goldman Sachs said it sees a 50 percent probability of May getting a Brexit divorce deal ratified, adding that lawmakers would ultimately block a no-deal exit if needed.  Goldman said it saw the probability of a no-deal exit at 15 percent and the probability of no Brexit at around 35 percent.  \u201cThere does exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to avoid a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit (if called upon to do so), but there does not yet exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to support a second referendum (at least at this stage),\u201d Goldman said in a note to clients on Friday.  \u201cThe prime minister will repeatedly try to defer the definitive parliamentary vote on her negotiated Brexit deal, and the intensification of tail risks will continue to play a role in incentivising the eventual ratification of that deal.\u201d  JPMorgan said it thought May would now seek an extension to the March 29 deadline.  May, who has repeatedly said Brexit will happen on March 29, suffered a defeat in parliament on Thursday that undermined her pledge to EU leaders to get her divorce deal approved if they grant her concessions.  She has promised that if parliament has not approved a deal by Feb. 26, she will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress on that day and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Feb. 27 to debate and vote on the way forward.  Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said an extension to Brexit was possible but not inevitable.  \u201cIf there is going to be an extension, it needs to be with a purpose, it needs to be with a view to securing and ratifying an agreement,\u201d Varadkar said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would like to see this stalemate or impasse or period of purgatory continue for months and months and months.\u201d  BREXIT MAZE  The divergent views from two of the most powerful Wall Street banks indicates just how hard investors are finding it to read the labyrinthine plots and counterplots of Brexit, the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant political and economic move since World War Two.  \u201cHaving chosen to afford the PM extra time this week, our expectation is that a majority of MPs (Members of Parliament) will finally be prepared to begin to take action to attempt to ensure that a \u201cno deal\u201d exit does not occur at that point,\u201d JPMorgan said.  \u201cWe continue to think it likely that, rather than allowing the vote and consequent ministerial resignations to occur, PM May will attempt to forestall by stating that she will seek an extension herself.\u201d  Most major banks got the 2016 referendum wrong.  The consensus then was that the United Kingdom would not vote to leave the EU. As results came in showing that it had, sterling had its biggest one-day fall since the era of free-floating exchange rates introduced in the early 1970s.  In private, though, many bankers are deeply worried about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  \u201cThe more messy this gets the more worried I am that we are heading for no deal,\u201d said an executive at one investment bank in London who spoke on condition of anonymity.  \u201cWe still expect a last-minute deal, but the closer we get to exit day we become less sure,\u201d the banker said.  Berenberg, one of Europe\u2019s oldest banks, said it saw the chances of May getting a majority for her deal at just 10 percent. It sees a 30 percent chance of a hard Brexit and a 20 percent chance of no Brexit.","718":"(Corrects headline and first paragraph to make clear changes not announced yet)  HONG KONG, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc\u2019s veteran banker Todd Leland will become Asia investment banking head, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday, adding to leadership changes at the bank since Chief Executive Officer David Solomon took over this month.  In the new role, Leland, an American who joined Goldman in 1992, will replace Andrea Vella and Kate Richdale as the head of the Asia investment banking unit excluding Japan. Vella and Richdale were appointed co-heads of the unit in 2015.  Vella and Richdale will remain in Asia to become the co-chairs of the unit, said the person, who declined to be named as the move has not been made public yet.  A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment.  Leland was named a co-president of the bank for Asia Pacific excluding Japan in September last year, after having previously worked in London for 10 years.  He takes over at a time when China\u2019s aggressive outbound push for mergers and acquisitions has slowed this year amid an escalating trade war with the United States, and weaker markets are expected to weigh on the appetite for new equity offerings.  In the first nine months of 2018, Goldman\u2019s revenue in Asia, which is smallest of its three regions, rose 9 percent to $3.9 billion. Asia\u2019s share of group sales fell by 1 percentage point to 14 percent in that period, its filings showed.  Richdale, a fluent Mandarin speaker with experience in Southeast Asian dealmaking, joined Goldman from Morgan Stanley in March 2013.  Before taking over the Asia leadership role, Vella had been co-head of the financing group in the region since January 2014. Prior to that he was head of credit capital markets in Asia excluding Japan.  Among other executive changes since Solomon was named the group chief executive, Goldman last month named Dan Dees, who heads the technology, media and telecom investment banking group globally, as investment banking co-chief.  Dees will share his new title with Gregg Lemkau and Marc Nachmann.  Dees\u2019s promotion came about a week after Goldman elevated former investment banking co-head John Waldron to president and chief operating officer and named Stephen Scherr as its new finance chief.  The Wall Street Journal first reported the Asia leadership changes at Goldman on Saturday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Fed said the biggest U.S. banks had enough capital to withstand over $600 billion in losses from a short, sharp economic slump, as well as a moderate longer-lasting downturn, and would now be permitted to pay out dividends and buy back stock on a limited basis.  Earlier this year, the Fed barred banks from buying back stock to help them build capital reserves because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This was its second bank \u201cstress test\u201d for 2020, the first time the Fed has done two in a year since annual health checks began after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.  Goldman shares were last up 7.2% after surpassing their January high for the first time since the COVID-crisis. Morgan Stanley was up 5.9% and trading at its highest since September 2007.  In comparison, the S&P 500 bank subsector, which does not include Goldman or Morgan Stanley, was up 3.1%.  The regulator\u2019s decision came quicker than many investors had expected and suggested Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs investors were in line for bigger buybacks than the majority of the sector, according to Piper Sander analyst Jeffery Harte.  \u201cOverall, the amount of share buybacks the Fed\u2019s math suggests the big banks will be able to make in the first quarter of 2021 is good news for the group,\u201d said Harte.  As for Goldman Sachs, Harte noted that investors had worried more about the bank\u2019s dividend prospects during the pandemic.  \u201cIt\u2019s quite a positive change from people being concerned Goldman wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain their dividend to being able to buyback more stocks than most of the sector,\u201d he said.  The Fed\u2019s decision came earlier than expected and the results were a little better than expected across the board, said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  \u201cGenerally people thought the Fed was going to keep restrictions in place another quarter or two,\u201d said Grant, who also suggested investors were favoring Morgan Stanley and Goldman due to relatively cheap valuations.

In the sector index JPMorgan Chase led gainers, up 4.8% while Citigroup climbed 3.7% and Bank of America was up 4.0%.  Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was down 0.6% as investors fled risk after a new strain of the coronavirus emerged in the United Kingdom, leading several countries to close their borders to Britain just days before the UK is set to leave the European Union.","721":"The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.

He cited grounds that the jury had been told that \u201ctangible\u201d could mean \u201ccapable of being understood by the mind,\u201d and the appeals court did not adopt that definition. He said he was \u201cconfident\u201d that motion would succeed.  Aleynikov, 48, was arrested on federal charges in July 2009 and convicted in December 2010, only to be exonerated by a federal appeals court in February 2012 after serving 11 months of an eight-year prison sentence.  Vance then filed state criminal charges against Aleynikov in August 2012. He was convicted by a jury in May 2015, but the judge who presided over the trial overturned the verdict, finding the copied code was not tangible.  However, the Appellate Division, First Department, a mid-level state appeals court, reinstated the conviction in January 2017, saying a copy on a disk could be tangible. The Court of Appeals agreed to review the case in April 2017.  Aleynikov, a Russian-born U.S. citizen, has said he intended the code only for his own use.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The revenue-boosting plan that management laid out last year has produced $2.5 billion so far in 2018, according to a presentation by Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr at an industry event. He stopped short of increasing the target, but suggested Goldman could still do better.  \u201cWhile we are meeting our objectives, these initiatives are not the limit of our ambition. Numerous business opportunities exist beyond the $5 billion (target),\u201d said Scherr, who plans to provide a strategic update in the spring.  The presentation marks the first under a new management team at Goldman Sachs. The bank is now led by a group of longtime dealmakers, including Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, who started on Oct. 1, Chief Operating Officer John Waldron and Scherr, who gave the presentation on his first day as CFO.  Goldman, once considered the most savvy Wall Street trading houses, has suffered as tougher regulations make it harder to maintain profits at its trading businesses and as customer trends change since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Its new management wants to reshape the business. It is conducting a \u201cfront-to-back\u201d review and will make a \u201cclinical assessment\u201d of whether each business is meeting its cost of capital, Scherr said, adding that the bank is not looking to shrink or exit businesses, but instead determine where to deploy capital for the best returns.  Scherr\u2019s presentation showed Goldman making headway on plans to lend more to consumers and big businesses. Its fledgling digital bank, Marcus, now has 2 million customers and it wants to grow that business\u2019s market share to eventually become a \u201cone-stop shop for financial well-being,\u201d Scherr said.  The bank is also working to improve areas such as trading, and to squeeze more revenue from the investment bank where Solomon and his deputies built their careers. That business has generated $40 billion in deal volume from new customers since Goldman launched its strategy in 2016.  Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a report last week that it could take a significant amount of time for Goldman to truly change its earnings mix by growing organically rather than pursuing a substantial acquisition. Whichever path it pursues, he said, the bank is headed in the right direction.  \u201cGoldman Sachs really wants to get bigger in growth businesses that investors and clients value most,\u201d Schorr said.

Italian bond yields have tumbled after the right-wing League failed to overturn decades of leftist rule in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna in Sunday\u2019s election. That\u2019s pushed the Italian\/German yield spread, a measure of the premium investors demand to hold Italian risk, to around 140 bps .  Goldman said the rally in Italian bonds following Sunday\u2019s regional election results reflected a view that a near-term snap national election was unlikely.  \u201cDespite the rally so far today, we think BTPs (Italian bonds) have more room to outperform versus other Euro area sovereigns,\u201d the bank told clients in a note.  \u201cMacro and political risks will remain a potential source of volatility in Italian debt over the longer run, but tactically we expect further compression in BTP-Bunds to 120 bps, assisted by the improving macro data in Europe.\u201d  The 120 bps milestone was last seen in May 2018, just before an Italian political crisis sparked a sharp bond selloff.","735":"(Adds company background)  NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Monday it is forming a new group within its merchant banking division called the alternatives capital markets and strategy group.

Kukies, who was formerly co-head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, left the Wall Street firm a year ago to become deputy German finance minister.  Kukies has since advocated a merger between Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, which unions warn could mean up to 30,000 job cuts, people familiar with the matter say.  Goldman Sachs is advising Commerzbank on the $28 billion plus deal deliberations, people familiar with the matter said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a conflict of interest,\u201d Fabio De Masi, a prominent leftist lawmaker in the German parliament, said, pointing to the state\u2019s 15 percent stake in Commerzbank.  Others echoed that complaint.  \u201cTo have Goldman Sachs advising Commerzbank, part owned by the state, on a merger a former partner in government is pushing for is incredibly insensitive,\u201d said Florian Toncar, a lawmaker from the pro-business Free Democrats party. \u201cThis makes it look as if the deal was done by an old boys\u2019 network.\u201d  Toncar said he would \u201cpursue this issue in parliament and ask how Goldman came to have the mandate.\u201d  A spokesman for Kukies told Reuters there was no conflict of interest and that he had worked in the trading department at Goldman Sachs, which was \u201cstrictly separated\u201d from bankers who advised on mergers.  Goldman Sachs declined to comment.  \u201cIn his 17 years at Goldman Sachs, Joerg Kukies exclusively worked for the sales and trading sector with no responsibility for the advisory\/mergers and acquisitions section,\u201d the spokesman for Kukies said.  Although confirmation of merger talks between Germany\u2019s two largest banks, following months of speculation, has boosted their share prices, it has also triggered opposition and concerns over the impact on employment.  The issue is a highly emotive one in Germany and in its Tuesday edition, top-selling tabloid newspaper Bild raised a question mark over Kukie\u2019s future in the government.  \u201cWhen 30,000 jobs are on the line, the government must avoid the impression of a conflict of interest,\u201d De Masi added.  This was echoed by Danyal Bayaz, a German parliamentarian and finance expert from the country\u2019s Green party.  \u201cIn the financial crisis, we saw that government and finance were too interconnected. Ten years later, we don\u2019t want to have the same. We want a strict separation from politics and industry,\u201d Bayaz said.  \u201cIt is important to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest,\u201d he added.

The Goldman unit is also seeking between US$5bn and US$10bn for West Street Strategic Solutions I (WSSS I), a special situations fund that will invest in transactions that include growth capital and balance sheet restructurings.

Concurrently, lending to private equity-backed companies in the middle market, the most common type of private credit transaction, fell as much as 70% in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.  Limited partners (LPs) such as university endowments, insurance companies and pension funds invest in private credit funds.  The Connecticut pension fund is considering a US$350m commitment to Goldman Sachs\u2019 investment funds to manage across different credit strategies, including Loan Partners IV and WSSS I.  The pension fund portfolio has a 5% allocation to private credit, Shawn Wooden, Connecticut state treasurer, said in an email.  \u201cThe purpose of this allocation is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns above public market debt strategies and reduce volatility through lower correlation to other asset classes,\u201d he said.  The private credit allocation can include sub-strategies that invest in senior debt, junior debt, distressed debt and special situations, Wooden said.  After several months of caution following the Covid-19 outbreak, LPs have broadly resumed normal operations, according to a June investor survey from Campbell Lutyens, a firm that helps credit managers raise money.  Loan Partners IV will operate with fund-level leverage, which would allow Goldman Sachs to borrow money to invest alongside LPs\u2019 commitments.

REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo  Nonetheless, Marcus represents a tiny portion of Goldman\u2019s overall revenue \u2013 just 2.7% last year, as its Wall Street businesses flourished \u2013 underscoring how hard it will be for the bank to build a consumer franchise that becomes a household name like Chase or Bank of America Corp without a substantial acquisition.  UBS analyst Brennan Hawken asked management why they would invest Goldman\u2019s own capital in technology and other infrastructure if there was an easy way to grow through M&A.  \u201cThe bar to do something significant is extremely high, and it\u2019s not an easy thing to do,\u201d said Solomon.  Management re-affirmed targets to reduce costs to 60% of revenue and produce a 13% return-on-equity by 2022. Last year, Goldman\u2019s costs were 65% of revenue and its ROE, which measures how much profit the bank can squeeze from shareholder funds, 11.1%.  Goldman still intends to grow consumer deposits to over $125 billion by 2024, up from $97 billion in 2020.  BUMPER YEAR  Analysts mostly celebrated Goldman\u2019s fourth-quarter results, which were driven by huge trading gains as well as a surge in underwriting fees.  The bank\u2019s net income attributable to common shareholders more than doubled, to $4.4 billion, or $12.08 per share, from $1.7 billion, or $4.69 per share, in the year-earlier period.  Analysts had expected a profit of $7.47 per share on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cIt was an exceptionally strong quarter,\u201d said Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski.  Revenue at all four of Goldman\u2019s businesses rose in the final quarter, but trading added the most to its bottom line, jumping 23% to $4.3 billion on robust volumes and asset values.  Goldman\u2019s trading operation registered its best annual performance in a decade as investors churned portfolios during a rollercoaster year. Dips and turns in coronavirus infection rates and policy responses, combined with social-injustice protests and a historic U.S. election created lots of volatility.  Trading accounted for 47% of Goldman\u2019s revenue in 2020, up from 40% the prior year.  Investment banking revenue jumped 27% to $2.6 billion during the fourth quarter, driven mainly by equity underwriting, which was up 195% from the same period in 2019.  Total revenue climbed 18% to $11.7 billion.  The results helped Goldman absorb a $3 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators over its role in Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB corruption scandal. The bank also set aside $3.1 billion to cover bad loans, compared to $1.1 billion last year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic.","752":"April 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc:  * EQUITY INTERNATIONAL, GOLDMAN SACHS MERCHANT BANKING DIVISION, CENTAURUS CAPITAL ANNOUNCE FORMATION & $300 MILLION INVESTMENT OF ARG REALTY GROUP Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","753":"Feb 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs\u2019s Sumit Rajpal, one of three co-heads of a merged alternative investing unit at the bank, has announced his resignation, Business Insider reported on Friday, citing sources.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - A club under the San Francisco freeway is one of the last places you\u2019d expect Goldman Sachs to throw a party. But it\u2019s not investment bankers gathering here. Instead, it\u2019s a comedy show arranged by Marcus, the company\u2019s online retail bank. The unit\u2019s edgier approach to business - and marketing - is giving Goldman a buzz it has sorely lacked.  The $98 billion firm run by Lloyd Blankfein has struggled since last decade\u2019s financial crisis to stand out as the elite performer it once was. Poor form in trading fixed income, currency and commodities in recent quarters is a big reason why.  Judging by results for the first three months of this year, unveiled on Tuesday, that division is improving. FICC revenue doubled from a year earlier, to $2 billion, the best performance in three years. But it\u2019s far from its glory days: its average quarterly top line in 2009 was almost $6 billion. And an annualized return on equity just above 15 percent marks Goldman as a whole as a solid franchise, but it doesn\u2019t exude excitement.  Marcus does. It now embodies the hungry approach to business that used to define Goldman. It\u2019s growing fast \u2013 from a small base \u2013 boosting retail loans by more than 50 percent to $3 billion in the first three and a bit months of this year. And that was after Blankfein urged executives to grow slowly and get it right, Marcus\u2019s chief commercial officer, Omer Ismail, told attendees at the LendIt Fintech conference in San Francisco last week.  It\u2019s also cranking out deals. On Sunday Marcus bought Clarity Money, a 15-month-old app allowing people to aggregate savings accounts, loans, insurance and the like. It\u2019s becoming the hot area of fintech. Online-lending newcomer Upgrade as well as big old Citi pitched similar services at last week\u2019s conference.  In recent months Marcus has also bought the assets of e-lender Bond Street and credit-card startup Final. Ismail calls these aqui-hires. He\u2019s getting an impressive new employee with Clarity Money: Adam Dell, a serial entrepreneur and investor, whose brother Michael founded computing firm Dell. He joins Goldman as a partner. Marcus is also open to deals in everything from revolving credit to wealth management.  It\u2019ll be a while yet until Marcus adds much to Goldman\u2019s bottom line \u2013 perhaps $450 million in pre-tax profit by 2020, the investment bank projects, less than 4 percent of what analysts reckon Goldman will rake in overall. For now, though, the upstart division is providing a breath of fresh air.","756":"FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians walk past a BBC logo at Broadcasting House, as the corporation announced it will cut around 450 jobs from its news division, in London, Britain January 29, 2020.

The new fund was launched in March and is in the process of raising $250 million from founders with the remaining fundraising expected to close by the end of the year. BBL Commodities itself currently has some $500 million to $600 million under management.  The new fund will be a rare beast in the market where commodities are often being traded by macro funds based on macro-economic trends.  But Goldberg says the world will face a number of tectonic changes relating to commodities in the next few years that will be so big that they will allow the trading of entire countries based on them.  One of the trends, he says, is the upcoming change in global marine regulations in 2020 that will set a new upper limit for sulfur content in fuel used for shipping to cut pollution.  The rule will see a drastic reduction in demand for fuel oil, currently used in ships, and raise demand for cleaner, low-sulfur diesel. That in turn will depress the value of heavy, sulfurous crude oil from places such as Canada as they tend to yield more fuel oil than diesel.  \u201cWhat happens to the balance of payments of Canada when your main export product gets less value? And who \u2013 which country and currency \u2013 does better in this scenario? That is what the fund will be looking at,\u201d said Goldberg.  The Wall Street Journal was first to report about the launch of the fund.  The impact from new marine fuel regulations might be as big as if not bigger than those from the U.S. shale boom on the global oil industry, said Goldberg.  When U.S. shale oil production soared in 2012-2014, the world had an oversupply of 1 million barrels per day of oil, equal to around one percent of demand.  But when new marine fuel regulation comes into play, demand for diesel will probably increase by about 2 million barrels per day or by over six percent of current global diesel demand, said Goldberg.  He said the fund will be also look at currencies such as the Australian dollar and Russian rouble, interest rates and broad-based equity indices across commodity producers.  \u201cPeople are saying the world will have a petrochemical boom. So we, for example, will be looking at what this boom means for broad indices,\u201d said Goldberg.  He said the advantage of having a macro fund exploring commodity trends is primarily in having access to more liquid asset classes. \u201cThe gasoline market is simply less liquid than the Canadian dollar.\u201d  Goldberg is fairly bullish on oil prices in the short term but in the medium term he expects crude to come under pressure as global demand growth is set to slow, OPEC cuts will end, while U.S. and Canadian output will increase on the back of improved efficiency.","758":"Jan 7 (Reuters) - Instacart said on Thursday it had hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Nick Giovanni as its new chief financial officer, as the U.S. grocery delivery app gears up for a potential initial public offering (IPO).

The new \u201cfirm wide flexible dress code\u201d was announced in an internal memo, which said the shift was due to \u201cthe changing nature of workplaces generally in favor of a more casual environment.\u201d  The memo sent to the bank\u2019s some 36,000 employees was penned by Chief Executive Officer David Solomon, a former investment banker who took the role in October, along with Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron.  Historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, Goldman Sachs traditionally required formal business attire. But since 2017, the bank began relaxing its dress code for employees in the technology division and other new digital businesses.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann -\/File Photo  But Goldman is entering a crowded market for co-branded cards where retailers often have the upper hand, and analysts question how much tolerance its shareholders will have for growing the bank\u2019s fledgling consumer business through credit card lending.  Goldman has been courting consumers since the 2016 launch of its online bank Marcus, and with its first credit card it is targeting fee-conscious ones. There will be no annual or late fees, and customers will pay variable annual interest rates of between 13.24 percent and 24.24 percent, according to Apple\u2019s website.  Apple and Goldman did not disclose the economic terms of their partnership when it was announced on Monday.  But banks have been increasingly willing to take less favorable deals because post-financial crisis regulations make the credit card business attractive for lenders, which are required to hold less capital against such debt than against other assets.  \u201cAs this kind of benign credit environment continues retailers have a greater leverage than they had a few years ago,\u201d said a person involved in similar credit card deals.  Issuing banks retain control of approving customers for cards, often using data the retailer has on shoppers as part of the process, the person said.  Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said in an email to employees on Monday that the card is a \u201cmajor step\u201d in the bank\u2019s plan to grow its consumer business.  Solomon has said the consumer business is a critical part of the bank\u2019s strategy to grow revenues and cut costs, as revenue shrinks in traditional areas of strength for Goldman like bond trading.  But many investors have been uneasy with Goldman growing its unsecured consumer debt, especially at a time when many speculate that a recession could be looming, said UBS analyst Brennan Hawken.  Marcus now has $45 billion in customer deposits in the United States and the U.K., and has issued $5 billion in personal loans, according to Solomon\u2019s email.  While the amount of loans is small compared to the bank\u2019s overall balance sheet, Hawken said investors would likely prefer Goldman stick to using its consumer business to add deposits, as opposed to personal loans or credit card debt.  \u201cPeople want Goldman to be Goldman,\u201d Hawken said. Goldman declined comment for this article.  The Apple Card\u2019s wide interest rate range indicates that some customers might have lower credit scores, said Josh Siegel, chief executive of StoneCastle Financial Corp. However, the bank may not necessarily keep that risk on its books.  \u201cThey might securitize the debt, which wouldn\u2019t be anything new for an investment bank,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Goldman Sachs, all of a sudden, especially with where we are in the credit cycle, is going to go long on unsecured consumer debt.\u201d  As this is Goldman\u2019s first foray into credit cards, it may take the bank a year or two to assess the quality of its credit decisions, according to an industry expert who declined to be named.  The same person said that the stated range of possible interest rates on unpaid balances was too wide to clearly show how much credit risk Goldman expects to take.  Credit risk concerns aside, analysts said that Goldman\u2019s decision to launch its first credit card in partnership with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies gives it the opportunity to gain consumer market share.  While Apple says its card is \u201ccreated by Apple, not a bank,\u201d according to its website, the Goldman Sachs logo will appear on the back of the card.  \u201cFor Goldman this is a play for massive distribution without having to contort too much,\u201d said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy and partner at Autonomous Research.  \u201cIt makes their brand way better at least in the retail and mass affluent marketplace.\u201d","768":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA is pictured in Darmstadt, Germany January 28, 2016.

Merck\u2019s takeover proposal of $48 per share in cash compares with an offer of around $39.6 worth of Entegris stock for each Versum share under the existing deal, based on Entegris\u2019 closing price of $35.38 on Wednesday.  Entegris announced a $4 billion all-stock deal in January for Versum, the former specialty chemicals division of industrial gases group Air Products, saying it wanted to create a big chemical supplier to the semiconductor market at a time when the industry is under pressure.","769":"SAO PAULO, March 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group is changing its management in Brazil, Latin America co-heads Gonzalo Garcia and Ram Sundaram announced in a statement on Thursday.

The Wall Street bank posted a quarterly return-on-equity of 17.5%, its highest since 2010. Investors closely track that figure because it shows how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profits.  Goldman also boasted record earnings per share, beating analyst expectations by a wide margin. Its performance was driven in large part by a 29% jump in trading revenue, as clients responded to news about the coronavirus pandemic by shifting their portfolios.  While rivals including JPMorgan Chase & Co have also benefited from the markets boom this year, they are far more exposed to vulnerable consumers and businesses suffering from unemployment and pandemic lockdowns. Goldman\u2019s consumer bank is relatively tiny.  \u201cSimply stunning results,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a report.  Goldman\u2019s shares were up 0.6% by late morning as shares of other big lenders fell.  In the years leading up to the pandemic, Goldman\u2019s heavy exposure to trading and lack of exposure to traditional lending was viewed as a problem. The bank is in the middle of a business-model revamp orchestrated by Chief Executive David Solomon that includes building out its consumer bank, called Marcus, and adding services like retail wealth management.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  Analysts say that is the right strategy for the long term, but, for now, Goldman\u2019s business mix is just right.  \u201cGoldman remains one of our favorite stocks,\u201d Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said. \u201cIts loan portfolio is small and of very high quality compared to those of other large bank holding companies. It has minimal exposure to credit cards and small business, which we see as the biggest COVID-19 risks. But it has upside leverage to more active capital markets.\u201d  Goldman\u2019s $4.6 billion in quarterly trading revenue included gains across fixed income and equity markets, and a bigger increase than other Wall Street banks. The business accounted for 42% of Goldman\u2019s overall revenue, while consumer and wealth management represented 14%.  The bank set aside $278 million to cover loans that go bad, bringing its year-to-date total credit provisions to $2.8 billion. By comparison, traditional rivals JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc have set aside anywhere from $10 billion-20 billion this year.  Goldman\u2019s investment banking business also benefited from several high-profile IPOs including Snowflake, Rocket Companies and Dun & Bradstreet during the quarter.  Goldman expects the trends to continue through at least the end of the year, as markets remain volatile and its investment banking backlog has grown, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on an analyst call.  \u201cWe can count on any number of issues to be the source of some volatility, whether it\u2019s the U.S. election, Libor transition, or the trajectory of COVID,\u201d he said.  Goldman has also picked up \u201cmeaningful\u201d market share across its trading businesses, he said, part of the bank\u2019s strategy to target major corporations for hedging, Treasury and risk-management services.  The bank\u2019s overall profit nearly doubled $3.5 billion from $1.8 billion a year ago. Earnings per share were a record $9.68, up from $4.79 a year earlier.  Analysts had expected a profit of $5.57 per share, on average, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.  Revenue rose at all four of its business units, with total revenue up 30% to $10.8 billion. That was above the $9.5 billion consensus estimate.","771":"FILE PHOTO: David M.

Marqeta\u2019s technology will be used to issue debit cards connected to the checking account, Jason Gardner, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive said in an interview.  Launched in 2016, Marcus has allowed Goldman to diversify its revenue and funding sources by offering savings accounts and personal loans to retail customers. Until then, the bank had operated largely as an investment bank and trading house, relying on money from the wholesale market.  Goldman, which had amassed more than $96 billion in consumer deposits through Marcus as of September 2020, has been investing heavily in its retail business. It bought a personal finance app in 2018, launched a credit card with Apple Inc in 2019 and has been offering lucrative savings rates to draw in more customers.  It launched an app for Marcus a little over a year ago, finally meeting demand from frustrated smartphone users who had to view account information, make loan payments or balance transfers on the bank\u2019s website.  Marqeta\u2019s clients include well-known digital payments companies like Square Inc and Klarna. Its platform has become popular with young tech-savvy financial companies, as it claims its technology makes it easier for fintech software developers to build new products and services.

In a report dated April 9 and provided on Thursday in response to a request from Reuters, ISS wrote it had \u201cpay-for-performance misalignment concerns\u201d regarding Goldman leaders including David Solomon, chief executive of the Wall Street bank, which has an annual meeting set for April 30.  Technically the pay was awarded for Goldman\u2019s performance in 2019, a period for which Solomon\u2019s total compensation rose 19% to $24.7 million, including a $7.65 million bonus.  But in practice many investors will also evaluate the pay in the context of the current economic crisis stemming from the pandemic, said Yonat Assayag, partner at pay consultant ClearBridge Compensation Group.  A stunning 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since mid-March, according to the latest Labor Department figures released on Thursday, wiping out all the jobs gained during the longest employment boom in U.S. history.  \u201cShareholders will have that in their minds,\u201d Assayag said. She added, \u201cThat\u2019s where it becomes a bit of a conundrum, because the decisions for bonuses were based on prior year\u2019s financial results.\u201d  As a cash crunch takes hold, hundreds of executives at other U.S. companies across nearly every economic sector have taken salary cuts and outlined further pay reviews as the scope of the crisis becomes clear.  Top banks in late March sought to reassure staff that they would not cut jobs.  And last week, Goldman executives said they were focused on controlling costs and may reevaluate the \u201ctiming, magnitude and pace\u201d of expenses and investments this year.  ISS wrote that its concerns about Goldman \u201care underscored by a significantly increased CEO bonus for a period when several key financial metrics were down year-over-year.\u201d The company\u2019s pay programs appear to give its directors too much discretion, ISS wrote.  Goldman Sachs spokesman Patrick Scanlan said the bank\u2019s compensation structure incentivized long-term growth and the meeting of financial targets, and did not place \u201cundue emphasis on shorter term results.\u201d  \u201cCompensation for 2019 reflects the significant achievements of our executives, including the development of a long-term growth strategy, implementation of a new operating approach, and consistent, solid net revenue performance,\u201d Scanlan said.  Solomon\u2019s 2019 raise stood out among compensation packages for CEOs at top U.S. banks.  Though the banks mostly ended the year with near-record profits, executive compensation remained stagnant as boards became more cost-conscious, reflecting a weaker revenue outlook.  JPMorgan Chase & Co raised its CEO\u2019s pay by 1.6%, while Bank of America and Citigroup held CEO pay flat. ISS has recommended investors support pay proposals at the latter two banks, while its report for JPMorgan is not yet out.  ISS recommended Goldman investors vote with management on other items, including backing the election of all directors, including Solomon.

Malaysian prosecutors this week filed charges against Goldman Sachs in connection with its role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the first criminal action against the U.S. bank over the scandal.

Goldman has said the outsized fees related to additional risks: it bought the unrated bonds while it sought investors and, in the case of a 2013 bond deal which raised $2.7 billion, 1MDB wanted the funds quickly.  Malaysia has sought jail terms and billions in fines from Goldman Sachs and four individuals who allegedly misappropriated about $2.7 billion from the 1MDB bond proceeds.  The U.S. Department of Justice alleges that a total of about $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and used to buy, among others, real estate in London and New York, expensive jewelry and artwork, and a private jet.

Authorities in Singapore were trying to determine whether some of the $600 million in fees that Goldman earned from the three bond deals flowed to the Singapore subsidiary, the news agency said.  In response to the report, the Singapore police said their criminal investigation into entities involved in 1MDB-related offence in Singapore had been going on since 2015.

REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse  Goldman was one of investment banks that would have led the IPO last year, after convincing the office space-sharing start-up it could improve on the $47 billion valuation in a private fundraising round it secured in January 2019.  The IPO was canceled after investors raised questions about WeWork\u2019s valuation and corporate governance arrangements that gave its co-founder Adam Neumann too much control.  WeWork ended up facing a cash crunch, and was rescued by shareholder SoftBank Group Corp in October in a $9.5 billion deal that gave the Japanese group majority control.  \u201cThe banks were not valuing (WeWork).

You say to the company, well, if you can prove to us that the model actually does what it does, then it\u2019s possible that the company is worth this in the public markets,\u201d Solomon said.  WeWork was considering a valuation of as low as $10 billion and $12 billion at the time it was preparing for an IPO in September, Reuters reported at the time.  Solomon told a conference panel at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland that the process worked because due diligence and feedback by potential IPO investors \u201cground it in reality.\u201d  While 2019 had promised to be a bumper year for IPOs, investor confidence fizzled out. Shares of some high-profile start-ups such as Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc languished in the months following their listings. A few companies, such as WeWork, canceled their stock market debuts, because of investor pushback against their valuations.  \u201cIf you bought a package of all the IPOs that came to market in 2019 I think you returned 34% and outperformed the broader market a little bit. But there were companies that did not perform well and did not meet the expectations that were set,\u201d Solomon said.  Cheap money, driven by low interest rates, is pushing investors to take risks, and this has led them to overvalue some companies\u2019 growth projections and not focus on their underlying earnings, Solomon said.  Solomon added that the fact that Saudi Aramco\u2019s $29.4 billion IPO attracted primarily domestic, rather than international, investors last month was because the valuation pitched to them on the local exchange was not attractive enough.","784":"Feb 19 (Reuters) - A deep freeze in Texas that has brought power outages and shut refineries and pipelines will have only a small and transitory impact on the global oil market, Goldman Sachs said in a note.  Oil prices slid by up to 2% on Friday, on worries that refineries will take time to resume operations after the big freeze in the U.S. South, creating a gap in demand, while OPEC+ supplies were expected to rise.  Texas\u2019s energy outages extended into a sixth day on Thursday, with the impact of reduced supplies from the biggest energy-producing state in the United States spilling over to neighbouring Mexico.  The bank estimates an average decline of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) in February production of U.S. Lower-48 onshore crude, seeing a quick output rebound on expectations of warmer weather this weekend.  \u201cWhile the gross impacts on supply and demand are large, they are mostly offsetting, and even more importantly, transitory, resulting in minimal implications for global oil prices, leaving risks to a further reversal of this week\u2019s rally,\u201d it said in Thursday\u2019s note.  Goldman estimates, on the demand side, industrial and shale downtime will reduce refinery gas by 50,000 bpd and diesel consumption by 150,000 bpd, while blocked roads and canceled flights will limit road gasoline demand by 250,000 bpd and jet fuel demand by 60,000 bpd.  Low temperatures and power outages should fuel heating demand for LPG by 80,000 bpd and for diesel powered generators by 200,000 bpd, however, it said.  Since oil refineries are potentially worse prepared for uniquely cold weather than seasonal storms, that could leave risks to the downside to even more prolonged refining downtime, it added.

The bank\u2019s 2020 performance was buffeted wildly by a combination of good times for traders, terrible times for almost everyone else, and a legacy of bad behavior in Goldman\u2019s own ranks. Remove the noise and Goldman still hit a sweet spot.  Goldman\u2019s earnings grew 13% to $8.9 billion in a year in which most rivals saw double-digit declines. Bank of America on Tuesday reported a 37% drop, following Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo southward. The difference is trading income, which accounts for almost half of Goldman\u2019s revenue, and which surged. That more than outweighed the fines the bank paid to settle its role in Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB scandal, an atonement that knocked around $3.4 billion off its net profit.  Look past the 1MDB fine, and Goldman would have made a return on equity of 15%, its best since 2009. That\u2019s not all Solomon\u2019s doing. Deduct the $3 billion increase in markets-related earnings \u2013 a Covid-19 windfall \u2013 and that figure falls by about 3.8 percentage points. But it\u2019s still higher than the 10% the firm produced in 2019, and above Goldman\u2019s likely cost of equity.  It\u2019s undoubtedly progress. Under the surface, the $100 billion bank is becoming more efficient: It is already half way to its $1.3 billion medium-term cost-cutting target. Furthermore, Goldman\u2019s giant operations are gradually getting cheaper to fund, thanks to its efforts at gathering retail deposits. Those increased by a third. Again, Covid-19 swelled deposits at all big lenders. Even Wells Fargo, which is in the doghouse for years of scamming its customers, grew its retail balances by 21%.  Solomon may have picked an unfortunate moment to set big targets, but his timing when it comes to retail banking is nifty. Goldman benefits from the surge in deposits but isn\u2019t being dragged down by the slump in lending and the sliding rates that have impacted other big lenders. Interest makes up around half of Bank of America and JPMorgan\u2019s revenue, but still only one-tenth of Goldman\u2019s. Solomon started the year with good intentions, and ended it with good fortune.","787":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon\u2019s annual pay fell by $10 million, or 36%, in 2020, according to regulatory disclosures filed Tuesday, reflecting the bank\u2019s role in Malaysia\u2019s 1MDB scandal.  FILE PHOTO: Goldman Sachs' Chairman and CEO David Solomon attends a session at the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2020. REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse  Solomon will receive $17.5 million for his work during the year, compared with $27.5 million the year before, the bank said.  Goldman previously announced it would reduce Solomon\u2019s pay, along with that of Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron, in light of the findings of investigations into the bank\u2019s role in the affair.  The scandal dates to the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009.  Between 2009 and 2014, Goldman bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win 1MDB business, including underwriting $6.5 billion in bond sales, for which it earned $600 million in fees, the bank has said.  Waldron will receive $18.5 million for his work last year, down 24%, or $6 million, from 2019.  Scherr will be paid $15.5 million, down 31%, or $7 million, from the previous year.  Were it not for the 1MDB scandal, Solomon and Scherr\u2019s pay would have been unchanged from the previous year, the bank said, and Waldron\u2019s pay would have risen by $1 million.  Rival Morgan Stanley\u2019s Chief Executive James Gorman saw his annual pay rise by $6 million, or 22%, last year, according to a regulatory filing released on Friday.  Goldman said in October it is clawing back $174 million from a dozen current and former executives, including Solomon and his predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein. The bank agreed to pay $2.9 billion to settle probes into its role in the 1MDB corruption scandal.","788":"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N poured more than $1 billion into two of its prime money-market portfolios this week due to heavy investor withdrawals, according to a filing with the U.S. securities regulator.  FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the ticker symbol and information for Goldman Sachs on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) February 9, 2016. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The Wall Street bank purchased $722.4 million in assets from its Goldman Sachs Financial Square Money Market Fund GPMXX.O and $301.2 million from its Goldman Sachs Fund Square Prime Obligations Fund.  Its support came as markets had another violently volatile week over concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, and represents an extraordinary move in the staid money-market fund industry.  Goldman, which disclosed the moves on Friday in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, did not have an immediate comment.  The bank repurchased securities from its two funds on Thursday after investors withdrew a net $8.1 billion from them during a four-day stretch, according to the disclosure.  Industrywide, investors pulled tens of billions of dollars from prime money-market funds, which buy top-rated corporate debt. Although they are among the tamest investment vehicles, they can be riskier than portfolios that rely more on U.S. government bonds.  The U.S. Federal Reserve rolled out three emergency credit programs this week to battle a global economic shutdown that has roiled the $3.8 trillion money-market mutual fund industry. The Fed is in effect encouraging banks to buy assets from those funds, insulating them from having to sell assets at a discount if they come under pressure from households or firms wanting to withdraw money.  Weekly liquidity levels at the nearly $18 billion Goldman Sachs Fund Square Money Market Fund dropped to 34% on Thursday from 43% on Monday. SEC rules on weekly liquidity dictate that funds have to keep at least 30% of their portfolios in securities that can be converted to cash in five business days.  During that four-day stretch, investors made $6.84 billion in net withdrawals from the fund, Goldman disclosures show.  Goldman's support is unusual, but it does not stand alone in supporting its funds during the coronavirus panic. Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N also stepped in twice this week with a total of $2.1 billion to prop up Dreyfus Cash Management.  That $10.5 billion portfolio was also hit by heavy investor withdrawals. BNY bought $1.2 billion from the prime money-market fund on Wednesday and then another $949 million on Thursday, according to fund disclosures, part of which was first reported by the Financial Times.  If a prime fund\u2019s weekly liquidity level falls below 30%, SEC rules give its board discretion to introduce redemption fees of up to 2% to slow down investor withdrawals. They can also put up gates for up to 10 business days.  Those moves, however, would not be welcomed by investors. That\u2019s why fund sponsors like Goldman and BNY Mellon can provide capital support so liquidity levels don\u2019t drop below the threshold. Other fund sponsors have stayed more heavily weighted in liquidity.  The recent market panic has been reminiscent of what happened in 2008, when money-market fund problems threatened to freeze up global markets.  The Reserve Primary Fund, which held Lehman Brothers debt, was overwhelmed by investor redemption requests after the investment bank went bankrupt. The fund\u2019s shares fell below $1 apiece, known as \u201cbreaking the buck,\u201d and it was forced to liquidate.  At least 21 other prime funds received support from their parent companies to avoid a similar fate, a Federal Reserve study later found. The U.S. Treasury temporarily supported money market funds as the crisis intensified.","789":"FILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.

GM's credit card issuer Capital One Financial Corp COF.N and Goldman have agreed upon the purchase price and expect to finalize the deal in the coming weeks, the report said.  The acquisition will enhance Goldman\u2019s focus on its consumer banking business, which it is expanding to even out volatile results from segments such as trading and investment banking.  Goldman currently has a much smaller presence in consumer banking, unlike larger peers JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup Inc C.N, and it is an area Chief Executive Officer David Solomon has been aggressively looking to strengthen.  It is the bank's second major credit card partnership, following the launch of a card with Apple Inc AAPL.O last year.  The purchase would also come at a time when U.S. households are cutting back on debt in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Goldman Sachs and Barclays declined to comment, while GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","790":"FILE PHOTO: Police wait outside the Finance Ministry for the arrival of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin before meeting with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble in Berlin, Germany, March 16, 2017.

A further 11 banks were listed as global coordinators and bookrunners but Goldman had no role on the deal.  In the internal email sent as the deal was faltering on Friday, the Goldman banker told colleagues they needed to call clients \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to reassure them that a collapsed deal did not mean markets were closed.  \u201cMS is the only bank to have played a lead role on the two largest postponed HK IPOs in past decade,\u201d said the email, sent to investment bankers in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. \u201cGS has successfully led 26 jumbo Hong Kong IPOs above US$1bn as Sponsor since 2010, more than any other bank on the Street (MS 19, JPM 15),\u201d the email said.  Aside from the AB InBev deal, the Goldman banker's email was referring to the collapse of the $4.5 billion sought by Chinese-U.S. pork producer WH Group 0288.HK in April 2014.  That IPO was pulled as investors balked at the valuation the company sought, although Goldman itself was a sponsor on that deal along with Morgan Stanley and five other banks.  Three months later WH Group successfully raised $2.1 billion in an IPO led solely by Morgan Stanley and Bank of China International.  Goldman did not get a role in the relaunched deal even though the bank was an investor in the pork producer, holding 5.2% of the shares through its private equity unit.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.  Banks fight fiercely for deals and league table credit in equity capital raising, with fees from the business making up about a quarter of the global investment banking fee pool, on average.  Worldwide, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan typically take the top 3 spots, according to Refinitiv data. In Asia, their fortunes fluctuate more, but Goldman and Morgan Stanley ranked first and second in the table for the past two years.","794":"NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc named David Solomon as its next chief executive officer on Tuesday, ushering in a new era for the Wall Street bank as it expands into different businesses and revamps familiar ones.  Solomon\u2019s promotion from his current role as president and chief operating officer comes months after the 56-year-old investment banker was first reported as next in line to succeed longtime CEO Lloyd Blankfein. His first day in charge is October 1.  \u201cDavid is the right person to lead Goldman Sachs,\u201d Blankfein said in a statement. \u201cHe has demonstrated a proven ability to build and grow businesses, identified creative ways to enhance our culture and has put clients at the center of our strategy. Through the talent of our people and the quality of our client franchise, Goldman Sachs is poised to realize the next stage of growth.\u201d  The change comes at a turning point for Goldman Sachs, which is trying to generate another $5 billion in annual revenue by growing its fledgling consumer bank, squeezing more from businesses like asset management and changing the way it approaches trading.  Management detailed parts of that plan last September after years of insisting that Goldman\u2019s once-lucrative trading business would come roaring back to life when markets picked up. Instead, since 2009, Goldman\u2019s annual trading revenue has declined by $20.8 billion.  Unlike Blankfein, who rose through the trading ranks to become CEO, Solomon made a name for himself advising corporations on financing and strategy in Goldman\u2019s investment bank. He joined as a partner in 1999 after working in commercial paper, junk bonds and leveraged finance at firms including Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns.  Alan Schwartz, executive chairman at Guggenheim Partners who worked with Solomon at Bear in the 1990s, said he showed natural leadership qualities early in his career.  \u201cDavid is a very good big picture thinker while at the same time staying on top of all the details,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cFinding both in one individual is unusual.\u201d  Several Goldman bankers who spoke to Reuters said employees in the business have been celebrating Solomon's triumph in a long succession race. (reut.rs\/kPAtnJ)  Though he was considered a \u201cdark horse\u201d candidate years ago, Solomon managed to outlast a number of rivals, including several from the trading business. Among them are former longtime chief operating officer Gary Cohn, who left Goldman last year for a role in President Donald Trump\u2019s White House that he has since departed, and former co-chief operating officer Harvey Schwartz, who left the bank in April after Solomon was chosen as Blankfein\u2019s successor.  Through most of its history, Goldman has alternated between traders and bankers as CEOs. There is natural tension between the two sides of the house at most Wall Street banks, especially after the trading losses and scandals that stemmed from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  Nonetheless, Solomon will have to get traders and bankers to cooperate on the revenue growth plan, which depends partly on the idea that customers should rely on Goldman Sachs not just for merger advice or stock offerings, but for all their borrowing, trading and money management needs.  News of Solomon\u2019s appointment came on the same day Goldman reported second-quarter results, which showed a 44 percent profit rise.  Beyond revenue growth, Solomon\u2019s legacy will depend on whether he can fill Blankfein\u2019s shoes.  The 63-year-old Blankfein, who took the helm in June 2006, oversaw Goldman Sachs through its most difficult period in modern history, involving a taxpayer bailout during the financial crisis, protests over Goldman\u2019s role in the crisis and massive regulatory changes that curtailed some of its most lucrative businesses.  Blankfein resisted pressure to leave during some of those moments, saying there was no better job to have. But in more recent years, he has joked that he does not want to die on the job like one of his predecessors, Gus Levy, who suffered a fatal stroke at a meeting.  He is stepping away at a time when Goldman Sachs is on steadier footing, but needs fresh leadership to reinvent itself, said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst at Vining Sparks.  \u201cThat is what David Solomon\u2019s challenge is,\u201d said Mosby. \u201cThat is why they\u2019re changing the management team.\u201d","795":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N has launched a global training initiative to safeguard the tight-knit culture it developed as a private partnership, even as the bank marks its 19th year as a publicly traded company.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  Bank leaders, including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and his deputy, Chief Operating Officer David Solomon, have been anchoring 2-1\/2-hour sessions with managers across the globe since September, focused on improving culture and employee conduct, executives involved with the effort told Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.  Since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, regulators have put a strong emphasis on improving corporate culture and employee behavior in a bid to reduce risk across the system.  Some 2,500 employees are expected to participate in the mandatory exercise known internally as the \u201cChairman\u2019s Forum\u201d by the time it concludes later this year, the executives said.  The sessions recreate everyday workplace scenarios to encourage senior staff to think about how they should behave when faced with tough decisions and conflict, including with respect to client transactions. Stephen Scherr, CEO of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, which houses the bank\u2019s consumer and corporate lending businesses, has led two of the gatherings so far.  Instilling uniform cultural values has gotten more difficult as Goldman has grown from the private firm with 5,000 employees Scherr joined in 1993 to the global banking institution with 30,000 employees that it is today, he said.  \u201cWhen I look back over 25 years, I don\u2019t think the themes that are being covered in these more organized sessions are frankly very different than those that were pervasive early on,\u201d said Scherr. \u201cWhat has changed is that at a purely practical level we\u2019re a much bigger organization.\u201d Goldman Sachs listed on the New York Stock Exchange in May 1999.  The bank has maintained its partnership program, but partners now represent less than 2 percent of total staff.  Goldman took a hard look at its culture following the financial crisis, when its image was tainted by claims it misled investors over profitable mortgage trades and a former employee who wrote a book accusing bank executives of calling clients \u201cmuppets.\u201d (reut.rs\/TKAIjb) Following that review, an internal committee released a report in 2013 reiterating a set of core business principles established by former CEO John Whitehead that focused on integrity, trust and putting clients first. (reut.rs\/122nCbB)  The training sessions build on that effort, especially as Blankfein enters his 13th year as CEO and prepares to eventually hand the reins over to Solomon.  Goldman executives said they are trying to make the training sessions relevant to real situations managers encounter. Sessions begin with video case studies that lead to interactive group discussions.  Blankfein makes an appearance at the start of each session by video, telling managers to foster a culture in which employees see it their \u201cindividual responsibility to raise issues that they are worried about.\u201d","796":"FILE PHOTO: An oil pump is seen just after sunset outside Saint-Fiacre, near Paris, France September 17, 2019.

He declined to name companies Goldman may partner with, but he said the bank is targeting companies it already works with to find consumers that are likely to have solid credit once global businesses get back to action.  Goldman's consumer bank is small and only five years old, which is why it is looking for customers to grow deposits and loans through partnerships with companies, a strategy larger retail banks like JPMorgan Chase JPM.N and Bank of America BAC.N have used for decades.  The coronavirus has already infected 2,410,208 people around the globe and a deadly respiratory virus associated with it, called COVID-19, has killed 165,854. In response, governments ordered the closure of huge swaths of the global economy, putting many millions of people out of work, but there is now talk of re-opening major cities and businesses. reut.rs\/2Kmkhxw  While it is still a tiny portion of Goldman\u2019s overall revenue, the consumer bank is growing fast.  Consumer banking generated $864 million in revenue last year, roughly 2.4% of Goldman\u2019s total revenue. That figure was $282 million, or 3.2%, at the end of the first quarter.  Despite the coronavirus\u2019 effect on consumers\u2019 finances, Marcus added $12 billion in deposits during the first three months of the year, arriving at $72 billion by March 31 and inching toward management\u2019s goal of $125 billion by 2025.

When the bank helps arrange financing, investments or other services for a big organization, it can sometimes seal a partnership where that organization\u2019s employees are offered a special deal for deposits or loans.  For instance, Goldman is giving discounts on personal loans and extra interest on savings products for AARP members, according to the group\u2019s website. JetBlue is Goldman\u2019s first partner for Marcus Pay, a new product where customers can pay off big purchases in installments over 12 or 18 months at a fixed rate of 10.99% to 25.99%, according to Goldman\u2019s website.  Since the coronavirus took hold in the United States, where Goldman has centered its consumer banking efforts, roughly 22 million people there have pursued jobless claims. Aware that surging unemployment and business disruptions could hinder its Main Street banking ambitions, Goldman is also tightening standards for borrowers, Talwar said.  He would not give specifics about credit standards for customers, but in January the bank said the average FICO score across the consumer bank\u2019s loan and credit cards is 740.  In the fourth quarter last year, banks tightened underwriting requirements on credit cards by the greatest amount since 2009, according to a survey of credit card customers conducted by Moody\u2019s.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always been prudent in our credit standards,\u201d Talwar said.","802":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS\/David Gray  While the bank is not alone on Wall Street in developing such a policy, Goldman carries outsized influence with institutional shareholders as one of the oldest and biggest Wall Street firms. The move also shows the tension between the growing importance of racial justice to investors and the difficulty of effecting social change in the corporate arena.  After pushing companies in its investment portfolio to include at least one woman director since 2019, Goldman Sachs next year wants boards to have a second director from an under-represented background, Catherine Winner, head of stewardship efforts for the $1.8 trillion unit, said in an interview.  For that second spot, Goldman\u2019s definition of diversity includes gender identity, sexual orientation and under-represented race and ethnic groups, and a board with two white women would meet the standard.  Goldman Sachs itself meets the standard based on details in its proxy.  Winner said the change will lead more companies to meet investor expectations. \u201cEscalation draws attention,\u201d she said on Wednesday.  The asset-management arm can exert leverage at companies where it is an important shareholder. The firm casts proxy votes at more than 9,000 corporate annual meetings a year, and last year 25% of its votes against directors were due to a lack of a woman on the board.  Winner said Goldman stopped short of urging companies to add a racially or ethnically diverse director outright because of challenges around obtaining this information. Many companies do not disclose directors\u2019 racial and ethnic make-up, and investors are wrestling with how to judge companies\u2019 progress on diversity without such data.  Some activists want asset managers to set targets. \u201cYou can find the data, the data is out there,\u201d said Roel Campos, a former member of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission who is now chair of the Latino Corporate Directors Association.  The relative ease of knowing which candidates are female is one reason women have made faster gains in the boardroom. Among the Russell 3000, women hold 23% of board seats, up from 15% in 2016, according to researcher Equilar.  Among top U.S. companies 8% of directors are Black and 5% are Hispanic or Latino, well below the groups\u2019 share of the U.S. population, 13% and 19% respectively.  In an interview this week BlackRock Inc stewardship chief Sandy Boss also cited a lack of data as a reason the largest asset manager will avoid a specific racial or ethnic target in its policy.

The recommendation from the bloc\u2019s ethics watchdog follows a year-long inquiry triggered after Barroso, a former Portuguese premier who led the European Commission for 10 years until 2014, joined the London arm of the U.S. investment bank in mid-2016.  Barroso has complained of \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d behaviour towards him. The Ombudsman said in a statement that her opinion had been influenced by new revelations that Barroso met a senior commissioner on Goldman\u2019s behalf last October despite having given an undertaking not to lobby his former employers in 2016.  With the EU reeling at that time from Britain\u2019s vote to quit, Barroso\u2019s successor Jean-Claude Juncker said he disapproved of his move to an institution criticised by some for its role in the financial crisis that plagued Europe.  But Juncker at first said he could not obstruct Barroso taking the job as an 18-month \u201ccooling off\u201d period to avert conflicts of interest had lapsed.  However, Juncker doubled that period for future incumbents and referred Barroso\u2019s case to the Commission\u2019s internal ethics committee to examine whether Barroso had breached a lifetime obligation for ex-commissioners to \u201cbehave with integrity\u201d.  That committee\u2019s subsequent ruling that Barroso suffer no loss of EU pension or other entitlements due to his new job was based, the Ombudsman said in her report, on a promise not to lobby the Commission on behalf of his new employer - a promise, she said, Barroso breached in his October meeting.  There was no immediate reaction from the Commission. It has the power to ask the EU court to cut the pensions of former commissioners who breach treaty obligations to act with integrity but such a step would be unprecedented. The Ombudsman Emily O\u2019Reilly recommended that the Commission consider asking Barroso to commit to refrain from lobbying it for some years.

Based on shareholder feedback, the New York bank had proposed to continue its stock plan for three years but requested no new shares be issued. The bank is changing its business model toward more deposit taking and lending and less reliance on deal-making.","809":"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's GS.N outsized reliance on trading and investment banking became a big advantage in the second quarter, driving up revenue while avoiding losses due to the coronavirus, but the pop may prove to be fleeting.  The bank's revenue rose 41%, with trading revenue doubling, in line with rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup Inc C.N that reported results earlier in the week.  Unlike those rivals, Goldman\u2019s fledgling presence in consumer banking meant it had to set aside much less for expected credit losses.  The bank had to account for other problems, though, including adding to its regulatory capital and setting aside $945 million for potential legal and regulatory costs. Its quarterly profit rose 2% year-over-year and beat Wall Street\u2019s expectations.  Analysts characterized the period as felicitous for the Wall Street firm, and investors celebrated its ability to trade through the crisis. Goldman shares were off earlier highs, up 1% at $216.26.  \u201cThe quarter couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for Goldman Sachs,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note.  It remains to be seen whether Goldman can repeat the performance in subsequent quarters. Other banks have said they expect trading revenue to fall in the coming months.

The global pandemic that has so far killed 578,718 people and slammed the global economy, isn't helping.

Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said the bank has also modified its consumer lending strategy due, in part, to the coronavirus recession. But he struck an upbeat note.  \u201cOur core businesses are performing well, and many of our new initiatives are advancing ahead of plan,\u201d Scherr said on a conference call. \u201cWe remain confident in our financial position, capital base and liquidity.\u201d  DRAG ON PROFITS  Goldman earned $2.2 billion, or $6.26 per share, during the second quarter. Analysts had expected the bank to earn just $3.78 per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.  Excluding special items, Goldman might have earned $11.79 per share, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said.  Within the special items was a $945-million provision for potential legal and regulatory costs. Goldman has been in talks to settle investigations involving its role in a corruption scandal at Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB.  Goldman also set aside $1.6 billion for loans that could potentially go bad, most of which was not related to its consumer business.  Last month, the bank fared poorly on the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test, forcing it to boost capital levels and stop repurchasing shares. Scherr and Solomon said they were quickly shifting money toward Goldman\u2019s balance sheet to satisfy the Fed.  Return-on-equity (ROE), a key measurement of how well banks wring profits from shareholder dollars, was 11.1% in the second quarter. It would have been over 15% if not for the money Goldman had to put toward capital goals and legal reserves, the bank said.  Goldman is aiming to deliver ROE of 13% within the next few years.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The trading division was also overdependent on a certain type of customer that became less active, Blankfein said. Goldman has traditionally relied on hedge funds and other active managers that have been struggling.  \u201cI would say, we, last year, braced for a return of volatility and it didn\u2019t come out,\u201d Blankfein said at an industry conference in Miami Beach. This and the lack of activity from customers caught Goldman in a \u201cdouble whammy,\u201d he said, and the bank is making adjustments.  The outlook for trading has improved due to factors including a recent rally in oil prices LCOc1 and a break out in 10-year bonds, he said. He acknowledged that the trading business has experienced \"secular\" problems, a change from what senior Goldman executives typically characterize as a \"cyclical\" downturn.  Blankfein gave an update on the Wall Street bank\u2019s ambitious $5 billion revenue plan that was met with skepticism when it was unveiled in September. Investors were keen to hear updates on Goldman\u2019s ailing bond trading unit.  As part of its growth plans, the bank has set up a joint venture between its market-making and investment banking teams to provide better financing and hedging services. He said this has resulted in 16 new commodity-related transactions already.  Goldman is also seeking to work more with large asset managers, banks and corporate clients to broaden its coverage. It was the first time Blankfein himself gave investors a formal, public presentation about Goldman\u2019s goals. Since his deputies first laid out the revenue-growth strategy in September, analysts have questioned the underlying assumptions and cited investor concerns. In October, Instinet analyst Steven Chubak told Goldman\u2019s finance chief that clients wanted to know why the bank thinks it can boost investment management revenue by $1 billion, given the challenges money managers face. In a recent report, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said shareholders remained \u201cskeptical\u201d about consumer lending and other components of Goldman\u2019s revenue growth plan, despite assurances from senior executives.  The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that Goldman will not achieve much of its $5 billion goal, which does not factor in improving market conditions, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said in an interview. The return of volatility should nonetheless help Goldman generate more income from trading, he said. \u201cThis is the environment that Goldman has been waiting for all decade,\u201d said Mayo, who expects the bank to achieve $3 billion of its $5 billion target.  \u201cIf Goldman doesn\u2019t get it right in 2018, then management has some serious questions to ask.\u201d Trading had been a profit engine for Goldman Sachs for the decade leading into the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Those profits dried up due to lethargic markets, new regulations and tougher competition.  To offset those changes, Goldman is looking to grow other businesses, including investment management, investment banking and consumer lending.  Goldman aims to cover 1,000 more clients in investment banking by 2020, according to Blankfein\u2019s presentation. The bank plans to expand its consumer business beyond its recent loan-and-deposit push into other areas like wealth management and retirement products over the long term, he said.

Its CEO, Thomas von Koch, wants to strengthen its balance sheet to support its global growth ambitions.

While other private equity funds have exited investments through IPOs, EQT has opted against an IPO of its portfolio firm IFS and will instead seek to refinance the enterprise software maker in early 2019 after bolstering its equity this year, a second source said.  That source added that Goldman Sachs had been selected to raise 100 million euros by selling a 10-15 percent stake in IFS to one or two limited partners, a strategy EQT has applied before.

Oil prices have declined sharply the past week as the Sino-U.S. trade war intensifies and were hovering below $72 per barrel on Tuesday, not far from their lowest since mid-April. [O\/R]  \u201cProduction disruptions and large supply shifts driven by U.S. political decisions are the drivers of this new fundamental volatility, with demand remaining robust so far,\u201d the bank said in a note dated Monday.  The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November as it reimposes sanctions over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that in certain cases, there could be waivers for countries that need more time to wind down imports of oil from Iran.  \u201cThe uncertainty on the magnitude and timing of the supply shifts has muddied the near-term outlook for oil fundamentals,\u201d Goldman said, adding that it continued to expect high supply volatility with potential for further disruptions.  \u201cThese supply shifts, alongside the ongoing surge in Saudi production, create the risk that the oil market moves into surplus in third-quarter 2018,\u201d the bank said.  However, prices are expected to get some support longer term as global oil inventories are weak, according to the bank.  \u201cUltimately, global inventories are low, oil demand remains robust and we still expect a deficit once U.S secondary sanctions are reintroduced.\u201d  Goldman said it still expects Brent to retest $80 per barrel, although this may occur only late this year depending on U.S. oil policies, rather than this summer as it previously expected.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The approvals come as policymakers and authorities step up efforts to shield the world\u2019s second-largest economy, battered by the coronavirus pandemic.  Goldman and Morgan Stanley received the nods from the China Securities Regulatory Commission to raise their stakes in Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities and Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities from 33% to 51% and 49% to 51%, respectively, the two Wall Street banks said in separate statements.  Majority ownership of the joint ventures potentially allows the U.S. banks to expand operations in China, and better integrate them with their global businesses.  Goldman in 2004 set up its China securities JV with Beijing Gao Hua Securities, which was co-founded by veteran Chinese banker Fang Fenglei.  Unlike most of the other China JVs, Goldman already has day-to-day operational control of its JV, which offers investment banking services such as equities and bond underwriting and deal advice.  Despite that managerial control, Goldman has long made it clear it would eventually seek to take a majority stake too.  Shanghai-based Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities was established in 2011 and its existing operations include underwriting and sponsoring equity and debt offerings as well as proprietary trading of bonds, it says on its website.  China raised the cap on foreign ownership of securities operations to 51% in 2018. Until then international banks had been allowed only minority stakes in their Chinese joint ventures.  Swiss lender UBS UBSG.S became the first foreign bank to hold a majority stake in a China securities business under the new rules in 2018. Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings 8604.T and JPMorgan JPM.N got their approvals last year.  Credit Suisse CSGN.S is still awaiting approval after it submitted an application for majority-controlled securities JV.  Beijing promised to scrap foreign ownership caps on securities firms and mutual funds for foreign investors from April 1, in an interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January.  The approvals for Goldman and Morgan Stanley come a day before China temporarily bars entry for most foreigners as an interim measure in response to the coronavirus epidemic.  Market participants said the thumbs up was a sign the country is continuing with the formal opening up of financial markets, despite the virus.

The companies had appealed to the General Court, Europe\u2019s second-highest court, asking for the European Commission\u2019s 2014 decision to be thrown out and their fines reduced.  The EU antitrust enforcer said the group ran a power cable cartel for almost 10 years from 1999, sharing markets and allocating customers between themselves. ABB escaped a 33 million euro sanction by alerting the authorities.  The court rejected their appeals.  \u201cThe General Court confirms the fines of over 300 million euros that the Commission imposed on the main European and Asian producers of (extra) high voltage power cables for their participation in a worldwide cartel,\u201d judges said.  Prysmian was hit with the biggest fine at 104.6 million euros, which included a joint fine of 37.3 million euros with Goldman Sachs. The bank acquired the Italian company via one of its private equity funds in 2005 but has since sold its holding.  Other cartel members were Japanese cable firms Exsym Corporation, J-Power Systems Corporation and Viscas Corporation, Korean peer LS Cable & System and General Cable Corp via its subsidiary Silec.  Fines were also given to Danish company NKT Holding , South Korean firm Taihan Electric Wire, Mitsubishi Cable Industries, Sumitomo Electric Industries and Hitachi Metals Ltd. Sumitomo and Hitachi were J-Power Systems\u2019 previous owners.

Opposition leaders in Venezuela, which is suffering from malnutrition and hyperinflation, at the time accused Goldman of giving President Nicolas Maduro a financial lifeline through the $2.8 billion deal.

On Friday AB InBev called off the Hong Kong listing of its Asia Pacific brewing business, that was being managed by Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan, citing several factors, including prevailing market conditions. A further 11 banks were listed as global coordinators and bookrunners but Goldman had no role on the deal.  In the internal email sent as the deal was faltering on Friday, the Goldman banker told colleagues they needed to call clients \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to reassure them that a collapsed deal did not mean markets were closed.  \u201cMS is the only bank to have played a lead role on the two largest postponed HK IPOs in past decade,\u201d said the email, sent to investment bankers in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan. \u201cGS has successfully led 26 jumbo Hong Kong IPOs above US$1bn as Sponsor since 2010, more than any other bank on the Street (MS 19, JPM 15),\u201d the email said.

That IPO was pulled as investors balked at the valuation the company sought, although Goldman itself was a sponsor on that deal along with Morgan Stanley and five other banks.  Three months later WH Group successfully raised $2.1 billion in an IPO led solely by Morgan Stanley and Bank of China International.  Goldman did not get a role in the relaunched deal even though the bank was an investor in the pork producer, holding 5.2% of the shares through its private equity unit.

Although it snubbed a Saudi investment conference last year following the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Goldman Sachs has since won a slew of mandates in the kingdom, including a lead role in Saudi Aramco\u2019s debut international bond.  TIBC raised money in international markets, transferring the funds to now defaulted Saudi conglomerate Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Brothers (AHAB), in what a Cayman Islands court last year called one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history.  After TIBC defaulted on a foreign exchange deal with Deutsche Bank in 2009, AHAB \u2013 which denies knowledge of the scheme \u2013 collapsed, along with another Saudi conglomerate Saad, leaving an estimated $22 billion in unpaid debts.  TIBC, administered by Bahrain\u2019s Central Bank, has a claim of around $3 billion against AHAB, a TIBC spokesman said, while more than 60 banks that have lent money to TIBC remain unpaid.  The sources said Goldman bought TIBC\u2019s debt after rulings in various jurisdictions appeared to strengthen the position of the Bahraini bank against AHAB.  However, if AHAB\u2019s application for a financial restructuring under the kingdom\u2019s bankruptcy law is successful next week, Goldman\u2019s claim may turn out to be worth less than it anticipated.

TIBC obtained an enforcement order of around $1.6 billion against AHAB from JDEK last year.  The TIBC spokesman acknowledged the suspension but said he believed the enforcement order was still valid.  Meanwhile, Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank and HSBC \u2013 two of AHAB\u2019s creditors \u2013 last month launched an application for the liquidation of AHAB under the kingdom\u2019s bankruptcy law, said the sources.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016. REUTERS\/David Gray\/File Photo\/File Photo  The bank was investigated for its role in raising $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) state fund.  WHAT IS 1MDB?  1MDB is a state fund launched in 2009 by former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak to promote economic development.  HOW DID BILLIONS GO MISSING?  1MDB raised billions of dollars in bonds, ostensibly for investment projects and joint ventures between 2009 and 2013.  Malaysian and U.S. authorities say $4.5 billion, including some of the money Goldman helped raise, was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials of the fund, Najib and others.  The siphoned funds were used to buy luxury assets and real estate, including hotels, a private jet, art by Picasso and Monet, and to finance Hollywood films, U.S. lawsuits said.  The U.S. Department of Justice has sought to recover about $2.1 billion in assets linked to diverted 1MDB funds - the largest ever asset recovery action brought by the agency.  HOW IS GOLDMAN SACHS INVOLVED?  Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries for its role in underwriting the 1MDB bond issues.  The work earned the bank $600 million in fees and led to large bonuses for some of its executives, officials have said, although the bank has disputed that figure.  The Justice Department said on Thursday that Goldman violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials for help in getting or keeping business. Malaysian prosecutors also said bank misled investors over the bond sales.  Goldman has in the past said that certain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB officials lied to it about how proceeds from the bond sales would be used.  On Thursday, Goldman\u2019s Malaysian unit pleaded guilty to violating U.S. foreign bribery rules.  HOW MUCH WILL GOLDMAN PAY?  Goldman will pay a $2.3 billion fine to the Justice Department and other regulators, and a further $600 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains to settle the U.S. probe and avoid a criminal conviction at the group level.  This is in addition to the $3.9 billion that Goldman has agreed to pay Malaysia in exchange for dropping all criminal charges against the bank.  On Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s markets watchdog also fined Goldman\u2019s Asia unit $350 million for serious lapses and deficiencies in its management controls that contributed to the misappropriation of $2.6 billion in funds it helped raise for 1MDB.  ARE THERE ANY OTHER CASES AGAINST GOLDMAN?  The Justice Department has filed criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers tied to the scandal, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng.  Leissner plead guilty to the charges last year, while Ng\u2019s case is pending in a New York court. Ng is expected to face separate charges in Malaysia after his U.S. trial concludes.  This week, Abu Dhabi\u2019s International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC) dropped a lawsuit against Goldman to recover losses suffered from the bank\u2019s dealings with 1MDB.  The lawsuit alleged that Goldman conspired with unidentified people from Malaysia to bribe two former IPIC executives to further their business at its expense.  HOW MUCH MORE IS BEING SOUGHT?  The Justice Department has recovered or assisted Malaysia in recovering nearly $1.1 billion in 1MDB-linked assets.  Malaysian authorities say at least $4.3 billion more are still unaccounted for.  WHO ELSE HAS BEEN IMPLICATED?  After losing an election in 2018, Najib has been charged with 42 criminal offences in Malaysia, mostly linked to losses at 1MDB and other state entities.  In July, he was found guilty of corruption and money laundering for illegally receiving $10 million from a former 1MDB unit and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Najib denies wrongdoing and has filed an appeal.  Elliott Broidy, a former fund-raiser for U.S. President Donald Trump, pleaded guilty this week to a charge that he illegally lobbied Trump to drop an investigation into 1MDB.  Malaysian and U.S. authorities have also filed charges against Malaysian financier Jho Low for his alleged central role in the 1MDB fraud.

You look at the equity trading business, for example, when you go back 20-30 years we would at Goldman Sachs have 500 people making markets in stocks and prices in stocks every single day. Today we have three - all going off technology platforms. But those businesses continue to change. The secret is how do you navigate the art of going from a business that is analog onto technology platform that has businesses that have never had technology platforms for a long time. How to adapt changes in your clients and customers and interfaces they require. It requires a lot of investment and it requires balance.\u201d MICHAEL CORBAT, CEO of CITIGROUP INC, ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: \u201cI would use a highly technical term when I describe the world today. The world\u2019s OK. We see governing central bank bodies that are likely to remain consistent around the stance that they have taken. So we shouldn\u2019t see any significant curbs down the road.\u201d He said the two indicators that the economy is strong and positive: Housing and job markets.  MARY CALLAHAN ERDOES, CEO OF J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, ON VOLATILITY: She said a return of volatility was not going to be a huge risk to financial markets and could make active management more important. \u201cVolatility won\u2019t unravel things,\u201d Erdoes said. She was concerned that volatility might scare away some investors who were burned during the last financial crisis and will remain risk averse. \u201cIt will really affect the people who are still psychologically damaged from 2008,\u201d she added. U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN MNUCHIN, ON U.S. TAX PLAN: \u201cThe tax plan was a major component to creating economic growth, getting competitive tax rates for both corporations and small businesses. We have the lowest small business rates since the 1930s and changing from a worldwide system to a territorial system. So we are seeing a lot of money now being invested in the U.S. and we are seeing the impact of that on the economy.\u201d  MNUCHIN ON STOCK BUYBACKS: \u201cStock buybacks are a mechanism companies can use to return capital to shareholders. There are lots of companies that are raising capital. We\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in corporate America.\u201d (Reporting by Anna Irrera, Lawrence Delevingne and Liana Baker; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)","838":"The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Oil prices are at risk for further gains due to the United States\u2019 decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, coupled with rising tensions in other oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, Goldman Sachs said in a note Wednesday.  The investment bank\u2019s current forecast is for Brent crude to hit $82.50 a barrel by the summer; it is currently trading around $77 a barrel. The harsher approach by the United States could result in an initial loss of about 500,000 barrels a day (bpd) in Iran\u2019s output, which is currently 3.8 million bpd.  Such a loss would boost oil prices by about $6.20 per barrel, Goldman said. \u201cSuch elevated oil geopolitical risks exacerbate the upside risks to Brent forecasts and reinforce our view that oil price volatility will continue to increase,\u201d they wrote.","839":"June 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc commodities unit generated more than $1 billion in revenue this year through May as traders positioned their bets for the collapse in oil prices, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.  Most of the boost came from oil trading overseen by Singapore-based partner Qin Xiao and Anthony Dewell in London, amid the collapse in oil prices, Bloomberg reported here, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  Oil prices plunged to their lowest in years in a dramatic sell-off at the start of March, with U.S. crude futures at one point priced deep in negative territory as panicked traders bailed out of positions upon realizing that many would be forced to take physical delivery of oil without a place to put the barrels.  Numerous funds and brokerages suffered heavy losses in the selloff, sparked by the slump in car and air travel due to the coronavirus as well as an argument between Saudi Arabia and Russia over production volumes.  \u201cWe are market makers and a client franchise business, and now as always we do all we can to help our clients manage their risk,\u201d Goldman spokesman Patrick Lenihan told Reuters.

On an annual basis, they raised their forecasts for 2021 and 2022 growth by 0.2 percentage points each, to 6.8% and 4.5%, respectively.  The bank\u2019s economists also said that they had brought forward their forecast for the first rate hike by the Federal Reserve from the second half of 2024 to the first half in light of the upgrade to the growth forecast, the larger-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate in January, and signs of a \u201cfirmer\u201d inflation outlook.  \u201cWe expect the FOMC to start tapering its asset purchases in early 2022,\u201d the note said.","841":"FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017.

A Wells Fargo spokesperson told Reuters that there was \u201cno validity\u201d to rumors the bank was in talks with potential candidates for the CEO position.  Since Tim Sloan took over as the scandal-plagued bank\u2019s CEO in 2016, politicians and analysts have repeatedly questioned whether he was the right person to turn Wells Fargo around.  The bank\u2019s board has consistently defended Sloan, saying his deep knowledge of Wells Fargo was an asset. In September the bank\u2019s chair, Betsy Duke, shot down a similar NY Post report that the board was seeking to replace Sloan with former Goldman Sachs executive and Trump adviser Gary Cohn.  Wells Fargo on Thursday reiterated Duke\u2019s statement from last year.  \u201cRumors that Wells Fargo\u2019s Board of Directors reached out to potential CEO candidates are completely false,\u201d Duke said. \u201cCEO Tim Sloan has the unanimous support of the board, and this support has never wavered.\u201d  Shares of Wells Fargo pared some losses to trade down 1.5 percent at $49.62.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - As Wall Street firms fall over themselves to improve their diversity credentials, Goldman Sachs\u2019s biennial selection of new partners has more than the usual significance. On balance, the class of 2020 is a solid B-plus \u2013 a little more inclusive than the bank\u2019s overall executive ranks, but still representative of an industry that\u2019s mostly white and male. But Goldman\u2019s picks may say something more decisive about its overall financial trajectory.  Only 60 staff made the partnership this year, winning access to a special bonus pool, as well as other perks and ambassadorial duties. That\u2019s down from 69 last time and the smallest number in at least two decades. In terms of diversity, Chief Executive David Solomon has at least moved in the right direction. Just 27% of the elect are women, for example, and 7% identify as Black. That\u2019s less than the general population, but in Goldman\u2019s top tier of employees more broadly, 23% are women and just under 3% Black or African American, according to its most recent sustainability report.  Perhaps as significant is the diversification of what Goldman and its partners actually do. Solomon has talked about deriving more of Goldman\u2019s income from less volatile activities like advising companies, or making interest on loans rather than the choppy business of trading securities. That slipped out of reach this year, as Covid-19 led to dramatic swings in markets and windfalls for trading desks. Those flightier activities made up 47% of Goldman\u2019s revenue in the past four quarters, compared with 41% a year earlier.  On that score, the partnership looks like a better guide to what Solomon has in mind. Around 35% of the new partner class comes from the firm\u2019s global markets division, which includes trading. Two years ago, 41% were in securities. That suggests the trading desk is becoming less of a stairway to heaven. Meanwhile, for all the sound and fury around Solomon\u2019s consumer banking initiative, it generated no new partners \u2013 suggesting that division, and its employees, have a little more work to do.","843":"(Reuters) - Shares of Goldman Sachs-backed ON24 Inc jumped nearly 54% in their market debut on Wednesday, giving the webinar-marketing platform a market value of over $3.42 billion.  Shares opened at $77, well above their initial public offering (IPO) price of $50 per share. The company sold nearly 8.6 million shares in its IPO, raising more than $428 million.  ON24\u2019s stellar debut comes as a string of companies rush to capitalize on the red-hot U.S. IPO market that shattered records over the past year.  Founded in 1998 by Chief Executive Officer Sharat Sharan, San Francisco-based ON24 allows people to create webinars and host virtual events on its platform and received $25 million in funding from Goldman Sachs in early 2019.  Video-conferencing platforms have become a vital part of day-to-day life due to the COVID-19 pandemic as people stuck at home under restrictions use them for work, school or socializing.  \u201cWe were doing really well and then the market came to us. Companies have gone through ten years worth of transformations in ten months,\u201d Sharan told Reuters.  Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P.

Goldman said it is cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators examining 1MDB matters in its quarterly financial filing.  On Thursday, U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against two former Goldman bankers and a Malaysian financier over the alleged theft of billions of dollars from the fund.  The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, in 2009. An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.  Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing in connection with alleged graft involving 1MDB."}}
