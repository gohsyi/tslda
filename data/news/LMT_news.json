Reviews of this sort are typical for a new administration, but Donald Trump\u2019s administration was doing deals down to the wire, including one for 50 stealthy F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin as a side deal to the Abraham accords inked only moments before Biden was sworn into office.

The deal includes four MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones made by privately-held General Atomics, and Hellfire, Paveway and JDAM precision-guided munitions made by Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Boeing, the sources said.  Reuters was first to report on Thursday that Washington was negotiating the sale and would notify Congress shortly.

FILE PHOTO: The Missile Defense Agency conducts the first intercept flight test of a land-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense weapon system from the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex in Kauai, Hawaii, December 10, 2015. REUTERS\/U.S. Missile Defense Agency\/Leah Garton\/Handout via Reuters\/File Photo  \u201cIt\u2019s game on,\u201d said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of Raytheon\u2019s lobbying campaign. Raytheon\u2019s pitch includes a proposal to put its SPY-6 radar on refitted destroyers, as the U.S. Navy plans to do. The company says that would save money and time as Japan tackles new missile threats, drones and stealth aircraft.  Lockheed Martin has a contract with Japan to build its $300 million SPY-7 radars at the two cancelled Aegis Ashore sites, but says other sites or ships are possible.  But critics say dedicating ships to missile defence pulls them away from other duties, and new destroyers can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. And Japan could face financial penalties if it pulled out of its contract with Lockheed Martin.  \u201cWe are looking at the various options available to us,\u201d a defence ministry spokesman said.  A key battle for the two companies will be winning the support of former defence ministers and deputy ministers who as early as next week will make recommendations to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  That group, led by former defence minister Itsunori Onodera, formed in June after current defence chief Taro Kono suspended the Aegis Ashore plan. It has weighed in on missile defence and discussed proposals that Japan acquire strike weapons for that mission, Japanese officials have said.  The group of lawmakers will release their recommendations on Friday after they present them for approval to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party\u2019s defence policy committee, Onodera told reporters after the group met on Thursday.  Japan under Abe has beefed up its military with stealth fighters designed to fly off carriers, longer-range missiles, new amphibious units and stronger air defences meant to deter threats from neighbours, including North Korea and China.  Kono said he ordered the Aegis sites relocated because rocket boosters that accelerate interceptor missiles into space could fall on residents. But concern over mounting costs was the main reason for that decision, according to the three sources.  China is rapidly expanding and improving its ballistic missile arsenal, and in 2017 North Korea tested a missile that flew over the Japanese island of Hokkaido.  With around three times the range of radars currently used by Japan, both SPY-6 and SPY-7 would greatly enhance Japan\u2019s ability to detect multiple attacks.  One option for Japan that would avoid any political fallout would be to buy both radars, using SPY-6 on Aegis ships and deploying Lockheed\u2019s SPY-7 as an early warning radar, one of the sources said.  CHOICE  Onodera\u2019s backing would make that change more likely because he approved the Lockheed Aegis radar acquisition two years ago. At the time he was unaware that testing in Hawaii could add at least $500 million to Aegis Ashore\u2019s $4 billion budget, separate sources told Reuters last year.  In an interview in the Asahi newspaper on Thursday, Onodera said the \u201cideal option\u201d for Japan would be to find a safe ground-based location. He also noted that building Aegis ships would cost both money and manpower.  Onodera\u2019s office declined an interview request, but one source familiar with his position on the radars described him as \u201cflexible.\u201d  Masahisa Sato, a former deputy defence minister who also served as a deputy minister of foreign affairs, said Japan\u2019s choice is between SPY-7 at new sites, with the missile launchers deployed elsewhere, or building Aegis ships equipped with SPY-6.  \u201cI am recommending an increase in Aegis ships,\u201d he said. \u201cSPY-7 is under development and there is a question about how it would perform in a new configuration,\u201d Sato added.  Lockheed Martin said its system could be adapted to ships, and disputed questions about performance.  \u201cSPY-7 radar is the most advanced radar in the world today and we believe it is the best solution for Japan\u2019s defence needs,\u201d the company said in an e-mail.  For its part, Raytheon said the SPY-6 will be deployed on 50 U.S. Navy ships, calling it the \u201cmost advanced radar technology in production today.\u201d","14":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Lockheed Martin is seen at Euronaval, the world naval defence exhibition in Le Bourget near Paris, France, October 23, 2018.

The provincial governor\u2019s office announced on Sunday that the Turkish Air Force F-16s and other aircraft will conduct low- and high-altitude flights over Ankara on Monday and Tuesday to test an air defense system project.  Broadcaster CNN Turk and other media said specifically that the flights were to test the S-400 radar system. Ankara began receiving the S-400s last July but they are not yet operational.  Dealers said the reports had a negative impact on the lira, which weakened to 5.7380 against the dollar from a close of 5.7140 on Friday. Tensions in U.S.-Turkish relations played a major role in a near 30% slide in the lira\u2019s value last year.  As recently as last Thursday, a senior State Department official told reporters Turkey needed to \u201cget rid of\u201d the system. Those comments came after President Tayyip Erdogan met U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House.  Trump said their talks were \u201cwonderful\u201d but it was unclear if the two NATO allies made any breakthrough on the S-400 issue and Erdogan subsequently said U.S. pressure to get rid of the S-400s was an infringement of sovereign rights.  Washington has suspended Turkey from the F-35 program, which it was a buyer and producer of, to punish it for the S-400 purchase. It has warned of possible U.S. sanctions over the deal but has not yet imposed them.  Trump has told Erdogan the United States is ready to sell Ankara U.S. Patriot systems if it drops the Russian system.","16":"(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N raised its estimate for 2019 earnings on Tuesday as quarterly profit climbed 9.2% amid improved sales of its F-35 fighter jets, but it forecast a lower cash flow for next year and shares dipped in afternoon trading.  FILE PHOTO: Lockheed Martin's logo is seen in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  The company also said the \"preliminary outlook for 2020 assumes there is no impact from U.S. Government actions related to Turkey.\" The U.S. and Turkey are embroiled in a dispute here over a Russian missile defense system and its impact on Turkish defense purchases.  Lockheed estimated 2020 cash flow of $7.2 billion, lower than its 2019 year-end estimate of $7.6 billion, which disappointed investors. Shares were down 0.3% at $372.98 after earlier gaining modestly; the stock had fallen about 3% in premarket trading after results were released.  Lockheed raised its profit estimate for 2019 by 1.9% to $21.55 per share from $21.15, the high point of a previous guidance, amid improved performance in its aeronautics business.  The Bethesda, Maryland-based company said 2020 sales would climb 5% to $62 billion from an estimated $59.1 billion at the end of 2019.  The results were \u201cimpressive\u201d and driven by better operations, while the guidance was \u201cconservative, as expected,\u201d Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a note to investors.  Business unit profit margins in 2020 were estimated to be between a range of 10.5% and 10.8%, lower than the 11.2% margin so far this year.  Turkey had agreed to buy 100 stealthy F-35 jets, Lockheed's biggest program, but the Pentagon removed the NATO ally from the program here and from the jet's supply chain.  The U.S government has insulated the company from the dispute so \u201cwe can bill and collect for\u201d the jets already made or being produced, Lockheed\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Possenriede told investors on an earnings conference call.  He said that outside of the F-35, Turkey only accounted for about $900 million of Lockheed\u2019s $137-billion backlog.  To be sure, other countries have expressed an interest in buying the F-35, and in September, the U.S. State Department approved a proposed sale of 32 F-35 fighter jets worth as much as $6.5 billion to Poland.  The company hoped it could also sell more F-35Bs, the short takeoff and landing version of the jet, to Singapore and Japan which are customers for the F-35A, Possenriede said.  And, despite Germany saying it will either pick the Eurofighter or Boeing's BA.N F\/A-18 fighter jet to replace its Tornado warplanes, Possenriede said Lockheed did not believe it was out of the competition to sell fighter jets in Germany.  The Pentagon has said the U.S. is spending between $500 million and $600 million in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain away from Turkey.  There were some operating segment wins for Lockheed during the quarter.  Lockheed\u2019s space unit was awarded a NASA contract worth up to $4.6 billion to build Orion astronaut capsules to help NASA build a sustainable presence on the moon. Though sales at the unit were up 5%, the 11.5% profit margin at the space unit was unchanged from last year.  The missiles and fire control unit, which makes missile defenses like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), was one of its best-performing units. Sales grew 14% to $2.6 billion during the quarter.  The aeronautics division which makes the F-35 received some bad news last week when the Pentagon said it could delay its decision to move into a full-rate production of the F-35 jet by as many as 13 months, or until 2021, because of issues integrating the jet with its testing facilities.  Full-rate production contracts are more lucrative for defense, and the news from the Pentagon suggests larger payments for F-35 deliveries to Lockheed from the U.S. government and its allies could be delayed by as much as a year.  The company delivered 28 F-35 combat jets in the quarter, compared with 20 a year earlier.  During the second quarter, Lockheed delivered 29 F-35s. So far this year, the company has delivered 83 of the jets, out of a total expected for the year of 131.  Lockheed\u2019s net income rose to $1.61 billion, or $5.66 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 29, from $1.47 billion, or $5.14 per share, a year earlier.  Net sales rose to $15.17 billion from $14.32 billion.  Lockheed\u2019s income tax rate was 9.7% in the third quarter, compared to 6.5% in the third quarter of 2018.","17":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp is eyeing a Japanese jet fighter project that could pit it against Lockheed Martin Corp, three sources said, almost three decades after it lost a similar competition to build an advanced stealth jet for the U.S. Air Force.  FILE PHOTO: A UAV helicopter build by Northrop Gruman is on deck aboard the soon to be commissioned littoral combat ship USS Coronado during a media tour in Coronado, California April 3, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  \u201cNorthrop is interested,\u201d said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of the plans. Northrop has already responded to Japanese requests for information (RFI) and has held preliminary talks with Japanese defense industry officials, he said.  Northrop Grumman has provided Japan with a menu of technologies it could contribute to the next-generation F-3 fighter project, but not yet made any specific proposals to Japan, the sources said.  The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.  The company\u2019s bid would compete with Lockheed Martin proposals that include a hybrid stealth design based on its F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor. The F-22 beat Northrop\u2019s YF-23 Black Widow demonstrator to win the lucrative U.S. Advanced Tactical Fighter contract in 1991.  The F-22 is banned for export and is only used by the U.S. Air Force. But Japan has ordered 42 F-35s to upgrade aging fighters whose designs date back to the 1970s. It plans to increase that order, including purchases of the vertical take off and landing (VTOL) versions suitable for aircraft carrier operations.  Northrop Grumman was unable to immediately comment.  Both it and Lockheed Martin would need U.S. government approval to offer sensitive aircraft technology to Japan.  FOREIGN PARTNERS  Tokyo has also sought offers from Boeing Co, which makes the F\/A-18E\/F Super Hornet, and has sounded out European defense companies about possible cooperation, including BAE Systems PLC, which is a leading member of the consortium that built Europe\u2019s Typhoon high-altitude interceptor.  The British company has also provided Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defence with a list of technology it could contribute, a fourth defense industry source said.  Bringing in foreign partners would allow Japan to spread development costs, estimated to be around $40 billion, and give it access to technology it would otherwise have to develop from scratch.  Tokyo, however, wants to ensure Japanese companies provide the F-3\u2019s avionics and flight hardware, which include communication and navigation systems, radar, and engines that are being developed by IHI Corp.  The Japanese government has so far issued three RFIs for the F-3 and sent letters to the British and United States governments outlining its requirements in more detail, sources have told Reuters.  Any foreign company picked for the F-3 project will work with Japanese defense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.  The maker of the A6M Zero, which battled Grumman Hellcats and Wildcats over the Pacific in World War Two, last developed a jet fighter two decades ago. That plane, the F-2, was a joint effort with Lockheed Martin.  Mitsubishi Heavy also assembles Japan\u2019s F-35s, a program to which Northrop Grumman contributes components such as wing skins. The U.S. company\u2019s other military aircraft include the E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft and the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), both of which Japan has purchased.  Northrop Grumman built the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and is developing the new B-21 stealth bomber for the U.S. Air Force. Its last fighter aircraft was the F-14 Tomcat, retired in 2006 from the U.S. Navy but still in service with the Iranian air force.  For now, it is unclear when Japan will begin F-3 development, as Japanese officials juggle spending priorities and military planners mull designs. Defence officials would like to introduce the aircraft in the mid-2030s to deter Chinese and Russian airspace intrusions.  With many of the engineers who designed the F-2 reaching retirement age, Japan, according to a fifth source familiar with Japanese defense industry capabilities, will need to get the project under way within the next two years to ensure it still has the skills to build a fleet of advanced stealth jets.","18":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N has been awarded a $1.36 billion Defense Department contract for GPS IIIF Space Vehicles 11 and 12, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.

The Pentagon pulled Jeff Boleng from the acting Chief Technology Officer post at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Software Engineering Institute so that he could help the Pentagon focus on overall policy and software acquisition in the newly created position of special assistant for software acquisition at the Pentagon.  Lord said that while Boleng will focus on the F-35 program, the Department of Defense was attempting to change how it acquires and employs software.  While the sensor-laden F-35 jet program has software needs addressed, the program has other issues.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported that the Pentagon had stopped accepting deliveries of the jet from Lockheed because of a dispute with the contractor over who will cover costs for fixing a production error.  The Pentagon confirmed the pause in acceptances the next day. Lord said the pause remained in effect as of Friday.

Reviews of this sort are typical for a new administration, but Donald Trump\u2019s administration was doing deals down to the wire, including one for 50 stealthy F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin as a side deal to the Abraham accords inked only moments before Biden was sworn into office.  The Department is temporarily pausing the implementation of some pending U.S. defense transfers and sales under Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales to allow incoming leadership an opportunity to review, the official said.  The F-35 jets are a major component of a $23 billion sale of high-tech armaments from General Atomics, Lockheed and Raytheon Technologies Corp to the United Arab Emirates.

The Belgian contract for 34 new F-35 fighter jets, with first deliveries in 2023, is worth just under 3 billion euros ($3.42 billion).  The Eurofighter Typhoon is a joint project between Britain's BAE Systems BAES.L, Airbus AIR.PA and Italy's Leonardo LDOF.MI.  BULGARIA  Bulgaria wants to buy 8 new or used fighter jets to replace its aging Soviet-designed MiG-29s in a tender valued at 1.8 billion levs ($1.06 billion) to help the country meet its obligations as a member of NATO, which it joined in 2004.  The United States, Sweden and Italy have submitted bids, with the United States offering two options: either new Lockheed F-16V jets or new Boeing BA.N F\/A-18E\/F Super Hornets. Sweden offered new Saab SAABb.ST Gripen jets, while Italy proposed supplying second-hand Eurofighters.  FINLAND  Finland is seeking bids to replace its aging fleet of 62 F\/A-18 Hornet jets, which are due to be phased out from 2025, in a deal expected to cost up to 10 billion euros ($11.47 billion).  Possible candidates include Saab's Gripen, the Rafale built by France's Dassault Aviation AVMD.PA, Boeing's Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin's F-35 and the Eurofighter.  Bids are due by early 2019, and Finland plans to make a final decision in 2021.  GERMANY  Germany wants to buy up to 90 new multi-role fighter jets to replace its aging fleet of 85 operational Tornado fighters.  Possible candidates include the Lockheed F-35, the Boeing F\/A-18E\/F and Boeing\u2019s F-15E fighter, as well as the Eurofighter, with deliveries to start in 2025 or sooner.  Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen has said she favors the Eurofighter, but Lockheed and Boeing still hope for a chance to bid for the work.  Germany is studying a number of options, including buying one type of jet to replace the Tornado jets, a split buy of two aircraft types, or a service life extension of the Tornado jets, according to sources familiar with the process.  POLAND  Poland has a fleet of 48 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets but is expected to move toward replacing its 30 Soviet-era MiG 29s in coming years. No details have been released.  SLOVAKIA  Slovakia said in July it had agreed to spend $1.9 billion to buy 14 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to replace its aging Russian-made MiG-29s, opting for the U.S. warplanes instead of Swedish Gripen jets produced by Saab.  SWITZERLAND  Switzerland has chosen a novel approach to replace its aging fleet of F-5 fighter jets and older model F\/A-18 fighters, and buy new ground-based air defenses in a combined competition worth up to 8 billion Swiss francs.

Still, the defense contractor reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit even as it was forced to trim its sales outlook. Quarterly sales in its aeronautics unit rose 14%to $6.4 billion.  The U.S. defense sector is expected to see much less COVID-19 disruption due to generally stable cash flows compared with industrial markets, according to analysts. Early on in the pandemic the defense industry was deemed essential, giving those workers an avenue to continue production.  Lockheed\u2019s earnings announcement disclosed that while earnings for the first quarter had not been impacted, \u201cthe corporation is beginning to experience some issues in each of its business areas related to COVID-19\u201d such as supplier delivery delays and suspending access at work sites.  The Pentagon\u2019s chief weapons buyer, Ellen Lord, said on Monday a three-month slowdown was now expected on major defense programs as a result of supplier operating challenges during the coronavirus pandemic.  For the aircraft the Lockheed makes, there was \u201clikely going to be some production impacts\u201d due to the pandemic, CFO Ken Possenriede said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts, potentially delaying F-35 deliveries.  Marillyn Hewson, the outgoing CEO, said that the company was also watching its international supply chain closely and could provide extra financial support to keep those businesses healthy.  The company said it now expects full-year sales in a range of $62.25 billion to $64.00 billion, down from $62.75 billion to $64.25 billion, forecast previously. Lockheed reaffirmed its 2020 earnings per share forecast of $23.80 - the mid point of the range.  \u201cWhile defense companies like Lockheed Martin are not immune to coronavirus, the projected impact on the 2020 results looks very minor compared to what is likely to be seen elsewhere in the industrial sector,\u201d analyst Robert Stallard of Vertical Research wrote in a note on Tuesday.  Stable demand along with the Pentagon increasing interim payments to defense contractors, and also paying them for sick time or quarantined employees are expected to buoy the defense industry as coronavirus hits the economy.  Shares of Lockheed fell 2% $375.54.

The minivan-sized OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin, extended its 11-foot (3.35 m) robotic arm toward a flat patch of gravel near Bennu\u2019s north pole and plucked the sample of rocks, the space agency\u2019s first handful of pristine asteroid rocks.  \u201cSample collection is complete, and the back-away burn has executed,\u201d Lockheed mission operator Estelle Church added seconds later, confirming the spacecraft eased away from the space rock after making contact.  The probe will send back images of the sample collection on Wednesday and throughout the week so scientists can examine how much material was retrieved and determine whether the probe will need to make another collection attempt.  If a successful collection is confirmed, the spacecraft will journey back toward Earth, arriving in 2023. Japan is the only other country to have already accomplished this.  Bennu, located over 100 million miles from Earth and whose acorn-shaped body formed in the early days of our solar system, could hold clues to the origins of life on Earth, scientists say.  \u201cEverything went just exactly perfect,\u201d Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator from the University of Arizona, Tucson, said on a NASA live feed from Lockheed\u2019s mission support building. \u201cWe have overcome the amazing challenges that this asteroid has thrown at us, and the spacecraft appears to have operated flawlessly.\u201d  The robotic arm\u2019s collection device, shaped like an oversized shower head, is designed to release a pressurized gas to kick up debris.  The spacecraft launched in 2016 from Kennedy Space Center for the journey to Bennu. It has been in orbit around the asteroid for nearly two years preparing for the \u201ctouch and go\u201d maneuver.  \u201cA lot of things could go wrong because the spacecraft\u2019s about the size of a van, and the asteroid has a lot of boulders in it,\u201d Lucy Lim, a planetary scientist at NASA, said in an earlier interview. \u201cSo we have to go between the boulders to get our sample, and a lot of planning went into that.\u201d  Asteroids are among the leftover debris from the solar system\u2019s formation some 4.5 billion years ago.

The competition, worth billions of euros to the winning bidder, could have consequences for a separate, fledgling Franco-German program to develop a next generation Eurofighter that will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon.  Airbus is pitching the Eurofighter, a joint program with Britain\u2019s BAE Systems and Italy\u2019s Leonardo, and says it could take over the Tornado missions when that aircraft is phased out starting in 2025.  Buying more Eurofighters would also allow Germany to streamline maintenance costs since it already has a fleet of 130 Eurofighters, the company said.  The ministry plans to give priority to the European warplane to retain aircraft expertise in Europe and continue use of a proven system, but it has also asked for information about Lockheed\u2019s F-35 fighter jet and the F-15E and F\/A-18E\/F jets built by Boeing.  The ministry in December publicly rebuked German Air Force chief Lieutenant General Karl Muellner after he indicated a preference for the F-35 as the only aircraft that met the military\u2019s stealth requirements. Muellner is now due to retire in May.  The ministry has said it will only make a final decision on the Tornado replacement after a comprehensive assessment of data provided by the aircraft manufacturers.  Airbus defense chief Dirk Hoke told German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag this weekend that a decision to buy the F-35 would kill off plans by France and Germany to develop a new European fighter.  \u201cAs soon as Germany becomes an F-35 nation, all cooperation with France on combat jet issues will die,\u201d Hoke told the paper.  LOCKHEED OPEN TO TECH TRANSFER  Lockheed officials argue that it would make sense for Germany to buy a certain number of F-35s, especially given that many of its close military allies in Europe, including Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, are also buying the jets.  Rick Edwards, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin International, said he understood the desire of European countries to maintain a sovereign capability in aerospace, but said Lockheed was willing to work closely with local industry.  \u201cWe won\u2019t walk away from any competition as long as we think it will be evaluated fairly,\u201d Edwards told Reuters on the eve of the ILA Berlin Air Show. \u201cWe think we have a strong offering. We\u2019ll bring a strong industrial partnership that achieves the goal of having a sovereign capability.\u201d  U.S. officials are legally bound to equally represent all possible U.S. bids, but experts say the F-35 would be the best option for Germany since it is already slated to carry nuclear weapons beginning in the early 2020s.  Germany has committed to having that capability as part of its responsibilities to the NATO alliance.  The Eurofighter would still need to be certified to carry nuclear bombs, a process that could take until 2030 or longer, and might force Germany to extend the life of some Tornado jets at great cost, according to U.S. military experts.  An Airbus spokesman said the company was confident that Eurofighter could be certified by 2025.  \u201cWe do not advocate for a particular U.S. platform, but we encourage Germany to consider a suitable platform that is interoperable and survivable in the context of the modern threat environment,\u201d said U.S. Air Force Colonel Alex Walford, air attache at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.","42":"July 23 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp said on Tuesday it has been working to establish alternate supply sources for F-35 parts in the United States after the Pentagon decided last week reut.rs\/2y5bKbX to remove Turkey from the fighter jet program.  \u201cThese actions should limit any future production or sustainment impact, and we remain on track to meet our commitment of delivering 131 F-35s this year,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson told investors on a post-earnings call.

The original clause would have excluded Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 fighter, the plane the Canadian air force wants. The contract is worth between C$15 billion and C$19 billion ($11.1 billion to $14.1 billion).  \u201cI was surprised by the recommended change ... why would you deviate from a policy that\u2019s been so successful to accommodate a competitor?\u201d said Jim Barnes, the Boeing official in charge of trying to sell the company\u2019s F-18 Super Hornet jet to Canada.  The change in the rules around economic benefits was the latest wrinkle in a decade-long troubled-plagued effort to replace Canada\u2019s CF-18 jets, some of which are 40 years old.  The final list of requirements for the new fleet of jets is due to be issued in July.  \u201cRight now we feel like we can put a very compelling offer on the table even with this change,\u201d Barnes told reporters on the margins of a defense and security conference in Ottawa.  Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains - in overall charge of the benefits aspect of procurement - said in response to Barnes\u2019s comment that Ottawa would ensure the competition was fair.  Compelling bidders to offer watertight guarantees of economic benefits contradicts rules of the consortium that developed the F-35, a group to which Canada belongs.  Boeing is offering a binding commitment and Barnes said the firm would stress to Canadian officials the potential economic disadvantages of entertaining a non-binding bid.  An official from Sweden\u2019s Saab AB, another contender, told reporters that Canadians could lose out by ignoring contenders that had made firm investment commitments.  \u201cI am concerned that the ability to respond to a non-binding environment may not necessarily give Canadians the best value at the end of the day,\u201d said Patrick Palmer, head of sales and marketing for Saab Canada.

In April, the Pentagon told Congress it was considering selling the jets to the European nation, a NATO member, as well as Greece, Romania, Spain and Singapore.  The sale would boost Poland\u2019s contributions to NATO and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on Russian equipment, a State Department official said in a statement. During the Cold War, Poland, which shares borders with Russia and fellow NATO member Germany, belonged to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.  The approval of the sale comes days after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visited Poland, a key ally in the region, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the start of World War Two.  Under President Donald Trump, the United States has rolled out a \u201cBuy American\u201d plan that relaxed restrictions on sales and encouraged U.S. officials to take a bigger role in increasing business overseas for the American weapons industry.  However, the United States began the process in April to remove Turkey from the multinational F-35 program after Ankara said it would proceed in purchasing a Russian S-400 missile defense system that NATO officials say is not compatible with the F-35.

The companies are vying to develop rockets to carry satellites into orbit in what the Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates is a roughly $5.5 billion satellite launch services market.  ULA has started cutting and building hardware and has begun structural and pressure testing at its Decatur, Alabama factory. Engineers were also modifying the Florida launch pad and tower to accommodate Vulcan.  ULA\u2019s legacy Atlas and Delta rockets have been synonymous with America\u2019s space missions for decades. But the Colorado-based company has waged a cost-cutting campaign in recent years that included job cuts and trying new production methods as it faces mounting competition from SpaceX.  Musk has upended the industry with reusable rocket technology that has slashed the cost of space transportation.  And Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin said last week it will fly its still-in-development New Glenn rocket in 2021 - the same year as Vulcan.  While ULA\u2019s rockets burn up during each voyage, making for reliable but costlier missions, the company is charting a strategy of returning the first-stage engine to Earth under a parachute and plucking it out of mid-air with a helicopter.  ULA does not envision more job cuts and has been adding engineers in Florida and elsewhere, it said on Wednesday.  \u201cWe are now optimal-sized,\u201d Drefke said, adding that ULA will be hiring more engineers as it moves into production.  The Vulcan, which will be powered partly by Blue Origin\u2019s U.S.-built BE-4 engine, is central to ending U.S. reliance on Russia\u2019s RD-180 engine for national security missions.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The three companies competing with Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 jet have already complained about the way the contest is being run, and expressed concern some of the specifications clearly favor the U.S. firm, industry sources have said in recent weeks.  Next week the government is due to release the so-called request for proposals - the final list of requirements - for the 88 new planes it wants to buy. The contract is worth between C$15 billion ($11.5 billion) and C$19 billion and the planes are due to be delivered between 2025 and the early 2030s.  Boeing and Airbus have now formally written to Ottawa expressing concerns about the current requirements, said two sources familiar with the matter who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. The fourth bidder is Sweden\u2019s Saab AB.  Pat Finn, the defense ministry\u2019s top official in charge of procurement, confirmed one of the four companies had sent a formal letter but gave no details. The final request for proposals is due out on July 17 and modifications are still being considered, he said.  \u201cWe continue to engage all four of them,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe have had some comments (such as) \u2018If changes are not made in such a place then we would frankly consider possibly not bidding.\u2019\u201d  \u201cWe are looking at those very seriously. I can\u2019t say that we will make every change, but as far as we know we continue to have four bidders in the race.\u201d  Airbus declined to comment. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.  Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to buy replacements for its aging F-18 fighters. In May, Ottawa changed the rules to allow Lockheed Martin to submit a bid, prompting Boeing to take the unusual step of announcing publicly it was surprised.  \u201cAnyone who is not Lockheed Martin has expressed a very strong view,\u201d said one of the sources. \u201cWe have been pretty clear with the government that this is not a request for proposals that lends to our participation.\u201d  At least one firm has expressed unhappiness that the requirements emphasize the ability to carry out first strikes on targets abroad, a strength of the F-35, said the sources.  The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insists the competition is not rigged. Finn said the defense ministry also had made changes to the requirements at the request of Boeing, Airbus and Saab.  Canada is part of the international consortium that developed the F-35. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 of the jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays.  Trudeau came to power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 on the grounds that it was too costly, but Ottawa has since softened its line.","60":"BRUSSELS\/BERLIN (Reuters) - Belgium has chosen Lockheed Martin's LMT.N F-35 stealth jets over the Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its aging F-16s, news agency Belga cited government sources as saying, in a move that would cement the U.S.-made war plane's position in Europe.

Courtesy Josh Rosales\/U.S. Air Force\/Handout via REUTERS  The country has been deliberating for months over a multibillion-dollar purchase of 34 new fighter jets, with the latest deadline for a decision being Oct. 29.  A defense ministry spokeswoman declined to comment on the government\u2019s decision and did not confirm the end-October deadline.  Lockheed spokeswoman Carolyn Nelson did not confirm that a decision had been made but said the company remains confident that the F-35 is the right choice for Belgium.  \u201cThe F-35 offers transformational capability for the Belgian Air Force and, if selected, will align them with a global coalition operating the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft.\u201d  If confirmed, the decision will make Belgium the 12th country to buy the radar-evading F-35 jets and could help to strengthen the U.S. aerospace company\u2019s position in forthcoming tenders in Switzerland, Finland and Germany.  The decision, the likely outcome of which was reported by Reuters last Friday, had been expected in July before the NATO summit in Brussels. The order for jets due for delivery from 2023 is estimated to be worth 3.6 billion euros ($4.14 billion). [nL2N1WV11Y]  Washington has extended the terms of the F-35 bid to Oct. 31 at Brussels\u2019 request, U.S. sources said, adding that any further delay would trigger changes in pricing.  Lockheed has said its bid will give Belgian companies significant opportunities to contribute to the global F-35 enterprise.  EUROFIGHTER BLOW  Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel has previously said he would like to make the decision on the F-16 replacements before a national election in May and Defence Minister Steven Vandeput has said he hoped to settle the matter before he steps down at the end of the year.  A win for Lockheed would mark a setback for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, the four countries behind the Eurofighter program, who had mounted a strong lobbying campaign for the European war plane.  It is also likely to anger France, which did not submit a formal bid for the Rafale fighter built by Dassault Aviation AVMD.PA but had offered Belgium close defense cooperation to prevent a further spread of the F-35 in Europe.  Other European buyers of the F-35 include Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Turkey and Norway.  The Eurofighter is flown by Germany, Britain, Austria, Italy and Spain.","61":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin LMT.N sees a potential export market of more than $20 billion for its F-16 fighter aircraft from an assembly line in India it has offered to set up in order to win a large Indian military order, a top executive said.

Lockheed Martin has offered to shift its F-16 production line from the United States to India, potentially the biggest boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Make-in-India project to create a defense industrial base and generate jobs for the thousands of youth entering the workforce each month.  Vivek Lall, the vice president of strategy and business development at Lockheed, told Reuters that the firm would make India the sole global production center for the F-16 that would meet the requirements for the Indian military but also overseas markets.  \u201cWe see current demand outside of India of more than 200 aircraft. The value of those initial acquisition programs would likely exceed $20 billion,\u201d Lall said.  Bahrain and Slovakia had picked the F-16 Block 70 that had been offered to India, he said. \u201cWe are in discussions with Bulgaria, several other countries, 10 countries. There is a kind of a renaissance of the F-16.\u201d  India\u2019s defense ministry is expected to issue an expression of interest over the next several months, followed by a request for proposals in a long, drawn out process for the air force contract.  India\u2019s military has said it wants 42 squadrons of jets, around 750 aircraft, to defend against a two pronged attack from China and Pakistan. But with old Russian jets like the MiG-21, first used in the 1960s, retiring soon, it could end up with only 22 squadrons by 2032, officials have warned.  Lall said the plan to relocate the F-16 plant which was originally in Fort Worth, Texas, will not undermine U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s signature goal of moving manufacturing back to America.  The plant in Texas is being used to produce the fifth generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter that the United States Air Force is transitioning to.  Lall said there would still be work done out of the United States even if production of the F-16 moves to India and that Make in India and Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again were not at cross purposes.  \u201cI think they complementary. The U.S. has a certain amount engineering and strength that will continue as long as the product is there, that will continue even when production moves.\u201d  Lockheed has picked Tata Advanced Systems as its Indian partner for the proposed F-16 plant and last year it announced that their joint venture will produce wings for the aircraft in India, regardless of whether it wins the Indian military order.","62":"Oct 23 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon\u2019s No. 1 weapons supplier, reported a 17 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by more production of F-35 fighter jets.

Bringing down the cost of the world\u2019s most expensive defense program is crucial to securing more orders, both in the United States and abroad.  President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has steadily declined in recent years as production increased.  The current \u201chandshake\u201d deal will be solidified along with pricing and other terms in a contract that will be announced in the coming weeks, the sources said, on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.  The agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense removes a crucial road block from the ongoing negotiations for a multi-year deal for the fighters that is expected to consist of three tranches over fiscal years 2018-2020.  The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin \u201chave made progress and are in the final stages of negotiation,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s head of acquisitions Ellen Lord said in a statement, adding the two sides had reached \u201ca handshake agreement which symbolizes the Department of Defense\u2019s commitment to equip\u201d U.S and allied forces, while giving \u201cgreat value\u201d to the U.S. taxpayer.  Last summer, Reuters reported that F-35 customers including Australia, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain and the United States had aimed to procure 135 or more jets in fiscal year 2018 for delivery in 2020 for about $88 million per jet.  In addition, negotiations were ongoing for the multi-year U.S. deal that was said to be worth more than $37 billion, and encompassing a record 440 F-35 fighter jets.  But negotiations for this 11th batch of jets extended because new Pentagon leaders drilled deep into the program to understand it and its costs, prolonging negotiations for the multi-year \u201cblock buy,\u201d the sources said.  On Sunday, a Lockheed Martin representative said the handshake agreement on the production contract for the 11th lot of F-35 aircraft was in place, but the total value and cost per variant would be released when the contract was finalised.  The F-35 comes in 3 variants: the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model; the F-35B, a short take-off\/vertical landing version; and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.  The F-35 program is aiming to grow the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bring the unit price of the F-35A closer to $80 million in 2020 through efficiencies gained by ordering in larger quantifies.  The jet had production problems in 2017, but Lockheed still hit its 2017 target to deliver 66 to the United States and its allies.  Lockheed is aiming to deliver 91 jets in 2018 and the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker hopes to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.  Despite the challenges the program has faced, the jet completed its flight testing in April. In May, Israel said it had been the first country to use the fighter in combat.  New international customers are also possible. In February, the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of 34 F-35s to Belgium for as much as $6.53 billion. Belgium is due to make a decision on a new fighter later this year.  General Tod Wolters, the top U.S. Air Force general in Europe and NATO\u2019s Allied Air Commander, said the new warplane was taking root in Europe.  \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changing system,\u201d Wolters told Reuters ahead of the Royal International Air Tattoo military air show in England. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of integrating the F-35 into the complete environment, not just the airspace.\u201d  Norway, Britain and Italy will have received 40 F-35s in Europe by the end of the year.

Israel initially balked at the prospective sale but last week dropped its opposition after what it described as U.S. guarantees that Israeli military superiority would be preserved.

The issue is not expected to impact F-35 deliveries and the program remains on track to meet its target of 91 aircraft for the year, the Pentagon said.","82":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee passed its version of a $716 billion defense policy bill on Thursday, including a measure to prevent Turkey from purchasing Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets.

Darin Russell\/Courtesy of Lockheed Martin\/Handout via REUTERS  The amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, from Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Senator Thom Tillis, would remove Turkey from the F-35 program over its detention of U.S. citizen Andrew Brunson, Shaheen\u2019s office said.  Brunson, a Christian pastor who could be jailed for up to 35 years, denied terrorism and spying charges in a Turkish court this month. He has been in pre-trial detention since 2016.  It also faults NATO ally Turkey for its agreement with Russia in December to buy S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries. Ankara wants the system to boost its defense capabilities amid threats from Kurdish and Islamist militants at home and conflicts across its borders in Syria and Iraq.  According to Shaheen\u2019s office, the intention to purchase the Russian system is sanctionable under U.S. law.  \u201cThere is tremendous hesitancy (about) transferring sensitive F35 planes and technology to a nation who has purchased a Russian air defense system designed to shoot these very planes down,\u201d said Senator Shaheen.  Relations between Ankara and Washington have been strained over a host of issues in recent months, including U.S. policy in Syria and a number of legal cases against Turkish and U.S. nationals being held in the two countries.  Turkey has said it would retaliate if the United States enacted a law halting weapons sales to the country.  Turkey plans to buy more than 100 of the F-35 jets, and has had talks with Washington about the purchase of Patriot missiles.  The move to buy S-400s, which are incompatible with the NATO systems, has unnerved NATO member countries, which are already wary of Moscow\u2019s military presence in the Middle East, prompting NATO officials to warn Turkey of unspecified consequences.  The NDAA is several steps from becoming law. The House of Representatives passed its version of the legislation earlier on Thursday. The Senate must still pass its version of the bill and the two versions must be reconciled before a final compromise bill can come up for a vote in both the House and Senate later this year.","83":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering expanding sales of Lockheed Martin Corp-made F-35 fighter jets to five new nations including Romania, Greece and Poland as European allies bulk up their defenses in the face of a strengthening Russia, a Pentagon official told Congress on Thursday.  In written testimony submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives and seen by Reuters, Vice Admiral Mathias Winter - the head of the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 office - said that \u201cfuture potential Foreign Military Sales customers include Singapore, Greece, Romania, Spain and Poland.\u201d  News of the new customers coincides with U.S. tension with F-35 development partner Turkey over Ankara\u2019s plans to buy a Russian missile defense system.  Foreign military sales like those of the F-35 are considered government-to-government deals where the Pentagon acts as an intermediary between the defense contractor and a foreign government.  Other U.S. allies have been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.  Winter\u2019s full written testimony, which will be made public as soon as Friday, said the United States would respond to all official requests for information about the jet.  Last year, Belgium was the first new customer for the F-35 in years, choosing it over the Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its aging F-16s in a 4 billion euro ($4.55 billion) deal.  Under President Donald Trump the United States has rolled out a \u201cBuy American\u201d plan that relaxed restrictions on sales and encouraged U.S. officials to take a bigger role in increasing business overseas for the U.S. weapons industry.  Lockheed, the jet\u2019s prime contractor, is developing and building three models of the new warplanes for the U.S. military and 10 other countries that have signed up to buy the jets: Britain, Australia, Italy, Turkey, Norway, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Belgium.  U.S. arms sales to foreign governments rose 13 percent to $192.3 billion in the year ending Sept. 30, the State Department said in November.  Lockheed delivered 91 F-35 fighter jets to the United States and its allies in calendar 2018.","84":"NEW DELHI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin will begin supplying wings for its F-16 combat jets from a facility in southern India from next year, a senior executive said on Thursday.  Lockheed is bidding for a contract, estimated at more than $15 billion, to supply the Indian Air Force with 114 combat planes and has offered to shift its F-16 production line from the United States to India.  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is pushing a Make-in-India programme under which it wants global firms, including in the defence sector, to set up manufacturing centres in India to build a domestic industrial base and create jobs.  Vivek Lall, vice president of Strategy and Business Development for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said the wings of all future F-16s that the company will sell worldwide will be produced in a joint venture with India\u2019s Tata Advanced Systems in the southern city of Hyderabad.  \u201cThe first wing prototype is being built now. The expectation is we will begin supplying by next year sometime, this will be the sole facility for future F-16 wing production,\u201d Lall told Reuters.  Lockheed is competing for the Indian air force contract with Boeing, which has pitched its F\/A-18 Super Hornet, as well as Sweden\u2019s Saab with its Gripen fighter. France\u2019s Dassault Systemes SE\u2019s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also in the fray.  The air force needs new fighter jets to replace its ageing fleet of Russian MiG planes. But Indian defence procurement is a lengthy process.  The government\u2019s insistence on local manufacture and reduced reliance on expensive imports has delayed decision-making further as foreign firms search for local partners and suppliers.  Lall said Lockheed was already producing the empennage of its C-130J transport aircraft from the Hyderabad facility and also cabins for its Sikorsky helicopters. There were 500 people each involved in two joint ventures set up for the production of the empennage and the cabin.  \u201cWe have been doing make-in-India for years now,\u201d he said. The company has said if it sets up a local production base for the F-16 it will also provide maintenance, repair and spares for the combat jet flying with air forces around the world.  Lall said that with 3,000 F-16s flying around the world and more orders being negotiated with countries such as Bahrain, Lockheed estimated there was a market worth $165 billion for after-sales support.  \u201cIt is a huge potential business, India will be plugging into the world\u2019s largest fighter jet ecosystem.\u201d (Reporting by Sanjeev Miglani; Editing by Jane Merriman)","85":"April 30 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp:  * LOCKHEED MARTIN OPENS NEW FACILITY TO SUPPORT F-35 PRODUCTION GROWTH  * LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP - THE FACILITY IS EXPECTED TO BE OPERATIONAL BY MID-MAY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","86":"April 24 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp:  * LOCKHEED MARTIN - SINCE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, CO HAS HIRED MORE THAN 1,700 NEW EMPLOYEES TO SUPPORT ESSENTIAL NATIONAL SECURITY WORK  * LOCKHEED MARTIN - COMMITTED TO CONTINUE HIRING DURING PANDEMIC & IS ADVERTISING MORE THAN 4,000 OPEN POSITIONS FOR TECHNICAL AND NON-TECHNICAL CAREERS Further company coverage:","87":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s defence ministry will take back direct control of the operation and development of the country\u2019s nuclear weapons from a consortium of Lockheed Martin, Serco and Jacobs Engineering in June 2021, it said on Monday.  Operation of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, which maintains the warheads for the Trident submarine-based nuclear deterrent, was awarded to the AWE Management consortium in 1999 under a 25-year contract.  Lockheed Martin owns 51% and Serco and Jacobs Engineering own 24.5% each of the consortium.  The government said ending the commercial arrangement early would improve its agility in managing the UK\u2019s nuclear deterrent and deliver value for money to the taxpayer.  Serco said it was told about the termination of the contract late on Friday. Shares in Serco fell 13% in early deals.  Based in Aldermaston in southern England, AWE is also required to retain the capability to design a new weapon, should it ever be required.  The company said AWE was expected to contribute about 17 million pounds ($22 million) to both its underlying trading profit and pretax profit in 2020.  It said, however, assuming a smooth handover of the contract next year, it expected profit in 2021 to remain broadly in line with current consensus and at similar levels to our expectations for 2020.  Sky News, which first reported the news, said it was not clear if the companies would receive compensation for the termination of the 25-year contract.  Analysts at Jefferies said they expected some compensation was likely as the consortium was now meeting its targets after a period of underperformance about five years ago.

FILE PHOTO - Lockheed Martin's logo is seen during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan on October 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  The Trump administration last week rolled out an overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home.  Rick Edwards, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin International, told Reuters the initiative should help speed up progress on foreign weapons sales that have already helped fuel his company\u2019s growth in recent years.  \u201cIt will reassure some of our allies that we\u2019re going to move the process faster,\u201d he said in an interview on the eve of the ILA Berlin Air Show. \u201cThey get frustrated with how long it takes to get through all the wickets.\u201d  Foreign sales accounted for about 30 percent of Lockheed\u2019s revenues in 2017 and should expand further in coming years, Edwards said, although he declined to name a specific target.  Lockheed on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast, helped in part by sales of its stealthy F-35 combat jets.  Edwards said that he would not be surprised if U.S. allies in the Gulf began requesting information about the F-35 during the Trump presidency, although future sales would depend on political decisions in that region and the United States.  \u201cThese countries are very strong allies, and they\u2019re buying a lot of American equipment, so the logical next step is that they\u2019ll pursue the rest of American capabilities,\u201d he said.  At the same time, he said, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors were working to beef up their air and missile defense capabilities and meet other military needs, which would probably take precedence before they moved ahead on any F-35 purchases.  A planned sale of Lockheed\u2019s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system is currently in the contract review process in Saudi Arabia, he said.  Lockheed is working closely with Saudi Arabian Military Industries, or SAMI, to work out details on local jobs and local sovereignty, and is likely to wind up with hundreds of Lockheed employees in the kingdom, Edwards said.  Saudi Arabia has announced \u201cambitious\u201d plans to increase the percentage of local work done on weapons contracts to around 50 percent from 2 to 3 percent currently by 2030, he said.  Lockheed is also \u201cbullish\u201d on sales in Europe, where it already has 3,500 employees and eight offices, Edwards added.  The company is focused heavily on several German competitions, including a multi-billion-euro heavy-lift helicopter competition in which its CH-53K King Stallion will square off against Boeing\u2019s twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook. The CH-53K will make its international debut at the air show this week.  Edwards said he was confident that the company\u2019s joint venture with European missile maker MBDA would be able to make a deal with Germany for a missile defense system after years of negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t see any showstoppers and the messaging from our customers has been great,\u201d he said.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The department said the deal would allow Lockheed to receive $6 billion in funding immediately, a move aimed at preventing major delays in production of the new stealthy fighter jets.  This contract is the first to lock in multiyear commitments from U.S. allies as Lockheed anticipates that buying components in larger quantities will help move the price of the most common F-35 jet to below $80 million by 2020. The most common variation of the jet, the F-35 A, had a price of $89.2 million after the most recent round of contract negotiations announced in September.  Lockheed is developing and building three models of the new warplanes for the U.S. military and 10 other countries that have signed up to buy the jets: Britain, Australia, Italy, Turkey, Norway, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Belgium.  The Pentagon\u2019s chief arms buyer, Ellen Lord, told Reuters on Tuesday that she expected to finalize the interim terms of the deal, known as an \u201cundefinitized contract action\u201d or UCA, with Lockheed, its No. 1 supplier, by the spring of next year.  A Lockheed representative said: \u201cThis is a smart approach for the taxpayer, the warfighter and for industry.\u201d  According to the Pentagon, Wednesday\u2019s agreement means that U.S. allies buy 149 jets over the three-year period. In the United States\u2019 one-year deal, it will buy the remaining 106 jets for delivery beginning in 2020.  The U.S. government will continue to buy jets in annual contracts, but is also purchasing components for future-year jets and will also benefit from the economies of scale allowed under the multiyear contract.  The three-year deal, known as the \u201cblock buy\u201d among the United States and allies, has been said to be worth more than $37 billion and encompass a record 440 jets.  Wednesday\u2019s contract agrees to a high-water mark of $22.7 billion for all of the 255 jets, but that dollar figure is expected to come down during the negotiations while the jet count is considered a minimum commitment.  The interim payment authorized on Wednesday will be deducted from the total contract when the two sides reach a final agreement.  The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp UTX.N, for engines to power the jets.","96":"April 17 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp:  * LOCKHEED MARTIN SUBMITS PROPOSAL FOR U.S. AIR FORCE\u2019S GPS IIIF PROGRAM Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","97":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former top U.S. military official, General Joseph Dunford, has been elected to the board of Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N, the Pentagon's largest weapons supplier, the company said on Friday.

The F-35 program, which makes up about 25% of Lockheed\u2019s annual revenue, has long aimed at expanding the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bringing the unit price of the F-35A below $80 million through efficiencies gained by bulk orders.  Earlier this year, Pentagon announced pricing details for its agreement with Lockheed that lowers the cost of the F-35 jets it plans to purchase through 2022 by 12.7%, which may encourage other nations to buy the warplane.  In 2019, international deliveries jumped 43% to 30 jets for international partner nations.  More U.S. allies have been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.  The F-35 comes in three configurations: the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies, a F-35 B-model which can handle short takeoffs and vertical landings and carrier-variant F-35C jets for the U.S. Navy.","127":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin LMT.N said on Tuesday it will slow production of its stealthy F-35 fighter jets at its Texas facility, possibly delaying delivery of between 18 and 24 jets due to a parts shortage as the coronavirus hampers production across the jet's vast supply chain.

The company said in a statement it expects the financial impact \u201cto be consistent with what we\u2019ve reported previously,\u201d and that they will share any new information during the next earnings call.  Ulmer cautioned that it was too soon to say the company would not meet its delivery target of 141 F-35 jets, \u201cbecause we have the ability to surge, and we\u2019ll be working with our suppliers to do everything we can to come out of this on the backside strong.\u201d  Lockheed Martin has exceeded its 2019 goal of 131 F-35 deliveries by 3 jets.  The parts slowdown began in early to mid-April, when European suppliers began to feel the impacts of the coronavirus. Later, suppliers in the U.S. were impacted, Ulmer said.  The slower production schedule will begin on May 23.  Ulmer said the slowdown could last through late-July, but could be extended or shortened depending on suppliers.  F-35 assembly facilities in Japan and Italy were both impacted by COVID-19 earlier this year.","128":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Lockheed Martin is seen at Euronaval, the world naval defence exhibition in Le Bourget near Paris, France, October 23, 2018.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  A preliminary deal was struck in July, and reported first by Reuters, clearing the way for a larger multi-year purchase that aims to bring the cost per jet down to $80 million by 2020. Most of the jets are for the U.S. military, and others are for a number of allied countries.  Reducing the cost of the world\u2019s most expensive defense program is crucial to securing orders in the United States and more from abroad. Lockheed is the No. 1 U.S. defense contractor.  \u201cDriving down cost is critical to the success of this program,\u201d Vice Admiral Mat Winter, head of the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 office said.  The agreement removes a roadblock from negotiations for a multi-year deal for the fighters that is expected to consist of three tranches over fiscal years 2018-2020.  President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for delays and cost overruns, but the price per jet has declined as production increased. The price of the last batch of F-35A\u2019s in 2017 cost 7 percent less than the previous jet order.  Greg Ulmer, head of the F-35 program at Lockheed, said the Bethesda, Maryland-based company expects to cut the cost of the F-35A to $80 million by 2020.  In addition, negotiations were ongoing for a multi-year deal that was said to be worth more than $37 billion, and encompassing a record 440 F-35 fighter jets.  Negotiations for this 11th batch of jets were extended because Trump-appointed Pentagon leadership drilled deep into the program to understand its costs, prolonging negotiations for the multi-year \u201cblock buy,\u201d people familiar with the talks have said.  Last summer, Reuters had reported on this 11th round of contract negotiations between Lockheed and F-35 customers including Australia, Denmark, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, South Korea, Britain and the United States. At the time, the anticipated price was for about $88 million per jet.  The F-35 comes in 3 variants: the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model; the F-35B, a short take-off\/vertical landing version; and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.  This deal includes 91 jets for the U.S. including 53 of the A variant, 24 of the B variant and 14 of the C variant. In addition, there are 28 F-35\u2019s for international partners and 22 for Foreign Military Sales customers in this batch.  The F-35 program is aiming to expand the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bring the unit price of the F-35A closer to $80 million in 2020 through efficiencies gained by ordering in larger quantifies.  Lockheed is aiming to deliver 91 jets in 2018 and the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker hopes to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.

The department said the deal would allow Lockheed to receive $6 billion in funding immediately, a move aimed at preventing major delays in production of the new stealthy fighter jets.  This contract is the first to lock in multiyear commitments from U.S. allies as Lockheed anticipates that buying components in larger quantities will help move the price of the most common F-35 jet to below $80 million by 2020. The most common variation of the jet, the F-35 A, had a price of $89.2 million after the most recent round of contract negotiations announced in September.  Lockheed is developing and building three models of the new warplanes for the U.S. military and 10 other countries that have signed up to buy the jets: Britain, Australia, Italy, Turkey, Norway, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Belgium.  The Pentagon\u2019s chief arms buyer, Ellen Lord, told Reuters on Tuesday that she expected to finalize the interim terms of the deal, known as an \u201cundefinitized contract action\u201d or UCA, with Lockheed, its No. 1 supplier, by the spring of next year.  A Lockheed representative said: \u201cThis is a smart approach for the taxpayer, the warfighter and for industry.\u201d  According to the Pentagon, Wednesday\u2019s agreement means that U.S. allies buy 149 jets over the three-year period. In the United States\u2019 one-year deal, it will buy the remaining 106 jets for delivery beginning in 2020.  The U.S. government will continue to buy jets in annual contracts, but is also purchasing components for future-year jets and will also benefit from the economies of scale allowed under the multiyear contract.  The three-year deal, known as the \u201cblock buy\u201d among the United States and allies, has been said to be worth more than $37 billion and encompass a record 440 jets.  Wednesday\u2019s contract agrees to a high-water mark of $22.7 billion for all of the 255 jets, but that dollar figure is expected to come down during the negotiations while the jet count is considered a minimum commitment.  The interim payment authorized on Wednesday will be deducted from the total contract when the two sides reach a final agreement.  The Pentagon is negotiating a separate contract with Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp, for engines to power the jets.

Picture taken May 22, 2020. U.S. Air National Guard\/Miss Julie M. Shea\/Handout via REUTERS.  The request for the Lockheed Martin Co jets was submitted by the Persian Gulf state in recent weeks, the people said.  A U.S. State Department spokesman said, \u201cAs a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress.\u201d  The Qatari embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Keen to counter Iran in the region, the U.S. helps to arm allies including Qatar, host to the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, and home to 8,000 U.S. service members and Department of Defense civilian employees.  The request follows an August deal between the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates in which Washington agreed to consider giving the Gulf state approval to buy F-35s in a side deal to a U.S.-brokered agreement called the Abraham Accord to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel.  Israel has signaled stiff opposition to a UAE sale and would likely be just as resistant to one with Qatar, fearing it could undercut its military advantage in the Middle East.  In Washington, a fourth person familiar with the matter said concern about Qatar\u2019s links to Hamas have frequently surfaced over arms sales to the Gulf state. But in the case of an advanced warplane like the F-35, it could be a deal breaker.  One of the people said Qatar\u2019s letter of request for the jets, the first formal step in the legal process of foreign military sale, was not directly linked to its adoption of the Abraham Accord. Nor has Qatar shown any sign it will normalize ties with Israel.  U.S. and Qatar have close ties. In September Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met in Washington as the U.S. hopes to move forward with naming Qatar as a major non-NATO ally.  Despite being U.S. allies, both the potential Qatari and UAE F-35 deals must satisfy a decades-old agreement with Israel that states any U.S. weapons sold to the region must not impair Israel\u2019s \u201cqualitative military edge,\u201d guaranteeing U.S. weapons furnished to Israel are \u201csuperior in capability\u201d to those sold to its neighbors.  Saudi Arabia, Washington\u2019s most powerful and closest partner among the Gulf Arab states, is also likely to oppose the United States supplying F-35s to Qatar. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt remain locked in a three-year standoff with Qatar that the Trump administration has tried to end, so far without success.  A formal letter of request typically contains specifications that would be used to furnish pricing data to a customer, but currently the F-35A, a fifth generation stealthy fighter jet, costs around $80 million.  Any F-35 sale could take years to negotiate and deliver, giving a new U.S. presidential administration ample time to halt the deals. Any sale would also need congressional approval.  Poland, the most recent F-35 customer, purchased 32 of the jets, but will not receive its first delivery until 2024.","134":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Lockheed Martin is seen at Euronaval, the world naval defence exhibition in Le Bourget near Paris, France, October 23, 2018.

The sources asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.  The sources said buying complete aircraft from the United States, at about $100 million each, will save Japan about $30 million per airframe.  The purchase will add to an earlier order for 42 of the fighters, most of which are being constructed at a \"final assembly and check out\" plant in Japan operated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 7011.T, the country's leading defense contractor.  That plant is one of only two such factories outside the United States. The other, in Italy, is operated by Leonardo Spa LDOF.MI.  As China fields ever more advanced aircraft, including stealth planes, and as North Korea pushes ahead with its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs, adding F-35s will further increase Japan\u2019s reliance on U.S. military technology to give it an edge over potential foes in East Asia.  Japanese military planners are also considering buying F-35Bs, the vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) version of the aircraft. Those models can operate from small islands skirting the East China Sea or from ships such as the Izumo-class helicopter carriers.  \u201cWe have not yet made any plan and we are evaluating what fighter aircraft we need,\u201d Itsunori Onodera said at a news briefing on Tuesday when asked whether Japan planned to buy more F-35s.  Onodera\u2019s ministry will release two defense reviews by the end of the year that will outline Japan\u2019s security goals and military procurement plans for the five years beginning in April 2019.  The first of the 42 F-35As ordered by Japan\u2019s Air Self Defence Force (ASDF) are being deployed to Misawa Air Base in northern Japan. Japanese government officials and Lockheed Martin executives are set to attend a ceremony there on Saturday to mark the entry of the first Japanese F-35 into service.  The F-35 accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed Martin\u2019s total revenue. The company is hiring 1,800 workers for its Fort Worth, Texas, factory to build a fleet that is expected to grow to more than 3,000 jets worldwide. Lockheed Martin is scheduled to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets by 2023.  The first Japanese F-35s will replace aging F-4 Phantom fighters that date back to 1960s. The next batch will allow Japan to retire some of the aging 200 F-15s flown by the ASDF that are the main interceptor workhorse of the nation\u2019s air defenses.  Japan also wants to build its own stealth fighter, dubbed the F-3, although the high cost of military aircraft development means it will probably need to find foreign partners to share the expense.","150":"FILE PHOTO: The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016.

The $4.4 billion dollar deal, announced late last year, has raised eyebrows because Lockheed would take over a company that produces 70% of the solid fuel rocket motors and other propulsion products used in everything from antiballistic missiles, to air-to-air missiles.  On Thursday the chief executive of one of Aerojet\u2019s biggest customers, Raytheon Technologies Corp, said his company would speak with anti-trust regulators because they have \u201cconcerns\u201d about the deal.  \u201cIf that merger actually happens, you don\u2019t have an independent supplier in the solid rocket motor side,\u201d Greg Hayes said at the Barclay\u2019s Industrial Select Conference on Wednesday.

Lockheed competes against Raytheon when it sells tactical missiles, often fired from jets, to the Pentagon.  Lockheed\u2019s CEO, Jim Taiclet, said the deal could put Lockheed into a strong position in the growing propulsion and hypersonic weapons market.  Still, Taiclet has said Lockheed would simultaneously remain a partner to Aerojet\u2019s current customer base by \u201cproviding outstanding propulsion products for the entire industry.\u201d  The merger, announced on Dec. 20, is in its 60-day antitrust review period that expires at midnight Thursday and is widely expected be extended by the FTC, allowing the agency more time for review.  Lockheed has anticipated the deal could take until the second half of the year to close.","154":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp was awarded a $2.4 billion Pentagon contract on Monday for THAAD interceptor missiles, some of which are slated to be delivered to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

In November, Saudi and U.S. officials signed letters of offer and acceptance formalizing terms for Saudi Arabia\u2019s purchase of 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense launchers, missiles and related equipment.  The Pentagon said the Saudi government would pay $1.5 billion of the $2.4 billion.

Boeing BA.N, Lockheed Martin LMT.N, Saab SAABb.ST and Dassault Aviation AVMD.PA are among the manufacturers expected to compete.  The aircraft must be built largely in India as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s drive to build a domestic industrial base.  The air force said in a notice that \u201c85 percent will have to be made in India by a Strategic Partner\/Indian Production Agency\u201d.  Lockheed has offered to move its F-16 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, to India and make it the only plant worldwide to produce the F-16 for not only India but also other countries, said Vivek Lall, vice president, strategy and business development at Lockheed Martin.  Lockheed has teamed with India\u2019s Tata Advanced Systems to build the planes locally while Sweden\u2019s Saab has entered into a partnership with the Adani Group, a resources conglomerate. The other contenders have not announced their local partners.  The tender will be open for makers of both single engine and twin-engined combat jets, in a widening of the field. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also potential contenders under the new requirements.  A spokesman for Dassault Aviation which makes the twin-engine Rafale declined to comment.  Earlier, the defense ministry had sought expressions of interest from single-engine manufacturers which effectively restricted the contest to Lockheed\u2019s F-16 and Saab\u2019s Gripen fighter jets.  But in February the government asked the air force to open up the competition to twin-engined aircraft, in the latest flip-flop in policy that has delayed the acquisition process for years and left the air force short of hundreds of planes.  India began its search for new planes for the Indian air force in 2003 to replace its Soviet-era MiG fighters.  The request for information is open until July, the air force said. A request for proposal will then be issued followed by bid evaluations and contract negotiations.

Fitted with powerful Lockheed Martin Corp radars, Japan\u2019s Aegis Ashore systems are meant to intercept missile strikes from North Korea and elsewhere. In June, defence minister Taro Kono suspended plans for two land sites, which would have cost about $2 billion to construct, citing the possibility that booster rockets could fall on local residents.  Instead, he suggested installing the systems on sea platforms or ships.  Defence ministry officials are considering several proposals, including putting Aegis on platforms resembling oil rigs, or on converted merchant ships or naval vessels. Kono\u2019s successor, Nobuo Kishi, has said he will make a decision on the future of Aegis Ashore by year end.  Delays and higher costs could rekindle support for an onshore plan, as Japan\u2019s public finances are strained by debt exacerbated by massive coronavirus economic aid spending.  A defence ministry official said he was unaware of the new cost and time estimates for missile defence at sea. The land-based Aegis Ashore batteries were scheduled to be operational in 2025.  Some of those proposals could cost more than $4 billion each, not including interceptor missiles and operating expenses, which would exceed those of land stations because of fuel, maintenance and larger crews, said the person familiar with the matter, who has seen estimates being discussed by defence ministry officials.  The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the plans.  A destroyer has about 300 sailors, about 10 times more people than needed for a land site, according to Japan\u2019s defence ministry.  Armed with interceptor missiles designed to hit warheads in space, Aegis Ashore\u2019s Lockheed Martin SPY-7 radar has at least three times the range of older Aegis radars already on Japanese warships.  \u201cWe are here to support whatever Japan needs, and in our mind, there is no option that is off the table,\u201d said Tom Rowden, the vice president responsible for Lockheed\u2019s overseas Rotary and Mission System business, including Aegis Ashore in Japan. \u201cOur main focus here is to give Japan the capability that they need to be able to defend their country.\u201d  In 2019, Japan listed China as its main security threat for the first time, pointing to Beijing\u2019s burgeoning defence spending and military manoeuvres. Japan has also said it is concerned about a resurgence in Russian activity around Japan.  Although Japan usually pays for big U.S.-built military projects through the U.S. government\u2019s Foreign Military Sales programme, it is buying SPY-7 directly from Lockheed and has paid half of the $300 million contract already.  The possibility that Aegis Ashore will be based at sea has spurred Raytheon Technologies Corp, which lost the contract to Lockheed in 2018, to promote its SPY-6 radar for Japan instead.  Defence ministry officials say they prefer the SPY-7 and are sticking with it. But some influential lawmakers from Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, such as former deputy defence minister and deputy foreign affairs minister Masahisa Sato, favour SPY-6 because the U.S. Navy plans to use it on new Aegis Ashore destroyers.

The move paves the way for a contract signing in 2019, a ministry spokesman told Reuters.  That would mark four years since the ministry first announced it had chosen the Medium Extended Air Defence System (MEADS) -- developed by Lockheed and MBDA with $4 billion in funding from Germany, Italy and the United States -- over Raytheon Co\u2019s Patriot system.  The next-generation defence system is known as TLVS in German.  \u201cThis is a another step forward toward a final contract in 2019,\u201d the spokesman said.

That was partly helped by a $75 million dollar boost from additional tax deductions on foreign military sales, part of Trump\u2019s tax cut that came into effect last year.  Excluding that one-time gain, Lockheed reported $5.73 per share profit, well ahead of the $4.34 per share that Wall Street had expected, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company had a 12.4 percent tax rate in the first quarter but Possenriede said he expected its 2019 tax rate to be 15.5 percent.  Lockheed\u2019s overall net sales for the quarter rose 23 percent to $14.34 billion. The company\u2019s sales backlog grew to $133.5 billion, up 3 billion over the quarter.  Lockheed shares were up 6.6 percent at $336.23 in afternoon trading.  JET SALES UP  Operating margins at the aeronautics division, Lockheed\u2019s biggest, fell to 10.5 percent in the first quarter from 10.8 percent a year earlier, but sales were up 27 percent to $5.5 billion on demand for the F-35 jet and some classified contracts.  The United States is considering expanding sales of Lockheed-made F-35 fighter jets to five new nations including Romania, Greece and Poland as European allies bulk up their defenses in the face of a strengthening Russia, a Pentagon official told Congress in early April.  The F-35, a key program for Lockheed, suffered a setback earlier this month when a Japanese F-35 stealth fighter crashed in the Pacific Ocean close to northern Japan. The aircraft was less than a year old and was the first F-35 assembled in Japan.  The company highlighted some risks in its earnings report, including U.S. \u201cgovernment actions to prevent the sale or delivery of the corporation\u2019s products\u201d to Turkey.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Airbus is pictured at their facility in Montoir-de-Bretagne near Saint-Nazaire, France July 12, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe  The defense arm of Airbus, which indicated last month it might withdraw, cited onerous security requirements and a late decision by Ottawa to loosen the rules for how much bidders would have to invest in Canada.  Airbus and other contenders had already complained the government appeared to be tilting the race in favor of Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 plane, which the Royal Canadian Air Force wants. Canada is part of the consortium that developed the plane.  Canada launched the long-delayed competition last month and said it was confident no favoritism had been shown. Ottawa says the contract is worth between C$15 billion ($11.30 billion) and C$19 billion.  Canada\u2019s official opposition Conservative Party, which is seeking to defeat Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in an October election, accused the government of gross mismanagement.  Reuters revealed in July that Airbus and Boeing Co BA.N had written to Ottawa to say they might pull out.  The firms are unhappy that in late May, the government dropped a demand that bidders must guarantee to give Canadian businesses 100% of the value of the deal in economic benefits.  Such legally watertight commitments, which Boeing, Airbus and Sweden's Saab AB SAABb.ST had already agreed to, contradict rules of the F-35 consortium. Ottawa's move allowed Lockheed Martin to stay in the competition.  \u201cOne of the strongest points of our bid was the fact we were willing to make binding commitments,\u201d said an Airbus source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.  \u201cOnce this was loosened up to a point where these commitments were no longer valued in the same way\u201d, the firm decided \u201cthat\u2019s just too much\u201d, added the source, who also cited security challenges.  European jets must show they can meet stringent standards required by the United States, which with Canada operates the North American Aerospace Defense Command.  \u201cNORAD security requirements continue to place too significant of a cost on platforms whose manufacture and repair chains sit outside the United States (and) Canada,\u201d Airbus said in a statement.  Canadian Procurement Minister Carla Qualtrough said she respected the Airbus decision, adding Ottawa was determined there should be a level playing field.  \u201cThis included adapting the economic benefits approach to ensure the highest level of participation among suppliers,\u201d she said in emailed comments.  Canada has been trying unsuccessfully for almost a decade to purchase replacements for its aging F-18 fighters. The former Conservative administration said in 2010 it would buy 65 F-35 jets but later scrapped the decision, triggering years of delays and reviews.  Trudeau\u2019s Liberals took power in 2015 vowing not to buy the F-35 on the grounds that it was too costly, but have since softened their line.  \u201cJustin Trudeau has spent the past four years delaying and dithering on new fighter jets for Canada only to completely mismanage the competition process,\u201d said Conservative defense spokesman James Bezan.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said Ottawa was acting after the United States told Canada the regulations would exclude Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 fighter, the plane the Canadian air force wants.  The complaint was the latest challenge for a trouble-plagued process that has dragged on for more than a decade.  Canada initially said bidders for the contract - worth between C$15 billion and C$19 billion ($11.1 billion to $14.1 billion) - must commit to give Canadian businesses 100 percent of the value of the deal in economic benefits.  But that contradicts rules of the consortium that developed the F-35, a group to which Canada belongs. The U.S. military\u2019s F-35 office wrote to Ottawa last December saying it would not bid unless changes were made.  \u201cThe U.S. government told us they were unable to offer contractual guarantees of economic benefits,\u201d said the source.  Ottawa is therefore dropping the requirement that firms give a legally binding promise they would spend the value of the fighter contract in Canada.  \u201cA bidder that is not willing and able to sign a contract and guarantee them (the benefits) can still bid and still be competitive but they will get less points in the economic benefits category\u201d than firms that offer a watertight commitment, said the source.  The planes will be judged on capability, which makes up 60 percent of the points available, as well as price and benefits, which make up for 20 percent each. The final requirements for the jets are due out in July, said the source.  The policy change could prompt protests from Boeing Co, Airbus SE and Saab AB, the three other contenders. Industry sources have long predicted that Lockheed Martin\u2019s rivals could pull out if they felt Ottawa was tilting the race in favor of the F-35.  The source added that Canada had made changes that benefited the other firms. For example, Ottawa initially insisted the European planes be fully compliant with strict U.S. rules on exchanging secure data.  The rules now say European bidders need only outline how they planned to meet the U.S. security requirements.  Airbus, Saab and Lockheed declined to comment. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","181":"BERLIN, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Almost eight years after losing a historic U.S. Air Force tanker competition to rival Boeing Co , Europe\u2019s Airbus is teaming up with a new partner, top U.S. arms maker Lockheed Martin, to pursue billions of dollars of follow-on orders, sources familiar with the matter said.  Airbus and Lockheed signed an agreement in Madrid last week that marks the company\u2019s first major bid to secure a foothold in the huge U.S. military market since its failed 2012 bid to merge with Britain\u2019s BAE Systems and its large U.S. unit.  The agreement kicks off a rerun of an epic battle between the world largest planemakers - Airbus and Boeing - that lasted for nearly a decade and saw two former Boeing executives sent to federal prison for ethics violations.","182":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Defense has stopped accepting most deliveries of F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N because of a dispute over who will cover costs for fixing a production error, three people familiar with the matter said.  Lockheed confirmed on Wednesday that the Pentagon had halted deliveries of the jet over a contractual issue, but did not give further details.  Last year, the Pentagon stopped accepting F-35s for 30 days after discovering corrosion where panels were fastened to the airframe, an issue that affected more than 200 of the stealthy jets. Once a fix had been devised, the deliveries resumed, and Lockheed hit its target aircraft delivery numbers for 2017.  But deliveries were paused again over a dispute as to who will pay for what will likely be a complex logistical fix that could require technicians to travel widely to mend aircraft based around the world, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.  When the Pentagon stops taking delivery of F-35s, foreign customers can also be affected. So far at least two foreign governments have stopped accepting F-35s as a result of this issue, two of the sources said.  A Lockheed spokeswoman said on Wednesday: \u201cProduction on the F-35 program continues and we are confident we will meet our delivery target of 91 aircraft for 2018. While all work in our factories remains active, the F-35 Joint Program Office has temporarily suspended accepting aircraft until we reach an agreement on a contractual issue and we expect this to be resolved soon.\u201d  It was not clear when the suspension of deliveries began.  Lockheed Martin's logo is seen during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The fastening issue on the F-35 fleet was not affecting flights, nor was it a safety concern, the Pentagon said last year.  The delivery pause is the latest of several production issues that have arisen in the Pentagon\u2019s most expensive weapons program, and comes at a time when the administration of President Donald Trump has criticized the cost of the fighter.  In 2016, a fix for insulation problems in the fuel tanks and lines of the jets caused a slowdown in deliveries.  Shares of Lockheed erased a 2.7 percent gain on the day after Reuters reported the suspension. They closed flat at $339.44.  GOVERNMENT INSPECTION  At the heart of the dispute is the government\u2019s inspection of the planes during Lockheed\u2019s production, which failed to discover problems with the fastenings, the sources said. Because neither party caught the issue at the time each is pointing the finger at the other to pay for the fix.  Two jets were received by the Pentagon despite the suspension because of specific needs in the field, one of the people said.  During routine maintenance at Hill Air Force Base in Utah last year, the Air Force detected \u201ccorrosion exceeding technical limits,\u201d where the carbon fiber exterior panel is fastened to the aluminum airframe.  A lack of protective coating at the fastening point that would have prevented corrosion was identified as the primary problem, the Pentagon said at the time.  The F-35 business accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed\u2019s total revenue. During the third quarter, sales at Lockheed\u2019s aeronautics business increased 14 percent to $4.7 billion, led by higher sales of the F-35 and highlighting the program\u2019s importance to Lockheed\u2019s profitability.","183":"WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp said on Thursday it hit its 2018 target to deliver 91 F-35 fighter jets to the United States and its allies, as the defense contractor built 38 percent more jets this year.

After months of deliberation, the decision to buy 34 of the planes was announced at a government news conference.  Belgium joins a list of other European NATO allies, including Britain, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey, to take the American-made plane, which is also set to be the U.S. military\u2019s main fighter aircraft for decades to come.  \u201cWe have landed! This government is investing heavily in defense. With the purchase of F-35A fighter planes ... we ensure your safety and that of our military,\u201d Belgian Defence Minister Steven Vandeput said on Twitter during the news conference.  \u201cThe offer from the Americans was the best in all our seven evaluation criteria,\u201d he later told reporters.  The jets, which can avoid detection and tracking by enemy radars or heat sensors, aim to offer NATO allies technological superiority with additional capabilities such as the ability to disrupt enemy communications networks and navigation signals.  The pick makes Belgium the 12th country to choose the F-35, which comes in three variants - the F-35A conventional take-off and landing model, the F-35B, a short take-off or vertical landing version, and the F-35C, used aboard aircraft carriers.  Belgium has chosen the conventional version of the plane, with the first deliveries scheduled for 2023.  Vice Admiral Mat Winter, U.S. F-35 program chief, said the decision would further strengthen ties between the United States and Belgium and make it easier for the two countries\u2019 air forces to work together on future missions.  The decision is a setback for Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, who are behind the Eurofighter program, and also means the rejection of an informal French offer to sell Belgium the Rafale fighter built by Dassault Aviation AVMD.PA.  However, Britain's BAE Systems BAES.L is also a partner on the F-35 project.  Belgium\u2019s decision raises the stakes for Eurofighter in Germany, Switzerland and Finland, which also plan to buy new warplanes, industry executives said.  Eurofighter also sees good prospects in Canada, which was part of the initial F-35 partnership, but has not made a decision to buy the U.S. aircraft. Exact terms of the Canadian competition are due to be released next year.  CHEAPER THAN PROJECTED  Prime Minister Charles Michel\u2019s government said despite a strong desire to support European allies, the F-35 was cheaper for Belgium over the long term, coming in 600 million euros ($684 million) under what the government budgeted for.  The total price of the deal, including the jets, pilot training, hangars and upkeep until 2030 was worth 4 billion euros, Vandeput said, compared with the original budget of 4.6 billion euros.  Over the 40-year life of the aircraft, the deal will cost Belgium 12.4 billion euros, rather than the 15 billion euros first projected, he said.

REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt\/File Photo  Belgium looks to have benefited from Lockheed Martin\u2019s strategy to reduce the cost of the jets as production has increased. U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized the F-35 program for delays and cost overruns.  Each plane is likely to cost Belgium around 76 million euros, slightly less than the amount paid by the Netherlands and Italy, according to Belgian newspaper Le Soir, citing a closed-door briefing by Belgian air force personnel to lawmakers on Wednesday, when the final decision was taken.  Michel also defended the decision to choose a U.S. company over European neighbors as a way to balance loyalties to the American-led NATO alliance and defense spending in Europe.  \u201cWe are choosing cooperation with NATO and for European defense,\u201d Michel told the news conference. He said money saved on the F-35 would be used for other defense projects.  With defense spending just under 0.9 percent of economic output on defense in 2017, Belgium is one of the worst performers in trying to meet a NATO target of 2 percent by 2024, which Trump says is already too low and should be at least 3 percent.

Mandatory credit Kyodo\/via REUTERS  Fitted with powerful Lockheed Martin Corp radars, Japan\u2019s Aegis Ashore systems are meant to intercept missile strikes from North Korea and elsewhere. In June, defence minister Taro Kono suspended plans for two land sites, which would have cost about $2 billion to construct, citing the possibility that booster rockets could fall on local residents.  Instead, he suggested installing the systems on sea platforms or ships.  Defence ministry officials are considering several proposals, including putting Aegis on platforms resembling oil rigs, or on converted merchant ships or naval vessels. Kono\u2019s successor, Nobuo Kishi, has said he will make a decision on the future of Aegis Ashore by year end.  Delays and higher costs could rekindle support for an onshore plan, as Japan\u2019s public finances are strained by debt exacerbated by massive coronavirus economic aid spending.  A defence ministry official said he was unaware of the new cost and time estimates for missile defence at sea. The land-based Aegis Ashore batteries were scheduled to be operational in 2025.  Some of those proposals could cost more than $4 billion each, not including interceptor missiles and operating expenses, which would exceed those of land stations because of fuel, maintenance and larger crews, said the person familiar with the matter, who has seen estimates being discussed by defence ministry officials.  The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the plans.  A destroyer has about 300 sailors, about 10 times more people than needed for a land site, according to Japan\u2019s defence ministry.  Armed with interceptor missiles designed to hit warheads in space, Aegis Ashore\u2019s Lockheed Martin SPY-7 radar has at least three times the range of older Aegis radars already on Japanese warships.  \u201cWe are here to support whatever Japan needs, and in our mind, there is no option that is off the table,\u201d said Tom Rowden, the vice president responsible for Lockheed\u2019s overseas Rotary and Mission System business, including Aegis Ashore in Japan. \u201cOur main focus here is to give Japan the capability that they need to be able to defend their country.\u201d  In 2019, Japan listed China as its main security threat for the first time, pointing to Beijing\u2019s burgeoning defence spending and military manoeuvres. Japan has also said it is concerned about a resurgence in Russian activity around Japan.  Although Japan usually pays for big U.S.-built military projects through the U.S. government\u2019s Foreign Military Sales programme, it is buying SPY-7 directly from Lockheed and has paid half of the $300 million contract already.  The possibility that Aegis Ashore will be based at sea has spurred Raytheon Technologies Corp, which lost the contract to Lockheed in 2018, to promote its SPY-6 radar for Japan instead.  Defence ministry officials say they prefer the SPY-7 and are sticking with it. But some influential lawmakers from Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, such as former deputy defence minister and deputy foreign affairs minister Masahisa Sato, favour SPY-6 because the U.S. Navy plans to use it on new Aegis Ashore destroyers.","194":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators introduced a measure on Thursday aimed at blocking the transfer of Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to Turkey, a NATO ally and one of nine partner nations involved in producing the high-tech, radar-evading aircraft.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen  The bill, by Republicans James Lankford and Thom Tillis, and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, comes at a time of deteriorating relations between the United States and Turkey, which supported the fight against Islamic State but has become increasingly worried about U.S. backing for Kurdish fighters in north Syria.  The three senators, in introducing the bill, issued a statement expressing concern that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had embarked on a \u201cpath of reckless governance and disregard for the rule of law.\u201d  \u201cTurkey\u2019s strategic decisions regrettably fall more and more out of line with, and at times in contrast to, U.S. interests. These factors make the transfer of sensitive F-35 technology and cutting-edge capabilities to Erdogan\u2019s regime increasingly risky,\u201d Lankford said in the statement.  The Turkish embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Erdogan declared a state of emergency in Turkey following an attempted coup in July 2016. Since then, he has detained tens of thousands of people, cracked down on dissent and carried out purges in the military and bureaucracy. He charges that followers of a U.S.-based cleric were behind the coup attempt.  Erdogan has been a key U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State but sent troops into the Kurdish-dominated Afrin region of northwestern Syria earlier this year and threatened to quash U.S. plans for a local security force in northern Syria.  The three senators voiced concern about Turkey\u2019s detention of an American evangelical preacher, Andrew Brunson, a long-time resident of Turkey who was jailed during Erdogan\u2019s crackdown.  \u201cPresident Erdogan\u2019s choice to take hostages and imprison innocent Americans, to try to gain leverage over the United States, is egregious and unlawful,\u201d Shaheen said in the statement.  Turkey plans to buy more than 100 of the F-35 aircraft. Turkish companies have been involved in producing parts for the fighter, and Ankara is scheduled to begin receiving its first aircraft within a year.  The bill would restrict the transfer of F-35s to Turkey and limit Ankara from receiving intellectual property or technical data needed to maintain and support the fighters.  It would allow the U.S. president to waive the restrictions by certifying Turkey is not taking steps that would undermine NATO security and not wrongfully detaining U.S. citizens.","195":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Lockheed Martin-made F-35 fighter jet for Turkey arrived on Wednesday at a military training facility in Arizona, an Air Force official said on Thursday, amid a dispute over Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian missile defense system.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Earlier this week, Reuters reported that the United States halted delivery of equipment related to the stealth F-35 fighter aircraft to Turkey because of concern the NATO ally\u2019s planned purchase of the Russian system would compromise the security of the jet, the most advanced U.S. fighter aircraft.  A second jet is scheduled to arrive at Luke Air Force Base on Friday, the Air Force official said. Two Turkish F-35 jets are already at the base.  Pentagon spokesman Charlie Summers told reporters on Thursday: \u201cThe training (for pilots) will continue at Luke Air Force Base.\u201d  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has refused to back down from Ankara\u2019s planned purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system.  The United States and other NATO allies that own F-35s fear the radar on the system will learn how to spot and track the jet, making it less able to evade Russian weapons.  In an attempt to persuade Turkey to drop its plans to buy the S-400, the United States offered the pricier American-made Patriot anti-missile system in a discounted deal that expired at the end of March. Turkey has shown interest in the Patriot system, but not at the expense of abandoning the S-400.  Turkey has engaged with U.S. negotiators in recent days about buying the Patriot system, a person familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. The system is made by Raytheon Co.  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday that Turkey had proposed to the United States that they form a working group to determine that Russian S-400 missile defense systems do not pose a threat to U.S. or NATO military equipment.  On Thursday, the Pentagon said it was not considering a technical working group and that it was not necessary at this stage.","196":"(Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N, the Pentagon's No. 1 weapons supplier, on Tuesday posted a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit, driven by higher production of its F-35 fighter jets, and forecast sales above Wall Street estimates for next year.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company, whose products feature prominently in the $110 billion package of U.S. weapons deals for Saudi Arabia that President Trump announced in May 2017, said it expects about $500 million in sales to the Kingdom next year.  Saudi Arabia has come under fire over the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but Lockheed suggested that if U.S. weapons sales are derailed it would not hurt its 2019 profit outlook.  The company said it now expects 2018 net sales of $53 billion, slightly above the average analyst estimate of $52.6 billion. Lockheed increased its profit forecast to $17.50, better than estimates of $17.11 per share, according to Refinitiv data.  Lockheed predicted 2019 sales would increase by 5 percent to 6 percent from 2018, assuming \u201ckey programs\u201d like the F-35 fighter jet, designed to avoid detection, continue to be funded by the U.S. government.  Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said there was \u201cnot a huge amount of dependency\u201d on Saudi sales built into its 2019 and 2020 forecasts.  The 2019 sales outlook would put sales within a range of $55.6 billion to $56.2 billion, slightly ahead of the average estimate of $55.4 billion.  Lockheed\u2019s tax rate fell to 6.5 percent in the third quarter, helped by a larger-than-usual $1.5 billion contribution to its pension plan, boosting the bottom line. In the third quarter of 2017, before a U.S. corporate tax cut was enacted, Lockheed had a rate of 25.8 percent.  Net income rose to $1.47 billion, or $5.14 per share, in the third quarter, from $963 million, or $3.32 per share, a year earlier. Net sales rose to $14.31 billion from $12.34 billion a year earlier.  Analysts expected adjusted profit of $4.31 per share on revenue of $13.07 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates. Lockheed\u2019s EPS was $5.14.  Joseph DeNardi, an analyst at Stifel, said in a note that Lockheed\u2019s stealthy F-35 fighter jet program reported strong profit margins. F-35 production volume as well as payments for maintenance increased in the quarter.  Margins were also strong at Lockheed\u2019s Rotary and Mission Systems business unit, which makes ships and helicopters. Operating profit increased 40 percent from the same period a year ago, in part on better margins from missile launch systems sales.  The Bethesda, Maryland-based company said its order backlog increased to $109 billion at the end of the quarter from $105 billion three months ago.  Lockheed shares were down 2.7 percent at $318.02 as the broader market tumbled in part on concerns about slower corporate profit growth in 2019.","197":"WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - A Lockheed Martin-made F-35 fighter jet for Turkey arrived on Wednesday at the training facility at Luke Air Force base amid a dispute with the United States over its planned purchase of a Russian missile system, a Pentagon official said on Thursday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The deal marks the first major foray by Airbus into the huge U.S. military market since its failed 2012 bid to merge with Britain's BAE Systems BAES.L and its large U.S. business.  It also promises a sequel to an epic battle between the world\u2019s largest planemakers, that saw two former Boeing executives sent to federal prison for ethics violations.  Demand for tankers, which refuel combat aircraft during exercises or missions, has grown as armed forces stage more longer-range operations around the world.  The U.S. Air Force, which wants to ultimately replace its entire fleet of more than 400 tankers, is looking to meet growing demand for aerial refueling with possible fee-for-service arrangements, purchases of hundreds of additional aircraft, and the future development of a stealthy tanker.  Senior Airbus and Lockheed executives have agreed to explore all these opportunities, but are still working on details of their future cooperation, sources familiar with the matter said.  BACKBONE OF MOBILITY  Airbus, which previously worked with Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N, won a $35 billion contract in 2008 to build its MRTT tankers for the U.S. Air Force.  But the deal was overturned amid political pressure and the U.S. Air Force re-ran the competition, which Boeing ultimately won, landing a $49 billion contract in 2011 to build 179 of its 767-based tankers.  Boeing had hoped this would lead to further orders but it has struggled with the KC-46A program, missing deadlines and racking up some $3 billion in additional costs.  Todd Blecher, a Boeing spokesman, told Reuters it is working with the U.S. Air Force to deliver the first tanker before the end of the year and the new aircraft would be \u201cthe backbone of global mobility for generations to come\u201d.  But Airbus and Lockheed now hope to win orders for the A330-based Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT), and eventually design work on a next-generation tanker.  \u201cWe will be well-positioned to provide the United States Air Force with the advanced refueling solutions needed to meet 21st century security challenges,\u201d Lockheed Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said in a statement.  Airbus is banking on the success of the MRTT, which has been selected by 12 countries, including Australia, Britain and South Korea and is already refueling or capable of refueling most major U.S. combat jets, including the F-35 fighter.  Lockheed, builder of the F-35 and the C-130J transport plane that can also be used as a tanker, will give Airbus a strong partner for future U.S. bids, the companies said.

REUTERS\/Tim Kelly\/File Photo  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N said on Thursday it has reached its 2018 target to deliver 91 F-35 fighter jets to the United States and its allies, as the defense contractor built 38 percent more jets this year.  The F-35 accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed\u2019s total revenue. During the third quarter, F-35 production volume and payments for maintenance increased in the quarter.  The cost of the most common variation of the jet, the F-35A, is now $89.2 million after the most recent round of contract negotiations announced in September.  Lockheed Martin said that in 2019 it aims to deliver more than 130 F-35s representing a 40 percent increase in production over 2018. The Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker is aiming for annual production to more than 160 jets in 2023.  In November, Lockheed received $6 billion in funding toward a multiyear commitment on a batch of 255 jets from the United States and its allies.  This year, more international customers have signed on to buy the jet. In October, Belgium said it chose the F-35 over the Eurofighter Typhoon to replace its aging F-16s in a 4 billion euro ($4.55 billion) deal.  Other U.S. allies have been eyeing a purchase of the stealthy jet. Potential new customers include Finland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates.  Despite the consistent growth, the F-35 has been widely criticized for being too expensive, including by U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials, who have also pointed to numerous production delays and cost overruns.

The cost of the fix was $119 million, people familiar with the situation had previously told Reuters.  The Pentagon had stopped accepting the jets on March 29, the Pentagon\u2019s F-35 Joint Program office told Reuters in a statement. The dispute was over responsibility for paying to fix corrosion related to an error discovered in the second half of 2017.  The military, U.S. allies that own F-35s and Lockheed Martin are making the necessary repairs to all aircraft, the Pentagon\u2019s office in charge of the fighter program said in the statement.  When the Pentagon stopped taking delivery of F-35s, foreign customers also were affected. At least two foreign governments, Australia and Norway, had their jets caught up in the acceptance pause.  The majority of aircraft will be repaired within two years, the statement said.  Lockheed shares added to gains after the news and closed up 2 percent at $317.71.  Last year, the Pentagon stopped accepting F-35s for 30 daysafter discovering corrosion where panels were fastened to theairframe, an issue that affected more than 200 of the stealthyjets.  During routine maintenance at Hill Air Force Base in Utah last year, the Air Force detected \u201ccorrosion exceeding technical limits\u201d where the carbon fiber exterior panel is fastened to the aluminum airframe.  Once a fix had been devised, the deliveries resumed andLockheed hit its target aircraft delivery numbers for 2017.  A lack of protective coating at the fastening point thatwould have prevented corrosion was identified as the primaryproblem, the Pentagon said at the time.  The fastening issue on the F-35 fleet did not affect flights, nor was it a safety concern, the Pentagon said last year.  On Monday, Lockheed said an agreement had been reached with the Pentagon, adding that it expected to hit its F-35 delivery target of 91 aircraft for 2018.  The pause was the latest production issue that has arisen in the Pentagon\u2019s most expensive weapons program. In 2016, a fix for insulation problems in the fuel tanks and lines of the jets caused a slowdown in deliveries.","204":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is set to give final approval to a $2.6 billion deal for military helicopters from U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin ahead of a visit by U.S. President Donald Trump this month, defense and industry sources said.

India\u2019s defense purchases from the United States have reached $17 billion since 2007 as it has pivoted away from traditional supplier Russia, looking to modernize its military and narrow the gap with China.  Modi\u2019s cabinet committee on security is expected to clear the purchase of 24 MH-60R Seahawk helicopters for the Indian navy in the next two weeks, a defense official and an industry source briefed on the matter separately told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s a government-to-government deal, it is close,\u201d said the industry source.  To cut short lengthy negotiations between Lockheed and the Indian government, the helicopters that will be deployed on India\u2019s warships will be bought through the U.S. foreign military sales route, under which the two governments will agree details of the deal.  Trump will visit India Feb. 24-25, the White House said on Monday, his first official trip to the country.  Both countries are separately working on a limited trade agreement ahead of the trip, after earlier imposing tit-for-tat tariffs on each other\u2019s imports.  Trump has called India the \u201ctariff king of the world\u201d but the Modi government has been trying to address some of his concerns.  Trade officials have pointed to large-scale U.S. arms purchases, from surveillance planes to Apache and Chinook helicopters, as proof of India\u2019s willingness to tighten strategic ties.  On Monday, the U.S. State Department said it had approved an Indian request for an Integrated Air Defense Weapon System for an estimated cost of $1.87 billion, which would further strengthen the two countries\u2019 defense ties.  The two sides are expected to move forward on the deal over the year.  The multirole helicopters from Lockheed will be equipped with Hellfire missiles and torpedoes, and are meant to help the Indian navy track submarines in the Indian Ocean, where China is expanding its presence.  Many of India\u2019s warships are without any helicopters because of years of underfunding, and the navy had sought their acquisition as a top priority.  The government outlined only a modest rise in its 2020\/21 defense spending to $73.65 billion in the budget on Feb. 1, of which a part will go toward making a down payment on the helicopter purchase, a defense official said.  \u201cWe expect a positive announcement soon on the helicopters,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of service rules. \u201cThere are limited resources, but there is an allocation.\u201d  The U.S. State Department approved the sale of the choppers to India last year along with radars, torpedoes and 10 AGM-114 Hellfire missiles.  The clearance came after the Trump administration rolled out a new \u201cBuy American\u201d plan in 2018 that had relaxed restrictions on sales, saying it would bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home.  The United States has also offered India the armed version of Guardian drones that were originally authorized for sale as unarmed for surveillance purposes, the first such approval for a country outside the NATO alliance.  India plans to buy 30 of these unmanned aircraft for surveillance of the Indian Ocean, at a cost estimated to be about $2.5 billion, from General Atomics.  However, the defense official said the deal is unlikely immediately because of lack of funds.","205":"Jan 29 (Reuters) - Pentagon\u2019s No.1 weapons supplier Lockheed Martin Corp, reported a quarterly profit on Tuesday, compared with a year-ago loss, lifted by demand for its F-35 fighter jets.

FILE PHOTO: A Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II aircraft takes part in flying display during the 52nd Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France, June 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Pascal Rossignol\/File Photo  The Pentagon said over three years the agreement will be worth $34 billion for 478 F-35 fighter jets. It is preliminary and a final deal is expected to be sealed in August for the 12th batch of jets, one of the most expensive aircraft ever produced.  The preliminary agreement details the first year, and lays out agreed upon options for two additional years. The options are there because official purchases cannot be made until the U.S. Congress approves an annual budget for those years.  This year\u2019s agreement will lower the cost of each F-35A, the most common version of the aircraft, to $81.35 million, Under Secretary of Defense Ellen Lord said, down from $89.2 million under a deal inked in August 2018.  Under the options covering the second and third years of the purchase, the price of each jet will drop below $80 million, Lord said. In those later years production would be around 160 jets per year.  The F-35 program has long aimed at growing the fleet to more than 3,000 jets and bringing the unit price of the F-35A below $80 million through efficiencies gained by ordering larger quantifies.  \u201cI am proud to state that this agreement has achieved an estimated 8.8% savings from Lot 11 to Lot 12 F-35A\u2019s, and an estimated average of 15%\u201d reduction across all variants from Lot 11 to Lot 14, Lord said in the statement. That savings exceeded expectations in a RAND Corp study.  \u201cThe unit price for all three F-35 variants was reduced and the agreement will include an F-35A unit cost below $80 million in Lot 13, exceeding the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin\u2019s long-standing cost reduction commitment earlier than planned,\u201d the Lockheed Martin F-35 program general manager Greg Ulmer said in a statement.  While being a major part of Lockheed\u2019s revenue, the F-35 has recently been holding competitions to find less expensive subcontractors to help control costs.  The new pricing could encourage more foreign customers to join the F-35 program. Lockheed executives have said that any country with an F-16 jet, the predecessor to the F-35, is a potential customer. This could put the market size at about 4000 jets, Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson recently told an investor conference.

Lockheed is bidding for a contract - estimated at more than $15 billion - to supply the Indian air force with 114 combat planes, which must be all manufactured locally under Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s flagship Make in India programme.  However, Vivek Lall, vice president of strategy and business development at Lockheed, said the proposed Indian production of the F-16 wings would not be contingent upon the company winning the order for the planes.  \u201cProducing F-16 wings in India will strengthen Lockheed Martin\u2019 strategic partnership with Tata and support Make in India,\u201d the company said in a statement.  Modi has been pushing for local manufacturing that will provide jobs and also end the military\u2019s dependence on imports.  Lockheed\u2019s announcement came just days ahead of top level talks between the United States and India aimed at expanding defence ties.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will meet with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.  Boeing has pitched its F\/A-18 Super Hornet for the Indian contract as well as Sweden\u2019s Saab with its Gripen fighter. France\u2019s Dassault Systemes SE\u2019s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also in the fray.  Lall said Lockheed had offered to make India its sole F-16 production facility that would supply the Indian military but also other countries. \u201cIf India buys the F-16 then it becomes the centre of manufacturing for the global market,\u201d he said.  Lall said the company planned to begin production of the F-16 wings in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad from 2020. He said these were being produced at a facility in Israel and would not impact any jobs in the United States.  The Israeli centre will continue to be involved in other production, he said. \u201cAll F-16 wings globally are to be built in the Hyderabad facility,\u201d he said.","211":"FILE PHOTO: Lockheed Martin's logo is seen in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  For instance, the company redesigned a wrench after a data-driven analysis of repairs on the CH-53E heavy-lift helicopter revealed that mechanics were damaging the swash plate part of the rotor if they slipped while tightening bolts.  \u201cWe went to the assistant secretary of the Navy and showed him a wrench.

Lockheed was also beginning to use the same data-crunching algorithms to study data from its F-35 stealth fighter jet, he said.  Sikorsky\u2019s new CH-53K King Stallion made its international flying debut at the air show on Wednesday, undeterred by a sudden rainstorm, and will perform a more ambitious flying program on Thursday.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel got a chance to see both helicopters on the tarmac during a visit to open the air show on Wednesday, but the rain prevented her from clambering around inside the planes as initially planned.  Sikorsky said it leased the aircraft backed from the U.S. Marine Corps, shipped it to Germany in a C-17 transport plane, and has been flying it successfully for nearly a month.  The CH-53K will compete against Boeing Co's smaller BA.N twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook helicopter in a German military competition valued at around 4 billion euros.  Both companies have assembled industrial teams in Germany to build parts and service the planes if they win the bids.  The defense ministry expects to release a formal request for proposals in the second half of 2018, with a contract award due in mid-2020, for deliveries to start in 2023.  Schultz said Sikorsky\u2019s approach to building helicopters, including building all its own transmissions, coupled with data analytics and other tools, had helped it boost readiness rates to well above 90 percent, a key selling point.  He said Sikorsky also remained in discussions with Israel, which is also considering buying the CH-53K helicopter for its military.  Nathalie Previte, Sikorsky vice president for strategy and business development, said a third country had requested a classified briefing on the helicopter from the U.S. government, but declined to identify it.","213":"Marillyn Hewson, Chairman, President and CEO, Lockheed Martin Corporation, speaks at the 2019 Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., April 29, 2019.

Croatia wanted to buy 12 used F-16 fighter jets from Israel, but it fell through after Israel said here in 2019 it could not get approval from the United States for the sale.  Other international customers for the fifth-generation F-35 include Canada, Finland, and Switzerland, which are running competitions for a future jet purchase. Additional customer prospects for Lockheed\u2019s F-35 include Greece, Spain, Eastern European and Middle Eastern countries, Ulmer said in a media conference call.

REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  Japan plans to buy two Aegis Ashore batteries to be deployed in 2023 in an upgrade of its missile defenses against the arsenals of North Korea and China. The purchase could also help ease trade friction with Washington.  Reuters reported last week that the candidates for the radar system were Raytheon Co\u2019s SPY-6 and a version of Lockheed Martin Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR).  The decision on the radar supplier means that Japan can add the purchase to a defense budget proposal slated for release in August, three sources with knowledge of the plan told Reuters previously. They also spoke on condition of anonymity.  The two Aegis Ashore sites will likely cost at least twice as much as Japan\u2019s initial estimate of $2 billion, the sources said. President Donald Trump has urged Tokyo to buy more U.S. military equipment and other goods to help balance a trade deficit with Japan.  Japan\u2019s trade surplus with the United States in May fell 17.3 percent year-on-year to 340.7 billion yen ($3.07 billion), the lowest level since January 2013 as Japan increased imports of U.S. coal and aircraft.  Japan\u2019s latest budget proposal comes amid an easing of regional tensions after the June 12 summit in Singapore between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  At the meeting, Kim reiterated a pledge to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, although short of the complete, verifiable and irreversible abandonment of nuclear weapons sought by Japan, the U.S. and other countries.  Trump agreed to halt joint drills with the South Korean military during the denuclearization negotiations with Pyongyang.  Japanese military planners still see North Korea as an immediate danger. They also view China\u2019s growing military power as a long-term threat.  \u201cNorth Korea needs to show it is making concrete steps to abandon its nuclear and missile programs, and it has yet to do so,\u201d Japan\u2019s Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said at a press briefing on Tuesday.  He said no decision had been reached yet on the radar system for Aegis Ashore.  The Japanese defense official said that Lockheed\u2019s radar had been selected due to its search capabilities and because its lifecycle cost would be less than the Raytheon system.  Officials at Lockheed and Raytheon said they had yet to be officially notified about the result of the radar bid.","232":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin LMT.N will build wings for its F-16 combat plane in India with its local partner, Tata Advanced Systems Limited, an executive at the U.S. company said on Tuesday.

Lall said Lockheed had offered to make India its sole F-16 production facility that would supply the Indian military but also other countries. \u201cIf India buys the F-16 then it becomes the center of manufacturing for the global market,\u201d he said.  Lall said the company planned to begin production of the F-16 wings in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad from 2020. He said these were being produced at a facility in Israel and would not impact any jobs in the United States.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Shares of Lockheed rose 2.5% in premarket trading, after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and raised its 2020 revenue outlook to a range of $62.75 billion to $64.25 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of about $62.61 billion.  U.S.-Iran tensions over the past few months have helped build momentum for defense purchases, benefiting Lockheed and other weapons makers, analysts have said. One business unit, Missiles and Fire Control, saw sales up 14% in the quarter on higher volume for higher tactical and strike missiles.  Shares of the company rose about 4.5% to a record high on Jan 3 after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.  Defense contractors General Dynamics GD.N, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp NOC.N are expected to outperform this year, in line with the sector's general pattern during presidential election years.  During the quarter the Pentagon announced pricing details for its agreement with Lockheed that lowers the cost of the F-35A jets it plans to purchase through 2022 by 12.7%.  Lockheed\u2019s Aeronautics division, which makes the F-35, saw quarterly sales up 9% in the quarter to $6.3 billion.  The F-35 comes in three configurations, the A-model for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. allies; a F-35 B-model which can handle short takeoffs and vertical landings; and carrier-variant F-35C jets for the U.S. Navy.  Under the agreement, which began as a handshake in June, the F-35A, the most common version of the aircraft, will each cost $82.4 million in 2020, $79.17 million in 2021 and $77.9 million in 2022.  The agreement means the U.S. government and allies plan to purchase 478 F-35 fighter jets at a cost of $34 billion over the three years. Because Congress has yet to approve budgets for future years agreement represented pricing \u201coptions\u201d for the U.S..  The F-35 program, which makes up about 25% of Lockheed\u2019s annual revenue, delivered a total of 134 of the stealthy jets in 2019 and aims to deliver 141 F-35s in 2020.  Lockheed said it expects 2020 earnings per share to be in the range of $23.65 per share to $23.95 per share, below analysts\u2019 expectation of $24.30 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In the past Lockheed has begun the year with a modest forecast and outperforms as the year goes on.  Net earnings rose to $1.5 billion, or $5.29 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.25 billion, or $4.39 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, had expected the company to post a profit of $5.03 per share.  Net sales rose 10.2% to $15.88 billion, below analysts\u2019 expectation of $15.29 billion.  The company said its tax rate was 18.2% and 14% in the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2019, compared to 15.5% and 13.6% in the quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2018.","234":"(Reuters) - Defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N said on Friday it plans to increase the workforce at its approximately 300-person Milwaukee facility by more than 15% this year.

The United States consults with Israel on proposed sales of advanced arms to other countries in the region, under a principle of preserving Israel\u2019s \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d. Some such sales have gone ahead over Israeli objections.  Asked whether Israel would oppose an F-35 sale to Qatar, Cohen told Army Radio: \u201cThe answer is yes. Our security and military superiority in the region are the most significant things for us. Our region has still not turned into Switzerland.\u201d  Qatar\u2019s F-35 request follows an August deal in which Washington agreed to consider giving the United Arab Emirates approval to buy the jets in a side deal to a U.S.-brokered agreement normalising ties between Israel and that Gulf power.  Israel, which has bought and deployed the F-35, has voiced discomfort at the prospect of UAE also getting the warplane - though the two countries have played up shared concerns about threats from Iran.  Qatar, by contrast, maintains ties with Iran as well as with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, against which Israel has fought three wars in Gaza.  But Qatar has also funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Gaza, payouts Israel has facilitated in hope of heading off another conflict in the impoverished enclave.  That intervention has prompted some Israeli officials to predict Qatar might also establish formal ties with Israel. Doha has ruled this out in the absence of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.","236":"NEW DELHI, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin offered India a new combat jet, F-21, on Wednesday to be made locally, in a bid to win a large military order worth over $15 billion.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  MBDA\u2019s German unit and Lockheed formed a 60-40 joint venture in March to press ahead with the new TLVS defense system after years of negotiations with the German defense ministry.  The German defense ministry announced in 2015 that it had chosen the Medium Extended Air Defence System (MEADS) -- developed with $4 billion in funding from Germany, Italy and the United States -- over Raytheon Co's RTN.N Patriot system.  TLVS is the German version of MEADS.  However, the two sides have been struggling to work out the details and terms of the program ever since.  Frank St. John, who took over as executive vice president of Lockheed\u2019s Missiles and Fire Control division in January, told Reuters the process had taken longer than expected but he was feeling more confident and enthusiastic now.  \u201cThe goal is to be on contract by the end of this year, but the process will take as long as required,\u201d St. John said in an interview at the ILA Berlin Air Show, where the companies are displaying the mobile air defense system.  Progress on the German deal could also trigger more interest by other countries in the system, which will offer the ability to knit together a variety of different systems, including Patriot, St. John said.  Lockheed builds the PAC-3 Missile Enhancement Segment (MSE) missiles used by the Patriot system.  \u201cThe good thing about TLVS is, because of the open architecture, you can plug in some legacy capabilities and then phase those out as you plug in new capabilities,\u201d he said.  Thomas Gottschild, managing director of the German unit of MBDA, told a news conference the team was \"in the final straight\" on the project but did not predict when a contract would be signed. MBDA is jointly owned by Airbus Group AIR.PA, Britain's BAE Systems BAES.L and Italy's Leonardo LDOF.MI.  St. John said the German ministry was expected to issue a final request for proposals to the joint venture in about two weeks, with a final response to be submitted in 60 days.  That would be followed by a \u201chopefully short negotiation process,\u201d and a contract signing at the end of this year or early next, he said. Years of discussion and negotiation meant the technical issues were now well understood.  The TLVS program was initially slated to cost about 4 billion euros ($4.87 billion), but sources familiar with the proposal have said the final cost is likely to be several billion euros higher.  The MEADS system was developed jointly by Germany, Italy and the United States, though the U.S. Army later decided not to buy the system for its own use.
