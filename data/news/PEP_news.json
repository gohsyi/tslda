FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Pepsi are pictured at a grocery store in Pasadena, California, U.S., July 11, 2017. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD  The soft drink and snack maker forecast earnings per share would rise 6% in 2020, less than Wall Street had expected and predicted slower organic revenue growth than last year.  PepsiCo shares were last down 0.7% after dipping as much as nearly 2% in early trade, but its finance chief described the earnings target as a \u201cgood, balanced number.\u201d  \u201cIt gives us the room and the ability to continue to invest back in the business,\u201d Chief Financial Officer told Reuters.  Analysts said the cautious forecasts should come as no surprise.  \u201cPepsiCo typically starts the year with conservative guidance, setting up for modest beats and raises,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein said.  Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta has been largely focusing on new launches, which include healthy snacks and beverages, and higher investments in marketing to drive sales.  Sugary drinks and salty snacks have been shunned for long on health concerns, but smaller soda servings and greater choice of healthy on-the-go snacks have rejuvenated that demand.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the consumer continue to go back to our classics... Doritos and Cheetos and Tostitos,\u201d Laguarta told analysts.  Rival Coca-Cola Co KO.N also beat forecasts on growing demand for its trademark soda.  PepsiCo said its North American beverage unit grew the fastest in four years in 2019, reflecting strong demand for its trademark Pepsi soda and Pepsi Zero Sugar. Sales in the unit rose 4% in the fourth quarter.  Snacks sales, under its Frito-Lay North America segment, gained 3%, powered by Lays, Doritos and premium brands such as Bare and Off the Eaten Path. Organic revenue, which strips out currency and acquisition effects, grew 4.3%.  Johnston said the coronavirus outbreak would have little impact on its business in China, which accounts for less than 2% of the group\u2019s worldwide sales and added that five of PepsiCo\u2019s six plants in China were already open.  For 2020, PepsiCo forecast core earnings of $5.88 per share, below $5.95 expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It sees organic revenue up 4% this year after a 4.5% rise in 2019.  Net revenue rose 5.7% to $20.64 billion in the fourth quarter, beating the estimate of $20.27 billion. It earned $1.45 per share on an adjusted basis, a cent above market forecasts.","4":"JERUSALEM\/LONDON (Reuters) - PepsiCo PEP.O will buy carbonated drink-machine maker SodaStream SODA.TASODA.O for $3.2 billion as it battles Coca-Cola KO.N for an edge in the health-conscious beverage market.  Founded in Britain in 1903, SodaStream was a coveted device in British kitchens in the 1970s and 80s, allowing people to create fizzy drinks by adding flavored syrups to carbonated tap water, but its popularity faded as bottled sodas became cheaper.  More recently, the Israel-based company reinvented itself as a fizzy water company popular with younger and more health- and environmentally-conscious consumers, who want to drink less soda and use fewer plastic bottles.  \u201cWith sugary carbonates and juices struggling and no turnaround in sight, mitigating the losses through newer and healthier products will be essential for PepsiCo,\u201d said Euromonitor International analyst Matthew Barry.  Euromonitor says bottled water sales saw 6.2 percent compound annual growth in the five years to 2017, while carbonated soft drinks sales were flat.  The deal announced on Monday may be the last for PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi, who will hand over to Ramon Laguarta later this year.  In 12 years as CEO, Nooyi sought to expand PepsiCo\u2019s offering of healthier food and drinks. It agreed to buy Bare Foods in May and KeVita drinks in late 2016.  PepsiCo will pay $144 per share in cash, representing a 10.9 percent premium to Friday\u2019s closing price of SodaStream\u2019s U.S.-listed stock and a 32 percent premium to its 30-day average.  SodaStream\u2019s shares were up 9 percent in Tel Aviv, while its U.S.-listed shares were up nearly 10 percent. PepsiCo shares were up only 0.3 percent as analysts questioned whether the deal would move the needle for PepsiCo\u2019s struggling drinks business.  FILE PHOTO: Employees pack boxes of the SodaStream product at the factory in the West Bank Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim January 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Ammar Awad  \u201cWe remain concerned about challenges facing PepsiCo\u2019s core business and, as such, continue to see limited upside for PepsiCo in the near term,\u201d Wells Fargo analysts said.  They also noted that the price tag implied a multiple of 33 times forward earnings based on consensus estimates, although a source familiar with the matter said that conventional methods of valuing deals were not best in this instance.  FINALLY READY  PepsiCo said SodaStream complements its water business, which includes Aquafina and smaller brands Bubly and Lifewtr. It is attractive because it is growing fast and allows people to customize their drinks, incoming CEO Ramon Laguarta said.  \u201cClearly, this is all about growth,\u201d Laguarta said, noting that SodaStream would benefit from PepsiCo\u2019s resources in research and development, design and distribution.  Laguarta said PepsiCo had held talks with SodaStream several times in the past but wanted to make sure its business was solid before doing a deal.  A turnaround at SodaStream over the last two years was helped by activist hedge fund manager Teleios Capital Partners, which nominated an external candidate to the board in 2016.  Adam Epstein, co-founder of Teleios, which is the fourth-largest shareholder in SodaStream, said the deal \u201crepresents an excellent outcome for all shareholders\u201d.  SodaStream\u2019s performance improved following a shift in strategy that put more emphasis on sparkling water over soda, and cultivating a loyal user base that continues to use the device after purchasing it.  \u201cNow we are ready to make this commitment,\u201d Laguarta said.  SodaStream\u2019s shares have jumped 85 percent this year after a 78 percent increase in 2017. The U.S. shares closed on Friday close to $130, up from $16.31 at the end of 2015.  In the latest second quarter, revenue grew 31 percent, driven by growth in places including Germany and the United States, while net profit rose nearly 82 percent.  Still, the notion of creating soft drinks at home has had limited success to date.  Coca-Cola and Keurig Green Mountain forged a partnership in 2015 to market a counter-top cold-drinks machine, but pulled the plug the following year after it failed to take off.  It remains to be seen what Keurig Dr Pepper KDP.N will do in the space following the merger last month of coffee company Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple.  New York-based PepsiCo will fund the deal with cash on hand and has committed to keep SodaStream in Israel for at least 15 years.  PepsiCo said the transaction, unanimously approved by the boards of both firms, was expected to close by January 2019.  PepsiCo was advised by Goldman Sachs and Centerview, while SodaStream was advised by Perella Weinberg Partners.","5":"FILE PHOTO: Roberto Azevedo, Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), attends a news conference after a General Council meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, July 23, 2020.

The next WTO chief would broker international trade talks amid worsening economic tensions between the United States and China, increased protectionism sparked by the coronavirus pandemic and pressure to reform global trading rules..  U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has effectively shut down the WTO\u2019s Appellate Body, which issues final settlements for trade disputes, by blocking judicial appointments.

FILE PHOTO: Products produced by Reckitt Benckiser; Vanish, Finish, Dettol and Harpic, are seen in London, Britain February 12, 2008. REUTERS\/Stephen Hird\/File Photo  Narasimhan, PepsiCo\u2019s global chief commercial officer, is the first external candidate to be appointed as CEO at Reckitt since the maker of Durex condoms, Nurofen tablets and Dettol cleaners was formed in 1999.  The 52-year-old takes over as CEO on Sept. 1, replacing Rakesh Kapoor, 60, who has led Reckitt for more than eight years and said in January he would retire this year.  Analysts welcomed the appointment, saying the new CEO would inject a fresh perspective to a company facing industrywide challenges to growth, though some said it raised doubts about the fate of Reckitt\u2019s restructuring plan.  The appointment is the latest in a series of external hirings as major consumer goods groups look to make up ground lost to smaller brands that have done a better job selling online and connecting with millennials on social media, while also facing investor pressure to boost efficiency.  Analysts had tipped Reckitt\u2019s health division operations chief Aditya Sehgal and hygiene home president Rob de Groot as potential internal successors to Kapoor.  In the end, Narasimhan\u2019s experience running large scale consumer businesses in developed and emerging markets helped him beat out 60 candidates reviewed for the job, Reckitt Benckiser Chairman Chris Sinclair told Reuters.  \u201cHe has got great perspective, but first and foremost we saw him as a consumerist and a consumer marketer and that\u2019s what set him apart,\u201d Sinclair said.  At PepsiCo, the chief commercial officer position held by Narasimhan will now be filled by the company\u2019s Greater China CEO Ram Krishnan, the U.S. drinks maker said.  As well as industry challenges, Reckitt has faced company-specific setbacks in recent years, including a safety scandal in South Korea, a failed product launch and a cyber attack.  Kapoor launched a restructuring plan, dubbed RB 2.0, to split the group into two business units \u2013 one for health and one for hygiene and home products - under the same parent company.  Reckitt said on Wednesday Narasimhan would be charged with delivering the plan, due to be completed in 2020, but some analysts suggested he might have other ideas.  \u201cThe appointment of a new, external CEO is bound to raise questions regarding the timing of the end of the group\u2019s RB 2.0 plan and whether it will ultimately lead to a split of the company,\u201d Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt said.  Sinclair, however, said Reckitt was on track to complete the 2.0 program by mid or late 2020 and that Narasimhan agreed with the plan.  \u2018FRESH PERSPECTIVE\u2019  Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo questioned why a company already smaller than rivals Procter & Gamble and Unilever wanted to \u201cdescale itself\u201d, which could hobble its ability to compete in emerging markets.  Reckitt shares were up 1.6% in afternoon trading on the London Stock Exchange.  At least three analysts welcomed Narasimhan\u2019s appointment.  \u201cNarasimhan\u2019s strategic and leadership background make him a strong fit for Reckitt. We believe he will bring a fresh perspective to both the business and to investors,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Taylor wrote in a note.  Narasimhan led Strategy, Global Category Groups and Global R&D in his capacity as Chief Commercial Officer at PepsiCo.  Prior to that, he headed the beverage maker\u2019s Latin America, Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa operations, managing annual sales of 14.5 billion pounds ($18.5 billion) - more than the total annual sales of Reckitt Benckiser. At one time he was also chief financial officer of the group\u2019s Americas Foods business.  Narasimhan studied mechanical engineering in India before moving to the United States for an MBA degree. Before joining PepsiCo, he worked at consultants McKinsey for two decades, where he advised on large consumer and healthcare deals.","7":"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc has joined rival Coca-Cola in predicting revenue growth in 2021, saying on Thursday it expects pre-pandemic lifestyles to resume as economies reopen and COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out.  The company has navigated the health crisis better than Coca-Cola as it relies more on grocery and retail channels from where consumers stockpiled snacks and beverages.  Pepsi said its fourth-quarter revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, topping Wall Street expectations, as people munched Tostitos and Cheetos and gulped down Gatorade while stuck at home during a second wave of coronavirus lockdowns.  The increase in demand had last year led the company to launch a direct-to-consumer website that offered special flavors and specialized bundles of its top selling products.  \u201cWe have figured how to do well in this environment,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told Reuters, adding that most of the growth came from no-sugar, low-calorie and healthy options.  Still, revenue from the foodservice channel, which includes restaurants and vending machines, fell at a double-digit rate.  Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta said he expects consumers to return to certain pre-pandemic behaviors by the second half of 2021, but some changes such as increased online shopping and more remote work arrangements will likely be sustained.  The company expects a mid-single digit rise in annual organic revenue and a high-single digit increase in adjusted earnings.  \u201cPepsiCo\u2019s success has largely been driven by its portfolio strategy and focus on at-home consumption, which is helping the company outperform others in the category, especially in beverage,\u201d Kristen Groh, a managing partner at Publicis Sapient said.  Organic revenue for Frito-Lay North America rose 5%, while those at the North American beverage unit rose 5.5%.  Excluding items, it earned $1.47 per share, a cent above expectations, according Refinitiv IBES data.  PepsiCo\u2019s shares, which had gained nearly 9% last year to outperform Coca-Cola\u2019s 1% rise, were marginally down in early trading.","8":"Oct 1 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc forecast full-year profit above market expectations on Thursday, as consumers buy more of its snacks such as Doritos and Cheetos while staying indoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Pepsi are pictured at a grocery store in Pasadena, California, U.S., July 11, 2017. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni\/File Photo  The U.S. drinks and snack group said on Friday that Pioneer\u2019s product portfolio was complementary to its own and would help PepsiCo to expand in sub-Saharan Africa by adding manufacturing and distribution capabilities.  \u201cPioneer Foods forms an important part of our strategy to not only expand in South Africa, but further into sub-Saharan Africa as well,\u201d PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.  PepsiCo has offered 110 rand ($7.94) per Pioneer ordinary share in what would be its second largest deal since 2010, the companies said, with the news lifting the South African company\u2019s shares by 29.32% to more than 100 rand.  Shares in agribusiness investment company Zeder Investments ZEDJ.J, which holds Pioneer as part of its portfolio, also rose more than 22%.  \u201cIt\u2019s a vote of confidence in South Africa at a time when we really need it,\u201d Pioneer CEO Tertius Carstens told Reuters.  Food producers have struggled amid a slump in retail sales as consumers cut back and dry weather hit maize and other produce.  Pioneer, which uses maize in many of its products, reported a decline in half-year earnings in May, weighed down by shortages in the staple food.  \u201cIt\u2019s almost a signal to other overseas companies that we are open for business. If PepsiCo is willing to put money down it may lift sentiment of other foreign investors that might come looking at South Africa for bargains,\u201d said Greg Davies, equities trader at Cratos Capital.  Pioneer, whose brands include Weet-Bix cereal, Liqui Fruit juice and Sasko bread, is the latest consumer goods firm to be the target of a buyout after South Africa's Clover Industries CLRJ.J, which processes products including yogurt, beverages, and olive oil, began takeover talks with a consortium of companies called Milco SA last year.  Pioneer was in talks over a potential deal with \u201ca multinational organization\u201d in 2017, but that fell apart after South Africa\u2019s credit rating was cut to junk status.

A customer picks packets of Lay's potato chips at a shop in Ahmedabad, India, April 26, 2019. REUTERS\/Amit Dave  After suing four farmers for cultivating the FC5 potato variety, grown exclusively for PepsiCo\u2019s popular Lay\u2019s potato chips, the snack food and drinks maker on Friday said it wants to \u201camicably settle\u201d the issue.  The Purchase, New York-based company said the four farmers had to either sell their potatoes to PepsiCo or stop cultivating the FC5 potato variety. In return, PepsiCo said it would withdraw the suit filed against the farmers.  Ashwani Mahajan, who heads the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, said PepsiCo was \u201ccoercing\u201d the farmers by using legal action to force them to either sell their output to the company or to stop growing the FC5 potato variety at all.  SJM is the economic wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of Modi\u2019s BJP.  The dispute comes at a particularly sensitive time in India, which is about half-way through a 39-day staggered general election, in which its rural population still has a dominant voice. Modi and the BJP are seeking a second term and most political strategists think they will likely get it.  \u201cOther than coercing these farmers, PepsiCo is also intimidating and exploiting them. It is a clear case of a large MNC (multi national corporation) arm-twisting India\u2019s poor farmers,\u201d Mahajan told Reuters.  The federal government should step in to ensure that the farmers do not get harassed by PepsiCo, he said.  In response, a PepsiCo India spokesman said in a statement that it \u201chas already proposed to amicably settle with people who were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety.\u201d  Adding: \u201cThe company was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming program.\u201d  LESS MOISTURE  The FC5 variety has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips.  PepsiCo maintains that it developed the FC5 variety, which has a lower moisture content required to make snacks such as potato chips, and registered the trait in 2016.  In April, the company filed the lawsuit in a court in Ahmedabad, the business hub of Gujarat, requesting the court to retrain the four farmers from growing the FC5 variety. The court has asked the farmers not to use the variety until the next hearing scheduled for June 12.  The court also appointed an officer to examine the issue.  Other than filing the lawsuit, the company has also sought more than 10 million rupees ($142,840) each from the four farmers for alleged patent infringement.  PepsiCo shouldn\u2019t have gone to the court seeking heavy damages from farmers and a large corporation cannot be allowed to take on a handful of farmers, Mahajan said.  PepsiCo, which set up its first potato chips plant in India in 1989, supplies the FC5 potato variety to a group of farmers who in turn sell their produce to the company at a fixed price.  The state government of Gujarat has assured the farmers that it will help them, Nitin Patel, deputy chief minister said last week.  The opposition Congress party has also criticised PepsiCo for suing the farmers.  \u201cPepsi\u2019s decision to take Gujarat\u2019s potato grower farmers to court is ill-advised and brazenly wrong,\u201d senior Congress party leader Ahmed Patel, who comes from Gujarat, said in a Tweet.  The All India Kisan Sabha, or All India Farmers\u2019 Forum, has asked the Indian government to protect the farmers and also called for a boycott of Lay\u2019s chips and PepsiCo\u2019s other products.

The deal is also the latest move by PepsiCo\u2019s new chief executive officer, Ramon Laguarta, to reduce the company\u2019s dependence on its core sugary drinks and salty snacks, which have been increasingly shunned by health-conscious consumers.  Pepsi last July announced the acquisition of South African maker of cereal and fruit juice Pioneer Food Group, a few months after closing its $3.2 billion buyout of carbonated drink-machine maker SodaStream.  The Rockstar deal comes about two months after Coca-Cola, which owns a stake in Monster Beverage Co MNST.O, rolled out Coke-branded energy drinks in the United States, after launching in European markets last year.  PepsiCo, which already distributes Rockstar products in some markets, has a smaller presence in the energy space with its Mountain Dew Kickstart and Mountain Dew Game Fuel brands.  \u201cWith Rockstar underneath their wings, they\u2019ll have a family of energy drinks... they can coordinate the activity of an entire family of brands to meet a variety of needs of people,\u201d Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.  Laguarta has previously said the company was looking to expand its presence in the caffeinated beverages market, as longer working hours in the United States was helping increase demand for a quick energy fix.  Spending by consumers globally on energy drinks rose 9.9% to $12.72 billion for the year ended February 2020, compared with a 2.6% increase in sales of soft drinks to $26.96 billion, according to market research firm Nielsen.  Credit Suisse analyst Kaumil Gajrawala said PepsiCo\u2019s previous distribution deal with Rockstar limited its ability to participate more meaningfully in the energy drink category.  Founded in 2001, Las Vegas-based Rockstar initially aimed straight for major player Red Bull, by having a wider variety of flavors and selling cans twice as big for the same price.  However, the brand, whose bright yellow logo can be seen on extreme sports teams and at music festivals, still remains far behind the Austrian giant, as well as Monster.  Monster and Red Bull, together accounted for over a third of the global energy drink market in 2019, according to data from Euromonitor International.  Pepsi said the deal is not expected to impact its revenue or earnings per share in 2020.  The company\u2019s shares fell 2.9% in early trading in a weak New York market.","13":"Jan 13, 2021; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) gestures against the Oklahoma City Thunder during the second half at Chesapeake Energy Arena.

Plant-based meat alternatives, such as burger patties and sausages from Beyond Meat, have gained in popularity in recent years as curious health-conscious consumers look to broaden or shift from chicken, pork and beef-based diets.  Beyond Meat suffered a surprise loss in its last reported quarter as demand for its products at restaurants and grocery stores tapered after an initial surge at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The new partnership with PepsiCo will give the faux meat maker access to the beverage giant\u2019s distribution and marketing resources and allow it to expand into new product lines, Beyond Meat Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said.  PepsiCo, which apart from its namesake soda owns the Lays, Quaker and Gatorade brands, has also been looking to expand its portfolio of health-focused snacks and beverages.  \u201cPlant-based proteins represent an exciting growth opportunity for us, a new frontier in our efforts to build a more sustainable food system,\u201d said Ram Krishnan, PepsiCo global chief commercial officer.

The drinks giant also boosted advertising behind its trademark colas - Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero - to claw back market share from larger rival Coca-Cola Co Inc KO.N.  The increased expenses, along with rising aluminum and freight costs, hit PepsiCo\u2019s core operating profit margin, which fell to 17.6 percent. This was below the 18 percent that Macquarie Research analyst Caroline Levy expected.  PepsiCo\u2019s shares were down about 1 percent in late morning trading.  \u201cPeople are a bit worried about the margin compression in the North American Beverages division and even the Frito Lay business margins were a little bit below (our expectations),\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Amit Sharma said.

Overall, the company reported better-than-expected sales and profit, driven by emerging markets such as Mexico, India and China, where the company has introduced more products that cater to local tastes.  \u201cWe continued to see very strong operating performance from our international divisions, propelled by developing and emerging markets,\u201d Indra Nooyi said in a statement.

Full-year core earnings per share, however, will take a one percentage point hit due to the stronger dollar and will come in at $5.65 per share, down from the $5.70 forecast earlier.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  In 1990, PepsiCo introduced a new plastic bottle with 25% recycled content. By the end of that decade the company said its bottles no longer contained any recycled content.  Coca-Cola began making plastic bottles in the United States with 25% recycled plastic. It phased them out in 1994 due to high costs, officials said then.  Coke and Pepsi declined to comment on these past targets.  In 2008, Nestle, the company behind Nescafe coffee and Pure Life water, set a U.S.-wide goal to make water bottles out of 60% recycled plastic within a decade.  That\u2019s a goal the company says was never met. Nestle told Reuters it was an ambitious target that didn\u2019t get the groundswell of industry and policy-maker support it needed.  Coke and Nestle said it is hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources; Nestle said it often pays a premium for recycled material.  All three companies made new pledges in 2018:  - Coca-Cola set a target to hit 50% recycled content in all packaging by 2030. Currently, it\u2019s at 20%, and about half that rate for PET plastic, it told Reuters.  - PepsiCo said it would use 25% recycled content in packaging by 2025. It told Reuters in September it had reached 4% as of 2019.  - Nestle said it aims to use 15% recycled plastic in its packaging by 2025.

Under his watch, Pepsico has spent more on advertising, raised production capacity, while tweaking its supply chain to focus more on healthier snacks and beverages.  The changes have helped Pepsi respond better to shifting consumer preferences at a time when packaged food and beverage companies are battling high transportation and labor costs, while trying to find the right product mix to cater to a more health-conscious consumer.  The company has modified some of its recipes using healthier ingredients and is tinkering with product sizes and marketing to keep shoppers reaching for its products.

The Doritos chips and Tropicana juice maker said it would initially cut greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by 75% and by 40% in areas that are outside its own manufacturing processes and supply chain by 2030.  The food-and-beverage giant generated about 57 million metric tonnes of greenhhouse gas emissions globally in 2019, according to its latest annual sustainability report. Over the next nine years, it hopes to cut those emissions by just under half, or an absolute 26 million metric tonnes.  The Purchase, New York-based company said it would first focus on its agricultural supply system, which contributes to a third of PepsiCo\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, before turning to carbon sequestration.  PepsiCo will accelerate the use of smart irrigation systems, improve soil health and reduce deforestation, its chief sustainability officer, Jim Andrew, said in an interview with Reuters.  Other steps will include the use of renewable energy in its offices, recycled PET bottles for beverages, cutting back on business flights and creating sustainable packaging, the company said.

FILE PHOTO: A customer picks packets of Lay's potato chips at a shop in Ahmedabad, India, April 26, 2019. REUTERS\/Amit Dave  The U.S. snack food and drinks maker, which in addition to filing the lawsuit against the four farmers in April had sued five other potato growers, had said it wanted to settle the issue amicably.  \u201cAfter discussions with the government, the company has agreed to withdraw the cases against the farmers,\u201d a PepsiCo India spokesman said on Thursday, adding that this applied to all nine.  The decision comes at a particularly sensitive time in India, which is about halfway through a 39-day general election in which its rural population still has a dominant voice.  It also follows intervention by an influential Hindu nationalist group with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said PepsiCo was coercing the farmers.  Modi and the BJP are seeking a second term and most political strategists think they are likely to succeed.  PepsiCo, which did not disclose details of its consultations, had previously said the farmers must either sell their potatoes to the New York-based company or stop cultivating the FC5 variety. In return, PepsiCo would withdraw the lawsuit.  PepsiCo, which set up its first potato chips plant in India in 1989, supplies the FC5 variety to a group of farmers who in turn sell their produce to it at a fixed price.  Ashwani Mahajan, who heads the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), the economic wing of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which is the ideological parent of Modi\u2019s BJP, welcomed PepsiCo\u2019s move as a moral victory for Indian farmers.  \u201cMNCs (multi national corporations) need to understand that they must honour Indian laws,\u201d Mahajan said.  PepsiCo maintains that it developed the FC5 variety of potato, which has a reduced moisture content to make snacks such as potato chips, and registered the trait in 2016.  The April lawsuit was filed in Ahmedabad, the business hub of the western state of Gujarat, requesting that the court restrain the four farmers from growing the FC5 variety.  PepsiCo had also sought more than 10 million rupees ($143,000) each from the farmers.  The state government of Gujarat, ruled by Modi\u2019s BJP, had assured the farmers that it would help them while the opposition Congress party had also criticised PepsiCo\u2019s action.  \u201cThe company remains deeply committed to the thousands of farmers we work with across the country and towards ensuring adoption of best farming practices,\u201d the PepsiCo spokesman said.  PepsiCo, the second large U.S. company to face such patent issues in India, is keen \u201cto find a long term and amicable resolution\u201d of the issues involving seed protection, he said.

Turk, who said he began buying Senomyx shares in April 2012, also called on the company to name a shareholder representative to its board. Turk said he first asked for a board seat in April and after that was denied asked to be an unpaid board observer, which was also denied.  The flavors and ingredients space has been undergoing consolidation and growth as food multinationals, facing slowing growth for legacy food and drinks brands, adjust their offerings to appeal to new and healthier tastes.

The company's stock has declined since PepsiCo Inc PEP.N stopped a trial partnership involving the use of Senomyx ingredients in drinks such as Mug Root Beer ahead of what was widely expected to be a U.S. nationwide rollout in late 2016.  Senomyx still has a non-exclusive agreement with Pepsi that runs until 2019, under which Pepsi has access to natural flavor ingredients and sweeteners that were developed during the partnership, according to a news release. Pepsi could not be reached for comment.  Since changing the terms of its deal with Pepsi, Senomyx\u2019s management team has not set up any new commercial partnerships despite claiming to have interest from at least 25 companies, Turk said.

The ISA said the former employee used information that was not public, a report on quarterly results and a report on PepsiCo\u2019s plan to buy SodaStream that led to a spike in the share price after they became public to buy shares for hundreds of thousands of shekels and make a profit of 156,000 shekels.

PepsiCo\u2019s shares rose 4.3 percent after the company\u2019s quarterly revenue and profit topped analysts\u2019 estimates, helped by strong sales in its Frito-Lay unit.  \u201cThe first major earnings report came out, and PepsiCo\u2019s earnings beat expectations and that\u2019s a good start for the market,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  PepsiCo helped drive a 0.61 percent gain in the consumer staples index. Rival Coca-Cola rose nearly 1 percent.  The energy index was the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors, jumping 1.39 percent as oil prices rose due to growing supply outages.  Shares of Exxon, Chevron and Schlumberger were all up around 1.5 percent.  Overall, S&P 500 companies are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21 percent, slightly higher than what was forecast in April, according to Thomson Reuters data.  However, investors and analysts will parse quarterly reports to gauge the impact of China\u2019s tariffs, which are expected to hit a range of U.S. companies.  On Tuesday, China raised \u201canti-dumping tariff rates\u201d for some U.S.-made optical fiber products, effective July 11.  \u201cThe trade conflict is far from over and could eventually have a very negative impact on equities, but for now it is taking a back seat only because we are entering into the earnings season,\u201d Cardillo said.  He also pointed to a \u201cdisappointing\u201d report from the National Federation of Independent Business that showed U.S. small business confidence index fell 0.6 points to 107.2 in June as another sign that the trade dispute is worrisome for corporate America.  At 9:59 a.m. EDT, the S&P 500 was up 6.28 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,790.45. The index rose to as much as 2,791.7 points, its highest since March 13.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 116.62 points, or 0.47 percent, at 24,893.21 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 5.21 points, or 0.07 percent, at 7,761.41.  Tesla Inc rose 1.2 percent. The U.S. automaker signed agreements to open a plant in Shanghai with an annual capacity of 500,000 cars, local media reported.  Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped 1.3 percent after Evercore ISI cut its rating on the stock to \u201cin line\u201d from \u201coutperform.\u201d  Rating downgrades on eBay, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Cerner also pulled shares of the three S&P 500 components down between 1.6 percent and 3.4 percent.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.44-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.16-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 20 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 60 new highs and eight new lows.","60":"May 1 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc:  * PEPSICO INC - DECLARED QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.9275 PER SHARE OF PEPSICO STOCK, A 15.2 PERCENT INCREASE VERSUS COMPARABLE YEAR-EARLIER PERIOD Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","61":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel-based SodaStream, a carbonated drink-machine maker bought this year by Pepsico PEP.O for $3.2 billion, is establishing a manufacturing plant in the Gaza Strip, its chief executive said on Thursday.

One of the company\u2019s large shareholders, Matthew Turk, who said he owns 4 percent of shares, or more than 1.9 million shares of common stock, is skeptical of the San Diego company\u2019s announced plans to explore a strategic review, and hopes to turn around its fortunes after its stock has lost 78 percent of its value since it went public in 2004, the investor said in the letter on Tuesday.  The flavors and ingredients space has been undergoing consolidation and growth as food multinationals, facing slowing growth for legacy food and drinks brands, adjust their offerings to appeal to new and healthier tastes. Last month, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc agreed to buy Israeli flavors and ingredients maker Frutarom Industries Ltd for $7.1 billion in cash and stock.  \u201cThere must not be a slow liquidation of Senomyx, but rather a complete sale either in whole or in parts as quickly as possible to preserve remaining shareholder value,\u201d Turk said.  Senomyx, which had a market capitalization of $62.8 million at the close of trading on Monday, could not immediately be reached for comment.  The company has seen its stock decline since Pepsi stopped a trial partnership involving using Senomyx ingredients in drinks such as Mug Root Beer ahead of what was widely expected to be a U.S. nationwide rollout in late 2016.  The company still has a non-exclusive agreement with Pepsi that runs until 2019, where Pepsi has access to natural flavor ingredients and sweeteners that were developed during their partnership, according to a news release. Pepsi could not be reached for comment.  Since changing the terms of its deal with Pepsi, the management team has not set up any new commercial partnerships despite claiming to have interest from at least 25 companies, Turk said.","64":"BRUSSELS, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The following are mergers under review by the European Commission and a brief guide to the EU merger process:  APPROVALS AND WITHDRAWALS  -- Power and thermal management solutions company Delta Electronics to acquire Thai electronics manufacturing company Delta Electronics Public Company Limited (approved Oct. 24)  NEW LISTINGS  -- U.S. food, snack and beverage corporation PepsiCo to acquire all outstanding shares of Israeli-based manufacturing company SodaStream International (notified Oct. 24\/deadline Nov. 30)  -- Steel company Aperam Alloys Germany, subsidiary of Aperam, to acquire Netherlands producer of materials from nickel and nickel alloy VDM Metals Holding (notified Oct. 23\/deadline Nov. 29)  EXTENSIONS AND OTHER CHANGES  -- Chemicals company Quaker Chemical Corp and Hinduja Group\u2019s Houghton Internatioal to merge (notified Oct. 19\/deadline extended from Nov. 27 to Dec. 11\/companies provided concessions March 2)  FIRST-STAGE REVIEWS BY DEADLINE  OCT 26  -- Japanese company Sony Corp. to acquire majority control of UK music publishing company EMI Music Publishing (notified Sept. 21\/deadline Oct. 26)  OCT 29  -- U.S. pet food maker Mars Petcare to acquire European veterinary business Anicura (notified Sept. 10\/deadline extended to Oct. 29 after Mars offered concessions)  OCT 30  -- Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp and India\u2019s Tata Steel to set up a steel joint venture (notified Sept. 25\/deadline Oct. 30)  NOV 6  -- Private quity fund OEP ITS Coopertief Holding to acquire Norwegian software licensing and IT consulting services firm Crayon Group Holding (notified Sept. 28\/deadline Nov. 6\/simplified)  -- Shanghai travel and hospitality group Jin Jiang International Holdings to acquire Radisson Holdings Incorporated and 69.65 percent of hotel operator Radisson Hospitality (notified Sept. 28\/deadline Nov. 6)  -- Japanese Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited to acquire Jersey biotechnology company Shire (notified Sept. 28\/deadline Nov. 6)  -- Walt Disney Co to buy the bulk of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc\u2019s film and television assets (notified Sept. 14\/deadline extended to Nov. 6 from Oct. 19 after Disney offered concessions)  NOV 7  -- Italian natural gas companies Societa Gasdotti Italian and Snam to launch an Italian natural gas joint venture (notified Oct. 1\/deadline Nov. 7\/simplified)  -- SELP, a joint venture between Luxembourg industrial property and warehouse owner SEGRO European Logistics Partnership, and Canadian pension fund investor Public Sector Pension Investment Board to acquire a Spanish distribution warehouse from French company ID Logistics Group (notified Oct. 1\/deadline Nov. 7\/simplified)  -- German luxury carmakers Daimler and BMW to launch a car-sharing joint venture (notified Sept. 17\/deadline extended to Nov. 7 after the companies offered concessions)  -- U.S. aircraft parts maker Spirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc to acquire EU-based supplier Asco Industries NV (notified Sept. 17\/deadline extended to Nov. 7 after the compamies offered concessions)  NOV 8  -- Dutch subsidiary of Saudi Arabian Oil Company IPO-ARMO.SE, Overseas Holding Cooperatief U.A., to acquire remaining shares in Netherlands-based specialty chemicals company of ARLANXEO Holding B.V.

Since taking the helm last October, Chief Executive Officer Ramon Laguarta has carved out a multi-billion dollar strategy, which includes partnering with celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen and ramping up manufacturing capacity for smaller cans, to boost demand for out-of-favor sugary sodas.  The company has splurged on new ads for its trademark Pepsi colas, as well as Mountain Dew and Gatorade beverages, rounding off with a campaign centering around the National Football League\u2019s 100th anniversary. Advertising and marketing expenditure has jumped 12% so far this year, the company said.  Gatorade sales have been revived by a zero-sugar version of the sports drink, and PepsiCo said retail sales of the variant have surpassed half a billion dollars since the launch in May 2018.  \u201c(Gatorade Zero) is capturing consumers that I think were very heavy users of Gatorade and abandoned the brand because of the calories,\u201d Laguarta said on a conference call with analysts.

The company\u2019s major snack brands, Doritos and Cheetos, also got a lift from the marketing push, at a time when calorie-counting Americans increasingly shift toward healthier options.  Johnston attributed the rise to on-the-go lifestyles.  \u201cWith busier lifestyles (there) comes a desire to eat more conveniently, which is a strong tailwind for our business\u201d.  PepsiCo said it expects to meet or exceed its fiscal 2019 organic revenue growth target of 4%. However, the heavy spending on advertising and manufacturing came at a cost.  The company\u2019s net income attributable fell 16% to $2.10 billion and it left its full-year core earnings per share forecast unchanged.  The profit forecast suggested that the cost of achieving revenue growth was rising, according to Wells Fargo analysts.  Net revenue rose 4.3% to $17.19 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $16.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Laguarta, who starts on Oct. 3, will be tasked with managing the company\u2019s response as consumer tastes move away from sugary drinks.  Nooyi, 62, is stepping down after 24 years at PepsiCo, where she held a variety of roles, including her most recent 12 years as CEO. Her departure also leaves only one woman of color among Fortune 500 CEOs.  Laguarta will be PepsiCo\u2019s sixth CEO in its 53-year history.  \u201cRamon Laguarta is exactly the right person to help build on @PepsiCo\u2019s strong position and success. He has been a critical partner and friend and I am positive that he will take PepsiCo to new and greater heights in the years to come,\u201d Nooyi tweeted on Monday.  A 22-year veteran of PepsiCo, Laguarta oversaw global operations, corporate strategy, public policy and government affairs in his role as president.  The Spaniard previously headed the company\u2019s Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) division - a unit PepsiCo characterized as \u201cone of the most complex business divisions in the company,\u201d due to its mix of both developed and emerging markets.

That leaves only 23 female CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, representing less than 5 percent of the total, according to the Fortune magazine.  RESHAPING PEPSI  In her climb to the top, Nooyi had been at the forefront of several deals that reshaped PepsiCo. While she was chief financial officer, PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats and when she was vice president of corporate strategy, it spun off its interest in Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell.  However, it was after becoming CEO in October 2006, that Nooyi cemented PepsiCo\u2019s dominance in the global snacks and drinks market - inking 80 tactical deals, including buying its bottling operations and the Naked juice brand  She has also bolstered its portfolio of healthier offerings, which now account for nearly half of its sales, compared with about 38 percent in 2006, better aligning its portfolio with evolving consumer tastes, according to Morningstar analyst Sonia Vora.  More recently, Nooyi focused on reinvigorating sales of its marquee sodas by stepping up marketing efforts to win market share from Coca-Cola.  As CEO for 12 years, she has boosted sales of the Mountain Dew and Gatorade maker to $63.5 billion, up 80 percent from when she started.

That\u2019s a goal the company says was never met. Nestle told Reuters it was an ambitious target that didn\u2019t get the groundswell of industry and policy-maker support it needed.  Coke and Nestle said it is hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources; Nestle said it often pays a premium for recycled material.  All three companies made new pledges in 2018:  - Coca-Cola set a target to hit 50% recycled content in all packaging by 2030. Currently, it\u2019s at 20%, and about half that rate for PET plastic, it told Reuters.  - PepsiCo said it would use 25% recycled content in packaging by 2025. It told Reuters in September it had reached 4% as of 2019.  - Nestle said it aims to use 15% recycled plastic in its packaging by 2025. The company told Reuters this is at 3% currently, up from 2% when it made the pledge.","98":"(Reuters) - PepsiCo PEP.O warned on Tuesday surging demand for Lays and Doritos would only partially offset a hit to business in the second quarter from coronavirus lockdowns that have shuttered restaurants, theaters and sports venues key for its soda sales.  FILE PHOTO: Pepsi products are displayed in a supermarket in New York City, U.S. February 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The company said it had seen an increase in consumers making breakfast and snacking during the day while stuck under stay-at-home orders, leading to a surge in sales of snacks, oatmeal and Aunt Jemima pancakes late in the first quarter.  Its drinks business, however, is not faring as well under the tough moves to stifle the virus, and the company ditched its full year forecast and predicted second-quarter organic sales would decline at a low single digit rate.  The warning mirrored that of rival Coca-Cola Co KO.N, last week, which said volumes had fallen 25% globally since the beginning of April, largely stemming from a loss of sales other than at retail stores.  PepsiCo finance chief Hugh Johnston stressed the group was less exposed than Coca-Cola to the part of the market hit the hardest by the lockdowns.  \u201cCompared to our biggest competitor in beverages, they clearly have higher market share in away from home channels- restaurants, movie theaters and the like,\u201d Johnston told Reuters.  Analysts at Jefferies estimate about 40% of Coca-Cola\u2019s volumes are sold through channels other than retail stores, compared with only about 10% for Pepsi.  Still, demand for sodas at grocery stores is also starting to taper off after an initial phase of stockpiling at the beginning of the health crisis, Johnston said.  PepsiCo\u2019s net revenue rose 7.7% to $13.9 billion in the quarter ended March 21, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $13.21 billion, also helped by a massive advertising campaign during the Super Bowl. Organic sales of snacks under its Frito-Lay North America unit rose 7% in the quarter.  Excluding one-time items, earned $1.07 per share, beating estimates of $1.03, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  PepsiCo also said it still expected to pay $5.5 billion in dividends and buy back shares worth $2 billion this fiscal year, signaling financial stability at a time when several blue-chip firms have suspended shareholder returns to preserve cash.  However, the company ditched its full year forecast over uncertainty related to the pandemic.  PepsiCo also announced a new North America distribution agreement with Bang Energy drinks on Tuesday, only a few weeks after striking a $3.85 billion deal to buy Rockstar Energy Beverages.","99":"* Energy shares jump as oil gains on supply disruptions  * PepsiCo\u2019s best day in 7 yrs on strong Q2  * Nordstrom down on disappointing forecast  * S&P 500 Q2 earnings growth seen at 21 pct -TR I\/B\/E\/S  * Tesla gains on plans to open new plant in Shanghai  * Indexes up: Dow 0.56 pct, S&P 0.30 pct, Nasdaq 0.14 pct (Changes comment, adds details, updates prices)  By Amy Caren Daniel  July 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 at a four-month high, as energy shares got a boost from higher crude prices and strong results from PepsiCo signaled a solid start to the earnings season.  PepsiCo\u2019s shares surged 3.9 percent and were poised for their biggest one-day jump in nearly seven years after the company\u2019s quarterly results topped estimates on strong sales of snacks.  The company also reaffirmed its full-year forecast amid signs of a gradual recovery in its soda business.  PepsiCo drove a 0.82 percent gain in the consumer staples index, with Coca-Cola rising 1 percent.  The energy index rose 0.62 percent as crude prices gained on growing supply disruptions in Norway and Libya, but gains were pared after the United States said it would consider requests for waivers from Iranian oil sanctions.  Shares of Exxon and Chevron were up around 1 percent each.  \u201cThe market is in a very optimistic mood. The economic data is very strong and the labor markets are strong, and companies are making a lot of money,\u201d said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin.  Overall, S&P 500 companies are expected to post second-quarter profit growth of around 21 percent, slightly higher than what was forecast in April, according to Thomson Reuters data.  However, investors and analysts will parse quarterly reports to gauge the impact of an escalating trade dispute between China and the United States on company earnings.  \u201cIn the end eventually the trade war could impact things but right now the economic data and other things are too strong that they are overshadowing the trade war,\u201d Frederick said.  Wall Street rose for a fourth straight session. At 12:45 p.m. EDT, the S&P 500 was up 8.24 points, or 0.30 percent, at 2,792.45. The index reached a peak of 2,795.58, its highest since March 13.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 137.75 points, or 0.56 percent, at 24,914.34 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 10.56 points, or 0.14 percent, at 7,766.76.  Ten of the 11 S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.20 percent gain in the utilities sector. The lone laggard were financials, off 0.39 percent after a 2.3 percent surge on Monday.  JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to report results on Friday. Their shares fell between 0.3 and 1.3 percent.  Nordstrom dropped 4.5 percent, the most on the S&P, after the upscale department store operator issued a bleak sales forecast for the rest of 2018.  Cerner was the second-biggest loser on the S&P, falling 4.3 percent after Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to \u201cunderperform\u201d.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded 28 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 88 new highs and 18 new lows.","100":"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.O said on Wednesday it will change the name and brand image of its Aunt Jemima pancake mix and syrup which have been criticized as racist amid a national debate over racial inequality in the United States.  The more than 130-year-old brand logo features an African-American woman named after a character in 19th-century minstrel shows and is rooted in a stereotype of a friendly black woman working as a servant or nanny for a white family.  Following PepsiCo's move, the makers of Uncle Ben's rice, owned by Mars Inc, Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, owned by ConAgra Brands Inc CAG.N and Cream of Wheat porridge, owned by B&G Foods Inc BGS.N, also said they would review their packaging.  The moves are part of Corporate America\u2019s reckoning with the treatment of African Americans amid weeks of protests over racism and police brutality after the death of George Floyd, a black man, in police custody in Minneapolis.  The Aunt Jemima brand had been called out in recent days on social media. A TikTok video called \u201cHow To Make A Non Racist Breakfast\u201d by user @singkirbysing, in which a woman pours the pancake mix down the sink, has received 175,000 views on Instagram since being posted on Tuesday.  \u201cWe recognize Aunt Jemima\u2019s origins are based on a racial stereotype,\u201d Kristin Kroepfl, vice president and chief marketing officer of PepsiCo-owned Quaker Foods North America, said in a statement.  Quaker did not announce a brand name or logo, but said packages without the Aunt Jemima image would appear in the fourth quarter of this year.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  ConAgra said its packaging, meant to evoke a \u201cloving grandmother\u201d, could be interpreted \u201cin a way that is wholly inconsistent with our values\u201d and that it has \u201cbegun a complete brand and packaging review on Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s\u201d.  Mars said it had \u201ca responsibility to take a stand in helping to put an end to racial bias and injustices\u201d and that \u201cone way we can do this is by evolving the Uncle Ben\u2019s brand, including its visual brand identity.\u201d  \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know what the exact changes or timing will be, but we are evaluating all possibilities,\u201d a spokeswoman said about the brand, known for its white-haired African-American man named after a Texas rice farmer.  B&G Foods said it was initiating an immediate review of its Cream of Wheat Brand, which features a black man in a chef\u2019s hat.  Some observers lauded the moves, but said they were slow to come.  \u201cBrands built on racist imagery have been living on borrowed time,\u201d said James O\u2019Rourke, management professor at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. \u201cThis move by Quaker Oats, while welcome, is decades late in coming.\u201d  PepsiCo on Tuesday announced a set of initiatives worth more than $400 million over five years to support black communities and boost black representation at PepsiCo.","101":"FILE PHOTO: Cans of Pepsi are pictured at a grocery store in Pasadena, California, U.S., July 11, 2017.

Most Palestinians in Gaza, a territory controlled by the Islamist militant group Hamas, live in poverty. The economy there is stifled by an Israeli-Egyptian blockade on the territory as well as by disputes with the Palestinians\u2019 limited self-rule authority based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  SodaStream CEO Daniel Birnbaum told the Globes business conference that the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in Israel had succeeded with a mixed workforce of Jews and Arabs, and that it was looking to expand that approach.  The new project, Birnbaum said, sitting on a stage next to Pepsico CEO Ramon Laguarta, was to establish a manufacturing facility in Gaza. \u201cWe want the people of Gaza to have jobs, real jobs, because where there is prosperity, there can be peace.\u201d  He did not discuss other details of the planned facility.  Earlier this month, PepsiCo completed its purchase of SodaStream as it battles Coca-Cola for an edge in the health-conscious beverage market.  Founded in Britain in 1903, SodaStream was a coveted device in British kitchens in the 1970s and 80s, allowing people to create fizzy drinks by adding flavoured syrups to carbonated tap water. But its popularity faded as bottled sodas became cheaper.  More recently, the company reinvented itself as a fizzy water company popular with younger and more health- and environmentally-conscious consumers, who want to drink less soda and use fewer plastic bottles.  SodaStream was in the spotlight a few years ago when critics called for a boycott over a factory it was running in the West Bank. The company has since closed that factory, relocating to a new, much larger facility in southern Israel, although it still employs many Palestinians.
