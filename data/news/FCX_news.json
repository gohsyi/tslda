REUTERS\/Muhammad Yamin\/File Photo  Freeport, which said gold sales from its Grasberg mine in Indonesia more than doubled in the third quarter, left its full-year copper and gold sales forecast relatively unchanged. That means much of the beat reflects a shift in the timing of sales to the third from fourth quarter, said Barclays Capital analyst Matthew Murphy.  Additionally, investors may be rattled by ongoing uncertainty over Freeport\u2019s complex $3.85 billion deal to sell its majority stake in Grasberg to the Indonesia government, said Clarksons Platou analyst Jeremy Sussman.  The transaction is expected to close in late 2018 or early 2019, but Freeport is \u201cnot popping champagne bottles yet,\u201d Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said on a conference call.  Until mid-2019, Freeport will mine Grasberg\u2019s depleting open pit and then transition to underground mining, which will \u201csignificantly\u201d hurt output until 2021.  Freeport shares were down nearly 5 percent at $11.05 in early afternoon trade, after the company said it has solid long-term growth prospects but is deferring development decisions until market conditions improve.  Copper markets are rattled by U.S.-China trade war worries, Adkerson said, despite looming supply constraints of the metal. Copper prices have dropped 11 percent since early May, while gold is about 6 percent lower this year.  Freeport is focused on developing its own projects, rather than buying assets from another miner, Adkerson said.  \u201cWith all these uncertainties, I think it\u2019s unlikely that anybody\u2019s going to be pursuing big-scale deals,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t consider it to be something that we would look at in the near term, given our share price.\u201d  Freeport stock is down some 40 percent so far this year.  In the third quarter, the average realized price for copper fell nearly 5 percent, to $2.80 per pound, while gold prices were about 8 percent lower from the same period last year, at $1,191 per ounce.  Copper sales, meantime, rose to 1.04 billion pounds from 932 million pounds, while gold sales grew to 837,000 ounces from 355,000 ounces.  Adjusted net income of 35 cents per share bettered the average analyst estimate of 33 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.  Revenue increased 13 percent to $4.91 billion, ahead of an expectation for $4.56 billion.","1":"March 9 (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Inc:  * FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC - REAFFIRMS OUTLOOK FOR SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW GENERATION IN 2021 AND BEYOND  * FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC - RAMP-UP OF PRODUCTION FROM UNDERGROUND TRANSITION AT GRASBERG DISTRICT REMAINS ON TRACK  * FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC - LONE STAR PROJECT IN ARIZONA IS NEARING COMPLETION AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMMISSIONED DURING 2020  * FREEPORT-MCMORAN INC - THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS TO ITS SUPPLY CHAIN OR PRODUCT SHIPMENTS SINCE OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","2":"TORONTO (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp Chief Executive Mark Bristow on Wednesday said he sees no competition from rivals in his pursuit of Freeport-McMoran Inc\u2019s Grasberg copper-gold mine in Indonesia but cautioned any deal for the asset would take time to pull off.

Grasberg ranks as the world\u2019s second-largest copper mine and largest gold mine and would enable Barrick to take advantage of rising demand for copper in the electric vehicle industry.  In an interview, Bristow ruled out a hostile approach for Freeport while reiterating interest in Grasberg.  \u201cAnd there\u2019s no competition for Grasberg,\u201d he added. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s held in a U.S. company so no Chinese company can access it.

Bristow said there is no deal on the table at this stage but said his comments were aimed at sending a message to the market. Any transaction could take years to execute, he said.  Barrick has been selling its less productive mines to focus on so-called Tier 1 assets following the acquisition of Africa-focused Rangold Resources a year ago.  Bristow is also seeking to resolve a dispute in Papua New Guinea, where Barrick has struggled with unrest and the government is seeking increased benefits from the Porgera joint venture with China\u2019s Zijin Mining.  Resolving that impasse would give Barrick licence with investors to expand in Indonesia, Bristow said.  \u201cHow that works out under my management is going to be important on whether the market will give me that slack to continue to pursue world-class assets in that environment,\u201d he said.  Barrick has a full geological team and has signed a handful of confidentiality agreements to access data at some of the more entrepreneurial miners in Canada, Bristow said, declining to provide names.  \u201cWe\u2019re hunting in Canada, but we are very clear about our investment filters.\u201d  Barrick boosted its dividend by 40%, benefiting from higher gold output and improved prices.","3":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Workers at Indonesia\u2019s Grasberg gold and copper mine on Friday ended a protest demanding an easing of a coronavirus lockdown at the mine operated by a local unit of Freeport-McMoran Inc, a workers\u2019 representative and the company said.  Mining operations were disrupted after protesters had blocked access to the world\u2019s second-largest copper mine since Monday, calling on the company to resume a bus service to allow them to travel to a nearby town, and for a bonus payment.  Yonpis Tabuni, a workers\u2019 representative, said by text message that all their demands had been met and the protest had ended.  He shared a video showing workers opening up road blockades, partially shrouded by thick fog and rain, at the mine located at a mountain-top mining complex in the easternmost region of Papua.  \u201cWe have reached peace with the management,\u201d said another worker who declined to be named, adding that the company had given them a written memo of the agreement.  Freeport Indonesia confirmed on Friday the blockades had been removed after earlier saying the local government had given permission to ease lockdown restrictions.  Riza Pratama, a spokesman for Freeport Indonesia, said on Thursday the company and local government had agreed to ease curbs to allow workers to leave the mine area and visit the nearby town.  Local authorities would allow some workers to leave Grasberg each day after passing rapid test screening for the coronavirus, instead of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, he said.  They would also need to pass a temperature check upon arriving at the nearby town.  Pratama said 4,600 workers who had not taken any leave since April would be prioritised.  Freeport employs 13,000 people in Tembagapura, the closest town to the Grasberg mine. Of those, 389 had tested positive for the coronavirus and all but 28 had recovered, Pratama said on Wednesday.","4":"March 23 (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Inc said on Monday it will cut costs, and warned that the revised operating plans would lead to temporary reductions in copper and molybdenum production in the Americas.

FILE PHOTO: Freeport McMoRan Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson gestures during a press conference with Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan (not pictured) at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources in Jakarta, Indonesia August 29, 2017. REUTERS\/Darren Whiteside  Adkerson\u2019s comments come a month after a Brazilian tailings dam controlled by rival Vale collapsed, killing more than 300.  Investors have grown anxious in the wake of that disaster about the rising risk of tailings dams, which are effectively depositories for the muddy detritus of the mining process. Of the three main types of tailings dams, Vale was using one considered the least safe at the operation in Brazil that collapsed.  \u201cEarly on, we recognized this as a major risk area for our company,\u201d Adkerson said at an industry conference in Florida. \u201cFundamentally, we\u2019re comfortable with the system that we have been putting in place in managing this risk.\u201d  Phoenix-based Freeport controls 19 active tailings dams in the United States and Peru, and monitors 55 inactive dams, including some first built in the 19th century. None are in Brazil.  \u201cWe\u2019ve invested significantly in reclaiming\u201d those old sites, Adkerson said, without providing specific dollar amounts.  Freeport uses a mix of tailings dam designs, including the one used by Vale in the Brazilian disaster.  Adkerson stressed he feels that Freeport, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded copper producer, has a superior inspection system. German firm T\u00dcV S\u00dcD has been faulted by Brazilian officials for faulty inspections of Vale facilities.  \u201cThe use of the system that we have designed mitigates the risk of catastrophic tailings failures,\u201d Adkerson said.  Elsewhere, Adkerson, 72, repeated recent claims that he is not interested in a large-scale acquisition and has no immediate plans to retire.  \u201cI\u2019m enjoying work now a lot more than in recent years,\u201d said Adkerson, who signed a deal late last year for Freeport to relinquish majority control of the world\u2019s second-largest copper mine under pressure from the Indonesian government, even though the company will remain the project\u2019s operator. That deal took years to close and had become a major impediment to Freeport\u2019s growth options.  \u201cI\u2019m younger than Donald Trump and he\u2019s talking about a second term,\u201d he said.","6":"HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - Several parties are interested in buying Freeport-McMoRan Inc\u2019s cobalt project in the Democratic Republic of Congo but not at a price that would interest the miner and so it is not planning a sale, Freeport\u2019s chief executive officer said.  As a result, Freeport is looking at other options for the asset, including possibly a joint venture to develop the large cobalt project, CEO Richard Adkerson said.  Freeport last year tried to sell its cobalt assets, including the Kisanfu exploration project in Congo and the Kokkola cobalt refinery in Finland, to China Molybdenum Co Ltd, as part of its sale of a stake in its Tenke Fungurume copper mine in the Congo.  But the discussions on the cobalt assets ended without a deal in June.  Prices for cobalt have soared more than 150 percent in the past year as the once obscure minor metal has become a critical and sought-after ingredient in rechargeable batteries for electric cars.  Speaking at a mining conference in Florida, Adkerson also said discussions between Freeport\u2019s joint venture partner at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia, Rio Tinto Plc, and the Indonesian government about a purchase of Rio\u2019s stake are expected to occur \u201cin the very near term.\u201d  Freeport would not be involved in those discussions, he said.  The Indonesian government was doing a lot of work to prepare itself for negotiations with Rio, Adkerson said, including hiring technical experts and doing site visits.  On the outlook for the copper market, Adkerson said a global copper deficit was inevitable in the future due to underinvestment in new production combined with strong global growth.

The strategy underscores Freeport\u2019s desire to keep Grasberg, one of the world\u2019s largest mines, the crown jewel of its operations even amid the complex task of excavating the largest underground mine ever developed at a cost of more than $15 billion.  \u201cFor two years, we\u2019re going to be focused on this transition,\u201d CEO Richard Adkerson said on the sidelines of the World Copper Conference in Santiago.  \u201cIf things go well with that ... two years from now we\u2019re going to be well situated to then look at further debt reductions, potentially higher dividends, potential investments in new projects, and we\u2019ll be open to seeing if there\u2019s anything in the global M&A market that meets our objectives.\u201d  The Phoenix-based miner agreed last December to relinquish majority control of Grasberg under pressure from the Indonesian government, although it will remain the project\u2019s operator.  \u201cOur company is really going to be much better situated in two years\u2019 time. We have confidence about this,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Grasberg asset is so special.\u201d  The company\u2019s stock underperformed the price of copper in the years before the Grasberg agreement, but has outperformed the red metal\u2019s price by more than 20 percent since the deal was signed.  Freeport\u2019s production is expected to rise about 20 percent through the end of 2022 as the Grasberg expansion and other projects in the United States and elsewhere come online, according to Jefferies, a U.S. investment bank.  Wall Street has started to notice the growth potential. Nine of the 23 analysts that cover Freeport\u2019s stock recommend buying it. Two years ago, only four did, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cFreeport has tremendous growth opportunities,\u201d said Jefferies mining analyst Christopher LaFemina.  Some investors have suggested that Freeport should be broken up, with its Indonesian operations separated from mines in the Americas. That is a strategy that Adkerson said would not succeed.  \u201cThere are real advantages in our current structure, as we\u2019re able to bring the global technological capability of the whole company to bear in Indonesia,\u201d he said.  Adkerson, 72, said he had no plans to retire and was focusing on bringing Freeport through this next chapter. \u201cI\u2019m in good health.

Freeport\u2019s local unit, PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), has been given a temporary operating permit for Grasberg until July 31, Coal and Minerals Director General Bambang Gatot Ariyono told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday.  Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport has been in negotiations with Indonesia to secure long-term operating rights at Grasberg after the government introduced new rules last year aimed at giving Jakarta greater control over the nation\u2019s resources.  Efforts to finalise a deal have been overshadowed by concerns over the environmental impact of the project in the eastern Indonesian province of Papua.  \u201cThis month we hope all of the aspects - the divestment transaction, investment stability guarantees, the environment, a smelter - all of them are resolved,\u201d Ariyono said.  Freeport\u2019s previous temporary operating permit for Grasberg expired on June 30 after being awarded in January.  Freeport\u2019s Grasberg partner Rio Tinto and state-owned mining holding company Inalum are also involved in negotiations on the project, which needs significant investment to develop an underground phase from its current open-pit construction.  Inalum may complete a multi-billion-dollar deal to acquire a majority stake in Grasberg this month, officials said on Saturday, but details on how Freeport will maintain operational control have yet to emerge.  According to Ariyono, the main issues to be resolved were environmental matters, and discussions were ongoing \u201cbetween the Environment and Forestry Ministry, the Freeport team and Inalum, who have requested an opportunity to resolve them\u201d.  Other matters, which include a requirement for Freeport to build a second copper smelter and adopt a new tax regime, \u201care nearly finalised\u201d, he said.  Inalum was trying to reach a deal within two weeks, company spokesman Rendi Witular told Reuters by text message. \u201cDifferences in views have narrowed,\u201d he said.  A spokesman for Freeport Indonesia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Melbourne-based spokesman for Rio Tinto declined to comment.  A 2017 state audit of operations at Grasberg that outlined massive damage from Freeport\u2019s mine waste and a lack of proper environmental permits has complicated efforts to wrap up the deal.  In April, following the audit, Indonesia\u2019s environment minister issued two decrees that gave Freeport six months to overhaul management of its mine waste.  Freeport\u2019s average daily copper ore production at Grasberg has been between 175,000 and 176,000 tonnes so far this year, below its 2018 target of 230,000 tonnes, Ariyono said.  The company exported 465,000 tonnes of copper concentrate from February to mid-June, he added.","9":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Inc's FCX.N Indonesian unit said it will operate the giant Grasberg mine with a \"skeletal team\" after a rise in coronavirus infections in the area, including at the mine workers' living quarters, and three deaths.  The move is aimed at ensuring workers at the world\u2019s biggest gold mine and second-biggest copper mine can socially distance effectively and avoid any further spread of the virus, which has infected 17,514 and killed 1,148 in Indonesia, a Freeport Indonesia spokesman said.  \u201cWe are trying to reduce the numbers of workers, reduce the population. We just have a skeletal team to run the mine,\u201d spokesman Riza Pratama told Reuters.  \u201cFor contractors whose projects have been delayed or postponed, we have returned their employees. We have also removed workers who are in the risk category,\u201d he said, adding that the changes have not affected the mine\u2019s output.  Pratama declined to say how many workers at the mine, which normally employs about 25,000 people, would be kept on to run the operation.  COVID-19 infections in the Mimika Regency, where Grasberg mine is located on Papua island, reached 150 cases as of Sunday, including 102 cases in Tambagapura, the living quarters built to house Grasberg\u2019s workers and their families. Three people in Mimika have died, official data showed.  Freeport did not disclose how many of the infected were workers, but said it had converted its on-site barracks into isolation wards for employees who had come into contact with infected persons.  Pratama declined to disclose the number of workers in isolation.  Elsewhere, Freeport has suspended operations at a copper mine in New Mexico because of the spread of COVID-19 among workers, while earlier this month, a factory run by the Indonesian unit of U.S. tobacco giant Philip Morris shut after 60 workers contracted the virus.  However, a closure for Grasberg is unlikely as the project needs to continue operating in order to minimise damage to the mine and danger to workers, Pratama said.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t maintain our mine ... it would be dangerous for our employees to work,\u201d he said.  Operations at Grasberg were affected in 2017 after thousands of workers staged a rally over layoffs by Freeport due to a contract dispute with the government.  But even then, Freeport continued to have a team of workers to maintain and operate the mine, Pratama said.  Freeport Indonesia last week said it has around 50,000 rapid and polymerase chain reaction test kits on site.  It has also shut on-site churches and mosques to prevent gatherings of large crowds and deployed a task force to ensure site cleanliness and prevent gatherings.","10":"JAKARTA, Sept 13 (Reuters) -  * Indonesia\u2019s energy ministry has approved a new recommendation for a unit of Freeport McMoran Inc to raise copper concentrate exports to 700,000 tonnes until March 2020, an official told reporters on Friday  * The new recommendation is much higher than the initial approval for shipments of 198,282 tonnes of copper concentrates, said Yunus Saefulhak, the ministry\u2019s director of minerals  * Freeport\u2019s Grasberg mine is expected to produce 1.2 million tonnes of copper concentrates this year, he said  * Saefulhak said Freeport could export more \u201cdue to optimisation of its open pit mine\u201d (Reporting by Wilda Asmarini; Writing by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Himani Sarkar)","11":"(Reuters) - Freeport McMoRan Inc shares slid 9 percent on Thursday after the world\u2019s second-largest copper miner posted lower-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast a drop in 2019 production.  A 14 percent dive in copper prices slammed the company in the fourth quarter, yet the chief executive officer said U.S. demand remains strong and underpins Freeport\u2019s plans for a major expansion in the United States.  Still, the first quarterly results report from a global miner rattled investors at a time when customer confidence has been shaken by trade tension and shaky economies in many regions.  Rivals Rio Tinto Ltd and BHP Group Ltd are slated to report results next month.  Global demand for copper, a key material used in construction and manufacturing, has slipped in the past year on concerns about economic growth during the ongoing trade spat between the United States and China, Brexit, the U.S. government shutdown and other factors.  The average price Freeport received for its copper fell 14 percent during the fourth quarter to $2.75 per pound. That has unnerved Wall Street, with shares of Freeport down more than 30 percent in the past six months alone.  Longer term, demand for the red metal is expected to spike due to the electrification trend. Electric vehicle motors use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines.  \u201cThe fundamentals of the copper market point to a very positive future,\u201d Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said on a Thursday conference call with investors. \u201cCopper prices simply have to rise.\u201d  In anticipation of that, Phoenix-based Freeport is spending $850 million to open a new U.S. copper mine.  Adkerson, CEO since 2003, has called the United States core to Freeport\u2019s growth, noting that demand in the country has risen and the company has had to buy copper from rivals just to honor customer contracts.  \u201cThe market may be focused on the fourth-quarter miss today, but we do not believe these historic results are very meaningful to the investment case as Freeport is entering a transformational period,\u201d said Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina.  Freeport posted fourth-quarter net income of $140 million, or 9 cents per share, compared to $1.04 billion, or 70 cents per share.  Excluding one-time Freeport earned 11 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 18 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Copper production fell 17 percent to 841 million pounds during the quarter.  Freeport last month relinquished majority control of Grasberg, the world\u2019s second-largest copper mine, under pressure from the Indonesian government even though it will remain the project\u2019s operator.","12":"(Reuters) - Freeport McMoRan Inc on Thursday said it swung to a second-quarter profit as the world\u2019s largest publicly traded copper producer slashed costs to stem the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

While copper prices have risen, Freeport does not plan to boost spending or make changes  \u201cWe\u2019re not making any major adjustments to those plans until we have clarity in this market situation,\u201d Adkerson said.  If prices do continue improve, Freeport may consider reinstating its dividend or share buybacks in 2021, he said.  The miner\u2019s quarterly copper production fell 1.2% to 767 million pounds, while its gold output rose 19% to 191,000 ounces.  The average price that Freeport received for its copper fell 7% in the quarter, event though copper prices traded 22% higher in the same period.  Freeport\u2019s total costs and expenses in the second quarter dropped 22% to $2.7 billion.  Freeport has been boosting production at its Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, which is expanding underground. The ramp-up of underground production at Grasberg continues to advance on schedule, the company said.","13":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Inc agreed on Thursday to sell a majority stake in the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine to the Indonesian government via a series of complex deals worth $3.85 billion, potentially ending a long-running dispute on mining rights.  Freeport-McMoRan Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson (L), and PT Inalum Chief Executive Budi Gunadi Sadikin shake hands after signing an initial agreement for the state-owned mining company Inalum to take a controlling stake in Freeport's local unit, in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Darren Whiteside  That agreement, which could still collapse, will have Freeport give up majority control but remain operator of the Grasberg copper mine, located in the country\u2019s eastern province of Papua, as Jakarta seeks to gain greater control over its mineral wealth.  Here are some questions and answers on the agreement:  WHAT HAS BEEN AGREED BETWEEN THE PARTIES?  Freeport and Rio Tinto have agreed on a structure and pricing for a series of transactions to transfer majority ownership of the Grasberg project to Indonesia\u2019s state-owned mining holding company, PT Inalum.  Inalum will pay $3.5 billion for Rio Tinto\u2019s 40 percent participating interest which Freeport will then convert into an equity holding in local unit PT Freeport Indonesia. Inalum will also pay $350 million for the share of Grasberg held by PT Indocopper Ivestama to take the country\u2019s total holding to 51.38 percent in Freeport Indonesia.  IS THIS AGREEMENT BINDING?  Heads of agreements are typically non-binding. However, Indonesia\u2019s State Owned Enterprises Minister Rini Soemarno said the agreement is binding while Rio Tinto and Freeport both said the heads of agreement is just a step and not binding.  WHAT ARE THE MAIN ISSUES STILL OUTSTANDING?  Freeport\u2019s divestment of ownership of Grasberg is one of the steps the miner must take as it transfers rights to the mine from its current Contract of Work to a special mining permit, to satisfy rules set out in Indonesia\u2019s 2009 Mining Law.  Details on exactly how the new permit will differ from the Contract of Work are yet to be revealed, but in essence, it is expected to establish financial and operational guarantees for Grasberg up to 2041.  Indonesia issued Contracts of Work before 2000 and usually royalties or taxes are fixed for the duration of the contract and are generally not subject to government regulation. In contrast, new mining permits are subject to current regulation and places the mining company at a lower status than the government.  Freeport is also required to build a second smelter in line with Indonesia\u2019s mining rules, which require mineral ores to be processed domestically to increase the value of the country\u2019s exports. According to Freeport, it will have five years to complete a $3 billion smelter project once Inalum has acquired a majority stake.  HOW CAN FREEPORT RETAIN OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE MINE WITHOUT RETAINING MAJORITY CONTROL?  Freeport is expected to form a joint venture agreement with Inalum that will establish rules on how the mine and the company will be managed on a daily basis, and that agreement is expected to cover shareholder voting rights and capital investment responsibilities.  With the risk of meddling due to the many vested interests swirling around Grasberg, Freeport has insisted it needs operational control before committing to a multi-billion-dollar investment for underground mining at Grasberg instead of its current open-pit form.  HOW HAVE INVESTORS IN FREEPORT AND RIO TINTO RESPONDED TO THE AGREEMENT?  The market response to the agreement has been muted so far, particularly compared to a 14 percent drop in Freeport\u2019s shares on April 24 after the company revealed environmental demands by the Indonesian government.  Freeport shares on Thursday rose 2.5 percent in pre-market trade on news of the agreement, but closed 0.7 percent lower at $17.29.  Rio shares trading in London were down 0.1 percent at 4,014 pence as of 1010 GMT on Friday.  WHAT IS EXPECTED TO HAPPEN NEXT AFTER THURSDAY\u2019S SIGNING CEREMONY?  Inalum, Freeport and Rio need to finalize sale and purchase agreements for the planned transactions, along with shareholder agreements.  The government needs to issue Freeport and Inalum with a special mining permit for Grasberg, which provides for long-term stability of its operations.  Environmental matters, including government requirements for Grasberg\u2019s management mine wastes known as tailings, need to be resolved.  WHAT HAVE THE MAIN PARTIES INVOLVED SAID ABOUT THE AGREEMENT?  Indonesian President Joko Widodo has said the agreement is a \u201cleap forward\u201d for the country and will mean greater returns from taxes, royalties and dividends.  Freeport Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said the company does not expect the new agreement to make \u201ca material change\u201d to its taxes, royalty payments or cash flows from Grasberg, but acknowledged Indonesia will benefit from greater dividends resulting from its increased ownership.  Referring to a discount Freeport had agreed to accept for its Indocopper stake, Adkerson said \u201cso we put some money on the table to help facilitate this happening.\u201d","14":"July 23 (Reuters) - Freeport McMoRan Inc reported a profit for the second quarter on Thursday, helped by a drop in costs.

That deal, where Indonesia and state-owned miner PT Inalum will control a 51.23 percent stake in PT Freeport Indonesia, is expected to end years of wrangling over ownership rights to Grasberg, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine.  But the planned $3.85 billion series of transactions are still subject to environmental clearances and a special mining permit by the Indonesian government after a 2017 audit found the mine to be in breach of environmental rules.  The environmental report said Freeport had allowed tailings from the mine to extend beyond previously agreed limits, polluting coastal areas, and that the Phoenix, Arizona-based company had operated in areas of Papuan forest without a permit.  Freeport has said it complies with Indonesia\u2019s environmental rules.  Environment ministry inspector general Ilyas Asaad said on Thursday his office had issued preliminary documents for Grasberg\u2019s environmental clearance.

The deal, which would give Indonesia and state-owned miner PT Inalum a 51.23 percent stake in PT Freeport Indonesia, aims to end years of wrangling over ownership rights to Grasberg, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine.  But a series of planned transactions worth $3.85 billion is still subject to Inalum securing a special permit for the mine, which requires environmental clearance relating to its waste disposal, and other regulatory issues.  Papua last week rejected the proposed ownership structure for the stake under which the province would indirectly own 10 percent of Freeport\u2019s local unit, potentially delaying the deal.  \u201cI ask that all stages of the divestment process can be finished and final (and) we hope that before the end of 2018 everything is completed,\u201d Widodo told a meeting with Inalum, Papua Governor Lukas Enembe and other government officials.  The president had also requested details on environmental matters, according to a statement on the cabinet secretary\u2019s website.  \u201cWe will use (this acquisition) to the maximum extent to improve the welfare and prosperity of the people, primarily the people of Papua,\u201d Widodo said.  According to Enembe, Widodo also demanded the transactions be carried out \u201cvery carefully\u201d to prevent intervention by third parties.  Enembe referred to a 2015 scandal linked to Grasberg in which Indonesia\u2019s former parliament speaker was accused of attempting to extort shares worth $1.8 billion from Freeport, as part of the compulsory majority divestment.  \u201cThat cannot happen again,\u201d Enembe said in a press release.  Once the deal is completed, Papua should \u201chold a 10 percent stake and Papua will also have rights regarding Freeport\u2019s agenda going forward,\u201d he said.  A spokesman for Inalum confirmed Thursday\u2019s meeting but said he was unable to comment further.  Inalum, which earlier this month raised $4 billion in bonds to fund the Grasberg deal, has proposed to finance the purchase of the 10 percent stake for Papua in Freeport Indonesia via joint ownership of PT Indocopper Investama.  \u201cThis is the most efficient mechanism financially and legally,\u201d Inalum said in a statement last week.  The structure was intended to prevent private companies from being involved in the Freeport transactions, Deputy State Owned Enterprise Minister Fajar Harry Sampurno told reporters on Monday.  \u201cObviously they don\u2019t want the Papua government going off on a frolic of its own, selling the shares or pledging the shares or doing something like that,\u201d Jakarta-based foreign legal counsel Bill Sullivan told Reuters.  In a media report on the Papua government website, Enembe was quoted as saying last week that the Inalum proposal \u201cis not in accordance with a previous agreement\u201d, and that his government wanted to form a company that would control the 10 percent stake itself.  Since Freeport won the right in 1988 to mine Grasberg, it has been a lightning rod for grievances over impacts on the environment and revenue sharing.

(Reuters) - Freeport McMoRan Inc FCX.N is not interested in selling its Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia, Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said on Monday, tamping down speculation of a deal with Canadian miner Barrick Gold Corp ABX.TO.

REUTERS\/Rodrigo Garrido\/File Photo  Barrick CEO Mark Bristow in recent weeks has expressed interest in buying Grasberg. Earlier this month Bristow said he sees no competition for the asset from global or state-backed Chinese miners.  That back and forth from two of the mining industry\u2019s most-powerful executives comes as investors are expecting a wave of buyouts this year, especially for copper assets.  Copper is a key material used in construction and electric vehicle motors. Many analysts expect a supply crunch in the next decade.  \u201cNow\u2019s just not the time for Freeport to think about doing a big strategic move,\u201d Adkerson said at the BMO Global Metals and Mining Conference in Florida.  When asked on Monday if he remained interested in Grasberg, Bristow told Reuters he felt the world\u2019s second-largest copper mine and largest gold mine should be worth more than it currently is.  \u201cI think the point is, is it undervalued? Yes. Could that value be delivered? Of course. What is the best way to do that? That\u2019s the elephant in the room, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.  Shares of Freeport, the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, fell 6 percent on Monday on fears the coronavius is spreading globally, while Barrick's stock rose 4.6 percent as gold prices GCc1 jumped.  Gold is considered a safe-haven for investors in times of crisis, whereas copper prices CMCUc1 are linked closely to global economic health. Barrick is the world's second-largest gold producer after Newmont Corp NEM.N.  Bristow has said copper is attractive because it is often mined alongside gold and the metals share common processing techniques.  Bristow told the conference Barrick has capacity for M&A but demurred when asked directly about his interest in a deal for Grasberg.  \u201cMy point is that copper is an inevitable part of gold mining in the future,\u201d he said during webcast remarks, which followed a presentation by Freeport\u2019s Adkerson.  \u201cYou can interpret that whichever way you want,\u201d he said.

The smelter on Oct. 31 went into maintenance that was scheduled for about 30 days, but that has been extended due to a lack of supply from a neighbouring oxygen plant, said a Mitsubishi Materials spokesman.  The oxygen plant was also conducting maintenance that had to be extended, the spokesman said. Oxygen is used in the initial stages of copper smelting to help remove impurities from copper concentrate.  The extended maintenance would cut the smelter\u2019s annual production of copper cathode by around 20,000 tonnes to approximately 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes, assuming partial operations resume in mid-December, the spokesman said.  The plant is expected to resume full operations in mid-January, he said.  He did not say how much copper supply would be affected by force majeure or which customers would be hit.  A Jakarta-based spokesman for Freeport-McMoRan Inc unit PT Freeport Indonesia, the main supplier of copper concentrate to PT Smelting, said its deliveries had not been disrupted yet, but he provided no further detail.  Each year Freeport supplies around 1 million tonnes of copper concentrate to PT Smelting for copper production.","35":"JAKARTA, July 25 (Reuters) - Indonesia\u2019s parliament has asked the government to recalculate damage to the environment from the giant Grasberg copper mine operated by the local unit of Freeport McMoRan Inc, the environment ministry said.  A 2017 report by Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) calculated that Freeport\u2019s decades-long operations at the mine in Indonesia\u2019s remote easternmost province of Papua had caused environmental damage worth $13.25 billion.  That damage, it said, was largely a result of tailings from the mine that had extended beyond previously agreed limits and which had polluted coastal areas.  The audit also said Freeport Indonesia (PT FI) had missed royalty payments, cleared thousands of hectares of protected forest and began mining underground without environmental clearance.  The environmental issues have presented problems for Freeport and Indonesia, whose state-owned mining holding company, PT Inalum, hopes to finalise a $3.9 billion deal to acquire a majority stake in Grasberg this year.  In a meeting with Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya on Tuesday, parliament urged the minister to \u201censure that PT FI fulfils governmental administrative penalties\u201d in accordance with the law, the ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.  \u201cCommission VII asks the Environment Minister to calculate the value of environmental losses resulting from damage and pollution from PT FI operations, as per the findings of the BPK,\u201d Commission VII chairman Gus Irawan Pasaribu said, according to the statement.  Jakarta-based spokesmen for PTFI and Inalum did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.  Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson said on a call with analysts on July 12 the company had been \u201cworking very closely\u201d with the environment ministry and had \u201creceived assurance that we will find a resolution of the environmental issues that will be acceptable for all parties. So we\u2019re very encouraged by that.\u201d  Since then he said Freeport had \u201centered into very productive discussions with the ministry and are making progress with the ministry in addressing these issues and working towards a resolution that we do not expect and the ministry does not expect to adversely affect our operations.\u201d  Parliament also urged the ministry to \u201cconduct environmental risk analysis and environmental audits on a regular basis\u201d, and plans to hold meetings with the ministries of mining and the environment on the matter.  A spokesman for the environment ministry declined to comment further on the parliament request or provide and estimate on how long this process could take.  Indonesia\u2019s mining minister said earlier this month the environmental matters must be resolved before his office could issue a new mining permit for PT-FI up to 2031.  Inalum CEO Budi Gunadi Sadikin told parliament on Monday that \u201cregarding the environment, we told Freeport \u2018the past problems are your sins\u2019. In future we will take responsibility together.\u201d  Sadikin added the environmental damage from Grasberg was a shared responsibility as the government already held a 9.36 percent stake in the mine.  Sadikin said a forestry permit for the mine still needed to be issued, and \u201cthe 185 trillion rupiah ($12.80 billion) from tailings damage still needs to be cleared up\u201d although he was confident that all the environmental problems could be resolved.  There are 13 of 48 sanctions related to the environmental audit that have not been met yet, according to the environment ministry.  In April, Freeport shares fell to a four-month low after the environment ministry announced tough new rules intended to comply with the BPK audit, just before the company announced its first quarter earnings.

For 2020, treatment charges (TC) of around $60 per tonne and refining charges (RC) of 6 cents per lb would be a \u201creasonable level to settle at\u201d, Javier Targhetta, president of Atlantic Copper and senior vice president for marketing and sales at Freeport told Reuters in an interview during Asia Copper Week in Shanghai on Tuesday.  Top global miners like Freeport and Chinese smelters are currently negotiating for next year\u2019s annual contracts and TC\/RCs are widely expected to be below the 2019 level of $80.80 per tonne\/8.08 cents per lb.  \u201cNew smelting capacity [in China] will come online but mine production will remain more or less flat, which will put pressure on TC\/RC,\u201d Targhetta said.  He also added that since more mines around the world were producing high arsenic material, blending clean concentrates with high arsenic copper concentrates was becoming more widespread.  \u201cSmelters will have to adapt to treat higher arsenic concentrates,\u201d he added.  Targhetta said new smelting capacity expected to come online in China next year will treat an additional 3-4 million tonnes of copper concentrates, which means an additional refined copper capacity of around 1 million tonnes.  He said demand for copper, including in China, remained positive in the near term due to \u201cvery low levels of inventories\u201d at the London Metal Exchange, Comex and the Shanghai Futures Exchange and at bonded warehouses.  He added that the U.S.-China trade war continues to cast a shadow over copper demand.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare say copper is bullish as it will depend on trade wars ... US, Japan and China, all the big consumption areas will depend on whether the world in general is growing and the world will be in growth mode if the trade war is eventually resolved,\u201d Targhetta said.

The Houston pipeline operator is still actively exploring the construction of an inland exporting facility on a harbor island off Corpus Christi, but has begun considering \u201call of our options,\u201d including an offshore terminal off Freeport, closer to its crude storage and terminal assets in Houston, said Mark Roles, a vice president at Magellan.  \u201cBarrels from pretty much every basin in the U.S. come through Houston so you can get a variety of grades, which is good for international buyers,\u201d Roles said on the sidelines of the Argus Americas Crude Summit in Houston.  That Magellan is considering Freeport adds a new wrinkle to the race to build U.S. export terminals capable of loading crude onto supertankers. The company had followed global commodities trader Trafigura SA and investor Carlyle Group in making plans for export terminals off Corpus Christi.  A Freeport facility would put Magellan in competition with Enbridge Inc, Kinder Morgan Inc and Oiltanking Partners LP, which have jointly proposed an offshore facility that would load 2 million barrels per day (bpd) onto supertankers 80 miles off Freeport.  Magellan\u2019s potential Corpus Christi terminal would be capable of loading as much as 1.5 million bpd onto supertankers and would have room for up to 20 million barrels of storage capacity, Magellan told Reuters.  The Houston pipeline operator owns a terminal in Corpus Christi\u2019s inner harbor, as well as other undeveloped property that could be used for additional storage tanks to connect to the terminal.  It is in talks with potential customers about the terminal, and has also held discussions about building pipelines between Houston and Corpus Christi and from the U.S. oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma to Houston, the company said.  But the oil flowing to Corpus Christi comes almost exclusively from Texas fields in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale, while Freeport pipelines have connections to the U.S. oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, which holds crude from a variety of basins around the United States, Roles said.  \u201cWith all the politics involved, the permitting, I don\u2019t believe more than two of these are going to get built,\u201d Roles said. \u201cWe want to be on one that\u2019s successful and has long-term commitments on it.\u201d (Reporting by Collin Eaton Editing by James Dalgleish)","39":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday that state-owned mining company PT Inalum has reached an initial agreement with Freeport-McMoRan Inc FCX.N to increase its stake in Freeport's local unit to 51 percent.  The larger stake would give Inalum a controlling stake in Freeport\u2019s Indonesian assets, including the Grasberg mine, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine.  Widodo said the government hopes to get larger amount of income from tax revenue and royalties under the deal and that Indonesia\u2019s national interest should be prioritized in the agreement.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo had instructed his administration to complete negotiations to buy a majority stake in the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine by end-April.  This includes buying Rio Tinto\u2019s participating interest, which entitles it to a 40 percent share of all production after 2022, and converting that holding into shares in the mine.  But Freeport said last month that new environmental demands from Indonesia\u2019s government on managing mine waste could delay a new contract for its massive Grasberg copper mine, and in turn could throw the timing of divestment into question.  Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson last month described the new demands as \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cdisappointing\u201d but said he was confident a resolution would be found.  \u201cIn the last 18 months there have been many issues popping up. This is only a normal blip,\u201d said Sadikin, when asked if the new environmental issues would delay the divestment deal.  Freeport has said that divestment of a majority stake must be part of a package that guarantees its long-term right to Grasberg and fiscal certainty as well.  \u201cThe perception is that in Indonesia the regulations change easily, (which) makes it difficult for them to calculate their finances,\u201d Sadikin said.  So as part of the divestment deal, Freeport wants a clear fiscal regime that governs taxes and royalties during the term of its contract to work the mine.  Sadikin said Freeport Indonesia would remain mine operator after divestment and said \u201cwe\u2019re getting closer and closer\u201d to a deal and that it could still be concluded in 2018.  Price was still one of the central issues in talks over the deal, Sadikin said.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of meeting at a point where everyone is slightly grumpy.

FILE PHOTO: Trucks are parked at the open-pit mine of PT Freeport's Grasberg copper and gold mine complex near Timika, in the eastern region of Papua, Indonesia on September 19, 2015 in this file photo taken by Antara Foto. REUTERS\/Muhammad Adimaja\/Antara Foto\/File Photo  In April, in follow-up action to the audit, the environment minister issued two decrees that gave Freeport six months to overhaul management of its mine waste, or tailings, at Grasberg, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine. One of the decrees said Freeport would be barred from any activities in areas that lack environmental permits.  And there may be more troubles to come for the Phoenix, Arizona-based company as the government has so far acted on only a part of the 2017 report by Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) on Freeport\u2019s decades-long operations at the mine in Indonesia\u2019s remote easternmost province of Papua.  A letter from Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson to the environment ministry, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, said the decrees imposed \u201cundue and unachievable restrictions\u201d on Freeport\u2019s basic operations.  In a separate letter to the government, quoted by Tempo magazine, Adkerson said: \u201cI am deeply concerned that these actions have the potential to derail the progress that all of us have worked so hard to achieve.\u201d  Freeport officials declined to comment on the letters. Officials at the mining and environment ministries confirmed that letters from Adkerson were received, but did not provide detail on their contents.  In a call to analysts last month, Adkerson had played down the impact of the decrees. \u201cThis is a distraction, but you all know over time we have to deal with political issues, and this is one of them,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see anything to interfere with our operations. The government needs and desires now to make sure that we continue to operate and they collect their taxes and royalties.\u201d  The biggest problem for both the government and the U.S. company may be the additional findings in the BPK report that are yet to be taken up. It asserted that Freeport caused environmental damage worth $13.25 billion, missed royalty payments, cleared thousands of hectares of protected forest and began mining underground without environmental clearance.  Pressure is mounting on the government to take more action.  Kardaya Warnika, an opposition party member who chairs parliament commission VII, which oversees the mining sector, said the government and parliament were both obligated to follow up on the audit findings.  If Freeport is found to have royalty shortfalls, \u201cthen they should pay,\u201d Warnika said.  Sonny Keraf, a former environment minister who led talks on Indonesia\u2019s 2009 mining law, said the government needs to follow up on the BPK report \u201ccomprehensively\u201d.  STUCK  Indonesian state mining holding company PT Inalum is due to take over the majority stake in Grasberg under a long-heralded acquisition deal, which has to be completed by 2019.  Under the proposed transaction, Rio Tinto RIO.L, which has a stake in Grasberg's output, would sell its interest to Inalum, which would be converted to equity.  Freeport, which would sell Inalum a further 9.36 percent stake, would see its current 90.64 percent holding in Grasberg diluted down to 49 percent, although it would remain the mine\u2019s operator.  Last week, Inalum CEO Budi Gunadi Sadikin told reporters discussions on the acquisition were being held up by \u201cseveral\u201d environmental issues. Freeport had \u201cmade breaches that need to be revised through the environmental audit,\u201d Sadikin said. \u201cThe biggest issue is the issue of tailings - that has to be improved.\u201d  Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya told reporters on Wednesday she had met Adkerson for a three-hour meeting last week to discuss the decrees on the tailings. No decision was reached and the ministry will hold regular meetings to resolve the matter, although Freeport will meanwhile be allowed to continue to operate, she added.  But with Jakarta\u2019s political climate likely to get increasingly tense ahead of the 2019 presidential elections, the government may not be in a position to work out a compromise with the company, political analysts said.  While the BPK report\u2019s recommendations are not binding, they could be turned into political \u201cammunition to undermine\u201d President Joko Widodo ahead of the election, said Achmad Sukarsono, an analyst at the Control Risks consultancy.  That would make it increasingly difficult for Widodo to finalize a deal for a majority government stake in Grasberg before the audit issues are resolved, he added.  For Widodo, getting a majority stake for the Indonesian government in one of the world\u2019s biggest mining operations under his watch would be a political boon.  A spokesman for the president\u2019s office deferred questions on the matter to Widodo\u2019s chief of staff, who did not respond to a request for comment.  The mining ministry directed questions on the BPK report to the ministry\u2019s environmental director, who did not respond to requests for comment.  Freeport \u201chas responded to the relevant matters in the BPK report,\u201d the company said in a statement in response to Reuters questions, declining to comment further.  NO CERTAINTY  Freeport began exploration in Papua in the late 1960\u2019s and, helped by ties to late President Suharto, clinched a deal to mine Grasberg in 1988.  The company is now one of Indonesia\u2019s biggest taxpayers.  The issue of what will happen to Grasberg when Freeport\u2019s contract there expires in 2021 has dogged the company for years.  In an effort to end years of wrangling, Freeport pledged last August to transfer majority ownership of Grasberg to Indonesia in return for rights to mine the deposit up to 2041.  That deal is critical to Freeport, whose underground expansion plans for Grasberg require billions of dollars in further investment, particularly as open pit mining there is slated to end this year.

The deal, which would give Indonesia and state-owned PT Inalum a 51.23 percent stake in PT Freeport Indonesia, aims to end years of wrangling over ownership rights to Grasberg, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine.  At the same time, Inalum, which last month raised more than $4 billion in bonds to fund the deal, aims prove to investors it is a \u201cworld-class partner that can work with them and get a decent and sustainable business out of Indonesia\u2019s natural resources,\u201d Sadikin said.  As part of the transaction, Inalum has proposed to sell a 10 percent stake in PT Freeport Indonesia to Papua province and Mimika regency, where the giant Grasberg mine is situated, for $819 million, Sadikin said.  But before Freeport can be issued a new mine permit the government of Papua still needs to agree on the stake price and ratify an expansion of Grasberg\u2019s forestry use permit for the mine\u2019s vast tailings sedimentation area, Sadikin said.  The proposed shareholding structure that was last month rejected by Papua governor had now been settled and would benefit Papuans by ensuring the stake could not be sold off by future governments, Sadikin said.  \u201cThere are several examples where a big significant asset is being transferred from foreign investors to local entities and the local government got nothing,\u201d he said.  Inalum was also facilitating discussions between Freeport and the province, which hopes to resolve an existing dispute with the miner over surface water taxes before approving the deal, he added.  Inalum currently has a 9.36 percent stake in Freeport Indonesia.  A Jakarta-based spokesman for Freeport Indonesia and a spokesman for the Papua government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","51":"(Refiles to fix dateline.)

The closure marks the latest blow for Freeport, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded copper producer, after Peru\u2019s government shuttered its mines last month because of the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed more than 110,000 lives across the globe and infected nearly 2 million.  The Chino mine, in New Mexico\u2019s southwest corner, produced 175 million pounds of copper last year, making it the company\u2019s third-largest North American mine by production.

Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson said in October the company wanted to avoid arbitration in dealing with Indonesia\u2019s push for Grasberg ownership. Talks with Freeport over rights to Grasberg broke down in February 2017.  Rio has a 40 percent interest in Freeport Indonesia\u2019s Grasberg contract, which entitles it to a 40 percent share of all production after 2022. Rio has held talks with Indonesia about a possible exit to the venture.  There have been few signs of progress since last August, when Freeport promised to divest a 51-percent stake in Grasberg to the Indonesian government in exchange for long-term operating rights. The government currently owns a less-than-10 percent stake in Freeport Indonesia.

A 2017 state audit of operations at Freeport Indonesia\u2019s Grasberg copper mine, the world\u2019s second largest, pointed to the miner\u2019s use of more than 4,000 hectares of protected forest in which to deposit its tailings.  The report also said Freeport had begun mining underground at Grasberg without a permit, and pointed to separate investigations that estimated damage worth $13.3 billion resulting from tailings from the mine.  Freeport has denied it breached Indonesia\u2019s environmental rules, but the issues have delayed the company\u2019s planned divestment of a majority stake to Indonesia\u2019s state-owned mining holding company, PT Inalum.  Indonesia\u2019s audit agency said in a press conference on Wednesday that a permit was being finalised by the environment ministry for the 4,536 hectares of forest used by Freeport, and that the outstanding royalties would need to be paid in two years.  It was not immediately clear how the 460 billion rupiah figure was derived, but according to a 2017 audit the area of forest had been used from 2008, and that Freeport should have been paying around 34 billion rupiah a year in royalties.  Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar said at the press conference that she was working with the governor of Papua province to get the new forestry permit approved.  \u201cI think we can finish it today,\u201d Bakar told reporters.  Damage from Grasberg tailings was \u201cquite heavy\u201d, and a planned revision of the tailings management system would be rolled out in two stages up to 2030 because \u201cit cannot be completed in five years,\u201d Bakar said.  Grasberg currently produces up to 200,000 tonnes of tailings per day, she said.  A Jakarta-based spokesman for Freeport said the company was not immediately able to comment on the latest BPK announcement.  The government aims to issue a new mining permit for Grasberg - which requires the environmental permit issues to be settled - before the end of the year, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan said at the same press conference.  The new mining permit is needed to complete Inalum\u2019s $3.85 billion Grasberg acquisition plan.","59":"JAKARTA, July 12 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Thursday that state-owned mining company PT Inalum has reached an initial agreement with Freeport-McMoRan Inc to increase its stake in Freeport\u2019s local unit to 51 percent.

The Denver-based company\u2019s Eagle Ford position, which it bought in 2014 from Freeport-McMoRan Inc for $3.1 billion, could help it pay off some of the $7.14 billion in long-term debt it had as of the end of September.  The coronavirus pandemic caused a worldwide slump in fuel demand. Recovery has begun but is threatened by the surge in infections in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The crash in oil prices made investors turn their backs on the shale industry and pushed companies to look at asset sales and mergers for survival.  Shale production has dropped sharply in response to the falloff in demand, with U.S. output down to 10.5 million barrels per day from nearly 13 million bpd at the end of 2019.  The assets could fetch around $600 million to $700 million, one of the sources said. The divestiture plan is at an early stage, the sources said, requesting anonymity while discussing a confidential process.  Ovintiv said it does not comment on questions related to potential transactions.  Numerous companies have gone into bankruptcy while others have combined to survive the downturn. When asked about that activity, Ovintiv top boss Doug Suttles told analysts on a quarterly earnings call that the company is \u201cwhere we need to be\u201d and that its focus will be on debt reduction.  At the end of last year, the company held 517 producing wells with total oil output of 25,300 bpd in the Eagle Ford.  Ovintiv cut its workforce by 25% earlier this year and slashed 2020 capital investment by $500 million. The company posted a second straight quarterly loss in the three months ended Sept. 30, with oil production down 22%.","61":"(Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp ABX.TO does not want to buy copper mining giant Freeport McMoRan Inc FCX.N, although it is interested in its rival's flagship Grasberg mine in Indonesia, Chief Executive Mark Bristow said on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: Mark Bristow, chief executive officer of Barrick Gold, speaks during an interview at the Investing in African Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town, South Africa February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Hutchings\/File Photo  The strategy replicates one that Bristow successfully deployed in 2019: aggressively float interest in an entire company even though the ultimate goal is just one asset.  Rumors that Barrick, the world\u2019s second-largest gold miner, planned to bid for Freeport are \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, Bristow told Reuters on the sidelines of the Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town. \u201cPeople jump to conclusions,\u201d he said.  The rumors, though, were flamed in recent weeks by Bristow himself in meetings with analysts and investors that leaked out to various media.  \u201cPeople say, \u2018Are you interested in Grasberg?\u2019 I say, \u2018I have to be; it\u2019s a tier one asset,\u2019\u201d Bristow said. Tier one assets refer to high-grade, long-life mines.  Buying Grasberg - the world\u2019s largest gold mine and second-largest copper mine - would fit nicely into Barrick\u2019s strategy of expanding in the Pacific Rim and capitalizing on rising copper demand from the electric vehicle industry.  Bristow said he believes copper will be \u201cthe most-strategic metal on this planet\u201d in a decade.  A Freeport spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview with Reuters last week, Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson declined to discuss Barrick.  Bristow last February launched a hostile takeover bid for rival gold miner Newmont Corporation NEM.N. The fight turned nasty - Bristow at one point called Newmont's then-CEO a \"loser\" - but ultimately Bristow got what he wanted: a cost-saving joint venture between the two companies in Nevada.  Buying all of Freeport, which traces its roots back to 1834, could bring legacy risk associated with old mines, Bristow said.  Freeport in late 2018 relinquished majority control of Grasberg under pressure from the Indonesian government. The deal smoothed relations with Jakarta and keeps Freeport the mine\u2019s operator until 2041.  Freeport is now spending more than $15 billion to expand Grasberg in what will be the largest underground mine ever developed.  Struggling with unrest at the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea (PNG), Bristow said Barrick offered the government a 52% share of the economic benefits of the mine in response to government demands for a larger stake.  If Barrick succeeds in resolving the dispute in PNG, the market will be more comfortable with the company taking on more risk the Pacific Rim, Bristow said.","62":"Feb 26 (Reuters) - Northisle Copper And Gold Inc:  * NORTHISLE FORMS A JOINT VENTURE WITH FREEPORT-MCMORAN MINERAL PROPERTIES CANADA INC ON ITS PEMBERTON HILLS COPPER PROPERTY  * NORTHISLE COPPER AND GOLD - UNDER JV TERMS, FREEPORT MAY EARN UP TO 65% INTEREST IN PEMBERTON PROPERTY BY FUNDING CAD24 MILLION EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES  * NORTHISLE COPPER AND GOLD - UPON COMPLETION OF FIRST OPTION, A JOINT VENTURE CO TO BE FORMED TO OPERATE PROPERTY UNDER SHAREHOLDER\u2019S AGREEMENT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","63":"JAKARTA, Dec 21 (Reuters) -  * A special mining permit given to Freeport McMoRan unit PT Freeport Indonesia on Friday is valid up to 2031, and could be extended to 2041, an energy ministry official said  * Copper ore output from Freeport\u2019s Grasberg mine is expected to decline in 2019 once open pit mining ends this year, Freeport Indonesia chief executive Tony Wenas said  * Output from the mine is expected to increase once again in 2020, Wenas said (Writing by Fergus Jensen; editing by David Evans)","64":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Workers at Indonesia\u2019s Grasberg gold and copper mine operated by the local unit of Freeport-McMoRan Inc extended a protest into a second day on Tuesday as they demanded an easing of a coronavirus lockdown  More than 1,000 mine workers had joined the second day of protests and blocked access to the world\u2019s second-largest copper mine in the easternmost region of Papua, Yonpis Tabuni, a workers\u2019 representative said.  \u201cOur demand is not met yet.

The agreement will give Indonesia control of the Grasberg mine, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine, and should cap years of wrangling over the mining rights for the site. Last August, the two sides agreed to let Freeport keep operating the mine while ceding control.  Indonesian President Joko Widodo said an initial agreement had been reached for Inalum to increase its stake in Freeport\u2019s local unit to 51 percent from 9.36 percent. \u201cI think this is a leap forward. We have to have a larger amount of income from tax, royalties, dividends ... so, the value of our mining sector can benefit everybody,\u201d Widodo told reporters.  President Widodo said the state owned enterprises minister and the finance minister would give more details later on Thursday.  Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati is scheduled to sign a heads of agreement with PT Freeport Indonesia at 4 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Thursday, a ministry spokesman said earlier.  Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson is expected to attend the signing, along with Inalum Chief Executive Budi Gunadi Sadikin and several other ministers.  It was not immediately clear whether a resolution had been reached on how the mine will be managed by Freeport with Indonesia as the majority shareholder.  A Jakarta-based spokesman for Freeport declined to comment.  During Freeport\u2019s five decades of operating Grasberg, located in Indonesia\u2019s easternmost province of Papua, there has been frequent friction between the government and the company over revenue sharing and the mine\u2019s social and environmental impact.  Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport has been in negotiations with Indonesia to secure long-term operating rights at Grasberg after the government introduced new rules aimed at giving Jakarta greater control over the nation\u2019s resources.  Efforts to finalise a deal have been complicated by concerns over the environmental impact of the project.  With presidential elections due in 2019, sealing a deal to get a majority stake for Indonesia in one of the world\u2019s biggest mining operations is a priority for President Widodo, who is widely expected to seek a second term in office.  A deal is also critical for Freeport, as it needs long-term certainty to push forward with the massive investment needed to develop an underground mining phase at Grasberg from the current open-pit construction.  As part of the acquisition deal, Inalum was expected to acquire the 40 percent participating interest in Grasberg held by mining giant Rio Tinto.

The move continues a recent acquisition spree for Zijin and strengthens its foothold in the Balkans, having entered Serbia when it took over local copper producer RTB Bor in 2018, before completing the purchase of Nevsun Resources, which also has interests in Serbia, for $1.4 billion this year.  Zijin will pay Freeport an initial $240 million for its stake in the lower zone of the Timok copper-gold mine, plus 0.4% of the net sales proceeds once production begins, up to an aggregate maximum amount of $150 million, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Zijin already has a 100% interest in the upper zone through its Nevsun acquisition and holds 60.4% of the lower zone. Freeport owns the rest of the lower zone but its holding was due to rise to 54% on completion of a feasibility study.  \u201cAfter completion of the transaction, the company will own 100% interests in the resources of both the upper zone and the lower zone,\u201d Zijin said, adding that the purchase would allow the company to increase its resources and further its internationalisation.  It said the acquisition would lift its total controlled copper resources by 7.72 million tonnes, or 15.6%, to 57.24 million tonnes on an equity basis, while its gold resources would rise by 161 tonnes, or 9.3%, to 1,889 tonnes.  Phoenix-based Freeport did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sale outside of normal business hours.  Development of the lower zone of Timok has not yet started but Zijin said the deal would help with unified planning, construction and operation of the project. Production from the upper zone is expected to begin in 2021, it added.  Zijin will also acquire Freeport\u2019s interests in five exploration licenses in the surrounding area, which are currently held by a Zijin-Freeport joint venture and have \u201cfavourable potential for prospecting,\u201d the statement said.  Zijin expects the transaction to be completed no later than Feb. 29, 2020.

The U.S. miner has spent billions of dollars in the switch from a depleting open pit mine and to develop a coexisting underground mine that would help achieve low cost, long life production and generate significant future cash flows.  Copper production at Grasberg fell 14% in the fourth quarter, while total production of the metal dropped 1.7% to 827 million pounds.  The company said it expects capital expenditure for 2020 to be about $2.8 billion, higher than last year, including $1.8 billion for major projects. It has also earmarked another $500 million for the development of a new smelter in Indonesia.  \u201cWe think the market has taken a very short term view of 2020 and focused on the capex related to the smelter, the first quarter guidance and the cash costs\u201d, said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry.  Unit net cash costs are expected to average $1.75 per pound of copper for 2020, the company said, compared with $1.74 last year.  Freeport forecast sales of 725 million pounds of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold in the first quarter.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said copper will benefit even during modest global growth, but added current prices are still well below the incentive needed to attract new supply.  The average price Freeport received for its copper fell marginally to $2.74 per pound in the fourth quarter.

Freeport is in the midst of carrying out a $15 billion project to expand Indonesia\u2019s massive Grasberg copper and gold mine from an open pit to an underground operation, a complex and time-intensive process that is nevertheless essential to help Freeport stem an erosion in production.  Freeport said its costs would likely rise to $1.75 per pound of copper this year, the second consecutive forecast increase since January, surprising investors. The price Freeport receives for its copper fell 7 percent to $2.90 per pound in the quarter.  \u201cThe slight uptick in cost guidance was disappointing,\u201d said Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Jeremy Sussman.  Copper production fell 18 percent in the quarter to 750 million pounds, more than many analysts expected, with the largest drop in Indonesia.  Shares of the company fell 8 percent to $12.49 in afternoon trading after the earnings miss. Broader markets were mixed.  The stock had gained about 35 percent since January, outpacing copper prices.  Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in an interview earlier this month that the Grasberg expansion will be the company\u2019s main focus for the next two years and that Freeport will forgo any dividend raises or large-scale acquisitions in the interim.  The expansion will, Adkerson hopes, mark a pivot to massive growth for the company just as copper demand surges for use in electric cars and other electronics. But the growth comes at a high cost and is testing the patience of Wall Street, where investors often look for quicker paybacks on investment projects.  The Phoenix-based company posted first quarter net income of $31 million, or 2 cents per share, compared with net income of $692 million, or 48 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Excluding onetime items, Freeport earned 5 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 7 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Grasberg is also a major gold producer and output of gold and molybdenum also slipped during the quarter.

Freeport settled with Jiangxi Copper, Tongling Nonferrous Metals and China Copper Corp in three separate deals at the same price, Javier Targhetta, president of Atlantic Copper and senior vice president for marketing and sales at Freeport told Reuters.  The charges, paid by miners to smelters to process ore into refined metal, were set at $62 a tonne and 6.2 cents per pound, down from $80.80 a tonne and 8.08 cents per pound in 2019, reflecting tight concentrate supply and China\u2019s rising processing capacity.  The agreements, made on the sidelines of the Asia Copper Week gathering in Shanghai, saw the TC\/RCs benchmark falling for a fifth straight year to its lowest since 2011. The charges were set as high as $107 per tonne and 10.7 cents per lb in 2015.  A senior executive at Tongling confirmed the settlement with Freeport. Jiangxi and China Copper did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The TC\/RCs benchmark is referenced in major long-term deals globally and plays a big role in determining profitability at both ends of the copper supply chain. Smelters prefer high TC\/RCs, while miners want low charges.  A senior official at another major Chinese smelter said the benchmark was \u201cextremely bad news\u201d and that they \u201ccannot swallow\u201d such low prices, adding that the low settlement would lead to a production cut.  A Jiangxi executive said earlier this week that his company needs TC of at least around $75 a tonne to break even.  The charges have been under pressure due to tight concentrate supply and rising smelting and refining capacity in China. They fall when the supply of ore tightens, as smelters compete to get supplies.  Spot TC\/RCs AM-CN-CUCONC, used in smaller and short-term deals, fell sharply this year to seven-year lows of $52 a tonne in August and September after China rapidly expanded its capacity. They are currently assessed at $59.50 a tonne.  \u201cIn my opinion it\u2019s a fair settlement that represents well the market situation we forecast for 2020,\u201d Freeport\u2019s Targhetta added, having said on Tuesday that a $60 TC would be a \u201creasonable\u201d level.  All other terms of the deals for 2020 with Tongling and Jiangxi would be rolled over from the previous year, he added.  Codelco, the world\u2019s biggest copper producer, would follow the \u201cvery reasonable\u201d Freeport-Jiangxi agreement, said a company source who was not authorised to speak to the media and so declined to be identified.  \u201cIt is very good news for us. I believe this $62 will be the benchmark for 2020, but the spot price will remain quite lower than $62,\u201d said Behrouz Rahmati, an investment manager and advisor to the CEO at National Iranian Copper Industries Company.  Chinese smelters are set to add 900,000 tonnes of annual smelting capacity this year and could add another 350,000 tonnes in 2020, research house Antaike said.  Official data showed refined copper output in China, the world\u2019s biggest copper consumer, hit a record 868,000 tonnes in October, while global copper mine production declined by about 0.5% in the first eight months of 2019, latest data by the International Copper Study Group showed.","85":"(Reuters) - Shares of Freeport-McMoRan Inc FCX.N fell more than 14 percent on Tuesday after the miner revealed onerous environmental demands from Indonesia's government that could delay a new contract for its massive Grasberg copper mine.  The world\u2019s biggest listed copper miner also lowered its copper sales forecast for the year while raising its outlook for costs, and reported a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit.  Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport has been in tricky negotiations with Indonesia to secure long-term operating rights at Grasberg, after the government introduced new rules last year aimed at giving it greater control of its resources.  On Tuesday, the company said the environment ministry wants it to change the way it manages the disposal of mine waste, or tailings, at the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine. The current disposal system has been in place for the last 20 years.  \u201cWe had an agreement with the government that over the life of the mine, we would retain 50 percent of the tailings on land. They\u2019re now saying it should be 95 percent, which just cannot be done,\u201d Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said on a conference call.  He described the ministry\u2019s demands as \u201cshocking\u201d and \u201cdisappointing\u201d but said he was confident that a resolution would be found. He also said that the tailings, which are moved from the mine in a high-lying area by a river system to a cordoned-off area in lowlands, were benign.  Despite the reassurances, Freeport\u2019s stock fell to its weakest level in four months, touching $16.06.  The market was speculating that the government\u2019s tougher stance on tailings \u201ccould potentially prolong negotiations on divestment,\u201d Clarksons Platou analyst Jeremy Sussman said.  In exchange for securing the right to keep operating Grasberg, Freeport has to divest a 51-percent stake in the mine to the government, which currently owns 9.36 percent of Freeport Indonesia.  Earlier, Freeport reduced its copper production forecast for this year to 3.8 billion pounds from 3.9 billion and raised its copper cash cost forecast to $1.01 a pound from a previous 97 cents.  The company also highlighted seismic issues at Grasberg that could lower production in 2019.  Attributable profits rose to $692 million, or 47 cents per share, in the quarter ended March, from $228 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier, helped by higher copper prices.  But excluding one-time charges, profit was 46 cents per share, well below analysts\u2019 forecasts for 56 cents.","86":"JAKARTA, Feb 19 (Reuters) -  * Indonesia issued the local unit of copper miner Freeport McMoRan Inc with a quota to export 1,247,866 wet metric tonnes (wmt) of copper concentrate up to Feb 15, 2019, a mining ministry official said on Monday.  * Medco Energi Internasional unit Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara was also issued with a quota to export 450,826 wmt of copper concentrate over same period, Minerals Director Bambang Susigit told Reuters by text message.

Freeport accepted far less than it could have gotten for its majority Grasberg stake, highlighting the company\u2019s desire to end an acrimonious chapter that had weighed on its shares for more than six years. The company risked getting nothing had the case moved to arbitration.  Shares of Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport were down slightly in Thursday afternoon trading.  \u201cFreeport left money on the table to get this deal done,\u201d Freeport Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said on a conference call with investors after a signing ceremony in Jakarta. \u201cIt\u2019s a new day for Freeport, and a new day for our working with the government.\u201d  It was not immediately clear if the agreement would be binding. While Freeport and Rio both said the agreement was non-binding, Jakarta said it was a binding deal.  The transactions will be completed this month, said State-Owned Enterprises Minister Rini Soemarno.  The deal could be a boon for Freeport\u2019s stock, which has fallen behind peers. Most analysts believe the stock should trade about 14 percent above current levels, according to Thomson Reuters data.  \u201cJust to have clarity is critically important because for many investors, Freeport has been uninvestable because of the uncertainty around Grasberg,\u201d Jefferies mining analyst Christopher LaFemina said in an interview.  Under the agreement, Indonesian state-owned miner PT Inalum plans to acquire the Indonesian unit of Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L, which holds a 40 percent participating interest in Grasberg, for $3.5 billion.  That interest would then be transferred to Freeport\u2019s local unit, PT Freeport Indonesia, and converted into a 40 percent equity holding in the unit via a rights issuance that would then be given to Inalum.  A subsequent purchase of the share of Grasberg held by Freeport unit PT Indocopper Investama, valued at $350 million, would give Indonesia a total holding of 51.38 percent in Freeport Indonesia.  Estimates on the value of that stake vary. Jefferies values it at $800 million, while some estimates are lower.  Freeport, which will hold about 49 percent of Grasberg when the agreement is set, has also agreed to build a smelter in Indonesia within five years of the deal being signed, Adkerson said.  The two sides had agreed in principle last August to a deal. Thursday\u2019s agreement hammers out most of the specifics.  Rio for its part said it hoped for binding agreements by the end of the year, adding in a statement \u201cthere is no certainty that a transaction will be completed.\u201d  ROYALTIES  Indonesian President Joko Widodo praised the agreement as \u201ca leap forward.\u201d  \u201cWe have to have a larger amount of income from tax, royalties, dividends ... so the value of our mining sector can benefit everybody,\u201d Widodo said at the ceremony.  Sealing a deal to get a majority stake for Indonesia in Grasberg is a priority for Widodo, who is widely expected to seek a second term in office in presidential elections next year.  The deal is also critical for the massive investment needed to develop underground mines at Grasberg as the current open-pit operation is phased out this year.  Still, planned agreements on how Freeport will manage mine operations with Inalum as the majority shareholder also need to be resolved.  Adkerson, Freeport\u2019s CEO since 2003, said that under the agreement Freeport alone will have authority to manage mine operations, but Inalum will work as an equal partner at the board level.  Inalum wants Freeport to \u201ctake the lead,\u201d he said, because Grasberg is \u201cthe most complicated mine in the world to operate.\u201d The high-altitude mine operates in an extremely rugged and remote area of New Guinea surrounded by jungle.  Efforts to finalise a deal have been complicated by concerns over the environmental impact of the project, in particular its handling of mine waste or tailings.  Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya must still issue a recommendation to Freeport Indonesia before the miner can secure the rights to Grasberg up to 2041.","88":"(Corrects gold output in paragraph 5 to say 223,000 ounces, from 223 million ounces)  Jan 23 (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded copper producer, reported a drop in quarterly profit on Thursday, hit mainly by a tax provision and lower output from its Indonesian operations.

REUTERS\/Muhammad Yamin\/File Photo  But as months of travel curbs dragged on, angry workers blockaded the mine for four days in August until the operator - a unit of U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan Inc - relented and let them resume weekly rotations out of the site via a four-hour trek by cable car and bus to towns below.  Now the workers are happier, but health experts fear the greater risk of a new outbreak.  The tensions expose the balancing act to maintain output at full blast, while containing COVID-19 in mines like Grasberg, the world\u2019s largest gold mine and second-largest copper mine.  \u201cWe\u2019ve put the priority and the health of our workers and community at the top of our list,\u201d Freeport McMoRan Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told Reuters. \u201cFrom the outset, we recognized that (Grasberg) was a particularly vulnerable place due to the size of the workforce\u201d of nearly 30,000 people.  While Freeport has halted some global operations due to the pandemic, production has continued at the 14,000 foot (4,267 metre) -high Grasberg mine despite Indonesia facing one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Southeast Asia.  In May, Freeport said it would operate with a \u201cskeletal team\u201d because of a rise in coronavirus cases in the area, including at the workers\u2019 living quarters. Freeport said at the time it was limiting contractors and removing \u201chigh-risk\u201d workers but did not specify how many people would be working at the mine.  But the lockdown took a psychological toll on the workers stuck above the clouds at the site since April, some of whom said that they were unable to attend funerals of family members.  \u201cWe were frustrated, we wanted to see our families. So we had to protest,\u201d said a worker, speaking from a dormitory shared with four others. He asked not to be named due to fears of losing his job.  Workers who were kept from working the mine were also unhappy because of lost wages.  RISK OF SECOND WAVE?  Grasberg is located in Papua province\u2019s Mimika regency, which has seen a steady rise in coronavirus cases. As of Oct. 8, there had been 1,902 cases in a population of about 224,000, the second-most infected area in Indonesia\u2019s easternmost province.  Five people have died of COVID-19 at the mine with 724 confirmed cases as of Sept. 29, according to Mining Industry Indonesia, the state company holding a majority stake in Freeport Indonesia.  Since the protests, workers have returned to a weekly crew-change roster, the local company PT Freeport Indonesia said, with about 400-500 workers leaving and entering the mine daily after temperatures checks and a rapid COVID-19 test.  If a rapid test is positive, this would be followed up by a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, which experts consider far more accurate.  Before the pandemic, twice as many workers would enter and leave the mine daily, Freeport Indonesia said.  Adkerson said Freeport is treating its employees for coronavirus free of charge at its own medical facilities.  Tri Yunis Miko Wahyono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, said crew changes should be less frequent to limit the risk of spreading the virus.  \u201cThe shortest crew change should be two weeks unless a company is willing to pay for PCR tests for every worker every week,\u201d he said.  But that strategy keeps workers on site longer, adding to potential friction with the company.  \u201cEVERYONE WANTS US TO KEEP WORKING\u201d  To help resolve the protests, Freeport Indonesia paid workers compensation of up to 15 million rupiah ($1,010) for working longer than usual, although it said it did not have responsibility for contractors, who make up nearly three quarters of the 29,201 workers.  A Freeport contractor said by telephone he had not received any payment yet, but the issue was being discussed with management and there were no plans for more protests.  Freeport is one of Indonesia\u2019s biggest taxpayers, with direct contributions of more than $16 billion in taxes, royalties, dividends and other payments between 1992 and 2015, according to company data.  The mine is also crucial for Freeport McMoRan, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded copper producer, which made a profit in the second quarter partly due to higher production at Grasberg.Operations at the Indonesian mine are expected to ramp up even further as it transitions from open pit to underground mining.  \u201cEveryone wants us to keep working.

The world\u2019s largest publicly listed copper miner has already warned that production at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia is expected to slip as it switches its operations to underground mining from open pit.  Meanwhile, demand for copper, especially from top consumer China, has declined in the past year as the prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war stifles global growth and hurts prices.  The average price Freeport received for its copper fell 6.4% in the third quarter to $2.62 per pound. Copper production fell 14%, while gold output was down 56.2% in the quarter.  Freeport said copper sales were also lower in South America, dented by lower grades and recovery rates at its Cerro Verde mine in Peru.  Anti-mining protests in Peru had held up about $400 million in copper exports from some of the country\u2019s top mines for nearly three weeks in August. Freeport was among miners that were unable to ship copper concentrates.

Uncertainty around the economic impact of a U.S.-China trade war has pushed copper prices lower in recent weeks, but Phoenix-based Freeport has not seen a decline in demand to date, Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said.  \u201cWe remain positive on the outlook for copper prices given limitations on supply and the important role of copper in the global economy,\u201d Adkerson said in a statement. \u201c(We) will be prepared to adjust our plans if necessary to respond to market conditions.\u201d  Freeport reported a second-quarter adjusted profit of 58 cents per share, up from 17 cents a year earlier when results where hurt by a strike and operational issues at its giant Grasberg mine and well ahead of analysts\u2019 average expectation for a profit of 52 cents per share.  Earlier this month, Freeport said it would sell a majority stake in Grasberg, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine, to the Indonesian government via a series of complex deals including Rio Tinto worth $3.9 billion.  Separately on Tuesday, Indonesia\u2019s parliament asked the government to recalculate Grasberg damages to the environment, estimated in a 2017 report at $13.25 billion, though the rationale was unclear.  Freeport said it is now negotiating with the government on legal and fiscal terms for a new permit that would run through 2041.  Mining at the Grasberg open pit is being extended by six months, Freeport said, and lower copper and gold production is expected as operations transition underground in 2019 and 2020.  Indonesia introduced new rules last year to gain greater control over mineral resources, requiring miners to divest a majority stake in their operations, relinquish arbitration rights and pay new taxes and royalties.  Freeport said second-quarter copper sales grew to 989 million pounds, from 942 million pounds, while gold sales rose to 676,000 ounces from 432,000 ounces.  It had forecast copper sales of 970 million pounds and gold sales at 700,000 ounces in April.  The average copper price rose to $3.08 per pound, from $2.65 a pound in the same period last year, while gold prices rose to $1,274 per ounce from $1,243.

The deal, in which Inalum will control a 51.23 percent stake in PT Freeport Indonesia, is expected to end more than nine years of wrangling between Freeport and Indonesia over ownership rights to Grasberg, the world\u2019s second-biggest copper mine.

That damage, it said, was largely a result of tailings from the mine that had extended beyond previously agreed limits and which had polluted coastal areas.  In April, in follow-up action to the audit, the environment minister issued two decrees that gave Freeport six months to overhaul the management of tailings from Grasberg. One of the decrees said Freeport would be barred from any activities in areas that lack environmental permits.  These matters have complicated the issue of a new mining permit for Grasberg, which would be held by Inalum.  Freeport Indonesia Executive Director Tony Wenas said his company was fully compliant with Indonesian environmental impact rules. Freeport hoped \u201cin the near future the Environment and Forestry Ministry issues a policy\u201d related to Grasberg, he said.  \u201cWe are discussing several options,\u201d Wenas said, referring to the possibility of reducing tailings sediment, methods for tailings removal and expansion of mangrove wetlands, among other options.

The drastic move underscores how fast the virus, which causes a sometimes deadly respiratory illness known as COVID-19, has torn through the global economy and affected demand for the key metals that underpin it.  Prices for copper, widely used in construction and manufacturing, are down more than 22% since January.  Phoenix-based Freeport said it will cut its 5-cent dividend, saving about $291 million annually. The company also is looking to slash costs and production at its mines across the world, including the world\u2019s largest gold mine and second-largest copper mine at Grasberg, Indonesia.  It was the company\u2019s first dividend cut since 2015.  \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered our world, bringing swift and significant disruption to all aspects of our society,\u201d Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in a public letter posted on the company\u2019s website.
