(Reporting by Gary McWilliams Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)","1":"(Reuters) - Oilfield service giants Schlumberger and General Electric Co\u2019s Baker Hughes missed second quarter revenue forecasts on Friday as slow international growth offset record production in the United States that boosted domestic demand for their services.  FILE PHOTO: The exterior of a Schlumberger Corporation building is pictured in West Houston January 16, 2015.REUTERS\/Richard Carson\/File Photo  The Houston-based companies were the first among their peers to report earnings, putting them under scrutiny from analysts seeking clues about the health of the industry. Schlumberger, the world\u2019s largest oilfield services firm, is viewed a as bellwether for the global oil and gas industry due to its heavy international exposure.  Schlumberger\u2019s overall revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter to $8.30 billion, missing analysts\u2019 estimate of $8.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Revenue from Schlumberger\u2019s international business dragged the overall performance down: it grew 4 percent in the quarter to $5.07 billion, but remained 1.4 percent below a year ago.  GE\u2019s Baker Hughes reported total revenue of $5.55 billion, versus analysts\u2019 forecasts of $5.57 billion, according to I\/B\/E\/S. Baker Hughes\u2019 revenues were hurt by its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses.  The performances reflect how a relatively slow recovery in international markets, where oil projects are often more costly, continues to drag down earnings for large integrated service firms, even as surging U.S. production helps.  U.S. oil production last week hit a record 11 million barrels per day, marking a dramatic comeback in an industry that had been hard hit by the 2014 oil price crash.  Wall Street analysts were not fazed by the missed estimates, and instead focused their attention on stronger-than-expected sequential growth in international markets and upbeat comments from executives.  \u201cBoth companies were much more optimistic about the global land and offshore recovery than in previous conference calls,\u201d said James West, a senior managing director for investment banking firm Evercore ISI.  Shares of Schlumberger were trading at $66.86 in afternoon trade, off a fraction of a percent. Baker Hughes was up about 0.8 percent at $32.04.  Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, topped $80 a barrel in the second quarter, its strongest level in roughly three and a half years amid an effort by major oil producers to cut production and stabilize prices and supply disruptions.  UPBEAT FORECASTS  Schlumberger said it expected to fully utilize its international equipment in the fourth quarter of this year and forecasted double digit growth in that segment next year.  \u201cThe broader-based recovery has finally started,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on the company\u2019s conference call.  Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said his firm was seeing positive indications from a number of international markets and that longer-cycle activity should drive growth in its oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses going forward.  \u201cThis is what people have been looking for - the inflection in the international business. It is starting to materialize now,\u201d said Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago, referencing the firm\u2019s sequential growth.  Revenue from Schlumberger\u2019s North America operations jumped about 43 percent to $3.14 billion.  Both companies said they have yet to see the impacts of pipeline constraints in the Permian, where growing production is quickly outpacing available takeaway capacity.  Schlumberger warned the constraints could slow growth in the coming months, but said it plans to continue deploying hydraulic fracturing fleets.  The bottlenecks have sent the price of local crude down to an almost $15 a barrel discount to benchmark prices at Cushing, Oklahoma.  Revenues in GE\u2019s Baker Hughes\u2019 oilfield services unit, which accounts for more than half of its overall sales, rose 14 percent year over year to approximately $2.9 billion, driven by stronger activity in North America.  Last month conglomerate General Electric said it would divest its stake in Baker Hughes in a bid to simplify its business and boost shareholder returns, less than a year after merging with the services firm.","2":"DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - U.S. oil output growth is expected to slow over the next five years, likely prompting oil majors to \u201cgobble up\u201d smaller shale oil producers, Mark Papa, shale pioneer and non-executive chairman of Schlumberger, told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: Mark Papa, then CEO of EOG Resources, speaks at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference in Houston March 6, 2013. REUTERS\/Richard Carson\/File Photo  U.S. output surged to nearly 13 million bpd last year, making it the world\u2019s largest producer.  The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecast U.S. oil production growth at 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2020, with shale accounting for most of the increase.  But Papa, boss of the world\u2019s largest oilfield services company, expects U.S. output to grow by just 400,000 bpd in 2020 and by 100,000-500,000 bpd per year through 2025, depending on future oil prices.  \u201cWhat we are seeing is that there has been a kind of inflection in the growth path for U.S. oil production, mainly due to inflection in shale oil growth,\u201d Papa said in an interview in Saudi Arabia.  He cited the shorter life and high decline rates of shale reservoirs such as the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in Texas.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying that the U.S. shale oil will go away but I\u2019m saying it will become a less powerful force as we go through the 2020s than it was in the previous decade,\u201d he said.  Global demand is seen to grow by about 1 million bpd a year over the next five years, but that growth in demand would be met more by OPEC oil producers, he said.  Over the last decade, the shale revolution turned the United States into a major force in energy exports, however, it failed to boost profits, which has discouraged investors.  The shale industry was squeezed by an OPEC price war that began in 2014, sending U.S. crude prices below $30 per barrel at one point.  That drove shale companies to cut costs and become more efficient.  Now, with investor returns flagging, the industry no longer believes in drilling its way to success even at higher prices and financing for new production has been sharply limited.  Analysts believe that even if oil prices were to remain above $60 a barrel this year, it will not spur another production spurt because of the pressure for returns.  Papa said U.S. shale crude producers need a price of $55 per barrel to break even, above which they can achieve an adequate return on investment.  Over the last couple of years oil prices have generally been lower, what has reduced the amount of capital available to the industry.  \u201cWhat is likely to happen over the next 5 to 10 years is that some of the smaller companies will get consolidated... get gobbled up by the majors,\u201d Papa said.  \u201cToday Exxon Mobil, Chevron and even BP are becoming bigger in the shale oil business and probably five years from now those three companies will be even bigger and there will be less of the small companies.\u201d  Papa also expects the rise in gas flaring and venting in the Permian Basin in Texas to end by mid-2020 helped by a slowdown in the drilling of new wells and an increase in gas pipeline capacity.","3":"(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV SLB.N, the world's largest oilfield services provider, reported a slight profit beat on Friday but cautioned that North American growth would slow due to transportation bottlenecks and hurt results next quarter.  The exterior of the Schlumberger Corporation headquarters building is pictured in the Galleria area of Houston January 16, 2015. REUTERS\/Richard Carson  Although quarterly profits rose from a year ago, the company has been hit by slower-than-anticipated growth in the largest U.S. Permian Basin. Production has outpaced available pipeline takeaway capacity and driven prices lower, but Schlumberger expects the bottlenecks to be resolved in the next 12 to 18 months.  \u201cThe North America land market is changing pretty rapidly,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said during a third-quarter earnings call.  The \u201crapid softening\u201d in both hydraulic fracturing activity and pricing seen during the second half of the third quarter will continue at the same pace into the fourth quarter, he added.  Schlumberger, the first oilfield service provider to report earnings, is seen as a bellwether for the industry. The company warned investors last month that slowing activity in North America was affecting its business.  Shares of Schlumberger were up 2.3 percent at $59.76. The stock hit an 7-year low this week.  Schlumberger said \u201cseveral key customers\u201d were opting to stop using hydraulic fracturing fleets later this year and into January.  \u201cThis is presenting terms challenges in terms of white spaces in the calendar,\u201d Kibsgaard said.  The company reported a profit of $644 million, or 46 cents per share, up about 18 percent from a year ago. Analysts anticipated earnings of 45 cents, excluding items, according to Refinitiv data.  Schlumberger also echoed concerns cited on previous investor calls that poor oil and gas reservoirs and well performance in North America could prompt production gains to fall short of expectations.  Analysts from investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said the results were within expectations but \u201cunlikely to bring investors rushing off sidelines\u201d and back into the sector.  International revenue rose 1.3 percent to $5.22 billion, while revenue from North America jumped about 23 percent to $3.20 billion.  \u201cWe may have seen the bottom in the international markets. The commentary seems more upbeat,\u201d said Brian Youngberg, an Edward Jones analyst.  Total revenue rose to $8.5 billion from $7.91 billion a year ago. Analysts looked for $8.58 billion, according to Refinitiv data.","4":"(Reuters) - Oilfield services bellwether Schlumberger NV on Friday is forecast to post modestly higher profits for its second quarter, but investors will be listening closely to what tech expert Olivier Le Peuch has to say about its future direction.  The 55-year-old Frenchman, appointed as Schlumberger\u2019s chief operating officer in February and seen as its CEO- in-waiting, is being watched for signs he plans to return the top oil services provider by revenue to its roots in high-tech equipment and services.  Since current CEO Paal Kibsgaard took charge in August 2011, the company has overspent on costly program-management ventures, paid $430 million for pressure pumping gear as the market became oversaturated, and seen its share price tumble about 58%. Its stock is rated \u201cbuy\u201d by just 63% of analysts, below rival Halliburton at 82%, and Baker Hughes GE at 79%.  Le Peuch, an electrical engineer by training with more than three decades at the company, is expected to take over this year from Kibsgaard. Last quarter, Le Peuch outlined results in the company\u2019s global operations and offered its forecast for second-quarter profit of 35 cents a share, up 13% from a year ago.  Schlumberger declined to make Le Peuch available for an interview.  Analysts said Le Peuch\u2019s deep background in technology will be critical at a time when digitalization is changing the oil industry. He has run Schlumberger\u2019s software units as well as its well-completions and offshore businesses.  TECH DOMINANCE  \u201cThey\u2019ve always been a leader in oilfield technology, with the one exception being (hydraulic) fracturing. Several competitors have made incremental improvements that have gained market share,\u201d said Paul Mecray III, a managing director for investment firm Tower Bridge Advisors who has followed Schlumberger for more than 50 years.  \u201cThey have to maintain it,\u201d he said.  Unlike Kibsgaard, who joined the firm from Exxon Mobil in the 1990s and quickly rose through the ranks, Le Peuch started in custom software development for Schlumberger\u2019s wireline measurement businesses and got his first big break as a president of its Information Solutions unit in 2004.  Le Peuch also was part of the teams that drove Schlumberger\u2019s purchase of software maker Technoguide in 2002, according to former colleagues, and later acquisitions of two well-completions businesses, and pursued a joint venture with offshore firm Subsea 7.  Technoguide developed the highly profitable Petrel E&P software, which allows geologists to visualize oil reservoirs and drilling engineers to plan production systems.  That deal to buy Technoguide helped propel Le Peuch to president of Schlumberger\u2019s Information Solutions, a role that former colleagues said will help him steer the company as the industry becomes more digital technology focused.  \u201cIn the early 2000s to 2010, he was right in the thick of the forefront of Schlumberger\u2019s big advance in expanding the range and profitability of software offerings,\u201d according to Ram Shenoy, a former Schlumberger executive who spent two decades at the company, most recently as its vice president of research.  GROOMED FOR TOP JOB  Le Peuch has been groomed for the top job through a series of key assignments. He was vice president of engineering and manufacturing, a job earlier held by Kibsgaard, and later ran Schlumberger\u2019s offshore unit Cameron, which it bought in 2016.  Analysts are counting on Le Peuch to move away from the all-encompassing projects championed by Kibsgaard. He sought to buck the industry\u2019s capital spending decline by taking equity stakes in big oil and gas projects, which were criticized as competing with customers.  But after investing billions on such projects, and writing down investments, the firm has said it would halt such investments and seek to sell some of those stakes.  \u201cWhile Olivier has been part of the senior management team for a while and was a part of the decisions, you will see a return to Schlumberger\u2019s roots as a pure oilfield service and equipment company,\u201d said James West, an analyst for Evercore ISI.  \u201cHe\u2019ll put more emphasis on digitalization, technologies, and machine learning,\u201d West added.","5":"March 24 (Reuters) - Schlumberger, the world\u2019s largest oilfield services company, on Tuesday said it would cut spending by 30% this year versus 2019 as oil prices collapse and it prepares for a downturn.

(Reporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)","6":"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV SLB.N expects to book a charge to earnings of up to $1.4 billion for an accelerated restructuring and new job cuts, Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said at a energy conference on Tuesday.  Le Peuch said the restructuring will include cuts in the company\u2019s product lines and focus the company\u2019s operations on five key oil basins. It is expected to save about $1.5 billion in annual costs.  The restructuring comes as oil prices have collapsed to under $40 a barrel as the COVID-19 pandemic hurt fuel demand. Le Peuch, who was appointed CEO a year ago, was already reshaping Schlumberger before the pandemic by side-lining hydraulic fracturing equipment and beefing up its focus on technology.  Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Energy, Power and Renewables conference Le Peuch told investors the decline in oilfield activity had been \u201csharper than expected\u201d, especially in U.S. land operations, which saw a drop-off of around 60%.  One-time charges associated with the restructuring and headcount reductions will be between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. There may be additional costs incurred from a \u201crationalization\u201d of the company\u2019s assets, the CEO said.  Le Peuch also outlined to investors plans for its New Energy group, which will focus on marketing low-carbon or carbon-neutral technology. That group has begun working with startup Celsius Energy in France to develop geothermal as a building heating and cooling source, and is launching a second venture, called Genvia, to produce hydrogen fuel from water.  He also emphasized the growing importance of digital technology, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic.  \u201cThe recent crisis accelerated customer acceptance of remote drilling operations,\u201d he said, noting that Schlumberger had seen a 30% increase in that area over the first quarter.  The company was able to reduce headcount by 25% when operating remotely, and will reach a 50% reduction on some wellsites, he said.","7":"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV SLB.N said on Friday it would spend less in 2019 and forecast single-digit growth in international markets this year, sending its shares as much as 5 percent higher.  FILE PHOTO: The exterior of a Schlumberger Corp building is pictured in West Houston Jan. 16, 2015. Schlumberger, is the world's No.1 oilfield services provider. REUTERS\/Richard Carson\/File Photo  With the sharp drop in oil prices since 2014 many producers have evaluated spending budgets for 2019, stoking concerns that a slowdown in activity would hurt oilfield service companies, which have struggled to boost their prices.  Schlumberger, a bellwether for the oilfield services sector, expects full-year 2019 capital expenditure of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, versus $2.2 billion in 2018, driven by lower spending in North America, Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on an earnings call.  Shares of Schlumberger rose more than 5 percent to $43.60 in early trading.  \u201cThe downward guidance for 2019 capital expenditures helped solidify the dividend is safe,\u201d said Brian Youngberg, a senior energy analyst for Edward Jones.  Schlumberger said recent volatility in crude prices has led to even more uncertainty in the spending outlook for oil and gas producers. Crude prices have tumbled roughly 30 percent since October.  \u201cFuture investments will likely be much closer to a level that can be covered by free cash flow,\u201d Kibsgaard said about its U.S. operator customers.  But he said that even as operators tighten their purse strings, the company had built \u201csignificant flexibility\u201d into its 2019 operating plan. He also said supply cuts by OPEC and Russia could lead to a gradual recovery in oil prices in 2019.  And after several years of underinvestment, the company anticipates growth in international markets, driven by higher activity in regions including Latin America, Africa and Asia.  Revenue from Schlumberger\u2019s North America business rose 0.3 percent year over year to $2.82 billion, while international revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $5.28 billion.  Schlumberger warned in early December that fourth-quarter North America revenue would take a hit due to steeper-than-anticipated declines in the hydraulic fracturing market.  Revenue from its OneStim hydraulic fracturing businesses slid 25 percent sequentially in the fourth quarter, prompting the company to idle some of its fleets late in the fourth quarter, it said.  While analysts called Schlumberger\u2019s results neutral to positive, investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co noted they would not \u201cdo much to make investors feel a sense of urgency to dive headlong into OFS (oilfield service) stocks.\u201d  Fourth-quarter net income was $538 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.26 billion, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier when it took $2.7 billion in charges, including a $938 million write-down on its Venezuelan holdings and unpaid bills there.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 36 cents per share, in line with analysts\u2019 estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Schlumberger executives have said oil companies will have to increase spending to overcome declining output from existing fields and meet future demand.  Ayat\u2019s successor will face pressure from investors concerned about past investments by the company\u2019s Schlumberger Production Management, or SPM business, which takes direct stakes in oil projects.  \u201cIt\u2019s something that investors don\u2019t like. You buy Schlumberger because it is an oil services company, not a producer,\u201d said Cowen & Co analyst Marc Bianchi. The new CFO would have to continue selling assets from the unit, Bianchi said.  Last year, Schlumberger launched a reorganization to simplify its business structure. The company also has said it was slowing investments in the SPM business.  Schlumberger shares were off 1.3 percent at $67.20 on Monday, and are down about 16 percent over the last two years.  Improving Schlumberger\u2019s share price will hinge on exceeding revenue and profit expectations, Bianchi said. \u201cThey just need to start beating some quarters.\u201d  Schlumberger reports second quarter results on Friday. Revenues should move higher and the company should have a solid second half of 2018, James West, a senior managing director for Evercore ISI, wrote in a note on Monday.  Biguet previously held positions as Schlumberger\u2019s treasurer and as controller of operations, according to its financial filings. He has worked at Schlumberger since 1995 with roles in Venezuela, Canada and France before taking on his current position in December, 2017, according to his LinkedIn profile.  Biguet \u201cis very skilled in managing the organization,\u201d said one person familiar with proposed changes. \u201cNow, he needs to manage the Street.\u201d  Ayat started at Schlumberger in 1982, serving in several roles, including treasurer before becoming CFO in 2007.

FILE PHOTO: The exterior of a Schlumberger Corporation building is pictured in West Houston, Texas, U.S. on January 16, 2015. REUTERS\/Richard Carson\/File Photo  The 7-2 decision overturned a lower court\u2019s ruling that had enforced limits on applying U.S. patent law overseas and reduced by $93.4 million the damages sum that rival ION Geophysical Corp had to pay for infringing Schlumberger technology that helps find oil and gas beneath the ocean floor. Both companies are based in Houston.  The decision expands the ability of patent owners to recover foreign-based damages, increasing the threat posed by certain infringement lawsuits in the United States.  Internet-based companies and others had expressed concern that extending patent damages beyond national borders would expose U.S. high-technology firms to greater patent-related risks abroad.  For graphic on ION Geophysical shares whipsawed by Supreme Court ruling click tmsnrt.rs\/2K9GWv2  The ruling initially sent ION\u2019s shares into a tailspin, diving as much as 20 percent at one point and triggering a 5-minute trading halt in the shares on the New York Stock Exchange. ION shares steadily recovered the loss, however, and are little changed on the day.  Schlumberger shares, meanwhile, are up 4 percent, but most of that gain occurred before the ruling was released and on the heels of a modest oil output increase agreement that was reached by OPEC earlier on Friday.  U.S. patent law generally applies only domestically, but Schlumberger said that since the law protects against infringement that occurs when components of a patented invention are supplied from the U.S. for assembly abroad, it should be fully compensated for the infringement, including any lost foreign sales.  The high court agreed. Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said ION infringed patents owned by Schlumberger subsidiary WesternGeco in the United States.  The \u201coverseas events were merely incidental to the infringement,\u201d he said.  Writing for the dissent, Justice Neil Gorsuch said that allowing overseas damages extends U.S. patent owners\u2019 monopolies over an invention to foreign markets.  \u201cThat, in turn, would invite other countries to use their own patent laws and courts to assert control over our economy,\u201d Gorsuch said.  ION Chief Executive Brian Hanson said he was disappointed in the decision but that the company will press other arguments to avoid the damages when the case is returned to lower courts.  A spokeswoman for Schlumberger said the company was pleased with the decision allowing it to be \u201ccompensated fully for monetary damages caused by those who choose to infringe its patents.\u201d  The case involved four WesternGeco patents related to an invention that more efficiently completes marine seismic surveys to help identify oil and gas drilling locations.  ION developed a competing system and sold it to surveying companies abroad. WesternGeco sued in 2009, and a federal jury in Houston found that Ion infringed the patents and caused the company to lose contracts.  The jury awarded $12.5 million in royalties and $93.4 million in lost profits stemming from foreign contracts the company said it missed out on as a result of ION\u2019s infringement.  In 2015, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent issues, ruled that Schlumberger could not recoup the lost profits portion because U.S. patent law does not cover the overseas use of infringing products.  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration backed Schlumberger in the case. The case was made more complicated when the Federal Circuit on May 7 invalidated three of the patents at issue in the case, which could impact the overall damages owed.","16":"OSLO, April 18 (Reuters) - Offshore oil driller Seadrill aims to expand relations with Schlumberger, the world\u2019s largest oil services firm, and other suppliers to the global oil and gas industry, its chief executive told Reuters on Wednesday.

The negotiations cover drillers, well service crews, divers and other workers at oil industry subcontractors Baker Hughes , Vetco Gray, Weatherford, Oceaneering, Schlumberger and Subsea 7.  If a strike breaks out on Dec. 3, it could be escalated in the following weeks to encompass workers at the other firms.  Norway is western Europe\u2019s top petroleum exporting nation. A strike would not affect ongoing production of oil and gas but would disrupt other functions such as the drilling of new wells, said Espen Johannessen, Safe\u2019s union leader at Schlumberger.  Among the fields that would see an impact were Gullfaks, Statfjord and Valhall, he said, as well as a number of mobile offshore drilling rigs.  Schlumberger and the Norwegian Oil and Gas Associaiton which negotiates with the union on behalf of the oil service firms, were not immediately available for comment.  In total, around 700 workers are covered by the collective bargaining agreement between Safe and the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association (NOG), according to Norway\u2019s government-appointed wage mediator, who will oversee the negotiations.  In 2016, a three-week strike among Norwegian oil service workers disrupted the drilling of new wells but did not impact production.  The industry\u2019s core production workers, who are directly employed by oil firms and thus not part of the latest talks, settled their wage demands last month following a 10-day strike that cut output and rattled energy markets.  A larger labour union, Industri Energi, said in October it had agreed to a wage deal covering some 6,500 oil service workers and would not go on strike.  Safe has said the rights of some of its members have been eroded and it fears this could spread, with the potential consequence that wages in certain cases could be cut by as much as 47%.  Separately on Thursday, the planned escalation of a strike by security guards could close down a quarter of Norway\u2019s gas exports to Europe within the next few days, gas systems operator Gassco said.

FILE PHOTO: A general view of the world's first Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) pipe rack suspension bridge in Punta Europa, Equatorial Guinea, February 5, 2014. REUTERS\/Pascal Fletcher\/File Photo  Ophir Energy, the London-based company heading the Fortuna development, and Golar LNG, which operates floating LNG facilities, said Schlumberger had decided to withdraw due to problems with the project\u2019s financing.  Schlumberger was not immediately available for comment.  The Fortuna development would be west Africa\u2019s first deepwater LNG project and includes a floating terminal that liquefies gas offshore, not onshore as usual.  Reuters reported earlier this month the growing frustration of Equatorial Guinea\u2019s government at the delays and its ultimatum to take the project off Ophir or scrap it altogether.  Golar LNG participated in Fortuna as part of the OneLNG joint venture it had established with Schlumberger. On Thursday it said Schlumberger withdrew from OneLNG due to the financing problems and its own priorities for spending its resources.  Golar Chief Executive Iain Ross said funds would take time to find and may come from new equity partners that would replace Schlumberger.  \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s dead at all,\u201d Ross said of the project.  \u201cWe\u2019d like to keep the project going and we\u2019re also in discussion with other potential partners to replace Schlumberger on the project ... We believe in the project,\u201d he told investors on a conference call.  Ophir, which confirmed Schlumberger\u2019s departure from Fortuna, also hinted at finding new equity partners.  \u201cOphir has already held informal discussions with other, well-capitalised, potential partners for our Fortuna project. Following (Golar\u2019s) announcement ... we have now formalised discussions and are actively moving forward with them,\u201d it said.  \u201cHANGING BY A THREAD\u201d  Fortuna is a so-called FLNG project, a pioneering design that shrinks complex infrastructure typically spread over hundreds of acres onto a single vessel. Golar operates an FLNG in Cameroon which became the world\u2019s first converted FLNG project and boosted hopes for the Fortuna development.  Like FSRUs, vessels which regasify LNG offshore, FLNGs are expected to inject flexibility and liquidity into the global LNG market because once they become accepted technologies they will reduce the time and costs of developing and exporting gas.

Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch, who took the top job last year, promised to improve North American margins, including through staff cuts, asset sales and by idling equipment.  Schlumberger cut more than 1,400 jobs since the third quarter of 2019, and is exploring selling unprofitable businesses, Le Peuch said on a conference call. His plans calls for an asset-light strategy that emphasizes higher-margin software and technical services.  Wall Street analysts said the report was generally positive, pointing to strong international growth and lower costs in North America.  Shares were up 50 cents at $39.28 in early trading. The stock lost more than 10% last year even as the S&P 500 index of large companies rose 29%.  Le Peuch plans to further pare its OneStim hydraulic fracturing business, which it expanded through a $430-million acquisition just two years ago. It is cutting the number of active fracking fleets, bringing the total reduction to 50%.  The company confirmed a Reuters report that Schlumberger was exploring a sale of a business that helps boost production from aging oil and gas wells. It also plans to halt another North American business that lets producers service live wells onshore.  International markets, which make up 70% of Schlumberger\u2019s business, were a bright spot for the company. Revenue rose 8% to $5.72 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with a 13% decline in North America.  It forecast 2020 spending by oil and gas companies internationally to rise about 5%, with revenue in its international division growing at the same pace or higher excluding asset sales.  Le Peuch, however, warned OPEC-led output cuts would slow investments in Russia and the Middle East in coming months, and its business in Iraq would decline due to U.S.-Iran tensions. North American business will also drop in the first quarter in a low-single digit percentage, he said.

Its earnings of 35 cents a share were in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but shares fell as much as 3% in early trading amid forecasts for continued soft demand for oilfield services in North America.  \u201cNorth America remains a challenging environment,\u201d Le Peuch told investors on Friday during a conference call, pointing to softer pricing and an overcapacity of equipment, particularly in hydraulic fracturing.  Le Peuch, 55, said Wall Street estimates of a 42 cent-per-share third-quarter profit were achievable, but added there was \u201cno visible upside.\u201d The company earned 46 cents a share a year earlier.  Byron Pope, an oilfield analyst at investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said Le Peuch, who takes over Aug. 1, did not say how his strategy would deviate from that of outgoing CEO Paal Kibsgaard, adding that disappointing drilling margins initially could have sent shares lower.  Mark Papa, an investor who built EOG Resources into one of the most profitable U.S. shale companies, will become non-executive chairman, replacing Kibsgaard, 52, the company said. Kibsgaard signaled that finance chief Simon Ayat will retire, without setting a date.  Schlumberger will pay Kibsgaard $2 million annually for the next three years to provide transition consulting services, the company said.  Le Peuch will receive a $1.4 million salary increase on his base pay of $1 million, according to a regulatory filing. He will be eligible for a bonus of 150% of his base salary, and share grants valued at roughly $10.5 million.  In 2018, Kibsgaard\u2019s total compensation was $16.2 million, down from $20.8 million the year prior, according to a February proxy statement.  Schlumberger has benefited from a modest uptick in international markets since 2018 after a prolonged slump in oil prices. But its earnings have been hampered by heavy investments and softer demand for some services.  International revenue rose 8% year-over-year to $5.46 billion in the quarter, but revenue in North America fell 11%, to $2.8 billion.

This agreement follows comments on May 4 from the Director general at Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS) Vajira Dassanayake, who said Sri Lanka would sign agreements with French oil company Total and Eastern Echo DMCC for a seismic study off its east coast.  Sri Lanka first signed a deal with Total in 2016 to conduct a study off the eastern coast but this did not take place.  Total had earlier signed a two-year agreement with PRDS to survey around 50,000 sq km off the east coast from the air, at a cost of $25 million to acquire data on unexplored areas.  Dassanayake earlier in May said Total would invest $3 million to $10 million for the seismic study, while Eastern Echo DMCC would carry out the marine survey.  Officials from Total and Schlumberger did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  CEO Paal Kibsgaard, speaking at the Scotia Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans, said the business known as Schlumberger Production Management (SPM), was cash-flow neutral last year and was expected to generate free cash flow beginning this year.  The company said last year it hoped to sell some of its SPM investments to recoup its costs. The business was formed in 2011 to help to diversify its equipment and services sales.  Schlumberger continues to offer stakes in existing projects \u201cto clearly demonstrate the value of the SPM business model to our investors,\u201d said Kibsgaard. \u201cIn the meantime, we will not undertake any new SPM projects.\u201d  In the past, Kibsgaard insisted the business was strong and offered the potential for higher margins by allowing Schlumberger to choose all the equipment and services instead of the project operator.  Schlumberger has spent billions of dollars to take over managing customers\u2019 oilfields, in some cases becoming an investor in the fields, while seeking to profit from increased oil production. Critics say the ventures require heavy upfront investments and subject Schlumberger to commodity price risks.  The company reduced its investments in SPM projects to $981 million last year from $1.67 billion in 2017.

However, North American spending growth faced a slowdown.  Onshore exploration and production investment in North America will decline more than 10 percent this year from last year, he said.

Oilfield service providers are facing reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher shareholder returns rather than more drilling activity. Competition also is forcing service companies to exit less profitable businesses.  The trio, which hold about 26% of the global oilfield services market, according to consultancy Spears & Associates, recently disclosed plans to review operations in light of declining demand for their services.  The asset sales, which could raise $800 million combined for the trio, come amid cost cutting. Halliburton last year cut more than 8% of its North American staff and Schlumberger booked a $12.7 billion writedown in October.  \u201cWe believe this is best so we can focus on products and services core to the lifecycle of the reservoir,\u201d Halliburton said in a statement, confirming the marketing of its pipeline and process services business. It hopes to close a sale by mid-year.  Schlumberger and Baker Hughes declined to comment.  The two separately hired advisers to sell units that boost production from wells using so-called rod lift gear, according to people familiar with the matter.  Baker Hughes also has retained an investment bank to sell its wellhead services operations, two of the people said.  All four operations are likely to be valued in the region of $200 million each, two of the sources said.  Rod lift is an attractive divestment target because profits are slim and energy producers are switching to more advanced electric pumps which sit inside a well.  Schlumberger\u2019s recently appointed chief executive, Olivier Le Peuch, spoke in October of moving the company toward more asset-light software and services-driven businesses, which could retain profitability even when drilling activity is subdued.  While the four planned divestments are small pieces of these large companies - Halliburton has the smallest market capitalization at $20.9 billion - analysts and investment bankers believe larger asset sales are likely in 2020.

The charge, amounting to nearly 18% of value of the company\u2019s assets, drove an $11.4 billion loss, the largest in the company\u2019s history.  However, shares rose 2% to $32.53 in mid-day trading as investors looked past the writedowns and focused on improved international operations and adjusted profits that topped Wall Street estimates.  Excluding the charges, Schlumberger earned 43 cents a share, above the 40 cents estimated by analysts.

Denver-based Liberty Oilfield on Tuesday agreed to swap a 37% stake in the company in exchange for Schlumberger\u2019s North American hydraulic fracturing fleet, two Texas sand mines and other units.  The deal comes as oilfield companies have been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which dealt a blow to fuel demand and drove shale oil and gas firms to slash drilling, cut spending and workers.  Consolidation will help the oilfield sector recover, Liberty Oilfield Chief Executive Chris Wright told Reuters.  \u201cThere are too many oil and gas companies and too many service companies. The marketplace is forcing that number to shrink,\u201d he said.  Schlumberger, which had vowed to reduce its North American fracking presence and is undergoing a major restructuring, approached Liberty before the pandemic hit the United States, Wright said.  \u201cWe get approached all the time and most don\u2019t seem like a good fit. This one certainly was,\u201d he added, pointing to Schlumberger\u2019s reputation as a technology leader.  Wright predicts fracking activity will come back, with some 200 hydraulic fracturing fleets running next year if producers keep plans to hold production flat. He declined to say how many hydraulic fracturing fleets Liberty is running, but said the number of active fleets have gone up each month since May.  As of last week, there were 85 hydraulic fracturing spreads running in the United States, according to consultancy Primary Vision, down sharply from a peak of over 400 in 2018.  \u201cI\u2019m modestly bullish on the outlook for oil and gas over the next several years,\u201d said Wright. \u201cI suspect we\u2019ll see an oil price next year that will be enough to support customer plans to keep production flat.\u201d  U.S. oil firms will have to limit production growth to prevent another boom-bust cycle as prices strengthen, he said.

REUTERS\/Richard Carson  The drop in hydraulic fracturing activity this year has been \u201csignificantly larger\u201d than expected, Patrick Schorn, executive vice president of wells at Schlumberger, said at a conference in New York, leading to a bigger decline in pricing than the company had forecast originally.  Oilfield service companies this year have been hit by a slowdown in demand as regional oil prices have fallen with transportation bottlenecks faced by producer customers. A recent drop in the U.S. benchmark crude to around $53 a barrel also has stoked concern of an oil glut next year.  Schlumberger is \u201cguiding consensus lower\u201d through the first quarter of 2019, analysts for investment firm Raymond James wrote in a note following Schorn\u2019s presentation.  Shares of Schlumberger were down about 2.6 percent in afternoon trading on Tuesday, at $44.62, amid a broad market decline. The stock is down roughly 44 percent since January.  Hydraulic fracturing pumps water and sand at high pressure into a well to release oil and gas trapped in shale rock. Oil producers have been pulling back on fracking and completing wells because of the pipeline bottlenecks and price weakness.  Schorn said recent price declines would likely prompt its customers to take \u201ca more conservative\u201d approach during the start of 2019 and that any ramp-up in international investment also could be tepid.  \u201cLooking forward to next year, the recent volatility in oil prices has introduced more uncertainty to the outlook\u201d for exploration and production spending in 2019, Schorn said.  Schlumberger\u2019s North America revenue, including its Cameron International business, was $3.12 billion in the third quarter, accounting for roughly 38 percent of total revenue.  A year ago Schlumberger acquired Weatherford International\u2019s U.S. pressure pumping business for $430 million, positioning it to better compete with rival Halliburton.

The exterior of the Schlumberger Corporation headquarters building is pictured in the Galleria area of Houston January 16, 2015. REUTERS\/Richard Carson  The nine justices heard about an hour of arguments that will resolve the amount of money that rival ION Geophysical Corp IO.N must pay for infringing Schlumberger technology that helps search for oil and gas beneath the ocean floor. Both companies are based in Houston.  Some justices, including conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch and liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, expressed concerns about applying U.S. patent laws abroad, while others indicated that Schlumberger should be fully compensated.  Schlumberger is appealing a lower court ruling that barred it from recovering $93.4 million in lost profits stemming from foreign contracts the company said it missed out on as a result of the infringement.  Schlumberger said federal patent law protects against infringement that occurs when components of a patented invention are supplied from the United States for assembly abroad, and so it should be fully compensated for its lost foreign sales.  Gorsuch and Breyer expressed skepticism about imposing damages based on the use of the technology by ION\u2019s overseas customers. Breyer said if other countries did the same it could pose problems for U.S. companies as well.  \u201cI see chaos or confusion,\u201d Breyer said.  Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy, as well as liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, signaled sympathy for Schlumberger.  Kennedy told ION\u2019s attorney Kannon Shanmugam that the company\u2019s position would confine patent owners in how they use their own patents and mean they would not be fully compensated for infringement. Shanmugam said that U.S. patent laws have a \u201cpresumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d  A decision in Schlumberger\u2019s favor would expand the ability of patent owners to recover foreign-based damages, increasing the threat posed by certain infringement suits in the United States.  Schlumberger said that the lower court ruling harms innovation by allowing companies to infringe competitors\u2019 patents while risking minimal punishment.  Other observers, including a group representing internet-based companies, said the opposite is true because extending patent damages beyond national borders would expose U.S. high-technology firms to greater patent-related risks overseas.  The case involves four patents owned by Schlumberger subsidiary WesternGeco related to an invention that more efficiently completes marine seismic surveys to help identify oil and gas drilling locations.  ION developed a competing system and sold it to surveying companies abroad. WesternGeco sued in 2009, and a federal jury in Houston found that Ion infringed the patents and caused the company to lose contracts. The jury awarded $12.5 million in royalties as well as the $93.4 million in lost profits.  In 2015, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent disputes, ruled that Schlumberger could not recoup the lost profits portion, saying U.S. patent law does not apply outside the country.  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration backed Schlumberger, and urged the justices to overturn the lower court ruling, which it said \u201csystematically undercompensates\u201d U.S. patent owners who participate in cross-border commerce.  The justices are due to issue their ruling by the end of June.","80":"July 20 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Inc posted a quarterly profit on Friday, compared with a year-ago loss, as a recovery in crude oil prices spurred demand for its oilfield services in North America.

REUTERS\/Richard Carson\/File Photo  HOUSTON (Reuters) - The chief executive of the largest oilfield service provider, Schlumberger, warned on Tuesday that bottlenecks in the largest U.S. shale basin would slow oil production growth and investments in the region.  A surge in oil and gas production in the Permian basin of west Texas and New Mexico has outstripped transport capacity, pushing the local price of oil to four-year lows and threatening to curtail drilling activity. Any slowdown could hurt oilfield service companies that have only recently started to recover from the 2014 oil-price crash.  \u201cThese challenges will likely have a dampening effect on production growth, wellhead prices and investment levels in the coming year,\u201d CEO Paal Kibsgaard said at a Barclays conference in New York.

The company expects a rapid reduction in active drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity, estimating the number of rigs in operation could fall to levels last seen during the 2016 downturn.  Oil prices have fallen by more than half this year, diving below $24 a barrel on Tuesday, as coronavirus curtails demand and top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia began pumping full bore to grab share in a slumping market.  The twin supply and demand shocks have driven major oil companies to slash spending by up to 50% this year and pushed oilfield services providers for price cuts. Rival Halliburton plans to furlough about 3,500 workers in response to the producer spending cuts and coronavirus outbreak.  Earlier this year, Schlumberger had already outlined an aggressive cost-cutting strategy for North American operations, which Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch on Tuesday said positioned the firm for the latest downturn in prices. The company has accelerated its asset light strategy, as well as personnel and compensation reductions.  \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy ride, I must say, but we\u2019re doing everything we can to catch up,\u201d he told investors in an online presentation for the Scotia Howard Weil Energy Conference.

FILE PHOTO: The exterior of a Schlumberger Corporation building is pictured in West Houston January 16, 2015. REUTERS\/Richard Carson  Easing of COVID-19 related restrictions has propelled oil demand and prices, which remain stable since a late-2020 rebound from historic lows. Brent crude, which averaged at $45 per barrel in the last quarter of 2020, hovered around $55 on Friday.  Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Olivier Le Peuch said he was optimistic about demand recovery through this year, as rivals Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Co have noted, giving investors hope the oil downturn was nearing an end.  However, Le Peuch\u2019s timeline for a full recovery to 2019 level no later than 2023 was behind Halliburton\u2019s view of a rebalancing next year. Baker Hughes also sees strong investment growth in 2022.  Still, Le Peuch said the reset could happen sooner, as some analysts have noted in recent weeks, with international recovery accelerating from second quarter this year and North America activity continuing to build upwards after a strong start to the year.  \u201cOur hypothesis going forward is that the market supply share will rebalance slightly, will favor international and will, as a consequence, pull international activity to 100% or more in the next 2 or 3 years,\u201d he told analysts on a post earnings call.

REUTERS\/Richard Carson  Crude prices plunged 60% in March after Saudi Arabia and Russia vowed to pump full bore and the spread of the novel coronavirus crushed global fuel demand. On Friday, international Brent crude futures were trading around $28 a barrel, well below the cost of production for many big producers.  The decline has caused big customers such as Exxon Mobil XOM.N to cut spending at least 30% and halt some drilling. Schlumberger expects overall global spending to fall roughly 20% in 2020, with a 40% drop in North America.  While OPEC and allies agreed to reduce output next month by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to buttress crude prices, the flood of oil on markets and business lockdowns from the coronavirus continue to hit oil prices.  The second quarter \u201cis likely to be the most uncertain and disruptive quarter the industry has ever seen,\u201d Chief Executive Olivier Le Peuch told investors on Friday. The company could not provide precise guidance for its current quarter given the uncertainty, he said.

But the resilience in international markets \u201cis a moving target\u201d as national oil companies and others continue to reduce spending, wrote analysts at energy investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.  Schlumberger cut its capital investments by 30% this year to $1.8 billion, and pared its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents from 50 cents per share to preserve cash. Schlumberger executives have taken a 20% pay cut, while the company has reduced staff and furloughed workers.  The dividend cut was a \u201cmonumental decision from the management team - and exactly the right one,\u201d wrote Bernstein analysts.  Shares rose 8% in early trading to $15.19.  Most of the $8.5 billion charge to earnings was from writing down assets because of the broad oil business decline. Nearly $1.3 billion was tied to past investments in customer projects, a strategy that led to prior charges and which critics have said increased its exposure to oil prices.  Another $587 million hit to earnings came from its North America pressure pumping unit - a business it expanded roughly two years ago with a $430 million acquisition of Weatherford International assets.  The charge led the company to report a first-quarter net loss of $7.38 billion, or $5.32 per share, compared with a profit of $421 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier.  In North America, revenue was $2.3 billion, a 7% decline from the last quarter. Schlumberger has been restructuring its North American business, and in January said it would idle roughly 50% of its hydraulic fracturing fleet. In March, as activity dropped off, the company reduced its active fleet 27%.

The Houston-based company, a bellwether for the oilfield services industry, has benefited from increased production in North American shale fields, but has struggled to see improvements in international markets since oil prices crashed in mid-2014.  Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, topped $80 a barrel in the second quarter, its strongest level in roughly three and a half years amid an effort by major oil producers to cut production and stabilize prices and supply disruptions.

It is starting to materialize now,\u201d said Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago, referencing the firm\u2019s sequential growth.  Shares of Schlumberger, the world\u2019s largest oilfield services company, were up 1.6 percent at $67.96 in early trading on Friday.  Revenue from Schlumberger\u2019s North America operations jumped about 43 percent to $3.14 billion.  Schlumberger warned that pipeline constraints in the Permian basin could slow growth in the coming months, but said it plans to continue deploying hydraulic fracturing fleets.  The services company has not yet seen an impact on Permian growth or pricing due to pipeline constraints, Kibsgaard said.  Schlumberger, which is seeking to vertically integrate its operations, said it now owns several sand mines and has capacity to cover 100 percent of its current and projected U.S. hydraulic fracturing work.  Total revenue rose 11.3 percent to $8.30 billion, but missed analysts\u2019 estimate of $8.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.
