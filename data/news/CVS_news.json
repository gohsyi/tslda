Adding to competition, Amazon in June agreed to acquire a small online pharmacy firm, a move that put the world\u2019s biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains, drug distributors and PBMs.  \u201cWe welcome competition ... expect more of it in the years to come and are confident that we ourselves are key disruptors,\u201d Merlo said.  CVS Health also said it now expects its Aetna deal to close during the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The Aetna deal is likely to reshape healthcare in the United States as it brings together one of the nation\u2019s largest PBMs and pharmacy operators with one of the oldest health insurers, whose national business ranges from employer healthcare to government plans.  Net loss attributable to CVS was $2.56 billion, or $2.52 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30.  CVS said it took a $3.9 billion goodwill impairment charge in the reported quarter related to the Omnicare business in its retail unit.  \u201cThe Omnicare write-down was somewhat of a surprise, but overall we were already expecting modest results out of that business,\u201d Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.

CVS has been running an oncology program in 12 states in which patients prescribed treatment regimens that follow National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines automatically receive prior authorization approval, speeding the time to starting their treatment.  It will now add easier access to broad-panel gene sequencing tests to that program for patients in its at-risk Aetna plans, Alan Lotvin, CVS\u2019 chief transformation officer, said in an interview. In at-risk insurance plans CVS, which acquired Aetna last year for $69 billion, takes on the risk of higher member costs.  Other non-Aetna health plans can also buy the CVS program, the company said.  Under the program, genetic sequencing of tumors would be available for patients with late-stage cancer or whose cancers progress after prior treatments, representing about 30 percent of patients, Lotvin said. The testing will be done by Tempus, a next-generation gene sequencing company in Chicago.  Dr. Otis Brawley, professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins University and former chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said the eased access to these genetic tests will help steer patients away from chemotherapy to targeted medicines.  About 10% to 12% of patients with small cell lung cancer benefit from a treatment typically used for certain breast cancers, he said.  \u201cOne of the problems has been that these patients don\u2019t get genetic sequencing or they get it so late they can\u2019t benefit from the drug,\u201d Brawley said.  Drugmakers including Bayer AG have introduced medicines that work well against cancers driven by specific rare genetic mutations. But adoption of the broad genetic tests needed to identify those mutations has been stalled over insurers\u2019 concerns that there is not enough evidence to justify paying for their widespread use, Reuters reported earlier this year.  The tests typically cost $3,000 to $5,000, Brawley said.  Lotvin said CVS\u2019 pilot program had produced observational evidence showing that following the national cancer guidelines had resulted in fewer hospitalizations and chemotherapy treatments, improving care, saving money and lessening the side effect burden.  Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Maine, Missouri, North Caroline, Nebraska, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Utah are in the pilot.","3":"CVS Pharmacy Inc has agreed to pay $9.75 million to more than 20,000 pharmacy and retail employees in California to settle claims that the company failed to pay them for training conducted outside of their shifts, according to a court filing.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of CVS Health is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Testing for COVID-19, the serious respiratory illness cased by the new coronavirus, has been held back by a lack of test kits and other equipment. While more than 300,000 people in America have tested positive for the new coronavirus, officials believe a shortage of kits has undercounted cases.  Testing, including at drive-through sites like these, is also seen as a key component for U.S. workers and restarting the economy as most states have ordered many non-essential businesses to close.  Executives from Walmart IncWMT.N, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.N and Target Corp TGT.N also said in March as part of the government announcement that they would start this testing.  In recent weeks, CVS and Walgreens had said that they each had a pilot site running.  CVS\u2019 two new drive-through COVID-19 testing sites in Georgia and Rhode Island will use the new Abbott tests, which can work in 15 minutes, and that up to four more locations to follow.  \u201cWe want to get some experience under our belt with these sites and understand exactly sort of what the volume looks like,\u201d CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in an interview.  Brennan said the company expects to announce a third testing site in a different state on Tuesday and could launch up to three more sites afterward.  Brennan said it was changing the pilot model it had tested - a single-lane drive-through in the parking lot of one of its stores. The new testing sites will be located at Georgia Tech university and the other will be in the parking lot of a casino in Rhode Island.  CVS will supply personnel from its MinuteClinic unit to oversee the testing. The states will provide security and protective equipment.  The testing is currently available at no cost to patients and is being paid for by the federal government, CVS said.  Walgreens said last week on a conference call with analysts that it had a pilot running in Chicago that was doing about 150 tests a day under the direction of the government. Target said in March that because CVS handled the pharmacy operations in its stores, it would partner with them to bring any sites online.","8":"June 25 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp:  * CVS HEALTH CORP - CVS HEALTH NOW HAS A TOTAL OF 19 DRIVE-THRU TEST SITES ACROSS NEVADA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","9":"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp CVS.N, which expects to close its $69 billion purchase of Aetna Inc AET.N this month, reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates on higher sales of prescription drugs.

The combination is expected to reshape the healthcare sector as it brings together one of the largest PBMs and one of the nation\u2019s oldest health insurers.  CVS could offer more preventive care services and screenings to Aetna customers in its clinics, such as enabling diabetes patients to monitor blood sugar levels, avoiding higher cost visits to doctors or emergency rooms.  Pharmacy same-store sales rose 8.7 percent in the quarter, while analysts were expecting a 7.7 percent rise.  Front end of the store same-store sales rose 0.8 percent versus analysts\u2019 expectations of an 0.8 percent drop, despite brick-and-mortar drugstore chains like CVS coming under increasing pressure from consumer shifts to online options.

Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia complained at a hearing last week that the two sides had treated him as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the deal. CVS closed the $69 billion transaction last week and began the integration process.  Leon said at a hearing on Monday that he would issue an order asking the two sides to argue why he should not require CVS and Aetna to be held separate until he decides whether he will approve the consent agreement reached in October between the companies and the U.S. Justice Department.  Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust, declined comment after the hearing.  A CVS spokesman said in an email after the hearing: \u201cCVS Health and Aetna are one company, and our focus is on transforming the consumer health experience.\u201d  Leon said during the brief hearing that he was \"concerned\" the Justice Department's filing with the court pointed to antitrust issues. In October, the Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna on condition that the health insurer sell its Medicare Part D drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc WCG.N.  Most deals struck between the government and companies to resolve antitrust concerns are approved by federal courts with little fuss under the 1974 Tunney Act, which requires courts to ensure the agreement is in the public interest.  Companies generally do not wait for final court approval before closing their transactions.","11":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Target Corp, CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said on Thursday they would require customers wear face coverings while shopping at their U.S. stores, adopting a widely accepted way to curb the spread of the coronavirus.  The move by consumer-facing companies comes as virus cases continue to surge in the United States and deaths exceed 137,000.  On Wednesday, Walmart Inc WMT.N, Kroger Co KR.N and Kohls Corp KSS.N had decided to implement the policy at all their outlets.  Target TGT.N said it would launch the policy from August 1, with an exception for those with underlying medical conditions and young children.

Walgreens' WBA.O policy will come into effect on Monday, with the company saying it will add store signage and intercom messages to remind shoppers of the new rule.  CVS CVS.N will also launch the rule at its pharmacies from Monday, but said it was not asking its employees to act as enforcers.  While many companies have recommended masks for months, they were hesitant to make it a requirement over fears of drawing the ire of shoppers, especially after several videos posted online showed confrontations between customers and store staff.  \u201cWhat we are asking is that customers help protect themselves,\u201d CVS said in a statement.","12":"Aug 20 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp said on Thursday a majority of its COVID-19 test results will be available within 2-5 days, as the drugstore chain expanded its network of third-party lab partners to help improve the turnaround time of its results.

A shortfall of adequate diagnostic testing has hampered the U.S. response to the pandemic, which has so far infected more than 4 million Americans.

More than 20 states including Florida, Arizona, and Texas, have reported an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks.  The United States has had about a quarter of the global total in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths.  States hard hit early in the pandemic, such as New York and New Jersey, have experienced dramatic declines in cases. But many states that reopened before achieving safety metrics or are not requiring mask wearing are seeing record increases. Overall U.S. cases rose 25% last week with 10 states reporting a greater than 50% rise in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis.  Wall Street firm Jefferies forecast there will be 400 million to 700 million tests during the current COVID-19 outbreak, representing billions of dollars for test suppliers and makers, as well as lab companies.  Other companies such as Labcorp Holdings LH.N and Quest Diagnostics Inc DGX.N have also created testing services for corporations. Quest is working with Delta Air Lines.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  But CVS, with its PBM services and insurance business, serves some of the largest U.S. companies with hundreds of thousands of employees.  The new service, dubbed Return Ready, is open to all companies, not just current customers.  CVS declined to provide details about companies that have already signed up, but said they are in discussions with media companies, financials services, sports leagues and the public sector.  ANTIBODY TESTING NOT INCLUDED  Return Ready is aimed at large employers or smaller ones who self-insure, meaning they pay for employee healthcare costs rather than insurers - and instead pay CVS to manage the tests and other services.  CVS declined to provide pricing for the program. Diagnostic tests can cost more than $100 each.  While the U.S. government has required health insurers to cover COVID-19 diagnostic testing, that is largely restricted to \u201cmedically necessary\u201d testing for those with symptoms and does not cover these back-to-work programs.  CVS is not offering tests that detect coronavirus antibodies to show prior infection.  Earlier this year, antibody tests were seen as key to getting the United States back to work, while in Europe some countries have considered related \u201cimmunity passports.\u201d But it is not yet known whether the presence of those antibodies confers some level of immunity against future infection or how long any immunity might last.  Healthcare consulting firm Willis Towers Watson does not advise employers to use antibody tests because of the uncertainty about what they indicate, health management practice leader Jeff Levin-Scherz said in a recent interview.  Even regular diagnostic testing offers no guarantees. If everyone is tested and the tests are completely accurate, workers can still become infected a day after they test negative, he said.  \u201cYou still couldn\u2019t assume that your workplace is a bubble and no COVID would come in,\u201d Levin-Scherz said.","16":"June 9 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp:  * WAYNE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT AND CVS HEALTH LAUNCH COVID-19 TESTING Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","17":"A former CVS Health executive is urging a federal appeals court to quickly review a judge\u2019s decision that blocks him from working at Amazon.com Inc\u2019s PillPack online retail pharmacy due to a noncompete clause, saying it\u2019s causing him \u201cundue financial and personal hardship.\u201d  Lawyers for John Lavin at K&L Gates in a brief on Thursday asked the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston for an expedited appeal of the judge\u2019s ruling in the case.

REUTERS\/Yuki Iwamura\/  Fewer than 10% of doses allocated to those Arkansas seniors have been administered, according to the state health department. The two pharmacies are working with about 40% of the state\u2019s facilities. Some of those were told that they were scheduled for February or March, said Dr. Joe Thompson, former Arkansas surgeon general and chief executive of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement  \u201cThis is not acceptable,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a failure in deployment by CVS and Walgreens.\u201d  Federal health officials in recent days have urged broadening vaccine eligibility to tens of millions of Americans to speed the national inoculation program rollout. Meanwhile, seniors at some long-term care facilities - who account for about 1% of the U.S. population but 40% of COVID-19 deaths and were supposed to be at the front of the line - continue to wait.  State and local officials and long-term care operators in states including Florida, California, Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania told Reuters they have turned to alternative providers for vaccinations for their residents or staff because the pharmacy chains were scheduling shots weeks out.  Some 75,000 long-term care facilities signed up to receive vaccines from CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc under the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Pharmacy Partnership Program.  \u201cI think they face serious bandwidth issues in terms of scheduling,\u201d said David Grabowski, a Harvard Medical School professor and healthcare policy expert. \u201cI find it very distressing that we haven\u2019t been doing this more rapidly. This is really a matter of life or death.\u201d  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson in a statement on Thursday said the two pharmacy chains assured him that all long-term care residents assigned to them would be vaccinated by the end of this month.  Many states prioritized homes with patients requiring medical care, which contributed to delays at other long-term care facilities.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  CVS said it plans to finish all shots at assigned facilities within nine to 12 weeks of the first dose. That means states like California, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, which were among the last to activate the second-phase of facility vaccinations, may not be finished until April.  \u201cState decisions on which facilities are activated when have a significant impact on timing,\u201d CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford said, noting that the company has administered 1 million shots and is on track with its federal agreement.  Others hurdles included confirming vaccine availability, the winter holidays, vaccine hesitancy and fresh COVID-19 outbreaks, the companies said.  That resulted in \u201ca little bit slower start than what we were hoping for. Now that we\u2019ve gotten past the first of the year, you\u2019re seeing a quick and rapid acceleration,\u201d said Rick Gates, Walgreens\u2019 senior vice president of pharmacy and healthcare. The company has done more than 500,000 shots and expects to be done by March.  \u2018OVERWHELMED BY THE SHEER VOLUME\u2019  Meanwhile, central Florida\u2019s Seminole County is deploying mobile clinics to some assisted living facilities.  \u201cWe went because they either have not been contacted by the private providers or they had concerns because of some type of issue,\u201d said county emergency manager Alan Harris.  \u201cCVS and Walgreens, I think, are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of long-term care facilities in Florida,\u201d Harris said.  The state of Florida has hired health services firm CDR Maguire to take over vaccinations at about 1,900 assisted living facilities that CVS or Walgreens had scheduled on or after Jan. 24.  Los Angeles County opted out of the CVS-Walgreens partnership and is asking facilities that can to pick up and administer vaccine themselves. In Northern California\u2019s Contra Costa County, nonprofit Choice in Aging joined John Muir Health and Kaiser Permanente in pitching in to help.  Choice in Aging is targeting facilities with six or fewer beds in historically underserved communities. \u201cThis is a population that is never prioritized,\u201d said Choice in Aging CEO Debbie Toth.

Large health insurers such as UnitedHealth and CVS Health\u2019s Aetna unit exited ACA exchanges in 2017 and 2018, due to years of mounting losses, and uncertainty as Republicans took aim at former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been studying the individual market for a while. Some of the remedies have been put in place. Clearly there\u2019s a big market,\u201d CVS Health\u2019s recently-appointed Chief Executive Officer Karen Lynch said at a post-earnings conference call.  About 11.4 million people enrolled in 2020 Obamacare plans.  The move by CVS comes as President Joe Biden\u2019s administration told the U.S. Supreme Court last week that the ACA should be upheld.  \u201cWe suspect the \u201cBlue Sweep\u201d in Washington, D.C. likely factored into this decision as it is already creating a more supportive policy backdrop for overall ... market growth,\u201d said Stephens analyst Scott Fidel.  The ACA law had been defended by Democratic-led states and the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.  Lynch made the comments during a company conference call where the company said it expects 2021 adjusted profit between $7.39 and $7.55 per share, from $7.50 this year.  CVS said it expects COVID-19 related business such as vaccinations and testing to contribute $400 mln to $500 mln next year. Analysts\u2019 had expected 2021 profit of $7.54 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  It also expects it could add to its business from new customers who get inoculated at its pharmacies.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Shares of CVS, which runs a national drugstore chain, rose more than 5%, as its pharmacy benefits business also posted better-than-expected operating profit.  CVS completed its purchase of Aetna last year, combining one of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers with one of the nation\u2019s oldest health insurers. The deal was driven in part by CVS\u2019 strategy to cut health plan costs through its \u201cHealthHUB\u201d pharmacies.  These hubs include expanded CVS MinuteClinics staffed with nurse practitioners, while pharmacists have larger roles such as advising patients on health needs like blood glucose measurements for customers with diabetes.  \u201cWe believe if we can engage consumers around their health, we will improve health outcomes and ultimately that will reduce healthcare costs,\u201d Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a phone interview.  CVS expects to lower costs as hubs handle services typically done in pricier settings, he said, such as emergency rooms or hospital-affiliated urgent care centers.  The hubs are already driving prescription growth and retail store sales, Merlo said. The company also has two insurer customers whose members are using the CVS hubs in a pilot program.  CVS plans to open 1,500 HealthHUBs around the country by the end of 2021, and said they will contribute to earnings in 2021. Merlo expects to provide more financial details around the second quarter of next year.  Sales in the pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business, which negotiates discounts with drugmakers for its clients that include insurers, rose 6.4% to $36.02 billion, helped by increased pharmacy claims and a higher prices for branded drugs.  The unit that includes Aetna posted sales of $17.18 billion, helped by lower-than-expected medical costs.  Results from CVS\u2019 retail business were pressured by lower payments for filling prescriptions, an industry-wide trend. Sales still rose 2.9% to $21.47 billion.  CVS plans to close about 75 retail pharmacy stores in 2020, Chief Financial Officer Eva Boratto said on a conference call with analysts.

A logo of Aetna is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The $69 billion CVS-Aetna deal would be the second large deal this year between insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, a consolidation the companies say will help rein in rising U.S. healthcare costs.  CVS said separately that it expects the Aetna acquisition to close in the early part of the fourth quarter of this year.  Rival insurer Cigna Corp's CI.N $52 billion acquisition of Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, which was announced after the CVS-Aetna transaction, has already passed U.S. Justice Department scrutiny.  Aetna did not disclose the terms of the sale to WellCare but said that the Medicare pharmacy prescription plans, known as Part D plans, covered more than 2.2 million members.  The sale price is likely between $1 billion and $1.5 billion based on the number of members, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch estimated in a research note. He forecast the acquisition would add $3 billion to WellCare\u2019s annual revenue and 50 cents to $1 per share to earnings starting in 2020.  Wall Street analysts expected Aetna to sell all or some of its Medicare prescription drug business ahead of its combination with CVS, the largest manager of pharmacy drug plans for the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.  The sale to WellCare aims to avoid an antitrust lawsuit over the amount of control it would have over the Medicare prescription drug market. Aetna said the asset sale is a \u201csignificant step\u201d in the U.S. Justice Department review and that its closing is contingent on that antitrust approval.  Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said that the sale of the entire business \u201calmost certainly ensures approval by the DOJ,\u201d or Justice Department. Selling the entire business also ensures a more seamless handover to WellCare, she said.  WellCare, which specializes in government Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans, has only a small Medicare prescription drug plan business with about 4 percent market share, according to a recent research note from Barclays.  CVS has a 24 percent market share and Aetna has 8.7 percent, according to Barclays.  WellCare said it does not expect to recognize revenue from the deal until 2020 because the terms call for Aetna to provide administrative services and retain the financial risk related to the government plans through 2019.  WellCare shares rose 4 percent to $319.76, Aetna added 0.7 percent to $203.13, and CVS was up 0.6 percent to $78.93.","29":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon.com Inc is seen in Sao Paulo, Brazil October 17, 2017.

According to a civil complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, Omnicare would often assign new numbers to prescriptions after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.  The government said this enabled Omnicare to bill Medicare Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for hundreds of thousands of drugs, under what the company internally called \u201crollover\u201d prescriptions, from 2010 to 2018.  Many of the drugs were anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antipsychotics and treated serious conditions such as dementia, depression and heart disease, and sometimes had dangerous side effects requiring supervision by doctors, the government said.  \u201cA pharmacy\u2019s fundamental obligation is to ensure that drugs are dispensed only under the supervision of treating doctors who monitor patients\u2019 drug therapies,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement.  \u201cOmnicare put at risk the health of tens of thousands of elderly and disabled individuals living in assisted living and other residential long-term care facilities,\u201d he added.

CVS, based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, bought Omnicare in 2015 for about $10.4 billion.  The government joined a lawsuit originally brought in June 2015 by Uri Bassan, a pharmacist who worked for Omnicare in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  It said Omnicare\u2019s compliance department had acknowledged the dispensing problem internally two months earlier, when a regional officer expressed concern in an email that its systems allowed rollover prescriptions \u201cwithout any documentation or pharmacist intervention.\u201d  The False Claims Act lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government, and share in recoveries.

CVS has been running an oncology program in 12 states in which patients prescribed treatment regimens that follow National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines automatically receive prior authorization approval, speeding the time to starting their treatment.  It will now add easier access to broad-panel gene sequencing tests to that program for patients in its at-risk Aetna plans, Alan Lotvin, CVS\u2019 chief transformation officer said in an interview. In at-risk insurance plans CVS, which acquired Aetna last year for $69 billion, takes on the risk of higher member costs.  The genetic sequencing of tumors would be available for patients with late-stage cancer or whose cancers progress after prior treatments, representing about 30 percent of patients, Lotvin said. The testing will be done by Tempus, a next-generation gene sequencing company in Chicago.  Drugmakers including Bayer AG have introduced medicines that work well against cancers driven by specific rare genetic mutations. But adoption of the broad genetic tests needed to identify those mutations has been stalled over insurers\u2019 concerns that there is not enough evidence to justify paying for their widespread use, Reuters reported earlier this year.  Lotvin said CVS\u2019 pilot program had produced observational evidence showing that following the national cancer guidelines had resulted in fewer hospitalizations and chemotherapy treatments, improving care, saving money and lessening the side effect burden.  Florida, New Jersey and Maryland are among the 12 states included in the pilot.

The testing will be scheduled online and take place at select CVS Pharmacy locations in parking lots or at drive-thru windows.  CVS Health currently operates large-scale COVID-19 rapid test sites in five U.S. states, and each site can accommodate 1,000 tests per day.  Walgreens, on the other hand, plans to open drive-through COVID-19 testing locations in 49 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, the drugstore chain said. The company currently has 15 testing sites in seven states.  CVS expects to have up to 1,000 locations across the country offering this service by the end of May, with the goal of processing up to 1.5 million tests per month.  Kroger Health, the healthcare division of Kroger Co, also said on Monday it would expand its drive-thru COVID-19 testing model to 50 locations in more than 12 states and expects to perform up to 100,000 tests by the end of May.  Testing for COVID-19, the serious respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, has been held back by a lack of test kits and other equipment.  Testing, including at drive-through sites like these provided by few retailers, are seen as a key component for U.S. workers and restarting the economy as most states have ordered many non-essential businesses to close.  Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings also said it would now offer its antibody tests for the virus that causes COVID-19 at no upfront out-of-pocket costs.

Pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) revenue rose 4.2% to $34.84 billion in the quarter, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $34.2 billion compiled by Evercore ISI. But the company said high dispensing rates of cheap generic drugs limited growth.  CVS also said it expects increased competition for its PBM business in 2020.  Revenue of $21.45 billion from its retail drugstore chains, which compete with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O, was up 3.7% and also edged past analysts' estimates. But CVS said it is seeing less profit per prescription filled.  Walgreens on Tuesday said it planned to close about 200 U.S. stores, months after saying it would do the same in Britain.

U.S. retailers face a choice of strictly enforcing state eligibility rules with on-site identity checks, or rely on an honor system that could allow people to ignore those guidelines but also get more people inoculated.  \u201cState and local guidelines vary across the 40 public health jurisdictions we serve, but in most cases, identification will not be required to receive the vaccine,\u201d a Kroger spokeswoman said. The biggest U.S. grocery chain has so far administered about 7,800 COVID-19 vaccines to healthcare workers and nursing home staff and residents.  Twenty-two states have moved toward using age as the main criteria for prioritizing inoculations, with four more set to follow next week. Others are adhering to strict guidelines meant to assure that scarce coronavirus vaccine supplies went first to healthcare workers, nursing home residents and first responders.  Teachers and other \u201cessential workers\u201d are supposed to be among those next in line as distribution widens, but who qualifies as an essential worker varies by state.  \u201cWe are not planning to ask for ID to receive a COVID-19 vaccination,\u201d a CVS Health spokesman said. \u201cThese vaccinations will be appointment-only in our stores and patients will have already gone through an eligibility screening when they register for an appointment on our website, through our app or via a 1-800 number.\u201d  However, the accuracy of information provided in eligibility screenings conducted by some companies is not automatically checked at the vaccination sites.

But Giant Food in a statement said it was just checking the photo ID and insurance card of anyone who secured an appointment through the district\u2019s website.  A spokeswoman for the DC health department said the vaccination team would raise the issue with Giant Food. Safeway parent Albertsons Companies Inc did not respond to requests for comment.  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University\u2019s medical school, attributed the lack of planning and diverging local guidance to chronic underfunding of the U.S. healthcare system, with the ongoing pandemic straining resources further.  Schaffner said the solution was to increase vaccine availability and hire more vaccinators.  \u201cThe more vaccines you have, the less you have to worry about prioritization,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cWe know it\u2019s not going to be perfect, but who cares, we need to get them into the arms.\u201d","62":"(Adds CVS, TransDigm Group, Revolution Bars, Mitek, Parkland Fuel, Albertis ; Updates Imperva, Capio)  Oct 10 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Wednesday:  ** Italy\u2019s Atlantia SpA and Spain\u2019s Acs Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA will finalize their purchase of Abertis in the coming weeks, three sources close to the matter said, dismissing concerns the deal could fall apart after a bridge operated by an Atlantia business collapsed.  ** Parkland Fuel Corp, a Canada-based marketer of petroleum products, said it would buy a 75 percent stake in privately held SOL Investments Ltd for C$1.57 billion ($1.21 billion) to expand further in the U.S. Gulf and the Atlantic coast.  ** Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp won U.S. antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc, the Justice Department said, paving the way for a combination with potential to cut U.S. healthcare costs.  ** Buyout firm Thoma Bravo LLC has agreed to buy Imperva Inc for $2.1 billion in cash, adding the cybersecurity firm to its technology-heavy investment portfolio, the company said.  ** Aircraft parts supplier TransDigm Group Inc has agreed to buy smaller rival Esterline Technologies Corp for about $3.6 billion in its biggest-ever deal, as it seeks the heft to compete with Boeing Co and Airbus SE in after-sales servicing.  ** Britain\u2019s Revolution Bars Group ended talks to buy nightclub operator Deltic Group, saying a deal would not be in the best interests of its shareholders.  ** Mitek Systems Inc, a U.S. provider of financial technology to banks, has rejected a takeover approach from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp\u2019s software company ASG Technologies Group Inc , people familiar with the matter said.  ** U.S. oil firm Chevron will become the first oil major to formally exit the Norwegian continental shelf, as it transfers its last stake in an exploration license, according to a government letter.  ** South Korea\u2019s Lotte Corp said it planned to take a stake in Lotte Chemical for 2.2 trillion won ($1.93 billion) from two affiliates to improve its governance and efficiency.  ** Leading shareholders in Sweden\u2019s Capio swung behind a $900 million takeover bid from France\u2019s Ramsay Generale de Sante, paving the way for a deal to go through after the board backed it.  ** FamilyMart Uny Holdings Co is considering selling the rest of its Uny general merchandise store unit to discount retailer Don Quijote Holdings Co, Nikkei Business magazine reported.  ** Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp is in talks to buy a majority stake in U.S. shared office space provider WeWork Cos, a source said, potentially doubling down on one of its biggest bets on a loss-making startup.  ** Shares in Alps Electric Co rose as much as 2.8 percent after a regulatory filing a day earlier showed U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management Corp had boosted its stake in the company to 9.22 percent from 6.26 percent.  ** Australian education provider Navitas Ltd said on Tuesday it had received a A$1.97 billion ($1.4 billion) takeover bid from an Australian private equity firm and the company\u2019s co-founder, sending its shares 20 percent higher.

The company said the program would not raise costs for health insurers and employers, and eliminating out-of-pocket costs would ensure better adherence by diabetic patients to their drug regimens.  PBMs act as middlemen in the drug supply chain who negotiate prices for employers and health insurers.  The rising prices of prescription drugs, especially insulin, have come under intense scrutiny and is a top issue for politicians on both sides of the aisle as the U.S. presidential election draws closer.  The cost of insulin, a life-sustaining medicine for patients with type 1 diabetes, nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, leading to a national outcry as reports emerged of risky rationing of the medicine among patients.  CVS said an analysis showed that members taking branded diabetes drugs spend $467.24 in out-of-pocket costs per year.  Drugmakers such as Eli Lilly and Co, Sanofi SA and Novo Nordisk have recently been making some of their insulin products available at lower costs to counter heavy criticism from lawmakers and patients.","64":"FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.

Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had complained last week in a hearing that the two sides had treated him as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the agreement. CVS closed the $69 billion transaction last week and began the integration process.  \u201cAt this stage, I am less convinced of the sufficiency of the government\u2019s negotiated remedy than the government is,\u201d he wrote in the order issued on Tuesday.  The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna on condition that the health insurer sell its Medicare Part D drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc WCG.N. That sale was completed last month.  Also in the order, Leon asked the government and the companies to file a brief by Dec. 14 to show why their integration should not be halted while he considers whether or not to approve the consent decree reached in October.  Most consent agreements that the antitrust agencies strike with companies to resolve competitive concerns are approved by federal courts with little fuss under the 1974 Tunney Act, which requires courts to ensure the agreements are in the public interest.  Companies generally do not wait for final court approval before closing their transactions.","65":"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp CVS.N said on Tuesday that it expects to close its $69 billion purchase of health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N after Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday as two states continue to review the transaction.

Fewer than 10% of doses allocated to those Arkansas seniors have been administered, according to the state health department. The two pharmacies are working with about 40% of the state\u2019s facilities. Some of those were told that they were scheduled for February or March, said Dr. Joe Thompson, former Arkansas surgeon general and chief executive of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement  \u201cThis is not acceptable,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a failure in deployment by CVS and Walgreens.\u201d  Federal health officials in recent days have urged broadening vaccine eligibility to tens of millions of Americans to speed the national inoculation program rollout. Meanwhile, seniors at some long-term care facilities - who account for about 1% of the U.S. population but 40% of COVID-19 deaths and were supposed to be at the front of the line - continue to wait.  State and local officials and long-term care operators in states including Florida, California, Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania told Reuters they have turned to alternative providers for vaccinations for their residents or staff because the pharmacy chains were scheduling shots weeks out.  Some 75,000 long-term care facilities signed up to receive vaccines from CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc under the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Pharmacy Partnership Program.  \u201cI think they face serious bandwidth issues in terms of scheduling,\u201d said David Grabowski, a Harvard Medical School professor and healthcare policy expert. \u201cI find it very distressing that we haven\u2019t been doing this more rapidly. This is really a matter of life or death.\u201d  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson in a statement on Thursday said the two pharmacy chains assured him that all long-term care residents assigned to them would be vaccinated by the end of this month.  Many states prioritized homes with patients requiring medical care, which contributed to delays at other long-term care facilities.  CVS said it plans to finish all shots at assigned facilities within nine to 12 weeks of the first dose. That means states like California, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, which were among the last to activate the second-phase of facility vaccinations, may not be finished until April.  \u201cState decisions on which facilities are activated when have a significant impact on timing,\u201d CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford said, noting that the company has administered 1 million shots and is on track with its federal agreement.  Others hurdles included confirming vaccine availability, the winter holidays, vaccine hesitancy and fresh COVID-19 outbreaks, the companies said.  That resulted in \u201ca little bit slower start than what we were hoping for. Now that we\u2019ve gotten past the first of the year, you\u2019re seeing a quick and rapid acceleration,\u201d said Rick Gates, Walgreens\u2019 senior vice president of pharmacy and healthcare.

The state of Florida has hired health services firm CDR Maguire to take over vaccinations at about 1,900 assisted living facilities that CVS or Walgreens had scheduled on or after Jan. 24.  Los Angeles County opted out of the CVS-Walgreens partnership and is asking facilities that can to pick up and administer vaccine themselves. In Northern California\u2019s Contra Costa County, nonprofit Choice in Aging joined John Muir Health and Kaiser Permanente in pitching in to help.  Choice in Aging is targeting facilities with six or fewer beds in historically underserved communities. \u201cThis is a population that is never prioritized,\u201d said Choice in Aging CEO Debbie Toth.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  CVS manages pharmacy benefits for employers and health insurers and negotiates prices on their behalf with drug manufacturers. It designs how prescription drug coverage will work for the members, setting the co-pay levels and how easy it is for a patient to get a medicine.  The rising cost of insulin and other diabetes treatments has become a top issue for both Democrats and Republicans ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.  The cost of insulin, a life-sustaining medicine for people with type 1 diabetes, nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016. Individuals with high-deductible health insurance plans often face thousands of dollars of out-of-pocket costs before their insurance starts paying.  Some large corporate health plans already cover all out-of-pocket cost of preventive medicines like diabetes treatments for employees in high-deductible plans. The U.S. government paved the way for broader adoption of these policies last year.  CVS said its data shows that by eliminating the out-of-pocket cost for metformin, insulin and high-priced diabetes drugs like those in the SGLT2 inhibitor class, patients will take their drugs more regularly, which is better for their health.  When combined with a drug coverage plan that limits the number of drugs available with full insurance coverage, the PBM customers should save a little bit of money overall, CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said.  CVS said an analysis showed that members taking branded diabetes drugs spend $467.24 in out-of-pocket costs per year. CVS currently offers the plan for its own customers and it will be available largely for 2021 health insurance plans.  CVS\u2019 biggest rival, Cigna Corp\u2019s Express Scripts, has a diabetes program that limits members\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for insulin to $25 per month and is cost-neutral for the employer that sponsors their health insurance.  OptumRx, part of UnitedHealth Group Inc, said it offers customized pharmacy benefit programs that include discounts for members and an affordability program that limits out-of-pocket costs for life-sustaining drugs like insulin and HIV treatments.  Drugmakers such as Eli Lilly and Co, Sanofi SA and Novo Nordisk have recently been making some of their insulin products available at lower costs to counter heavy criticism from lawmakers and patients.","88":"(Adds quotes, updates prices) * Fears about trade wars ease, boosting stocks * North Korean hopes reduce bond safety bid * $40 bln CVS bond sale seen weighing on prices By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields were little changed on Tuesday in choppy trading as optimism grew that U.S. President Donald Trump may back down from proposed steel and aluminum tariffs that have prompted concerns about a global trade war. Top U.S. Republican politicians, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, on Monday urged Trump not to go ahead with tariffs on foreign imports of steel and aluminum. Even though the president said he would not back down, he suggested Canada and Mexico could be exempted if a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was reached, which many market participants see as the main motivation behind the plan. \"It does seem as though Trump has laid out the fact that he's using these tariffs as a negotiating tactic,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Benchmark 10-year note yields were last at 2.879 percent, unchanged on the day. The potential for easing tensions between the United States and North Korea was seen helping reduce demand for safe-haven U.S. bonds. Trump said on Tuesday he saw \"possible progress\" in denuclearization efforts with North Korea after South Korea said Pyongyang would be willing to meet with the United States and suspend nuclear tests while talks proceed. CVS Health Corp's $40 billion, nine-part corporate bond sale weighed on bonds earlier on Tuesday. \"There was some concerns in the early morning about this big deal with CVS going through and potential hedging needs,\" said John Herrmann, a director in rates strategies at MUFG Securities Americas in New York. Speculation also swirled that Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard may take a more hawkish tone in a speech scheduled for Tuesday evening. \"We\u2019re hearing a bunch of whispers about how potentially hawkish she may be tonight and that maybe she\u2019s ready to shift out of the uber dove camp into something more centrist,\" Herrmann said. Rising inflation and continued job market gains have increased speculation that the U.S. central bank may hike rates four times this year, more than the previously expected three increases. The major economic focus this week will be Friday\u2019s employment report for February, which will be evaluated for further signs of wage strength as an indicator of inflation.

Under the partnership, residents and staff of all long-term care facilities like nursing homes, assisted living facilities, residential care homes and adult family homes across the country can get vaccinated at no out-of-pocket cost.

FILE PHOTO - The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly  Order books of more than US$120bn for the nine-tranche trade - the third largest US dollar high-grade corporate deal on record, according to IFR data - brought some relief after new issues have traded wider in secondary of late.  \u201cThis is the deal of 2018,\u201d Matt Brill, senior portfolio manager at Invesco, told IFR.  \u201cThe market needs this to do well.\u201d  The CVS bond, which will help finance the US$69bn acquisition of health insurer Aetna, had been hailed as a crucial test for the market that has provided some of the largest corporations with cheap financing for several consecutive years.  CVS had been eyeing other currencies as well due to the large amount of debt it needed to raise.  But hefty demand for the US dollar offering helped alleviate concerns about investor demand that has tapered off in recent weeks, according to Lipper data.  The asset class, for example, last month saw its biggest weekly outflow since November 2016. Analysts have also warned about wilting demand from foreign investors as hedging costs have risen.  \u201cThe market at this juncture still has the capacity to finance large scale transactions,\u201d said a banker not directly involved in the CVS deal.  BUYSIDE BARGAINING  Some investors, however, cautioned that other would-be borrowers may not find as welcome a reception.  Some, for example, gave CVS credit for the acquisition which will create one of the largest companies in the US by revenue and help cut costs. It could also help the firm resist Amazon\u2019s entry into drug distribution.  \u201cCVS has fundamentally changed its business through this acquisition,\u201d Janelle Woodward, global co-head of income at BMO Global Asset Management, said.  Brill described the merged entity - the M&A deal is yet to close - as almost a conglomerate.  \u201cIt will have multiple sources of revenue, and will be an industry leader in multiple areas,\u201d Brill said.  To win over investors, CVS also offered a steep discount on some of the tranches that include a special mandatory redemption clause.  That clause, offered on every tranche except the 30-year, requires CVS to buy the bonds back from investors at a price of 101 if the merger fails to close by September 3 next year.  Bond buyers hailed the discount as a break-through.  RECORD BOOKS  Still, the huge order book is one of the largest ever recorded in the corporate bond market, according to IFR data.  Mindful of the recent choppy backdrop, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan - active bookrunners on the CVS trade - closed books unusually early by 10:30am New York time, and launched it just after midday.  That strategy also allowed accounts whose orders weren\u2019t filled to buy bonds in the secondary market on the same day of pricing, Brill said. The deal was trading tighter in the gray market on Tuesday afternoon after launch.  Relatively generous initial price thoughts on the trade, comprising maturities ranging from two to 30 years, certainly helped turn heads on the buyside from the get go..  IFR calculated new issue concession of between 30bp-40bp across the deal at IPTs stage, based on where outstanding bonds from CVS were trading. The only exceptions were the two and three-year bonds, which began with NICs closer to 15bp-25bp.  But as order books swelled, and leads pulled in spreads, NICs were closer to 10bp-18bp on the longest tranches at launch, and 2bp-4bp on the two shortest dated offerings, IFR calculations show.  Only Verizon\u2019s US$49bn bond from 2013, and Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s US$46bn bond issue from 2016 have been larger than the CVS issue.  InBev, by comparison, paid new issue concessions ranging between negative 5bp and plus 20bp on its multi-tranche offering that helped finance its acquisition of SABMiller, according to IFR calculations.  The CVS deal, rated Baa1 by Moody\u2019s and BBB by S&P, is due to price later on Tuesday.","111":"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp has completed the first round of COVID-19 vaccinations at about 8,000 U.S. skilled nursing facilities that were part of a federal program, the drugstore chain said on Monday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Administration of second doses is expected to be completed within four weeks, the company said.  CVS said it will complete first vaccinations in the 40,000 long-term care facilities that have contracted with the company by mid-February, and said it has completed the first vaccinations of residents in skilled-nursing facilities. Most states have moved on to begin vaccinations of members of the general public.  CVS said it has given nearly 2 million shots through the program but did not disclose how many more nursing home residents are still waiting for their first dose.  The Trump administration tapped CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance last year to run nursing home vaccinations and the first vaccinations began in late December. Nursing homes residents were in the first priority group for a vaccine in the United States because they are most likely to die of COVID-19.  However, state officials have raised alarms that inoculations at nursing homes were moving more slowly than expected, a Reuters analysis found earlier this month, even as federal officials pushed states to make vaccines available for other groups, like people over 65. [L1N2JQ22Q]  The company said that many states opted to not activate the program until mid-to-late January.  CVS said it can eventually administer 20 to 25 million shots a month through its retail locations once vaccines are more widely available, but did not provide timing of when this would likely occur.  In the final days of the Trump Administration, Operation Warp Speed said it would activate the federal program to send shots to pharmacies early.  CVS said some of its locations in New York, Indiana, and Massachusetts were already giving shots.  There have been growing concerns about a slower-than-expected rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in the country. As of Sunday, just over 18.5 million had received one or more doses of the vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the government had earlier expected 20 million to have been vaccinated by the end of 2020.  The new administration has said it will give 100 million vaccinations in U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s first 100 days in office.","112":"May 2 (Reuters) - Cvs Health Corp:  * CVS HEALTH REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS AND CONFIRMS 2018 FULL YEAR OUTLOOK  * CVS HEALTH CORP Q1 SAME STORE SALES ROSE 5.8 PCT  * CVS HEALTH CORP Q1 GAAP SHR $0.98 FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  * CVS HEALTH CORP Q1 SHR VIEW $1.41 -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * CVS HEALTH CORP SEES FY 2018 ADJUSTED SHR $6.87 TO $7.08  * CVS HEALTH CORP SEES FY 2018 GAAP SHR $5.11 TO $5.32 FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  * CVS HEALTH CORP - EXPECTS FULL YEAR GAAP OPERATING PROFIT GROWTH OF DOWN 0.25% TO UP 2.75%  * CVS HEALTH CORP - CONFIRMED ITS PREVIOUS ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT GROWTH GUIDANCE FOR FULL YEAR OF DOWN 1.5% TO UP 1.5%  * CVS HEALTH CORP FY2018 SHR VIEW $6.30 -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * CVS HEALTH CORP QTRLY SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 5.8% AND PHARMACY SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 7.3%  * CVS HEALTH CORP - EXPECTS Q2 GAAP OPERATING PROFIT GROWTH OF 5.25% TO 8.5%  * CVS HEALTH CORP - EXPECTS Q2 ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT GROWTH OF FLAT TO UP 3.25%  * CVS HEALTH CORP - EXPECTS TO DELIVER GAAP DILUTED EPS OF $1.21 TO $1.26 AND ADJUSTED EPS OF $1.59 TO $1.64 IN Q2  * CVS HEALTH CORP Q2 SHR VIEW $1.41 -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * CVS HEALTH CORP - FRONT STORE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 1.6% IN THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR  * CVS HEALTH - MOVING FORWARD ON BOTH REGULATORY, INTEGRATION PLANNING FRONTS IN SUPPORT OF A CLOSE IN SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR FOR AETNA TRANSACTION Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","113":"May 21 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp:  * CVS HEALTH EXPANDS STATEWIDE COVID-19 RESPONSE BY OPENING 37 ADDITIONAL NEW DRIVE-THRU TEST SITES IN FLORIDA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","114":"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp said on Tuesday it would return to selling individual health insurance plans on the online marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), popularly known as Obamacare, saying the market had stabilized.

The move by CVS comes as President Joe Biden told the U.S. Supreme Court last week that the ACA should be upheld and Democrats consider expanding coverage to more people.  Lynch made the comments during a company conference call where the company said it expects 2021 adjusted profit between $7.39 and $7.55 per share, versus $7.50 in 2020.  Analysts\u2019 had expected 2021 profit of $7.54 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. CVS shares fell 4.7% to $70.68 in afternoon trading.  Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said the share move seemed overdone given that the 2021 financial outlook was in line with the company\u2019s previous comments.  COVID-19  CVS said that COVID-19 vaccinations and testing would contribute $400 mln to $500 mln next year.  The company has administered over three million COVID-19 vaccines in long-term care facilities and is now giving 250,000 shots per week in its pharmacies under a broader federal program.  The vaccines are two-dose regimens requiring 15 minutes\u2019 observation for each patient on site, adding the potential for additional sales, the company said.  Lynch said it will increase dose vaccinations and expand into more pharmacies and states as soon as March or April if supply increases as hoped. It plans to offer 20 million to 25 million shots per month.  During the conference call, CVS executive vice president Alan Lotvin said that based on conversations with pharmaceutical makers, CVS estimates about 500 million doses of vaccines would be made available between now and the end of June.  Most vaccine will be from Pfizer Inc\/BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is currently considering a vaccine from Johnson & Johnson Inc. that could be authorized in a few weeks and Novavax Inc is also hoping to apply to the FDA in coming months.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.30 per share in the reported quarter, beating estimates of $1.24 per share.","115":"May 21 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp:  * CVS HEALTH OPENS 17 NEW DRIVE-THRU TEST SITES IN ILLINOIS AS PART OF NATIONWIDE COVID-19 RESPONSE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","116":"FILE PHOTO: People walk by a CVS Pharmacy store in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 30, 2017.

The company, which acquired health insurer Aetna for $69 billion in 2018, is not planning further major deals until it has completed the Aetna integration and reduced the debt load it took on, Chief Executive Larry Merlo told Reuters in an interview.  Aetna revenue nearly tripled in the quarter from a year ago to $17.15 billion.  CVS, which gets discounts and rebates from drugmakers in exchange for listing their products on its formularies of preferred drugs, in turn guarantees rebates to its PBM customers. Profits have diminished in the past few quarters as the rate of drug price hikes has slowed under intensifying pressure from politicians of both major U.S. parties.  The company played down the role of rebate guarantees on a conference call with analysts, and said it expects the issue to be immaterial to earnings as it heads into 2021.  \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously been working hard to reverse our rebate exposure, and we\u2019ve seen that exposure has lessened in our outlook for 2020,\u201d said Derica Rice, head of CVS\u2019 PBM unit, who plans to leave the company after February.  The company forecast total adjusted 2020 profit of $7.04 to $7.17 per share. The analysts\u2019 average estimate is $7.15 per share, according to Refinitiv data.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Barclays noted that CVS has a track record of providing conservative initial forecasts compared to its ultimate actual results.  CVS plans to offer less expensive expanded health services such as blood pressure screening and diabetes monitoring in 1,500 stores by 2021. Executives said they could eventually expand the format dubbed HealthHubs to all of its stores.  CVS retail store sales rose 2.5% to $22.58 billion, also helped by higher branded drug prices, while sales in the PBM business rose 6.2% to $37.07 billion.  PBMs negotiate drug discounts for health insurers and employers, and take a cut of the rebates provided by drugmakers. They have been criticized by politicians and patient advocates for their role in keeping U.S. healthcare costs high.  Excluding items, CVS earned $1.73 in the quarter, beating Wall Street estimates by 5 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Total revenue for the quarter rose 23% to $66.89 billion.

FILE PHOTO: Shoppers walk outside a CVS store and pharmacy in Medford, Massachusetts, U.S. December 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  The new plan model is aimed at providing greater drug cost simplicity, predictability and transparency, CVS said.  The \u201cguaranteed net cost\u201d option could also deflect growing criticism that pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) reap gains off the widening gap between pharmaceutical list prices and their lower net cost after hefty rebates paid by drugmakers to secure coverage and access to their products.  President Donald Trump, who has promised lower prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers, earlier this year singled out industry \u201cmiddlemen\u201d, such as PBMs and insurers, and the common practice of drugmakers offering rebates to them.  PBMs like CVS\u2019 Caremark unit make a profit by using their scale to negotiate drug prices and by providing cost-management strategies to health plans. Under its new option, CVS takes on the risk of drug price inflation and shifts in drug use - at least for the term of each contract.  The new model guarantees average spending per prescription across each distribution channel \u2013 retail, mail order and specialty pharmacy, Derica Rice, president of CVS Caremark, said in an interview.  Rival PBM Express Scripts Holding Co last month announced a new drug coverage list aimed at accommodating reduced prices for brand-name drugs as a way to encourage drugmakers to move away from paying rebates after a prescription is filled.  Trump Administration officials have also suggested ending the rebate practice.  \u201cIf rebates go away, this model accommodates that,\u201d Rice said. \u201cBut as long as we get to the lowest net cost we are indifferent.\u201d  He said plan sponsors still have the option to choose whether to pass on any rebates to patients at the pharmacy counter.  CVS said it is first offering the net cost model to employer-sponsored plans, but will eventually make it available to all clients, including government health plans.  Rice said both existing and new clients have already chosen to adopt the net cost model next year, but he declined to estimate how many clients were expected to make the switch.  The company, which last week completed its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna, said it hopes that other PBMs will shift to similar net cost pricing models, allowing clients the ability to assess the net cost of their pharmacy benefit and select a PBM based on that criteria.","137":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cigna Corp CI.N on Thursday closed its $54-billion deal to buy Express Scripts Holding Co, creating one of the biggest providers of pharmacy benefits and insurance plans in the United States, a combination it says will help it improve healthcare coordination and cut costs.

Officials have said that Pfizer and the U.S. government will begin distributing the shots within 24 hours of receiving a regulatory green light and hospitals are planning to give healthcare workers the first shots early next week.  CVS expects to receive its first Pfizer dose allotment toward the end of next week but will wait until December 21 to give shots to comply with regulators, said Chris Cox, senior vice president at CVS Health.

The companies have said they will save administrative and patient care costs when they combine, in part by steering Aetna customers to walk-in clinics in CVS stores for less expensive medical services. CVS could offer more preventive care services and screenings in its clinics, such as enabling patients with diabetes to monitor blood sugar levels, avoiding higher cost visits to doctors or emergency rooms.  CVS aims to cut costs by $750 million annually by the end of the second year after the deal closes.  It is the second large recent healthcare deal to win U.S. Justice Department approval. The agency gave the green light to health insurer Cigna Corp's CI.N $52 billion acquisition of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O, on Sept. 17.  Shares of CVS and Aetna each rose about 1 percent on Wednesday, a day when the broader market was sharply lower, with CVS trading at $80.20 and Aetna at $206.48.  The deal was approved on the condition that the companies sell Aetna\u2019s standalone Medicare prescription drug plan business, known as Medicare Part D, the Justice department said.  Aetna last month said it would sell all of those standalone plans for prescription drugs that are part of the Medicare program for Americans aged 65 and older and the disabled to WellCare Health Plans Inc WCG.N, paving the way for the deal's approval.  FILE PHOTO - Logos of CVS and Aetna are displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Without the sale the two companies would have owned more than a 30 percent share of those standalone Medicare drug plans, creating concern about the amount of control the new CVS would have had over this part of the Medicare insurance market. Drugs administered by doctors and hospitals are covered under a separate Medicare benefit.  Together Aetna and CVS have 6.8 million members in standalone Medicare drug plans, the Justice Department said. CVS also has a large PBM business.  \u201cThe divestitures required here allow for the creation of an integrated pharmacy and health benefits company that has the potential to generate benefits by improving the quality and lowering the costs of the healthcare services that American consumers can obtain,\u201d Makan Delrahim, head of the department\u2019s Antitrust Division, said in a statement.  ON TRACK TO CLOSE THIS YEAR  California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington also joined the antitrust review.  \u201cWe know that over consolidation is bad for healthcare and leaves millions of Californians with fewer options. We will keep close watch to ensure that the terms of this settlement are met,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.  CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo said in a statement that the deal is on track to close early in the fourth quarter. CVS first announced plans to buy Aetna last December.  Since then, online retailer Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O stepped into the healthcare market with the purchase of online pharmacy PillPack, which Wall Street analysts say can help it expand further in healthcare and undercut major players across the prescription drugs supply chain.  Amazon has also aligned itself with JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKaN to experiment with new models for employee healthcare - one of Aetna's target markets for health insurance.  The decision comes as the Trump administration intensifies pressure on healthcare industry \u201cmiddlemen,\u201d such as PBMs, over practices it says increase the cost of prescription medicines for U.S. consumers.  After the deals were announced, antitrust experts described them as \u201cvertical\u201d combinations that were less troublesome from a competitive standpoint than a previous round of proposed consolidation deals among insurers, which were blocked.

FILE PHOTO: Pharmaceutical tablets and capsules are arranged in the shape of a U.S. dollar sign on a table in this picture illustration taken in Ljubljana August 20, 2014. REUTERS\/Srdjan Zivulovic  The company has held back on marketing the pharmacy benefit plan while it talks to these groups, CVS said.  The plan, launched a year ago, is based on analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a Boston-based group that assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices.  Using ICER\u2019s cost effectiveness assessment, CVS decides whether to include second or third medicines entering the market if there are already similar ones in the plan.  Opposition to the CVS plan is part of much broader concerns cited by drug companies and advocacy groups, many of which receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Some say that ICER\u2019s analysis based on additional years of \u201cquality life\u201d gained from a given treatment is arbitrary and disregards the costs of drug development and patient needs.  More than 50 groups, including drugmakers, PhRMA, the industry\u2019s main lobby group, and other advocacy groups, have provided comment during a public input period included in a review by ICER of its assessment methods. Many asked ICER to eliminate price recommendations from its efficacy analyses.  ICER has defended its methods, which are based on a widely-used cost effectiveness analysis.  The soft rollout of CVS\u2019 ICER-related product comes as employer health plan sponsors - its biggest clients - are showing increased concern over their cost for new high-priced drugs, and are considering refusing to pay for them at all, CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in a recent interview.  If corporate customers follow through on that threat, CVS said it could change tactics with the plan.  Rising drug prices, particularly for expensive specialty treatments for severe or deadly conditions, have pushed annual U.S. healthcare spending to $3.65 trillion, and made them unaffordable for many individuals.  Earlier this year, Novartis AG NOVN.S launched Zolgensma, a more than $2 million gene therapy for a rare but deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy.  The new CVS program, cited as an example of ICER\u2019s growing influence on U.S. drug pricing, would not apply to such a breakthrough treatment. It is a tiny plan by CVS standards as the company manages pharmaceutical benefits for more than 102 million people and also owns Aetna insurance and a national pharmacy chain.  NOT WIDELY PROMOTED  The plan\u2019s scope is limited to so-called me too drugs, those where similar effective treatments already exist, and aims to pressure drugmakers to set lower prices. For example, two of three very similar drugs for migraine approved in 2018 could have been excluded, but drugmakers set prices ICER deemed cost effective.  CVS has limited sales and marketing for the plan while it talks to patient groups who oppose it. About 240,000 CVS employees and a few large clients\u2019 employees are enrolled thus far. The company declined to comment on exact membership.  \u201cWe are not widely promoting this program,\u201d Brennan said, adding that CVS is working to address patient groups\u2019 concerns.  Meanwhile, Brennan said some employers are considering refusing to pay for million-dollar treatments like gene therapy. They are saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cover these kinds of therapies no matter what their comparative effectiveness is if they\u2019ve got a really high cost.\u201d  Large healthcare consultant and brokerage Mercer said it has begun to field similar concerns.  \u201cWe have certainly gotten some plan sponsors saying \u2018What if we don\u2019t cover specialty drugs?\u2019\u201d said David Dross, who runs Mercer\u2019s managed pharmacy practice. Two years ago, it never received any such questions, he said.  Steve Wojcik, an executive with the National Business Group on Health which represents large employers, said he does not believe many will take that drastic step.  Still, ICER President Steven Pearson said employers tell him they worry about their ability to cover everything and have suggested they might drop some high-cost treatments. He said employers can use cost effectiveness analysis to help them manage their spending.  ICER has responded to outside criticism by meeting with patient advocates and by adding new measurements for a drug\u2019s effectiveness, such as the value of life years gained, which does not focus on quality of life improvements, Pearson said.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department has said in a court filing that a partial government shutdown could delay its response to comments on pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp\u2019s purchase of health insurer Aetna, a necessary step in a court giving final approval to the deal.  Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has been reviewing a consent decree reached by the government and the companies in October to allow their $69 billion merger. The deal has closed, although Judge Leon has required that some aspects of integration be halted during the review process.  Additionally, the Justice Department is required to respond to public comments on the consent agreement. It said in a court filing late on Tuesday that a lapse in funding as of midnight on Jan. 4 meant that the Antitrust Division could not process those comments until its appropriations were restored.  An exception could be made if the court orders them to do so, the department said in the filing.  The partial shutdown began hitting government agencies on Dec. 22 as part of a battle between the White House, which is demanding billions to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico, and congressional Democrats, who say the expenditure would be ineffective in slowing illegal immigration.  A spokesman for CVS had no immediate comment.","153":"Nov 6 (Reuters) - CVS Health posted a 3.5% rise in third-quarter sales on Friday, partly boosted by higher demand at its pharmacy stores that sell over-the-counter consumer health products and prescription drugs.

In the wake of nationwide protests in the U.S. against police brutality and racial inequality following the death of African American George Floyd last month, several companies have issued statements in support of the black community and set up funds to fight systemic racism.  The change in policy at both companies comes after a Walmart customer complained the practice of locking up items that cater to people of color was discriminatory.  \u201cWe have a firm-nondiscrimination policy that applies to all aspects of our business and our product protection measures have never been based on the race or ethnicity of our customers,\u201d CVS said in an emailed statement on Friday.  The drugstore chain said it had expanded its selection of products in its textured hair and color cosmetics categories by 35% over the past year to add new brands that appeal to communities of color.  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc also said it is currently ensuring multicultural hair care and beauty products are not stored behind locked cases, which has been the case at a limited number of its stores.

The AMA said that the $69 billion deal, announced in December, would lead to a \u201csubstantial reduction\u201d of competition in pharmacy benefit (PBM) services market and the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan for seniors.  The AMA said the deal would increase concentration in 10 of the 34 Medicare Part D regional markets to the point where it is presumed likely to increase market power.  \u201cCVS and Aetna ... operate as rivals in some of the same markets, raising substantial concerns,\u201d said AMA President Barbara McAneny in a statement.  McAneny said the merger would mean higher prices, less choice and stifled innovation in PBM services, health insurance and pharmacy services.  CVS said in a statement that it strongly disagreed with the AMA\u2019s assessment of the deal.  \u201cWe believe that competition within each of the business segments in which we operate \u2013 pharmacy benefit management, pharmacies and insurers \u2013 is fierce and will remain so,\u201d the company said in a statement.","156":"FILE PHOTO: A woman waits behind a sheet of protective plastic at the pharmacist's counter at a CVS Pharmacy in Manhattan during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, New York, U.S., March 27, 2020.

CVS Health expects to have more than 4,000 test sites operating by mid-October in the country, the company said.  The drugstore chain, which has been operating large-scale testing sites since early April, said the new locations will open in waves over the next several weeks in 33 states and Washington, DC. It aims to open more than 400 sites on Friday.  The new sites will use self-swab tests, which will be available within two to three days.

Late last year, CVS agreed to buy health insurer Aetna Inc for $69 billion, seeking to tackle soaring healthcare spending through lower-cost medical services in pharmacies.  Retail clinics refer to walk-in clinics in stores and supermarkets. MinuteClinic, launched in 2000, is the largest provider of retail clinics in the United States.  Munk was previously the chief medical officer of Boston-based Iora Health.","158":"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp CVS.N on Wednesday said it was sticking to its 2020 forecast and expected a strong second quarter, as reduced medical service use for its Aetna insurance business offset coronavirus-related expenses and the pandemic's impact on pharmacy sales and prescriptions.  People wait in line practicing social distance at Target CVS Pharmacy as the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues, in Oakland, California, U.S., April 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The company, which has a health insurance business, a large pharmacy benefit manager and retail pharmacy stores, said it still expects 2020 adjusted profit of $7.04 to $7.17 per share, and its shares rose 2.3% to $62.62.  \u201cSticking with the guidance should be enough for the stock at a time when the company is also dedicating extra resources to manage the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Bank of America analyst Michael Cherny.  CVS said sales of over-the-counter health products fell 11% in April, as Americans largely stayed home to help slow the spread of the coronavirus and COVID-19, the sometimes deadly illness it causes.  The company said its second-quarter results would reflect a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in pandemic-related expenses, such as bonus payouts to some employees and waiving fees associated with home delivery.  The stockpiling of healthcare items, disinfectants and other necessities by consumers that fueled a surge in retail sales and led to a better-than-expected first quarter was not sustained in April, when many states required residents to stay at home. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA.O reported a similar trend when it announced quarterly results last month.  \u201cWe are seeing that as shelter-in orders are lifting, and we return our hours of operation to normal hours, we\u2019re beginning to see sales improve,\u201d said Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Roberts.  The company was seeing some benefit from its prescription home delivery initiatives, and highlighted efforts to expand COVID-19 testing. The company expects to have up to 1,000 locations across the country offering self-swab coronavirus tests.  \u201cI will say that the nature of our business is, to a degree, recession resistant,\u201d Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call.  Sales at CVS\u2019 retail unit jumped 7.7% to $22.75 billion in the first quarter, helped by strength in its pharmacy and over-the-counter consumer health products.  Aetna fared well in the first quarter as it spent less on medical claims, with patients staying away from doctors\u2019 offices and hospitals over coronavirus fears and elective procedures were delayed or canceled to preserve capacity for COVID-19 patients.  That trend continued in April, with a 30% decline in use of medical services overall and 50% drop in laboratory and radiology services.  The company\u2019s large pharmacy benefits business also benefited from consumer stockpiling of medicines in the first quarter, but the company said that trend had since reversed. Sales rose 4.2% to $34.98 billion.  CVS said it had an adjusted first-quarter profit of $1.91 per share, topping analysts\u2019 average expectations by 28 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Overall sales rose 8.3% to $66.76 billion, beating estimates by $2.66 billion.","159":"Feb 7 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp:  * CVS HEALTH SAYS ON FEB 7, 2020, MARK T.

That will be followed by shots from Moderna Inc about a week later, they told Reuters.  Pfizer and BioNTech SE could receive emergency authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine from regulators as soon as Friday. Moderna\u2019s regulatory process is about a week behind.  Officials have said that Pfizer and the U.S. government will begin distributing the shots within 24 hours of receiving a regulatory green light, and hospitals are planning to give healthcare workers the first shots early next week.  CVS expects to receive its first Pfizer dose allotment toward the end of next week but will wait until December 21 to give shots, said Chris Cox, senior vice president at CVS Health. He said U.S. officials want to allow time for the companies to review information documents about the shot and get waivers from nursing home residents and their families.  Some states are opting to use Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine to inoculate their nursing home residents rather than the Pfizer shot, he added, saying that earliest date that CVS can administer Moderna\u2019s shots is December 28.  Moderna has applied for emergency authorization and is expected to receive it soon after a meeting of advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 17.  CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, which run the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy chains but also offer other offsite pharmacy services, have an agreement with the federal government to vaccinate nursing home residents across the country through a voluntary program.  Cox said he believed all states had opted into the federal program, and CVS Pharmacy said more than 40,000 long-term care facilities had selected it as their COVID-19 vaccination provider.","163":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp CVS.N defended on Friday an agreement with the U.S. Justice Department which allowed it to purchase health insurer Aetna for $69 billion, a settlement that a federal judge is still assessing.  FILE PHOTO: Shoppers walk outside a CVS store and pharmacy in Medford, Massachusetts, U.S. December 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  The Justice Department approved the merger of CVS, a U.S. pharmacy chain and benefits manager, and Aetna in October on condition that Aetna sell its Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc WCG.N. That sale was completed in November.  Now, the Justice Department and companies have found themselves in the unusual position of defending their antitrust settlement to a skeptical federal judge. Most judges approve consent decrees aimed at resolving competition concerns with no fanfare, and deals normally close before the judge rules.  But Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in an order that he was \u201cless convinced\u201d than the government that the agreement would resolve antitrust concerns. He also has seemed annoyed that CVS closed its purchase of Aetna in October before his ruling.  In its brief, filed on Friday, CVS said that the deal had been extensively reviewed and urged the judge to allow the companies to continue integrating while he examines the settlement reached with the government.  CVS also noted that Aetna would be run separately from CVS, including decisions pricing and product offerings, during the court process.  In its filing, the government urged the judge to allow the companies to press on with integration, saying he did not have the power to stop the merger, only to reject the settlement.  \u201cThe United States remains mindful of the court\u2019s responsibility to independently determine whether the proposed settlement is in the public interest and looks forward to discussing why the settlement meets that standard,\u201d the government said.  While CVS and Aetna operate in largely separate business segments, the deal attracted opposition from groups including the American Medical Association and independent pharmacists, represented by the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York and Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency.  The two pharmacist groups asked Leon to allow them to argue against the deal.  \u201cWe are asking the court to stop the consolidation so that the concerns of patients, providers and consumers can be heard,\u201d said Debbi Barber, president of New York pharmacists.","164":"May 14 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targets on several U.S.-listed companies, including CVS Health, Regal Beloit and Zuora, on Thursday.

(Reporting by Trisha Roy and Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)","166":"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp on Wednesday raised its full-year profit forecast and reported first-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street estimates due to growth in its Aetna health insurance business, and as drug prices fell within its expectations.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Shares rose more than 5 percent to $57.35. They had fallen 17 percent this year, hurt by a weak forecast in February and a cut to rival Walgreen Boots Alliance\u2019s full-year outlook last month due to lower generic drug prices.  Aetna, CVS\u2019s health insurance unit, beat analysts\u2019 consensus by more than a billion dollars in the quarter, helped by its accounting for lower medical costs than anticipated during the fourth quarter.  The company, which bought Aetna for $69 billion in November, said 2019 cost savings from the deal were tracking near the high end of its $300 million to $350 million range, and that 2020 savings would likely exceed its $750 million target.  The company said a handful of new \u201cHealthHub\u201d pharmacies launched in Houston this year that provide healthcare services, such as chronic care management for diabetes, have drawn more customers than expected. It plans to launch more such stores in Houston and plans to provide details of a national roll-out next month.  \u201cConsumerism in healthcare is here to stay,\u201d CVS Chief Executive Larry Menlo said. \u201cWe are beginning to see this evolution through the HealthHubs. We are not just selling hundreds of products, it\u2019s a combination of products and services.\u201d  Menlo also said the company would take part in a pilot project announced by the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to expand point-of-sale rebates to patients in Medicare plans. The government has also proposed a rule that would require health plans to pass on all rebates, but it is not clear if it will be finalized for 2020.  Sales in its health care benefits unit rose by $16.55 billion to $17.78 billion with the addition of Aetna to its operations.  Sales of prescription drugs at its pharmacies were hurt as the company gets paid less for filling prescriptions. That was offset by higher volumes and higher prices of brand name drugs.  CVS in February had cautioned that rebate payments it guaranteed to customers were larger than what it has received from drugmakers due to lower-than-expected increases in drug prices.  \u201cConsidering that expectations have been low, we see this as the first positive catalyst that restores investor confidence in this management team,\u201d SVB Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said of the first-quarter profit and raised 2019 forecast.  CVS said it now expects full-year adjusted profit of $6.75 to $6.90 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $6.68 to $6.88.  Overall sales at its retail unit, which also sells over-the-counter-drugs and consumer health products, rose 3.3 percent to $21.12 billion.  The drugstore chain operator and pharmacy benefits manager said it earned $1.62 per share excluding items, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate by 12 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income rose 42.4 percent to $1.42 billion in the first quarter. Revenue rose 34.8 percent to $61.65 billion.","167":"FILE PHOTO: Logos of CVS and Aetna are displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017.

Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia scolded the government and parties late last year for closing the $69 billion dollar merger before the consent order was approved by the court. In response, CVS offered to halt some integration of the two companies.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  CVS\u2019s decision represents a setback for sales of Amgen\u2019s Aimovig, as many patients who rely on the coverage list will now have easier access to the rival Teva and Lilly drugs. Inclusion on the preferred drugs lists by the largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers is seen as critically important for sales of new medicines.  About 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, and global migraine drug sales could reach $8.7 billion by 2026, according to analytics firm GlobalData.  Shares of Amgen fell 1.3 percent to $198.27. Teva shares traded in New York were up 1.3 percent at $19.60, while Lilly was off 0.5 percent at $114.36.  An Amgen spokeswoman said the company was disappointed by the CVS decision and that it would work toward Aimovig being a preferred brand on CVS coverage lists.  The move by CVS is a positive development for Teva, whose drug was initially excluded from the list of covered drugs by Express Scripts, another large U.S. PBM. Its status recently changed and it may appear on some coverage lists, but likely with a higher out-of-pocket cost, Express Scripts said on Friday.  Teva\u2019s Ajovy and Lilly\u2019s Emgality will be available to members who have tried and failed to be helped by other preventive migraine treatments, CVS spokeswoman Christine Cramer said in an emailed statement.  The treatments belong to a class of drugs called CGRP inhibitors that have proven effective in helping to prevent migraines, and whose prices were backed as cost effective by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, Cramer said. ICER is a non-partisan research organization that reviews the clinical and economic value of medicines.  Cramer did not provide a reason for why the company had excluded Amgen.  PBMs typically extract discounts from drugmakers in return for favorable placement on their list of covered drugs, such as through a low co-payment, or coinsurance payment, for their members.  A Teva spokeswoman said in a statement that 60 percent of commercial patients now have access to Ajovy through covered drug lists and that discussions are continuing with other national and regional payers.  All three migraine drugs have a list price of $575 a month, or $6,900 a year. Those prices do not reflect rebates and discounts drugmakers typically provide to PBMs, who design and negotiate benefits for employers and insurers.  All three companies have said that they are providing a limited duration supply of these drugs at no cost directly to patients in addition to other assistance programs.  Amgen was the first of the three companies to launch a drug in the new class. The rival drugs from Teva and Lilly, which work in a similar manner, came on the market soon after.  CVS\u2019 policy is similar to that of Express Scripts, which requires patients first try two older preventive therapies and a triptan, a family of generic drugs used to treat acute migraine. Express is now part of Cigna Corp.  Lilly did not respond to a request for comment.","176":"May 21 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp:  * CVS HEALTH OPENS 14 NEW DRIVE-THRU TEST SITES IN CALIFORNIA AS PART OF NATIONWIDE COVID-19 RESPONSE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","177":"(Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp on Monday said it will hire 15,000 employees in the fourth quarter of this year as the onset of winter could fuel a resurgence in the spread of COVID-19 and flu cases.

CVS is one of the largest U.S. pharmacy operators and pharmacy benefits managers and also owns Aetna, a top health insurer. It had announced last year that it was working on a home hemodialysis system, which would enable patients with end stage renal disease to have more frequent dialysis and potentially better health outcomes compared with clinic-based care.  Without a transplant, patients with end-stage kidney disease require dialysis to clear their blood of waste and excess fluid, which involves spending three-to-five hours hooked up to a machine three times a week.  The U.S. government, which covers most patients with end stage renal disease in its Medicare health program, last week announced plans for several pilot programs aimed at overhauling kidney care. It would provide doctors and kidney care centers with incentives for earlier treatment for the chronic conditions that lead to kidney failure, home dialysis and kidney transplants.  Fresenius earlier this year bought NxStage, a U.S. maker of home-use dialysis machines, for $2 billion and said it would convert some of its clinics into transitional care sites to train patients to do dialysis at home. DaVita has said that it is accelerating home dialysis growth by investing in home remote monitoring and a telehealth platform that make the process easier.  CVS Executive Vice President Alan Lotvin said in an interview that by using its home dialysis equipment, patients are expected to undergo dialysis every other day for around 6 hours per day, potentially doubling the amount of dialysis they receive in a one-week period. More dialysis has been shown to lead to better patient health, he said.  CVS is enrolling up to 70 patients at up to 10 medical centers in the United States and expects the study to be completed in 16 to 18 months. If successful, it plans to begin offering kidney care dialysis services in 2021.  The company will also sell the systems, which were designed with DEKA Research & Development Corp, a New Hampshire-based company owned by Segway scooter inventor Dean Kamen, according to sources familiar with the arrangement. Reuters previously reported on the partnership.  Patients can launch and operate the system, which is contained in two cabinets that are each about the size of a small countertop refrigerator, through a software program on a tablet computer. In the trial, patients are trained for about six weeks with a nurse either at a clinic or at home and then operate the system themselves for six weeks.  Nurses and medical workers are one of the factors that drive the costs of dialysis in centers and can be a factor in home care costs. Doctors are also typically reimbursed when patients receive dialysis, a factor government officials have said undercuts earlier treatment of kidney disease.  DaVita shares have gained 12 percent this year since closing 2018 at $51.42. Fresenius shares closed 2018 at 56.64 euros and are up 25 percent. CVS shares have fallen 12 percent from $65.19 at the end of 2018.","182":"Nov 6 (Reuters) - Pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp on Wednesday reported a 10.1% rise in profit for the third quarter, helped by its Aetna health insurance business that it acquired last year.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  (Reuters) -Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and CVS Health Corp said on Friday they have begun administering Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff at some U.S. long-term care facilities.  The companies, which run the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy chains and offer other offsite pharmacy services, have agreed with the federal government to vaccinate nursing home residents across the country through a voluntary program.  Walgreens said it plans to administer the vaccine to about 3 million residents and staff in 35,000 long-term care facilities. The company said it would provide vaccinations in about 800 long-term care facilities across 12 states in the coming week.  CVS did not say how many people would be given the vaccine on Friday, but that it is administering them at a \u201chandful\u201d of long-term care facilities in Connecticut and Ohio. Its national rollout also begins next week in 12 states.  The companies told Reuters last week that they will start administering a vaccine made by Moderna Inc about a week after they begin their national rollouts.","184":"(Adds New York Times report, Pfizer comment, CVS and Walgreens on distribution)  Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it was working rapidly to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, with the green light coming possibly as soon as Friday evening, according to the New York Times.  The newspaper reported on Friday that the FDA is likely to issue the EUA by Friday evening, citing people familiar with the agency\u2019s planning. It had reported on Thursday night that the FDA would announce the news on Saturday.  Swift clearance of the vaccine was widely expected after a panel of expert advisers to the FDA on Thursday endorsed its emergency use to help stem a pandemic that has killed more than 285,000 people in the United States.  The decision will set the stage for the first Americans to be immunized outside of clinical trials as soon as Monday or Tuesday, with healthcare workers expected to be among the first in line.  Pfizer has asked that the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE, be approved for use in people aged 16 to 85. A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company cannot speculate on when the emergency use authorization will come.  The companies last month said that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness from COVID-19.  Detailed data released in FDA documents ahead of the advisory panel meeting showed the vaccine began protecting recipients even before they received a second dose.  The UK approved the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine last week and began a mass immunization program on Tuesday. Canada has also authorized the vaccine with inoculations expected to begin next week.  The FDA has notified the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed officials so that they can execute their plans for timely vaccine distribution, it said in a statement. (bit.ly\/2W47i9l)  In addition to healthcare workers, first responders and nursing home residents are expected to receive the first doses, but a wider rollout faces significant logistical challenges, given its need to be stored and transported in special ultra-cold freezers or on dry ice.  CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said they expect to administer the first Pfizer Inc COVID-19 vaccines to residents of long term care facilities on Dec. 21.  Another 2,902 U.S. deaths were reported on Thursday, a day after a record 3,253 people died from COVID-19, a pace projected to continue for the next two to three months until the vaccine can be widely distributed.  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, which oversees the FDA, told ABC News that regulatory authorization should come within days and the federal government would work with the company to get the vaccine shipped out.  For months, U.S. President Donald Trump had pressured the FDA in tweets and news conferences to move more quickly, accusing staff and Pfizer of dragging their feet.  Shortly after the FDA\u2019s statement, the outgoing president criticized the agency for what he said was its slow handling of the vaccines and FDA Commissioner Steven Hahn via tweet.  Trump said his \u201cpushing\u201d the agency had sped up new vaccine approval, but that the FDA was \u201cstill a big, old, slow turtle. Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn @SteveFDA.

The company has held back on marketing the pharmacy benefit plan while it talks to these groups, CVS said.  The plan, launched a year ago, is based on analyses by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a Boston-based group that assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices.  Using ICER\u2019s cost effectiveness assessment, CVS decides whether to include second or third medicines entering the market if there are already similar ones in the plan.  Opposition to the CVS plan is part of much broader concerns cited by drug companies and advocacy groups, many of which receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Some say that ICER\u2019s analysis based on additional years of \u201cquality life\u201d gained from a given treatment is arbitrary and disregards the costs of drug development and patient needs.  More than 50 groups, including drugmakers, PhRMA, the industry\u2019s main lobby group, and other advocacy groups, have provided comment during a public input period included in a review by ICER of its assessment methods. Many asked ICER to eliminate price recommendations from its efficacy analyses.  ICER has defended its methods, which are based on a widely-used cost effectiveness analysis.  The soft rollout of CVS\u2019 ICER-related product comes as employer health plan sponsors - its biggest clients - are showing increased concern over their cost for new high-priced drugs, and are considering refusing to pay for them at all, CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in a recent interview.  If corporate customers follow through on that threat, CVS said it could change tactics with the plan.  Rising drug prices, particularly for expensive specialty treatments for severe or deadly conditions, have pushed annual U.S. healthcare spending to $3.65 trillion, and made them unaffordable for many individuals.  Earlier this year, Novartis AG launched Zolgensma, a more than $2 million gene therapy for a rare but deadly disease called spinal muscular atrophy.  The new CVS program, cited as an example of ICER\u2019s growing influence on U.S. drug pricing, would not apply to such a breakthrough treatment. It is a tiny plan by CVS standards as the company manages pharmaceutical benefits for more than 102 million people and also owns Aetna insurance and a national pharmacy chain.  NOT WIDELY PROMOTED  The plan\u2019s scope is limited to so-called me too drugs, those where similar effective treatments already exist, and aims to pressure drugmakers to set lower prices. For example, two of three very similar drugs for migraine approved in 2018 could have been excluded, but drugmakers set prices ICER deemed cost effective.  CVS has limited sales and marketing for the plan while it talks to patient groups who oppose it. About 240,000 CVS employees and a few large clients\u2019 employees are enrolled thus far. The company declined to comment on exact membership.  \u201cWe are not widely promoting this program,\u201d Brennan said, adding that CVS is working to address patient groups\u2019 concerns.  Meanwhile, Brennan said some employers are considering refusing to pay for million-dollar treatments like gene therapy. They are saying, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cover these kinds of therapies no matter what their comparative effectiveness is if they\u2019ve got a really high cost.\u201d  Large healthcare consultant and brokerage Mercer said it has begun to field similar concerns.  \u201cWe have certainly gotten some plan sponsors saying \u2018What if we don\u2019t cover specialty drugs?\u2019\u201d said David Dross, who runs Mercer\u2019s managed pharmacy practice. Two years ago, it never received any such questions, he said.  Steve Wojcik, an executive with the National Business Group on Health which represents large employers, said he does not believe many will take that drastic step.  Still, ICER President Steven Pearson said employers tell him they worry about their ability to cover everything and have suggested they might drop some high-cost treatments. He said employers can use cost effectiveness analysis to help them manage their spending.  ICER has responded to outside criticism by meeting with patient advocates and by adding new measurements for a drug\u2019s effectiveness, such as the value of life years gained, which does not focus on quality of life improvements, Pearson said.  Since 2015, ICER has published up to a dozen reviews each year of drugs and classes of medicines.  Most U.S. private insurers now use ICER clinical and cost analyses to inform coverage negotiations with drugmakers. ICER funding primarily comes from a non-profit foundation, but drug companies and health insurers provide some funds for ICER-related activities.

In addition to onsite and pharmacy testing, CVS also will create plans for temperature and symptom checks, seasonal flu vaccines and other immunizations and offer add-on services like contact tracing technology for employees and other services.  The unexpected surge in COVID-19 cases in states in the South and West has increased demand in recent weeks for testing workers on a regular basis, such as every two weeks or every month, said Troy Brennan, chief medical officer of the company, which operates pharmacies, a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service and the Aetna insurance plan.  \u201cThe general perception is that there is not going to be a sustained lull over the course of the summer, and in fact it looks like it is building somewhat, and that is changing people\u2019s views,\u201d Brennan said.  States including Florida, Arizona, and Texas, as well as Georgia, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah have all reported an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks.  The United States has had more than 2.3 million cases and over 120,000 COVID-19 deaths, about a quarter of the world\u2019s total.  States hard hit early in the pandemic, such as New York and New Jersey, have experienced dramatic declines in cases. But many states that reopened before achieving safety metrics or are not requiring mask wearing are seeing record increases. Overall U.S. cases rose 25% last week with 10 states reporting a greater than 50% rise in new infections, according to a Reuters analysis.  Other companies such as Labcorp Holdings and Quest Diagnostics Inc have also created testing services for corporations. Quest is working with Delta Air Lines.  CVS, however, is one of the nation\u2019s largest healthcare companies. Between its PBM services and insurance business, CVS serves some of the largest U.S. companies with hundreds of thousands of employees.  The new service, dubbed Return Ready, is open to all companies, not just current customers.  CVS declined to provide details about companies that have already signed up, but said they are in discussions with media companies, financials services, sports leagues and the public sector.  ANTIBODY TESTING NOT INCLUDED  Return Ready is aimed at large employers or smaller ones who self-insure, meaning they pay for employee healthcare costs rather than insurers - and instead pay CVS to manage the tests and other services.  CVS declined to provide pricing for the program. Diagnostic tests can cost more than $100 each.  While the U.S. government has required health insurers to cover COVID-19 diagnostic testing, that coverage is largely restricted to \u201cmedically necessary\u201d testing for those with symptoms and does not cover these back-to-work programs.  CVS is not offering tests that detect coronavirus antibodies to show prior infection.  Earlier this year, antibody tests were seen as key to getting the United States back to work, while in Europe some countries have considered related \u201cimmunity passports.\u201d But it is not yet known whether the presence of those antibodies confers some level of immunity against future infection or how long any immunity might last.  Healthcare consulting firm Willis Towers Watson does not advise employers to use antibody tests because of the uncertainty about what they indicate, health management practice leader Jeff Levin-Scherz said in a recent interview.  Even regular diagnostic testing offers no guarantees. If everyone is tested and the tests are completely accurate, workers can still become infected a day after they test negative, he said.  \u201cYou still couldn\u2019t assume that your workplace is a bubble and no COVID would come in,\u201d Levin-Scherz said.

Administration of second doses is underway and expected to be completed within four weeks, the company said.  CVS says its long-term care vaccination effort remains on track, with nearly two million doses administered to date. (refini.tv\/3sTG7x7)","192":"Aug 13 (Reuters) - Healthcare providers, including CVS Health Corp, are kicking off flu vaccinations early, ordering extra shots and aiming to add tests that check for both the annual flu and COVID-19, pharmacy executives and experts told Reuters.  Flu vaccination for the fall has taken on increased urgency because of the potential for serious complications if patients contract both viruses at once.  Vaccine makers will provide nearly 200 million flu vaccines to the United States this year, potentially 20% more than typical, said LJ Tan, chief strategy officer for the Immunization Action Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes vaccination.  CVS expects to more than double the number of flu shots it provides to around 18 million people and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc is stockpiling extra vaccines, the companies told Reuters.  Failure to inoculate for the flu could also strain the United States COVID-19 testing capacity, which is still below the 6-10 million daily tests needed, Reuters has reported.  \u201cIf we can eliminate the dynamic of people getting symptoms and their first reaction is \u2018is this the seasonal flu or is this COVID,\u2019 it can take demand off of COVID-19 testing,\u201d CVS Chief Executive Larry Merlo told Reuters.  Merlo added that CVS is working to obtain tests that screen for both viruses simultaneously. U.S. regulators approved a joint COVID-19 and flu test in July.  The same people who are most vulnerable to risks from COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with respiratory conditions, are also at greatest risk for the flu, Tan added.  The U.S. healthcare system is already expected to be strained in the fall by a resurgence in COVID-19. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is anticipating an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the coming months, resulting in around 300,000 total deaths by December, up from the current figure of roughly 160,000, and a nearly 75% increase in hospitalizations.  There is evidence that social distancing measures for COVID-19 reduce the transmission rate of the flu as well, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning that continued measures in the U.S. could potentially slow flu transmission this season.  However, efforts to inoculate patients for the flu could be complicated by the need to safeguard patients and healthcare workers from COVID-19.  \u201cIf a patient has a fever or other symptoms associated with illness, they will be referred to their healthcare provider and immunizations will be deferred,\u201d a Walgreens spokeswoman told Reuters.  CVS plans to begin inoculating patients earlier than usual - possibly by the end of this month - to get a jump start on preparing for this year\u2019s flu season, which usually starts around October.  However, studies show there is a risk that getting inoculated against the flu too early can leave a patient vulnerable to contracting the virus later on in winter, if the shot wears off.  Other physicians are also starting this month, though it will still take months to fully distribute all the needed inoculations, Tan said.  The flu vaccine \u201ccomes out over time so you want to make sure people continue to seek flu vaccines\u201d through Thanksgiving and beyond, Tan said.

Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the speed at which the dispute was resolved likely points to the negotiating strength of pharmacy benefit managers in contract discussions. Consumers historically move to where their insurance is accepted, and Walmart likely would have lost out on the estimated 15 million to 20 million prescriptions it receives from CVS customers, Muken said.  In 2012, Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA.O and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, now part of Cigna Corp CI.N, failed to come to contract terms. Walgreens sales fell as it stopped filling prescriptions for Express Scripts customers, and the two companies reached a new agreement in the middle of the year that put Walgreens back in its network.  In addition to its retail pharmacies and stores, CVS is one of the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy benefit managers and, after buying Aetna, one of its top health insurance companies. Its prescription plans for those on the government-run Medicare program were unaffected by the contract dispute as was its Sam\u2019s Club agreements.

REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  The lowered forecast raised questions on Wall Street about the company\u2019s ability to succeed with its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna, which closed last year.  CVS said the rebates, or discounts, that are a pillar of the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business model, are an issue for 2019 as well. The U.S. government has proposed a rule that would overhaul the use of drug company rebates in government-run healthcare plans.  Chief Executive Larry Menlo said the proposed rule, which the Trump administration plans to put in place on Jan. 1, 2020, would force CVS to raise premiums in Medicare prescription drug plans if implemented.  Menlo said in an interview that there are practical issues with implementing the proposal. Companies are required submit bids to the government for the 2020 Medicare drug plans by early June of this year.  \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for folks to begin to take actions today recognizing that no one completely understands exactly what the rule is,\u201d Menlo said. \u201cIt just seems that a Jan. 1 go-live date would be very challenging to achieve.\u201d  CVS plans to suggest changes to the proposed rule.  Other challenges the company faces in 2019 include declining revenue from new generic drugs, Menlo said. In a typical generic launch, several competitors begin selling their versions within a year, giving CVS the ability to leverage rivals for competitive pricing.  But high-profile generic launches in 2019 have involved more complex treatments, including rivals to Mylan NV\u2019s EpiPen, and GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Advair for asthma.  \u201cIt\u2019s a more difficult manufacturing process and as a result the regulatory process to market is more challenged,\u201d Menlo said. \u201cSo we\u2019re seeing - on some of these products - less competition.\u201d  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, for instance, has been selling its generic EpiPen at $300, about the same as Mylan\u2019s. Mylan just launched its generic of Advair in February.  \u201cPERFECT STORM\u201d  CVS provided its 2019 forecast for adjusted earnings of $6.68 to $6.88 per share, compared with Wall Street estimates of $7.41, along with its first quarterly results since closing the Aetna deal.  CVS faced \u201ca perfect storm\u201d of challenges and now faces a longer road until the combination can work and create value, Evercore ISI analysts Ross Muken and Michael Newshel said in a research note.  \u201cThis will help to stoke fears of the Aetna transaction being a defensive maneuver, aimed at plugging holes in a leaky CVS bucket,\u201d they wrote.  Slowing growth of prescription drug prices, as drugmakers have caved to pressure from politicians to lower costs for U.S. consumers, has hit the outlook for the size of rebates manufacturers give CVS in return for coverage of their medicines by its PBM business.  The unexpected slowdown will squeeze CVS profits because it has already guaranteed rebates in set dollar amounts to PBM clients, such as health plan managers and employers.  CVS, which owns a large chain of pharmacies in addition to its PBM and now insurance business, also revealed a $2.2 billion fourth-quarter goodwill impairment charge related to its long-term care business, which includes the Omnicare unit it bought in 2015. It took a $3.9 billion charge in the second quarter.  The company pointed to low occupancy rates in skilled nursing facilities and a significant customer bankruptcy.

It plans to convert a total of 50 stores this year in Houston, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Tampa, representing about 15% of the stores in each of the markets, the company said ahead of a meeting on Tuesday with Wall Street analysts and investors in New York. The bulk of the expansion will be split between 2020 and 2021.  CVS first launched a handful of these stores with expanded health services it is calling health hubs in Houston earlier this year. The new format includes an employee with the title of \u201ccare concierge\u201d who will direct customers to health services such as a nutritionist or nurse practitioner. It also will offer screenings for sleep apnea and opthalmology issues related to diabetes, among other services.  These CVS stores have experienced increases in foot traffic, front-of-store sales and MinuteClinic visits per day, as well as prescriptions dispensed, CVS pharmacy executive Kevin Hourican said in a phone interview. He declined to provide specific figures. MinuteClinics are walk-in health clinics located in CVS pharmacies.  When CVS bought Aetna for $69 billion, it said the companies would work to bring more health services into its stores beyond the MinuteClinic offerings to tackle chronic conditions like obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.  Separately, CVS this week is in federal court in Washington D.C., where a judge is reviewing the Aetna deal. The U.S. Department of Justice and the companies agreed on an anti-trust settlement that included the sale of Medicare prescription drug plans to WellCare Health Plans Inc, but the court has not yet signed off on it.  In addition to its retail stores with pharmacies, CVS is one of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit managers.","210":"May 1 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp reported a 42 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday and raised its adjusted earnings forecast for the year, as it benefits from its $69 billion purchase of health insurer Aetna Inc.

FILE PHOTO: A demonstration of the newly released Apple Watch Series 4 is seen following the product launch event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam -\/File Photo  Called \u201cAttain,\u201d the Apple Watch app will reward Aetna customers for meeting activity goals and fulfilling recommended tasks, such as getting vaccinations or refilling medications, with a subsidy toward the cost of an Apple Watch or gift cards for U.S. retailers.  Several insurers have offered such subsidies for using wearable devices to meet generic activity goals such as a number of steps in the past. But what is new and significant about the Attain app is the use of personal health data held by Aetna to provide customized goals and recommendations.  That health history data is tightly regulated by the U.S. government, and Apple and Aetna had to enter into what is known as a business associate agreement in order for Aetna to share it with the Apple.  Access to regulated data is necessary for some of the functions of the app, such as recommending age-appropriate exercise or a lower-cost option for scheduled lab tests or MRI imaging tests. Aetna said the program is voluntary and that data gathered will not be used for premium pricing or coverage decisions.  \u201cWe understand that you don\u2019t need to be a personal trainer or work out several hours a day to be healthier,\u201d Alan Lotvin, executive vice president for transformation at CVS Health, said in a statement.  For Apple, the Aetna partnership continues a push into regulated areas as the company dives further into health features with its wearable device launched in 2014.  Last fall, Apple announced a watch with the ability to take an electrocardiogram, an electrical measure of heart activity that can detect heart problems. The feature required clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Aetna users can opt to share their information anonymously with Apple. Apple will use techniques such as machine learning to fine tune the app, such as detecting the users are more likely to follow up on tasks if they notified midday rather than in the morning.  \u201cAs we learn over time, the goal is to make more customized recommendations that will help members accomplish their goals and live healthier lives,\u201d Jeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said in a statement.","213":"(Reuters) - Drugstore operator chain CVS Health Corp said it had hired former Eli Lilly Chief Financial Officer Derica Rice as the president of its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business.

Rice, who was with Eli Lilly for 27 years, would join CVS on March 30.","214":"April 6 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp said that it will launch two new drive-through COVID-19 testing sites in Georgia and Rhode Island on Monday using new, faster tests than had previously been available, with up to four more locations to follow.  The company said both drive-through testing sites will use testing equipment made by Abbott Laboratories that can deliver results within minutes. It expects to be able to perform around 1,000 tests per day at each site.  \u201cWe want to get some experience under our belt with these sites and understand exactly sort of what the volume looks like. And we\u2019ll also be improving the logistics associated with each of the sites over time,\u201d CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said in an interview.  Brennan said the company expects to announce a third testing site in a different state on Tuesday and could launch up to three more sites afterward.  CVS was part of a group of U.S. retailers that pledged at a White House news conference on March 13 to open the testing sites in their parking lots. CVS has only opened one drive-through testing site, in the parking lot of a CVS Pharmacy in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.  Brennan said CVS was basically \u201cshutting down that other model\u201d of a single lane drive-through in the parking lot of one of its stores. A CVS spokeswoman said the Shrewsbury site is still operational, but the company is evaluating how and when to transition to this new model in Massachusetts.  The new testing sites will not be located in CVS parking lots. Instead, one will be located at Georgia Tech university and the other will be in the parking lot of a casino in Rhode Island.  CVS will supply personnel from its MinuteClinic unit to oversee the testing. The states will provide security and protective equipment.  The testing is currently available at no cost to patients, CVS said.  \u201cRight now, the federal government\u2019s paying for these tests and will do so for a specific duration of time,\u201d Brennan said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll develop the capability to bill insurance.\u201d  Patients will need to pre-register in advance online at CVS.com in order to schedule a same-day time slot for testing, the company said. Testing at the sites is for eligible individuals who meet criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in addition to state residency and age guidelines.

Shares of the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager fell almost 3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.  CVS, which is in the process of buying health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N for $69 billion, said it now expects full-year adjusted consolidated operating profit to range from an increase of 1.5 percent over last year to a decline of 1.5 percent. That is more pessimistic that its previous estimate of growth ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.  \u201cThe disappointment here is that much of the tax reform benefit on earnings is essentially going away, so near-term it\u2019s not going to provide as much lift to earnings as people were modeling,\u201d said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Mohan Naidu.  Using its tax savings, CVS said it will invest $425 million annually to raise its minimum wage for hourly employees to $11 an hour and offer a paid parental leave program. It also said it will spend at least half of its tax windfall on debt reduction and allocate at least $275 million to strategic investments in its business.  The raise for employees follows similar actions by Humana Inc HUM.N and Walmart Inc WMT.N to attract workers at a time when a historically low U.S. unemployment rate is making it harder to find and retain minimum-wage workers.  \u201cWith $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will be able to make strategic investments in our business in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term,\u201d Chief Financial Officer David Denton said in a statement.  Shareholders may have been looking for CVS to use tax savings to return cash to them through share buybacks or increased dividends as some other companies have recently pledged.  CVS shares fell as much as 3.6 percent before paring some of those losses and were down $2.09, or 2.8 percent at $72.26.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company said it expected adjusted operating profit growth of 0.5 percent to 4.5 percent in the first quarter as it benefits from a bad flu season.  In January, the company projected a tax rate of about 27 percent this year versus 39 percent previously.  Excluding items, CVS reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.92 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average expectations by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S."}}
