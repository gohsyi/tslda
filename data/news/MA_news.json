The holiday shopping season can account for the majority of certain retailers\u2019 annual sales, but the health crisis meant several retailers including Walmart Inc and Target Corp, faced with capacity constraints in certain stores, rolled out their holiday promotions early.

Sadove believes the digital trend will continue to grow in 2021, with smaller retailers also embracing new technology to offer customers new ways to shop.  People spending longer at home due to extended work-from-home and remote learning policies have fueled demand for home decor and home-improvement products, with retail sales in the home furniture and furnishings category jumping 16.2% according to the report.

A significant portion of transactions in China are made through the platforms, which previously only accepted Chinese bank accounts.

The launch marks the first time that Uber has offered such a card outside of the United States, Ranero said. The debit card will be rolled out in six cities, including Mexico City, Tijuana, Monterrey, Puebla, Merida and Guadalajara, and will eventually be extended to the rest of Mexico.  Drivers will not pay any commissions for use of the card, said Carlos Lopez-Moctezuma, head of open banking at BBVA.  Uber and other tech companies have had to find new ways to do business in Mexico, where more than half of the population is unbanked. Even Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador frequently remarks during his speeches that he does not use a checking account or credit card.  Uber already acts as a hook to lure people into the financial system, Ranero said. Uber drivers must have a bank account to receive their earnings, and about 35% of the company\u2019s workforce in Mexico opened an account expressly for that purpose, he said.  As a result of the partnership with BBVA, drivers will be able to open their accounts in the Uber app, without setting foot in a bank, Lopez-Moctezuma said. Many experts blame long lines at banks and a shortage of rural branches for Mexico\u2019s low banking rates.  Uber has also sought to reach riders who do not have bank accounts by accepting cash fares, but the policy has been met with resistance. In late April, Mexico City\u2019s government issued rules that prohibit cash payments for ride-hailing services and require drivers to register with the city, among other measures.  In an interview after the event, Ranero said the company is seeking to discuss the issue with city regulators but will continue to accept cash fares in the meantime.  \u201cWe believe this is a constitutional right of our riders and drivers,\u201d he said.","41":"Dec 6 (Reuters) - Mastercard Inc said on Sunday it was investigating allegations against Pornhub.com following a newspaper column which said many videos posted on the adult website depicted child abuse.

Modi has said when Indians use RuPay they were serving the country as its transaction fees stay within India and could help build roads, schools and hospitals, an endorsement that has worried Purchase, New York-based Mastercard, which is the world\u2019s second-largest payments processor.  \"Today Visa and Mastercard are losing market share in India to indigenously developed payment system of UPI and RUPAY Card, whose share have reached 65 percent of the payments done through debit and credit cards,\" Jaitley said in a Facebook post here about the various results of the note scrapping exercise, known as demonetization.

RuPay process payments between banks and merchants for purchases made with credit or debit cards, while UPI instantly transfers funds between two bank accounts linked to mobile phones.  SOCIAL MEDIA BACKLASH  Jaitley was referring to the volume of transactions, not the value.  Though RuPay, owned by many Indian and foreign banks, accounts for more than half of India\u2019s 1 billion debit and credit cards, industry sources say Visa and Mastercard still process the vast majority of the value of payments transactions in the country. Indian payments transactions were worth $51 billion in August, according to central bank data.  Jaitley said RuPay\u2019s total transactions had leapt to 84.3 billion rupees ($1.16 billion) as of September, from 11 billion rupees before demonetization. Total transactions done using UPI had jumped to 598 billion rupees ($8.26 billion) from 500 million rupees in October 2016, around the time it was launched.  Reuters reported last week that Mastercard complained to the Office of the United States Trade Representative on June 21 that Modi \u201cassociated the use of RuPay cards with nationalism, claiming it serves as \u2018kind of national service\u2019.\u201d  The Mastercard note said that while Modi\u2019s digital payments push was \u201ccommendable\u201d, the Indian government had adopted \u201ca series of protectionist measures\u201d to the detriment of global companies.

Several people said on Twitter they had asked their banks to replace their Mastercard with RuPay, with some using the hashtag #BoycottMastercard to voice their concerns.  One user posted a picture of a Mastercard cut into pieces, while another named Ramesh uploaded a graphic with a Mastercard logo on a toilet flush. A spokesman for the Delhi arm of Modi\u2019s ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, said he had asked his bank to cancel his Mastercard and switch to RuPay.

The European Commission has battled for more than a decade to reduce so-called interchange costs and encourage cross-border trade and online commerce.

Mastercard said: \u201cAt this time, we have no information to share on our ongoing engagement with the European Commission.\u201d  Mastercard has warned it might be fined more than $1 billion if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules, but this might be less if there was a negotiated resolution.  The Commission can hand down fines as much as 10 percent of a company\u2019s global turnover for infringing EU antitrust rules.  But under EU settlement rules for antitrust cases, companies do not get fines nor are required to admit wrongdoing.  The Commission is expected to seek feedback from retailers and consumer groups before deciding whether to accept the offer from Visa and Mastercard. Negative comments could lead it to demand a bigger fee cut.  Business lobbying group EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered the EU investigations, and Visa declined to comment.  Visa and MasterCard capped cross-border fees within Europe - that is, fees on transactions in one EU country charged for transactions in another EU country - in 2014 and 2009 respectively, to end another EU investigation.","55":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa V.N and Mastercard MA.N have offered to cap the fees charged on card payments made by tourists in the European Union to stave off fines and end an EU antitrust investigation.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The European Commission, which has waged a decades-long crackdown on payment and credit card fees, says so-called interchange fees in which the merchant\u2019s bank pays a charge to the cardholder\u2019s bank, result in higher prices for consumers.  This is because the fees, which are a lucrative source of revenue for banks, are ultimately borne by the merchant.  Visa, the world\u2019s largest payments network operator, and its closest rival Mastercard have proposed a 0.2 percent fee on non-EU debit card payments carried out in shops and a 0.3 percent fee on credit card payments, the Commission said on Tuesday.  This would bring their fees in line with those charged for EU cards, which were the subject of a long EU investigation after a 1997 complaint by business lobby EuroCommerce.  The group, whose members include Carrefour CARR.PA, Marks & Spencer MKS.L, Lidl and Metro B4B.DE, welcomed the offer but criticized the big difference in online and offline transaction fees.  Under the terms of the offer for online payments, debit card charges would be 1.15 percent and 1.50 percent for credit cards and the commitments would apply for five-and-a-half years.  \u201cNo such distinction is made for cards issued in the EU... We therefore cannot understand why merchants should be charged more for a perceived risk which can only arise by the card issuers\u2019 failure to implement adequate fraud prevention measures,\u201d the lobbying group said.  SAVINGS CALL  European consumer group BEUC urged merchants to pass on the cost savings to consumers.  Third parties have a month to provide feedback before the Commission decides whether to accept the offer, which was revealed by Reuters last month, or demand a bigger reduction.  Mastercard said it expected to incur a $650 million charge in the fourth quarter of this year because of a substantial fine related to a second EU antitrust investigation.  The Commission three years ago charged the company with imposing rules which blocked banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country. Mastercard scrapped this practice in December 2015 after the bloc adopted rules capping such charges.  \u201cThe case is still ongoing and we cannot comment further on it,\u201d Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.","56":"BRUSSELS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Mastercard will incur a $650 million charge in the fourth quarter of this year because of a substantial fine related to a second EU antitrust investigation, the world\u2019s second largest payments network operator said on Tuesday.

Its workforce will increase to more than 2,000 from 650 now, IDA Ireland, the state agency competing to win foreign jobs, said in a statement on Monday.  That matched the 1,500 jobs U.S. cloud software company Salesforce.com said it would add over a similar period a year ago, which at the time IDA Ireland said marked one of the largest job announcements in its 70-year history.  Foreign multinationals, particularly in the technology sector, employ about a quarter of a million people in Ireland, accounting for one in 10 jobs in the fast growing economy.  \u201cThis is excellent news and further proof of Ireland\u2019s place as a global hub for technology. The 1,500 jobs being created at Mastercard are high quality, skilled positions,\u201d Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said in a statement.  Mastercard, which like other financial payments companies is investing heavily in technology, said it aimed to recruit staff in the growing areas of cyber security, artificial intelligence, blockchain and user experience.  It will take on 22,500 square meters of additional space in two newly built office blocks near its current location in south Dublin to facilitate expansion in what the company said will become its European technology hub.  That will also make Mastercard the latest technology company to establish a campus-style site in Dublin after Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn, Alphabet\u2019s Google and Facebook bought or leased large spaces in the city.  The head of IDA Ireland said last month that he expects the strong multinational jobs growth to continue in the first half of 2020, but subdued global economic growth, continued trade tensions and capacity constraints in Ireland posed significant risks beyond that.","58":"March 6 (Reuters) - Mastercard Inc:  * MASTERCARD SAYS CONFIRMS THAT EMPLOYEE IN SAO PAOLO OFFICE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CORONAVIRUS  * MASTERCARD SAYS CLOSED BOTH SAO PAOLO & PURCHASE NORTH ANNEX OFFICES Further company coverage:","59":"Jan 29 (Reuters) - Mastercard Inc reported a 25% jump in adjusted quarterly profit on Wednesday as customers spent more on its cards to shop and pay bills, boosting fees for the world\u2019s second-largest payment processor.

Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period.  Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates.  About 43% of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28% in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cGlobally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,\u201d Ellis said.

The UK Supreme Court upheld the finding of the Court of Appeal in July 2018 that the MIFs charged within the Visa and MasterCard payment card schemes was an unlawful restriction of both European Union and UK competition law.

The complex case, brought after Mastercard lost an appeal against a 2007 European Commission ruling that its fees were anti-competitive, could entitle adults in Britain to 300 pounds each if it is successful.  The court dismissed a Mastercard appeal, setting the scene for Britain\u2019s first mass consumer claim brought under a new legal regime and establishing a standard for a string of other, stalled class actions.  \u201cMastercard has been ... imposing excessive card transaction charges over a prolonged period in a way it must have known would impose an invisible tax on UK consumers,\u201d said Walter Merricks, a lawyer who is leading the action.  Mastercard said the claim was driven by \u201chit and hope\u201d U.S. lawyers.  The case will now be sent back to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), nominated in 2015 to oversees Britain\u2019s fledgling, U.S.-style \u201copt-out\u201d collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law.  The CAT will reconsider granting the necessary collective proceedings order (CPO) for the case to proceed to trial, having refused to certify the case in 2017 because of its complexity. A hearing is expected next year.  Mastercard said it would ask the CAT to avert a serious risk of the new collective action regime going down the wrong path with a \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d case.  The case centres on so-called interchange fees which credit and debit card companies say they levy on merchants\u2019 banks to cover the costs of card services, security and innovation.  Merricks, who is being advised by law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, alleges these fees were excessive between 1992 and 2008, that they had to be paid by businesses that accepted Mastercard payments from British consumers and were passed on through increased shop prices.  Under the opt-out regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out.  Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. Others argue they can offer an effective route to compensation for those whose claims are individually too small to warrant the legal costs of taking on large companies alone - and that grouping such claims together helps attract necessary funding.  One such litigation funder, Therium, said it now expected to increase its investment allocation to competition class actions.

The directive sparked an aggressive lobbying effort from U.S. companies who said the rules would increase their infrastructure costs, hit their global fraud detection platforms and affect planned investments in India where more and more people are using digital modes of payments.  The companies had sought dilution of the central bank directive, requesting they be allowed to store data both locally and at their offshore offices, a practice widely known as \u201cdata mirroring\u201d. But their requests were declined.  Mastercard has started storing all its new payments transaction data in India at its technology center in the western city of Pune, the company said in a statement to Reuters on Tuesday. It did not specify whether a copy of that data was still being stored abroad.

Visa too has started storing a copy of its new transaction data locally and had sought time from the RBI to comply with the requirement to store Indian data only within the country, two industry sources said.  Visa and American Express did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The RBI directive was part of a wider push by India to ask companies to store more of their data locally at a time when governments globally are enforcing more stringent rules to protect user data.  Government sources have previously told Reuters that stringent data localization measures were essential for gaining easier access to data during criminal and other investigations.  Two U.S. senators this month called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to soften India\u2019s stance on data localization, warning that measures requiring it represent \u201ckey trade barriers\u201d between the two nations.

Banks needed to stop automatically directing debit card payments through the two global networks, and instead give retailers the cheaper option to use EFTPOS, a local payment network, Governor Philip Lowe told reporters after a speech in Canberra.  Global card schemes MasterCard and Visa, alongside the major four banks, dominate card payments systems in Australia. EFTPOS is owned by local financial institutions and retailers.  According to the RBA, processing debit card payments - the most frequently used payment method in Australia - through Visa or Mastercard costs retailers more than twice as much as using the local EFTPOS network.  The retailers association estimates this adds up to between A$300 million to A$500 million ($200 million to $340 million) in extra costs per year.  \u201cWe have made it very clear to the banking industry that we expect them to develop the functionality to allow the merchant to chose which payment rails it goes through, the international schemes or the EFTPOS schemes,\u201d Lowe said.  \u201cIf that process doesn\u2019t work then we would have to consider a regulatory solution.\u201d  Visa and Mastercard were not immediately available for comment.  Low said the banks had promised to develop systems that would facilitate the cheaper route for retailers, and said his preference would be not to have to intervene.  \u201cRegulating here is not the preferred option but it is a fallback option if we don\u2019t see the required change.\u201d  The RBA is currently reviewing the country\u2019s payments regulations to identify strategic issues that should be addressed, including the impact of new payment technologies and new entrants, regulatory technology, and the possible issuance of an electronic form of banknotes.  \u201cOne of the possible reasons for the major banks dragging their feet on least-cost routing is that they each have very extensive relationships with the large international schemes \u2013 we will be exploring this in the review,\u201d Tony Richards, the head of payments policy at the RBA, was quoted as saying in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday.

Tourism accounts for about 12% of Thailand\u2019s economy.  However, weaker Chinese economic growth and a boat accident last year led to a drop off in Chinese arrivals in Thailand in the first half of this year.  The downturn in the number of visitors from China was partially offset by Indian arrivals.  Thailand expects to welcome 2 million Indian tourists in 2019, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Yuthasak Supasorn, told Reuters, adding this was one year earlier than its target.  In August, the government extended a waiver of a 2,000 baht ($65) fee for visa-on-arrivals for tourists from 18 countries including those from China and India.  A growing middle class and increasing wealth in populations and the rise of low-cost airlines will make travel more accessible, Minor Hotels Chief Executive, Dilip Rajakrier, said in an email.  \u201cGiven only less than 10% of the China\u2019s total population having passports today.

A shopkeeper swipes a customer's debit card with the logo of RuPay at an electronics goods store in Kolkata, India October 31, 2018. REUTERS\/Rupak De Chowdhuri  Modi has in recent years backed India's homegrown payments network \"RuPay\", whose rise has broken the dominance of U.S. payment giants such as Mastercard and Visa V.N. More than half of India's 1 billion debit and credit cards now go through the RuPay payment system, and that means companies such as Mastercard face an uphill task to expand rapidly in one of the world's biggest payments growth markets.  Modi has publicly endorsed the indigenous card payment network, saying using RuPay was like serving the country as its transaction fee stays within India and could help build roads, schools and hospitals.  In a written reference to Modi\u2019s stance, Mastercard told the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on June 21 that the prime minister \u201cassociated the use of RuPay cards with nationalism, claiming it serves as \u2018kind of national service\u2019.\u201d  The note, which was sent by a Mastercard Vice President for Global Public Policy, Sahra English, said that, while Modi\u2019s digital payments push was \u201ccommendable\u201d, the Indian government had adopted \u201ca series of protectionist measures\u201d to the detriment of global companies.  U.S. companies in India have been increasingly battling Modi\u2019s policies they perceive to be protectionist. This year, U.S. technology companies have protested against an Indian law that would require them to store more data locally, raising their costs.  The previously unreported note, which was seen by Reuters, shows the extent to which Modi\u2019s support for RuPay frustrated the Purchase, New York-based company, which is the world\u2019s second-largest payments processor.  \u201cIncreasing rhetoric from the prime minister and government mandates on promotion and preference for RuPay ... continues to create market access issues for U.S. payments technology companies,\u201d Mastercard said in the note.  \u201cThe Indian government\u2019s preferential treatment of RuPay coupled with fallacies on pricing must be discontinued,\u201d the company asked the U.S. government to propose.  In response to Reuters queries, Mastercard said in a statement it \u201cfully supports\u201d the Indian government\u2019s initiatives and is \u201cdeeply invested\u201d in the country. The company did not comment on its USTR note and its executive Sahra English did not respond to questions.  The USTR did not respond to a request for comment and it was not clear whether the U.S. agency raised Mastercard\u2019s concerns with New Delhi. Visa did not respond to Reuters queries.  There was no response to requests for comment from Modi\u2019s office.  Mastercard, whose president and chief executive is India-born Ajay Banga, has a planned investment outlay of $1 billion in its key Indian market for 2014-2019. With 2,000 people, India accounts for 14 percent of the global Mastercard workforce, the largest outside the United States.  The company recruited a Bollywood actor this year for a campaign aimed at encouraging consumers in smaller cities to use debit cards more regularly as it seeks to grow in India.  DIGITAL BOOST  In November 2016, Modi started promoting the use of digital payments after replacing high-value currency notes in an attempt to crack down on the black economy.  That increased card usage: Indians in August clocked transactions worth $51 billion on debit and credit cards, nearly double the amount recorded in November 2016, according to data from the central bank, which does not provide separate usage statistics comparing Indian and foreign payment networks.  Foreign card companies have also had to contend with a growing use of mobile wallets and state-backed digital money transfer services, some of which Modi promoted.  RuPay received a major boost due to Modi\u2019s so-called financial inclusion program launched in 2014, which meant that all Indians opening a bank account for the first time were offered a RuPay card, not a Mastercard or Visa.  The Indian card network was developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), a group largely owned by state banks but which also counts private and foreign banks among its shareholders. It also oversees the payments services in India.  In its note to the USTR, Mastercard said the government had mandated banks to support the NPCI directly and indirectly, making it the \u201csole beneficiary\u201d of Modi\u2019s financial inclusion program.  The NPCI acted both as \u201ca quasi-regulator and a competing payment network\u201d, Mastercard said, adding that this was \u201ccompounded by the government\u2019s open preference for RuPay with misleading statements and inaccurate information on pricing, despite Mastercard being priced lower than RuPay\u201d.  Pricing refers to the fee paid by banks to payment processors such as Mastercard for card transactions. The company did not detail which specific statements it was referring to.  The chief executive of the NPCI, Dilip Asbe, did not respond to a request for comment.  At one point, RuPay levied a transaction fee which was half of that charged by Mastercard and Visa, one industry source said, but the U.S. card companies reduced charges in recent months. The pricing and charges are not publicly available.  Modi in June said foreign card companies take their transaction fees abroad and as \u201ceveryone cannot go to the border to protect the country, we can use RuPay card to serve the nation\u201d.  A month later, Mastercard issued a press statement which said the company gets only 15-20 percent of debit card transaction fees, while the rest stays \u201cwithin the Indian economy\u201d. It did not name RuPay.","100":"* Fintech firm secured 8 mln customers in 4 years  * Revolut undercuts U.S. banks with free accounts  * Faces battle to prove long-term profits  LONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Digital banking app Revolut is set to begin issuing its cards in the United States by the end of this year via a partnership with payments company Mastercard Inc, the two companies said on Tuesday.  The announcement follows a similar deal last month where Mastercard rival Visa Inc partnered with Revolut as part of its global expansion plans.  Revolut, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing bank account providers, aims to undercut established players such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase on everything from foreign exchange to current accounts and remittances.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to ensure our product is better value for customers, most U.S. banks charge $10 a month for an account and $10-$15 for local transfers and we\u2019ll be offering both for free,\u201d Revolut chief executive and founder Nikolay Storonsky told Reuters.  \u201cToday\u2019s announcement confirms the two businesses will partner on a minimum of 50 percent of all existing and future cards Revolut issue in Europe,\u201d the two companies said.  Revolut\u2019s deal with Mastercard will allow it to plug into its networks so that Revolut cards will be accepted by merchants in the 210 countries where Mastercard operates.  The British-based banking app aims to hire around 3,500 staff in the next year as it moves into North America and Asia, bringing its total employees to around 5,000.  Fintech firms such as Revolut, Monzo, and Starling have grown rapidly in Britain by undercutting traditional banks\u2019 prices while offering generally slicker service, but they face a challenge to build sustainable profits.  Most make their money from charging a subset of users for premium features, rather than lending money out as traditional banks do.  Revolut may also face a greater challenge in the U.S. market, where customers\u2019 wallets already bulge with multiple cards and local fintech firms such as Robinhood have a head start in offering fee-free stockbroking, one of Revolut\u2019s selling points.  Revolut differs from mainstream banks in that customers\u2019 deposits are not directly protected by government guarantees, but held in segregated accounts at traditional lenders.  While customers have therefore been slow to entrust their savings to Revolut since its launch in 2015, some 8 million customers have signed up for an account, attracted by its slick app and rock-bottom forex rates.","101":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Mastercard MA.N said on Tuesday it expected a resolution to two EU antitrust investigations in the first quarter of 2019.

Fueling their rise is a shift toward cashless financial transactions spurred by a rise in online shopping.  \u201cEverything travels on their rails,\u201d said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, which holds Visa shares. \u201cThey literally sit in the middle of the banks, consumers and merchants and that has been a really enviable place to be.\u201d  Visa had a market value of $449 billion and Mastercard\u2019s stood at about $324 billion as of Thursday\u2019s close. The $1 trillion club currently includes Apple Inc, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet.  Amazon.com stood at $927 billion, though the e-commerce leader\u2019s shares jumped on the heels of its earnings report on Thursday after the bell, putting it in position to crack $1 trillion, as it did briefly in September 2018.  Revenue for both Visa and Mastercard nearly doubled over their past five fiscal years, to nearly $23 billion for Visa, and about $17 billion for Mastercard, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period.  Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates.  About 43% of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28% in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson.  \u201cGlobally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,\u201d Ellis said.  Visa holds a 60% share of the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30%, according to Ellis, with American Express far behind at 8.5%.  Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are categorized as part of the S&P 500\u2019s information technology sector. While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies such as Intel Corp often garner the lion\u2019s share of attention, Visa and Mastercard have been key contributors to the rally in technology shares.  Their valuations have expanded to their most expensive in at least a decade. Visa trades at about 31 times forward 12 months\u2019 earnings estimates, while Mastercard trades at 35 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Both stocks are trading at a higher premium to the market than they have on average over the past five years.  The big run for Visa and Mastercard shares has also come during an more than 10-year U.S. bull market, and gains could be more muted in any downturn. Stocks started 2020 strong but have pulled back amid concerns over the spread of a virus from China.  Risks to the companies, Ellis said, include greater competition in the payment sector from big tech companies, as well as tougher regulations from governments around the world that might hinder access.  The companies are not sitting still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy privately held Plaid Inc in a $5.3 billion deal to boost access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard agreed to buy a majority of the corporate services businesses of Scandinavian payments group Nets for about $3.19 billion.","123":"April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Bank :  * MOBILE PAYMENT EXPANDS TO MASTERCARD BUSINESS TRAVEL CARDS  * CLIENTS WHOSE BUSINESS TRAVEL CARDS RUN ON MASTERCARD NETWORK CAN NOW PAY FOR PURCHASES VIA MOBILE DEVICES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","124":"Jan 5 (Reuters) - Payments processor Network International said on Tuesday Mastercard Inc executive Nandan Mer would succeed industry veteran Simon Haslam as the UK-listed company\u2019s new chief executive officer.

A unit of Visa offered 37 pence in cash for each Earthport share, a 23 percent premium to its initial bid and 12 percent higher than Mastercard\u2019s offer last month.  Earthport shares have risen more than five-fold to 38.80 pence since Visa first offered to buy the company.  Earthport, which had backed the Mastercard bid, said it was now recommending that shareholders accept the increased Visa offer.  Mastercard said it was considering its options and urged Earthport shareholders to take no action in response to Visa\u2019s announcement on Friday.  Both Visa and Mastercard have cited the same reason for their interest in Earthport - the deal would allow it to expand its cross-border network service.  Payment processing has become one of the hottest areas for deal making in the last two years, driven by technological changes in the way consumers pay for products.  Earthport, whose shares fell 28 percent last year until the first bid, offers a lower-cost option to traditional payments systems by allowing banks and money transfer firms to have a single relationship instead of multiple ties with various payments channels around the world.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/Files  The payments processor said the impact of the pandemic on international travel, especially outside Europe, remains significant. The comments echoed sentiments of American Express, which last week reported a 40% fall in quarterly profit and warned business travel would not recover before early 2022.  Mastercard\u2019s shares fell 7% to $295.45, while shares in rival Visa Inc, expected to report results after market close, were also lower.  \u201cWhile we believe that cross-border will ultimately recover, it will take time for people to build their confidence in the safety of travel,\u201d Mastercard\u2019s finance chief Sachin Mehra told analysts on a conference call.  \u201cWe believe that is tied to the broad availability of vaccines and therapeutics, likely towards the latter part of next year,\u201d he said.  The pandemic has forced companies to lay off workers by the millions, hurting their spending power, and the hit to air travel has also taken a toll on cross-border card transaction volumes.  Mastercard reported a 36% drop in cross-border volumes on a local currency basis, with the first three weeks of the current quarter clocking declines of more than 30% each.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move, which has not been finalized, would represent another step in tightening the financial noose on the government of President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters.  The sanctions would be targeted at the elite and groups loyal to Maduro, including members of the military, armed gangs and Cubans operating in Venezuela, while aiming to spare ordinary Venezuelans.  \u201cThe purpose of these sanctions is to continue to deprive the illegitimate Maduro regime of access to funds and deny their ability to continue stealing from the Venezuelan people,\u201d the official said.  Venezuela\u2019s information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has hit Maduro\u2019s government, his political allies and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company PDVSA with a series of sanctions since recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s interim president at the end of January.  It has threatened further measures.  The potential financial sanctions are modeled after similar ones imposed by the Trump\u2019s administration on Iran, North Korea, Syria and, to a lesser extent, Russia, the official said.  The sanctions would aim broadly to block state-owned financial institutions\u2019 access to the international financial system, including credit card providers as well as SWIFT, the Belgium-based financial messaging service.  Specific financial institutions considered to be complicit in propping up Maduro or the whole financial sector in Venezuela could be targeted in the sanctions.  The United States would use its authorities to exempt everyday Venezuelans from making transactions to buy food and medicine.  The sweeping financial sanctions against PDVSA, aimed at curbing crude exports to the United States and driving Maduro from power, were the strongest measures yet against Venezuela\u2019s vital oil sector. U.S. companies doing oil business with Venezuela have been ordered to divert payments to special blocked accounts.  Senior Trump administration officials have warned in recent weeks that Venezuelan banks or international financial institutions could face U.S. sanctions for helping Maduro to steal or hide Venezuelan state assets.  The U.S. Treasury Department earlier this week imposed sanctions on Moscow-based Evrofinance Mosnarbank, jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state companies, accusing it of helping PDVSA evade U.S. financial restrictions.  More than 50 other countries have joined the United States in recognizing Guaido.

Revolut differs from mainstream banks in that customers\u2019 deposits are not directly protected by government guarantees, but held in segregated accounts at traditional lenders.
