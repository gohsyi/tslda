The U.S. insurer reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.36 per share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $1.20 per share in the same period of 2017.

MetLife shares rose 2.3 percent to $46.10 in afterhours trading.  The insurer\u2019s adjusted profit strips out the effect of wild swings in derivatives values, which hurt MetLife\u2019s results last year. The gap between its net income and adjusted profit has narrowed, which shows that the company has been taking the right steps to reduce exposure to market volatility, MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian said in a statement.  MetLife has been working to regain investor confidence after two financial reporting errors for 2017. On Tuesday, it said Treasurer John McCallion would take over as chief financial officer from John Hele, who is retiring.  Two other large U.S. insurers, American International Group Inc AIG.N and Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N also reported results on Wednesday afternoon.

FILE PHOTO: A MetLife Inc building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Adjusted earnings for MetLife\u2019s U.S. business fell 11% to $707 million from the a year earlier. The unit was also pressured by a 16% decline in the retirement business on lower investment margins and less favorable underwriting. Adjusted earnings fell 9% in Latin America.  However, adjusted earnings rose 31% in Asia. The insurer has been working on growing its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia businesses to counter intense competition from online marketplaces in the United States.  MetLife held $15.6 billion in reserves as of Sept. 30 for long-term care policies that are still active, the company said.  The company is among a number of life insurers that typically conduct reviews every third quarter of assumptions they made when writing policies many years ago.  As interest rates decline, some life insurers are having to re-think assumptions they made long ago about what they thought rates would be.  Some one-time items led analysts to take different approaches to the results. Some excluded a charge related to the rates review and the effect of a dramatic gain in the insurer\u2019s derivative portfolio to conclude that MetLife had beaten their expectations.  MetLife\u2019s core earnings per share of $1.54 was above Barclays expectations of $1.40, boosted in part by higher variable investment income, wrote analyst Jay Gelb in a research note on Wednesday.  Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Daily said MetLife\u2019s operating earnings per share were $1.44, above the brokerage\u2019s estimate of $1.40.  Net income available to MetLife common shareholders jumped to $2.15 billion from $880 million a year earlier.  The company reported net derivative gains of $1.25 billion for the three months ended Sept 30, compared with a loss of $378 million a year earlier.  MetLife holds a book of derivatives to hedge against the risk market swings. Such gains do not indicate actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters.  On a per share basis, the company earned $2.30 compared to 88 cents in the same period a year earlier.  Excluding total notable items, such as the impact of an annual review of the company\u2019s actuarial assumptions and costs for an expense initiative, the company earned $1.27 per share.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.40 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","22":"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc MET.N has entered into an agreement to provide pension benefits for about 41,000 FedEx Corp FDX.N retirees and beneficiaries through an annuity, the two companies said on Tuesday.

It also marks MetLife\u2019s entry into the market for jumbo-sized transfers, Dargan wrote. The insurer has historically competed for pension transfer deals with less than $1 million in premiums, Dargan wrote.  Some life insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N and MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees and beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits under those pensions.  These deals, known as pension risk transfers, have been around for at least 90 years, but rising interest rates and stock market values are expected to make it easier for more companies unload their plans to insurers.  In 2017, MetLife disclosed that it had failed to make payments to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies. MetLife since been trying to locate the individuals, whom it intends to pay, the company has said.  The deal \u201cis a vote of confidence after MET\u2019s group annuitant issues and charges of the recent past,\u201d Dargan wrote.  FedEx\u2019s purchase of the group annuity contract will be funded by assets of its pension plan, the company said.

Khalaf, who headed the company\u2019s U.S. and EMEA business, will move into the new role on May 1 after Kandarian retires, MetLife said in a statement.  The new CEO takes over at a time when insurers are bracing for elevated payouts to owners of long-term care policies, which cover expenses like assisted living for infirmed and elderly customers, forcing them to boost reserves.  Khalaf joined MetLife in 2010, after the company bought American Life Insurance Company (Alico) from American International Group AIG.N in 2010. Khalaf worked with Alico for more than two decades in several leadership roles across the world.  Under Kandarian's leadership, MetLife spun off its longtime business that sold individual life insurance into a new company called Brighthouse Financial BHF.O in 2017. The aim was to boost the insurer's share price, besides creating a more nimble company that was less sensitive to interest rates.  Kandarian also pushed for removal of MetLife\u2019s \u201csystemically important\u201d designation, better known as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, a tag that triggers heightened regulatory oversight and requires companies to hold on to more capital.  Up to Monday\u2019s close, MetLife\u2019s shares have fallen more than 15 percent since the spin-off of Brighthouse Financial. The stock was up 1.3 percent in early trading on Tuesday.

She said that a human resources executive referred to her as a \u201cbitch\u201d and repeatedly called her \u201cthe little one\u201d rather than using her name.  Moazzaz said a male \u201cleadership coach\u201d the company assigned to her told her she needed to \u201cchoose between being pretty and being smart because men can\u2019t put you in both boxes\u201d if she wanted to be promoted.  In 2018, Moazzaz said, she authored a \u201ccandidate strategy\u201d for a MetLife executive, Martin Lippert, who was seeking to become its next CEO. Among other things, the document said MetLife had fallen short in hiring minorities and promoting women.  Lippert lost out to current MetLife CEO Michel Khalaf. Moazzaz said she was fired eight days after Khalaf took over.  Khalaf and other MetLife executives are also named as defendants in the lawsuit, which is brought under federal and New York law and seeks unspecified monetary damages.","25":"(Reuters) - Metlife Inc said on Thursday Chief Risk Officer Ramy Tadros will succeed Michel Khalaf as president of the insurer\u2019s U.S. business.

MetLife earned $1.126 billion in such income for the full year, topping the target of $900 million to $1.1 billion it set a year ago.  On underwriting, payouts for dental and other non-medical health claims were lower, cushioning the effect of higher claims from life insurance caused by COVID-19-related deaths, the company said.

The deal, executed through its Farmers Group Inc subsidiary, would expand Zurich Insurance\u2019s P&C business, as the industry grapples with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove up claims for business interruptions and event cancellations.  It would also allow MetLife to exit a business in which it faces fierce competition from larger players such as State Farm, GEICO and Progressive Insurance.  Its P&C business focuses more on car insurance, an area in which people have made fewer claims due to spending less time on the road during the pandemic.  If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced by early December, the sources said.  MetLife declined to comment, while Zurich did not respond to a comment request.  MetLife, whose offerings also include life insurance, employee benefits and asset management, earlier this month reported a 68% drop in third-quarter adjusted earnings at its U.S. property and casualty division, to $18 million.  The decline was driven by catastrophe losses caused by storms in the United States, it said.  The New York-based company\u2019s chief executive, Michel Khalaf, said during its latest quarterly earnings call that the P&C business had \u201can important strategic connection\u201d to the rest of MetLife, but declined to comment on whether he would sell it.  MetLife has been turning to dealmaking to move into more profitable areas.  It said in September it would buy vision-care benefits company Versant Health for $1.68 billion, which would make it the third-largest vision insurer in the United States by membership, and announced in December it would enter the pet insurance market by acquiring PetFirst Healthcare.

MetLife shares were up 3.7 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday, after closing the regular session up 1.8 percent at $41.94.  New York-based MetLife is one of the largest U.S. insurers by assets.  Net investment income rose to $4.49 billion from $4.3 billion, a year earlier.  The results follow MetLife\u2019s annual review of actuarial assumptions that it uses to calculate the capital it must hold in order to pay out claims. Many life insurers review those assumptions during the third quarter to see if they are still accurate.  That analysis can prove troublesome for life insurers who, as a result, must set aside funds for claims on older long-term care policies, which cover expenses like assisted living for infirm and elderly customers.  But MetLife, unlike some other insurers who have long-term care businesses, did not have to set aside extra funds, it said.  Net income available to MetLife common shareholders was a profit of $880 million. The company posted a loss of $97 million a year earlier.  On a per-share basis, the company earned 88 cents compared with a loss of 9 cents a year ago.  MetLife\u2019s loss in the same quarter last year was primarily due to the separation of Brighthouse Financial, its former individual life insurance business.  In the most recent quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share, compared with $1.04 per share a year ago.  Analysts on average had expected a quarterly profit of $1.27 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.  However, premiums, fees and other revenue fell 4 percent to $12.1 billion due to weakness in Asia, Europe, Middle East and Africa.","35":"(Adds analyst comments)  Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc fell short of Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, hit by a fall in adjusted earnings in its U.S. and Latin American businesses.  Adjusted earnings for MetLife\u2019s U.S. business fell 11% to $707 million from the a year earlier. The unit was also pressured by a 16% decline in the retirement business on lower investment margins and less favorable underwriting. Adjusted earnings fell 9% in Latin America.  However, adjusted earnings rose 31% in Asia. The insurer has been working on growing its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia businesses to counter intense competition from online marketplaces in the United States.  MetLife held $15.6 billion in reserves as of Sept. 30 for long-term care policies that are still active, the company said.  The company is among a number of life insurers that typically conduct reviews every third quarter of assumptions they made when writing policies many years ago.  As interest rates decline, some life insurers are having to re-think assumptions they made long ago about what they thought rates would be.  Some one-time items led analysts to take different approaches to the results. Some excluded a charge related to the rates review and the effect of a dramatic gain in the insurer\u2019s derivative portfolio to conclude that MetLife had beaten their expectations.  MetLife\u2019s core earnings per share of $1.54 was above Barclays expectations of $1.40, boosted in part by higher variable investment income, wrote analyst Jay Gelb in a research note on Wednesday.  Morgan Stanley analyst Nigel Daily said MetLife\u2019s operating earnings per share were $1.44, above the brokerage\u2019s estimate of $1.40.  Net income available to MetLife common shareholders jumped to $2.15 billion from $880 million a year earlier.  The company reported net derivative gains of $1.25 billion for the three months ended Sept 30, compared with a loss of $378 million a year earlier.  MetLife holds a book of derivatives to hedge against the risk market swings. Such gains do not indicate actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters.  On a per share basis, the company earned $2.30 compared to 88 cents in the same period a year earlier.  Excluding total notable items, such as the impact of an annual review of the company\u2019s actuarial assumptions and costs for an expense initiative, the company earned $1.27 per share.

The results capture a quarter that analysts had anticipated would be challenging for many life insurers, whose massive investment portfolios were caught in the whims of tumultuous markets toward the end of 2018.  Life insurers amped up risk taking in recent years, moving away from safer investments like Treasury bonds, as interest rates remained near rock-bottom levels.

In an administrative complaint, Galvin\u2019s office accused MetLife of making misleading statements to investors regarding the sufficiency of the reserves it was required to maintain to meet its obligations to pensioners.  Following December\u2019s revelation, MetLife in February announced it would increase those reserves by $510 million. The New York-based company has estimated that the number of retirees affected, both in and outside Massachusetts, is about 13,500.  The complaint seeks an order requiring MetLife to locate all of the hundreds of Massachusetts retirees eligible for benefits and provide them retroactive and continuing payments. It also seeks sanctions, censure and an administrative fine.  MetLife in a statement said it has \u201ctaken aggressive steps to locate unresponsive annuitants who are due funds and already have or will commence payment, including interest, once the necessary paperwork is complete.\u201d  The Massachusetts investigation is one of several launched by regulators in the wake of MetLife\u2019s December announcement. It also faces probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and New York\u2019s insurance regulator.  The case centers on MetLife\u2019s business over the last several decades of acquiring the assets of employers pension plans and converting them into group annuity contracts in a process called pension risk transfer.  Galvin\u2019s complaint said MetLife relied on inadequate procedures to contact retirees, many of whom may not have known the company took over their former employers\u2019 pension responsibilities.  MetLife\u2019s efforts to contact them primarily involved sending two perfunctory letters at age 65 and 70-1\/2, and when retirees did not respond to them, MetLife categorized them as \u201cpresumed dead,\u201d the complaint said.  By marking someone as \u201cpresumed dead,\u201d the assets to which he or she was entitled were released from the reserve, increasing MetLife\u2019s bottom line, Galvin alleged.  MetLife made no other attempts to contact them, yet Galvin said his office since launching its probe has been able to locate the majority of Massachusetts residents missing out on the payments.  \u201cThey weren\u2019t dead at all,\u201d Galvin said in an interview. \u201cNo serious effort was made to find these people.\u201d","47":"March 21 (Reuters) - Resolution Life Group Holdings Ltd on Thursday said it appointed former finance chief of U.S. insurer MetLife Inc John Hele as president and chief operating officer.

The insurer, which announced its results after a two-week delay, said adjusted fourth-quarter earnings fell to $678 million, or 64 cents per share, compared with $1.1 billion, or 95 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting earnings of 64 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  MetLife booked a fourth-quarter $70 million after-tax charge to cover the costs of finding and repaying the potentially tens of thousands of people to whom it failed to pay pensions.  Some life insurers, including MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees who are entitled to benefits under those pensions.  Changes to the U.S. tax code resulted in a $298 million hit to adjusted earnings, the company said.  Total adjusted revenue rose to $15.4 million from $15.3 million.  In December, MetLife said it had failed to make pension payments to thousands of workers. On Jan. 29, MetLife said its group annuity reserves fell short because of a \u201cmaterial weakness in internal control over financial reporting.\u201d  The company said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the matter and said it was delaying its quarterly results to account for the reserve build.

Generali, which ranks as Europe\u2019s third biggest insurer, first approached MetLife earlier this year offering to take on most of its underperforming European business whose adjusted earnings slipped 4% in the third quarter, the sources said.  But talks dragged on for more than six months and were hampered by management changes at MetLife, where Michel Khalaf became the New York-based insurer\u2019s new boss in May, they said.  Representatives at Generali and MetLife declined to comment.  Two of the sources said Generali remained interested in hoovering up a significant chunk of MetLife\u2019s European portfolio, including operations in Britain, France, Italy and eastern Europe, but no agreement could be reached.  They said the price and structure of the deal were the main stumbling blocks and ruled out any progress by the end of the year.  MetLife\u2019s Khalaf emailed staff in late November saying there were no live discussions with the Italian insurer after media reports first emerged.  \u201cNegotiations have been on and off for months. There are still many aspects of the deal that need fine-tuning including the valuation,\u201d a source familiar with the discussions said, ruling out any near-term agreement.  Generali has about 3 billion euros ($3.31 billion) for acquisitions, under its latest strategy plan, and its French boss Philippe Donnet is looking at several dossiers, according to a source close to the situation.  Any deal must come at a fair price and unlock significant synergies, this source said.  Generali wants to boost its presence in certain European countries to drive earnings after pulling back from non-core markets including Belgium and the Netherlands last year.  SLOW-MOVING  MetLife operates in 26 countries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), offering life, accident, health and credit insurance, as well as pension products.  The U.S. insurer runs the bulk of its European assets out of Ireland where its main subsidiary - MetLife Europe d.a.c. - has operations in 11 countries including Britain, Italy, Spain and France.  MetLife controls three other subsidiaries active in Europe and known as MetLife Europe Insurance d.a.c., MetLife Greece S.A. and MetLife TUnZiR in Poland.  The sources said Generali had carried out due diligence on all the divisions, aiming to buy most of the operations including activities in Greece and Poland. But MetLife was reluctant to sell its entire European portfolio unless the price was compelling.  Another source familiar with Generali\u2019s strategy said the Trieste-based company was still looking at MetLife\u2019s businesses, but said Generali would only resume efforts to negotiate a deal after its annual results due on March 14, 2020.  The source said that although things were moving slowly the talks could gain traction next year.  Investors are expected to quiz MetLife on its plans for Europe at a New York investor conference on Dec. 12.  MetLife\u2019s EMEA business is the smallest of the U.S. group\u2019s five businesses, with adjusted earnings of $277 million in 2018, compared with $2.8 billion for its U.S. operations and $5.6 billion for the group.  Insurers in Europe such as Old Mutual, Prudential and Standard Life have been streamlining their businesses via disposals and mergers to grapple with tougher regulatory scrutiny, low interest rates and fierce competition.  French insurer AXA is also considering selling its central European business as part of a restructuring to quit markets where it lacks scale, Reuters reported in October.

Prudential, the second largest U.S. life insurer, said adjusted operating income at its individual annuities unit fell 17 percent to $507 million in the second quarter ended June 30.  Annuities are long term investments an individual makes with an insurance company specifically for retirement purposes.

Prudential\u2019s stock fell nearly 2 percent to $98.56 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.

Life insurers make money by investing premiums they receive for coverage, hoping to earn more than what they pay in claims.  Premiums and fees rose 2 percent to $11.26 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier.  However, claims eclipsed the growth, rising 4 percent to $9.07 billion.  MetLife\u2019s net investment income jumped 31 percent to $4.91 billion, driven by a rise in the value of certain securities. On an adjusted basis, it rose 1 percent despite relatively inactive markets in the quarter, versus a year ago, when steep U.S. corporate tax cuts roiled stock markets.  For the company, business grew across most regions, including the United States, Asia and EMEA, but fell 4 percent in Latin America due to higher expenses and a drop in underwriting fees.  The insurer has been trying to grow its Asia and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) businesses to hold up to intense competition from online marketplace and in the United States, a market crowded with a bevy of insurers that offer competitive prices.  The U.S. life insurer\u2019s net income rose to $1.35 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.25 billion, or $1.19 per share a year ago.

The insurer reported an 8% increase for adjusted earnings in its U.S. business, to $780 million from $724 million, which helped to compensate for quarterly losses in MetLife\u2019s international units.

Such gains do not indicate actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters.

It did not comment on the value of the deal.  The deal, executed through its Farmers Group Inc subsidiary, would expand Zurich Insurance\u2019s P&C business, as the industry grapples with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove up claims for business interruptions and event cancellations.  It would also allow MetLife to exit a business in which it faces fierce competition from larger players such as State Farm, GEICO and Progressive Insurance.  Its P&C business focuses more on car insurance, an area in which people have made fewer claims due to spending less time on the road during the pandemic.  If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced by early December, the sources said.  MetLife declined to comment.  MetLife, whose offerings also include life insurance, employee benefits and asset management, earlier this month reported a 68% drop in third-quarter adjusted earnings at its U.S. property and casualty division, to $18 million.  The decline was driven by catastrophe losses caused by storms in the United States, it said.  The New York-based company\u2019s chief executive, Michel Khalaf, said during its latest quarterly earnings call that the P&C business had \u201can important strategic connection\u201d to the rest of MetLife, but declined to comment on whether he would sell it.

A new U.S. Chamber-MetLife poll of small businesses taken from Oct. 30-Nov. 10 showed that 74% of the owners said they need further government assistance to weather the pandemic. That percentage rises to 81% for minority-owned businesses.  The quarterly poll found that the 62% of small business owners fear that the worst is still to come with COVID-19\u2019s economic impact. Only 40% said they believe their small businesses can operate indefinitely during the current business environment.  \u201cWe must ensure small businesses across the country receive the assistance they need from the federal government,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the Chamber\u2019s chief policy officer. \u201cNot passing the bipartisan compromise for temporary and targeted relief risks the permanent loss of tens of thousands of small businesses, financial hardship for millions of Americans, and unnecessary delays in combating the pandemic.\u201d  Democrats and Republicans in Congress are still wrangling this week over a new coronavirus relief package that would provide additional unemployment compensation and aid to small businesses and other sectors of the economy hit hard by the pandemic.

Staff reduction plans are back up to the 13% level that the survey saw in April during the pandemic\u2019s first peak, he said.

MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mario Greco\u2019s latest M&A swoop confirms his reputation for shrewdness. The 61-year-old Zurich Insurance boss is expanding in the attractive U.S. insurance market thanks to a somewhat less-than-straightforward $3.94 billion deal with rival MetLife. Chunky, stable returns expected from the transaction should ensure the $61 billion Swiss insurer continues to outperform its rivals.  Under the terms of the deal, Greco\u2019s largest yet, Zurich will use its Farmers Group subsidiary to purchase the American property and casualty business of MetLife, and then flip it to partner Farmers Exchanges, a mutual insurer, for $1.51 billion. Zurich\u2019s final bill will thus amount to $2.43 billion.  Though more complicated than a straight acquisition, the beauty of the structure lies in a sweet arrangement between Farmers Group and its U.S. mutual insurance partner. The Zurich subsidiary provides ancillary services such as premium collection and investment management to Farmers Exchanges for a fee close to 7% of the mutual insurers\u2019 premiums. This makes earnings predictable without eroding Zurich\u2019s solvency ratios. The contribution from Farmers already amounted to 28% of Zurich\u2019s annual operating profit.  The MetLife deal should generate an additional annual fee of around $230 million from 2023, says Zurich, plus $30 million in other pre-tax profit. These will come to $260 million once taxed at 24% and after intangible amortisation worth $60 million a year is added back. Divide that by Zurich\u2019s net investment of $2.43 billion, and the return exceeds 10%, well above the 7.8% weighted average cost of capital that GuruFinance attributes to MetLife.  The MetLife transaction is the second sizeable one Greco has carried out at Zurich since the Italian executive arrived four-plus years ago. His A$2.9 billion purchase of an insurance unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in 2017, another reasonably large purchase, was also sensibly priced.  Investors cannot complain. Since taking the helm in May 2016, Zurich shares have delivered a total return with dividends of 115%, Refinitiv data show. That\u2019s almost twice the return delivered by rival Allianz, and well above those produced by France\u2019s AXA and Italy\u2019s Assicurazioni Generali, which Greco formerly led.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife Inc. MET.N will pay $10 million to settle with U.S. regulators over longstanding internal controls failures, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday.  The settlement follows a probe by the SEC into the company\u2019s failure to pay some workers\u2019 pensions, which MetLife disclosed in December 2017. The agency found MetLife violated key provisions of the federal securities laws relating to two errors in how it accounted for reserves associated with its annuities businesses, it said in Wednesday\u2019s statement.  The case centers on MetLife\u2019s business over the last several decades of acquiring the assets of employer pension plans and converting them into group annuity contracts in a process called pension risk transfer.  For over 25 years, MetLife\u2019s practice was to presume annuitants had died or otherwise would never be found if they did not respond to only two mailing attempts made approximately five and half years apart, the SEC said. This led the company to improperly release reserves for their benefits.  The insurer also overstated reserves and understated income relating to certain annuity guarantees assumed by a subsidiary. This was the result of data mistakes, including a failure to properly incorporate policyholder withdrawals. The company did not admit or deny the agency\u2019s findings, the SEC\u2019s statement said.  \u201cOur focus since we self-identified these issues has been to improve our processes to deliver better service to our customers,\u201d said a MetLife spokesperson. \u201cWe successfully remediated both material weaknesses associated with this settlement as of December 2018.  MetLife has separately agreed to pay $1 million to Massachusetts to resolve claims that it made misleading statements to investors in failing to pay pension benefits tot thousands of retirees. In January, the company also agreed to a $19.75-million penalty to New York state\u2019s insurance regulator for the failure.","104":"May 16 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc:  * METLIFE NAMES BILL O\u2019DONNELL AS U.S. CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER  * METLIFE INC - BILL O\u2019DONNELL HAS BEEN NAMED EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO) FOR U.S., SUCCEEDING MARLENE DEBEL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","105":"(Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc MET.N on Wednesday reported first-quarter adjusted earnings that notched up 2% from a year earlier, buoyed by investment growth and strong underwriting in some of the company's U.S. businesses.  MetLife\u2019s adjusted earnings were $1.45 billion compared with $1.42 billion a year earlier.  The insurer reported an 8% increase for adjusted earnings in its U.S. business, to $780 million from $724 million, which helped to compensate for quarterly losses in MetLife\u2019s international units.  Favorable variable investment income in MetLife\u2019s U.S. group retirement business and strong underwriting in its U.S. property casualty business helped drive the increase, the company said.  The insurer had \u201cmodest\u201d claims for life insurance and accident and health coverage related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it said.  MetLife\u2019s overall net investment income sank by 38% to $3.06 billion from $4.9 billion a year ago, driven by unfavorable changes in the fair value of certain securities, MetLife said.  MetLife reported net derivative gains of $4.2 billion compared with $115 million a year earlier.  MetLife holds a book of derivatives to hedge against the risk of market swings. Such gains do not indicate actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters.  On an adjusted per-share basis, the company earned $1.58 compared with $1.48 in the same period a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.44 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.","106":"April 24 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc:  * REASES SECOND QUARTER 2018 COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND BY 5 PERCENT  * SETS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.42PER SHARE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:"}}
