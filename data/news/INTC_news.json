Feb 10 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb called Intel\u2019s resources \u201cunmatched\u201d in the semiconductor industry and said his firm, Third Point, is \u201cexcited\u201d to be a long-term investor.  Loeb updated Third Point\u2019s clients on progress at Intel in a letter seen by Reuters. Less than eight weeks ago he pushed the company to attract fresh talent, keep its best people, and explore deal options.  Last month the company said Pat Gelsinger, who had worked at Intel decades ago, would return as CEO after running VMware .  He also said his firm sidestepped some of January\u2019s stock frenzy by avoiding companies many investors are betting against.","1":"Jan 5 (Reuters) - Jim Keller, a prominent computing chip architect who left Intel Corp last year, has joined a Toronto-based startup developing artificial intelligence chips.  Keller has been named president, chief technology officer and a board member of Tenstorrent Inc, a company founded in 2016 by Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Nvidia Corp veteran Ljubisa Bajic to create an AI chip that mimics some of the ways the human brain works to become more energy efficient than rival chips.  Keller, also an AMD veteran, has been a key player in chip advances at multiple companies. He worked on some of Apple Inc\u2019s early proprietary processors that set apart its iPhone and iPad devices from Android rivals. In 2012, he served a second stint at AMD helping design new high-end processors that have since helped the company gain market share against Intel in the data center market.  Keller moved to Tesla Inc in 2016 to help design a chip at the heart of its autonomous driving computing system before being recruited by Intel in April 2018. He left Intel in June.  At Tenstorrent, Keller will join a team competing against large rivals such as Nvidia, a slew of other startups and internal efforts at companies such as Amazon.com Inc in the artificial intelligence market.  Tenstorrent\u2019s chips - named \u201cGrayskull\u201d and \u201cWormhole\u201d - mimic the human brain in that they are designed to ignore redundant information and respond differently to, for example, a picture of a car versus a picture of a dog, all in the name of being more power efficient. The chips also operate on the assumption that future software will involve programmers giving high-level directions while artificially intelligent computers write much of the nitty gritty code required to implement those human ideas.  \u201cVictory requires a comprehensive re-thinking of compute and low level software,\u201d Keller of the artificial intelligence market in a statement.

Other technology companies including Micron Technology and Dell have pointed to a CPU shortage weighing on their revenue forecasts. Intel is a dominant supplier of such chips.

Intel withdrew that suit and on Wednesday filed a new version in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with Apple also joining as a plaintiff.

Dividend-paying sectors were the best performers of the major S&P sectors, with utilities .SPLRCU up 1.3 percent and consumer staples .SPLRCS up 0.6 percent. Facebook FB.O, Netflix NFLX.O and Amazon AMZN.O, part of the so-called FANG group of stocks, kept the Nasdaq in check.  The Dow was boosted by names such as Boeing BA.N and Caterpillar CAT.N as investors remained upbeat on trade-sensitive companies following the deal negotiated between the United States, Canada and Mexico.  Facebook fell 1.91 percent, in a third straight session of declines totaling 5.6 percent. The social media company, which on Friday disclosed its worst security breach ever, faces continuing calls for legislation to force technology firms to take responsibilities for online security seriously.  \u201cThese are all good companies that have incredibly high valuations so they are susceptible to the flu,\u201d said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. \u201cIt is easy to create fear in these names, given the valuations and this Facebook story, that is bleeding over to these other names.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 122.73 points, or 0.46 percent, to 26,773.94, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 1.16 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,923.43 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 37.76 points, or 0.47 percent, to 7,999.55.

Smaller names, which had been viewed as being more insulated to trade pressures, are losing their luster following Sunday's late-night North American trade agreement. The index is now down nearly 5 percent from its Aug. 31 high.  Financials .SPSY were little changed, shaking off earlier losses stemming from a drop in Italian banks after a senior lawmaker in one of Italy's ruling parties said most of the country's economic problems would be resolved if it readopted a national currency.  \u201cThat is really a blip, it definitely doesn\u2019t bleed through to the U.S. financial infrastructure,\u201d said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny\u2019s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.54-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.16-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 35 new highs and 124 new lows.

FILE PHOTO: Flextronics International Apple factory employees work on Apple Mac Pro computer assembly in Austin, TX, U.S., November 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Tom Brenner  The market has been dominated by Intel Corp INTC.O and Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O since 2006, when Apple joined most other major computer makers in using chips based on Intel's 'x86' computing architecture.  On Tuesday Apple is expected to start a two-year process of ending its nearly 15-year relationship with Intel by introducing Mac computers with Apple-designed chips based on computing architecture technology from Arm Ltd, which Nvidia Corp NVDA.O has agreed to buy from SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T in a $40 billion deal.  Apple will design the chips using Arm technology and have them manufactured by a partner, most likely Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, which makes processors for Apple's iPhone. UK-based Arm's technology also powers most Android phones.  Apple's forthcoming machines already have competition from Qualcomm, which since 2016 has worked with Microsoft Corp MSFT.O to adapt the Windows operating system to Qualcomm's Arm-based processors.  Qualcomm and Microsoft have worked with PC makers such as Lenovo Group Ltd 0992.HK and Asustek Computer 2357.TW to sell laptops using the new chips, and Microsoft's own Surface Pro X released last year uses a Qualcomm processor.  Those devices are niche sellers today, but Apple\u2019s entry into the market is likely to grab consumer attention around the emerging technology shift, especially if Apple begins to develop chips that rival Intel\u2019s performance.  \u201cApple diving headstrong into Arm will speed this up,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy.  Arm-based PCs have key differences from Intel-based machines. Because the chips are derived from smartphones where power consumption is a key concern, they tend to claim better battery life than conventional machines. Like smartphones, they also turn on quickly and can remain constantly connected to cellular data networks.  \u201cWhere the connectivity has shined is the work from home situation,\u201d said Miguel Nunes, senior director for product management at Qualcomm. \u201cWe see a lot of people realizing that their WiFi at home can\u2019t keep up with everything.\u201d  But hurdles remain for Arm-based PCs. Most software written in the past 20 years was for Intel machines, and until it is rewritten, it may have to rely on \u2018emulation\u2019 that could slow down apps.  Intel\u2019s chip lineup \u201cenables people to use their favorite Windows applications without experiencing the potential performance penalties associated with running non-native apps on non-x86 architecture via Windows, or worry if their favorite applications will run on their platform,\u201d Intel said in a statement.  Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies, said the critical test for Arm-based computers will be whether developers rewrite software used by big businesses, which are still the largest purchasers of machines. Apple\u2019s entry to the market does not guarantee that will happen.  \u201cMost of Apple\u2019s hardcore developer base is going to be using Apple\u2019s proprietary developer tools,\u201d he said. But with Microsoft also providing development tools for Windows on Arm, a broader shift \u201cis not outside the realm of possibility.\u201d","12":"SAN FRANCISCO, June 22 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Monday will hold its annual conference for software developers, rolling out new features in its operating systems for iPhones and iPads and possibly signaling a departure from Intel Corp\u2019s almost 15-year run supplying Mac computer processors.  Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developer Conference comes as paid services sold through the App Store have become central to the Cupertino, California, company\u2019s revenue growth as consumers have slowed the growth of iPhone upgrades. Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of the sales developers make through the App Store, which is the only way to distribute software onto Apple\u2019s mobile devices.  Those fees, and Apple\u2019s strict app review process, have come under antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, where regulators last week unveiled a formal probe into the company.  But developers still gravitate toward Apple\u2019s platform because it is lucrative, with a user base that is willing to spend money on paid apps. The annual developer conference, being held online this year for the first time because of the novel coronavirus, is where Apple often announces access to new hardware capabilities, such as special tools for artificial intelligence and augmented reality.  Apple this year could announce a move to part ways with Intel, which has supplied processors for Mac computers since 2006. Apple could announce a move to use its own house-designed processors as soon as Monday, two people familiar with matter told Reuters. The company, which already uses its own processor designs in iPhones in iPads, could announce one laptop model and one desktop model that will use the new chips, one of the people told Reuters.  An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company\u2019s future plans or products.  If Apple announces the move Monday, it will build on a tool it introduced last year called Catalyst, which aims to make it easier for developers to move their apps from Apple\u2019s mobile operating systems to Mac computers.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen\/File Photo  The U.S. company set out its arguments at the General Court in a re-hearing of a case seen as testing the European Commission\u2019s power to go after U.S. tech giants which offer incentives such as rebates to lure customers from competitors.  EU antitrust enforcers in 2009 said Intel tried to block Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to computer makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their chips from Intel.  The General Court is hearing the case for the second time after the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe\u2019s highest, in 2017 disagreed with its 2014 ruling backing the Commission\u2019s decision, in a major setback to the EU competition watchdog.  It told the lower tribunal to re-examine the case and whether exclusivity rebates actually harmed competition.  The Commission\u2019s decision was fundamentally flawed, Intel\u2019s lawyer Daniel Beard told the panel of five judges.  \u201cThe Commission either took a wrong approach in its decision or it carried out an as efficient competitor (AEC) test and it got it wrong,\u201d he said.  An AEC test is an economic analysis that determines if a dominant company knocks out competitors that are as efficient or more efficient through anti-competitive practices while pushing out a less efficient rival may not be problematic for regulators.  Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan criticised Intel for seeking to re-open the entire case.  \u201cThat was assessed very exhaustively in 2014. Intel\u2019s request is a second bite at the cherry,\u201d he told judges.  The Association for Competitive Technology is supporting Intel while French consumer body UFC is backing the Commission. A judgment is likely to come next year while the losing party can appeal to the CJEU.  Qualcomm has challenged a 997-million-euro EU fine for paying iPhone maker Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel.  Alphabet unit Google has also challenged a record 4.34-billion euro EU antitrust fine levied for using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen  Moovit will remain independent while its technology and the data it collects from more than 800 million users in 102 countries will be integrated into Intel\u2019s Israel-based autonomous car unit Mobileye.  The price paid was nearly twice the $500 million valuation when Moovit last raised money in 2018. Intel owned about 7% of Moovit through a previous equity investment and paid about $840 million in cash to assume full ownership.  The deal talks started with Moovit seeking to do a capital raise before the novel coronavirus outbreak globally, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. Moovit had enough cash to sustain itself for about a year, and when the economic impact of the pandemic became evident, it decided to explore an outright sale to Intel, the source added. The deal was negotiated in 40 days through virtual meetings, according to the source.  \u201cMoovit is an acquisition that fills some very critical gaps that we have going forward,\u201d Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua told Reuters.  The initial goal, he said, was to have a small fleet of driverless taxis in countries like Israel, France and South Korea.  Moovit is popular for helping commuters or tourists find the best way to a destination by showing them bus and train routes, bike paths and car-pooling options.  Once integrated with Mobileye, the app will be a platform to order the robotaxis and the real-time data will ensure the vehicles are deployed in high-demand areas, Shashua said.  Intel forecasts robotaxis will be a $160 billion market by 2030.  The decision to buy now, when much of the world economy is at a standstill due to the coronavirus outbreak, stems from Mobileye\u2019s ability to more accurately predict when its technology will be ready, Shashua said. And the target is 2022.  \u201cFor a company like Intel, which has a very orderly plan of how the future should unfold, the coronavirus should not be a setback. On the contrary, you should look at the crisis then find opportunities,\u201d Shashua said.  Moovit has raised $133 million from investors including Intel, BMW iVentures, and Sequoia Capital. In 2018 it raised $50 million in an investment round led by Intel Capital.  Intel has made significant investments already in Israel, including its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye in 2017. In December it bought Israeli artificial intelligence firm Habana Labs for $2 billion.

Courtesy NUVIA Inc\/Handout via REUTERS  NUVIA Inc was founded by Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno in early 2019 and is developing a processor code-named Phoenix. The company on Friday said it raised $53 million from Dell Technologies Capital and several Silicon Valley firms, which will help it expand from 60 employees to about 100 by the end of this year.  The company\u2019s founders, backers and plans have not been previously reported.  Williams left Apple this spring after more than nine years as chief architect for all Apple central processors and systems-on-a-chip. Gulati spent eight years at Apple working on mobile systems-on-a-chip, and Bruno spent five years in Apple\u2019s platform architecture group. Gulati and Bruno also worked for Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google before coming to NUVIA.  At NUVIA, the group\u2019s goal is to take the lessons learned designing powerful chips for small, battery-powered devices such as iPhones and apply them to large, electricity hungry data center servers. The founders aim to make a chip that is faster, more power efficient and more secure than existing data center processors, Williams told Reuters.  \u201cWe want to bring all these aspects that we have developed over time through our careers to this new market and really exploit them in this market, because it\u2019s an area ripe for innovation and advancement,\u201d Williams told Reuters in an interview.  Chip suppliers Qualcomm Inc, Marvell Technology Group and Ampere Computing, a startup founded by Intel\u2019s former president, are all also trying to take on Intel and AMD in the server market with chip technology previously used in mobile phones.  But Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategies, said NUVIA could prove a formidable new entrant based on its founding team\u2019s track record. He said the team made \u201cunprecedented\u201d performance gains with each new generation of chips at Apple.  \u201cI\u2019ve been in and around semiconductor companies for 30 years. There are never any guarantees, but one thread that I\u2019ve seen is that the most successful chip companies have rock star architects and developers,\u201d Moorhead said.  Among NUVIA\u2019s investors is Dell Technologies Inc\u2019s venture arm. Dell is one of Intel\u2019s biggest customers. Scott Darling, president the venture group and himself a veteran of Apple and Intel, said he could not comment on whether Dell will use NUVIA\u2019s chips.  \u201cThe silicon industry is relentless. It pounds forward,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cYou have to have a world-class team to do something disruptive enough that it will prevail despite the response of competitors. At NUVIA, we think we have found one.\u201d  (The story corrects spelling of John Bruno\u2019s surname in paragraph 4.)","25":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to back stricter deadlines for workers to sue retirement plans over alleged mismanagement, ruling Intel Corp cannot avoid a suit accusing it of unlawfully making high-risk investments that cost retirement plan beneficiaries hundreds of millions of dollars.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp's logo is seen on their \"smart building\" in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, Israel December 15, 2019. Picture taken December 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Amir Cohen\/File Photo  The justices unanimously upheld a lower court decision that revived the proposed class-action lawsuit filed in 2015 by former Intel engineer Christopher Sulyma against the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker. The justices rejected Intel\u2019s argument that Sulyma\u2019s lawsuit had been filed too late.  At issue was the time period for bringing a lawsuit alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a federal law that requires plan managers to invest prudently. Beneficiaries generally have six years to sue over ill-advised investment decisions. That deadline is cut to three years if a problem becomes known sooner.  Sulyma was backed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the case. Sulyma\u2019s suit accused company retirement plans and administrators of breaching their fiduciary duty to the participants by placing an overly heavy emphasis on hedge funds and private equity, in contrast to peer funds.  Intel said that the investments were chosen to better diversify the plans\u2019 portfolios and urged that the case be thrown out. The fund participants knew of the issue more than three years before based on emails the company had sent with links to documents about the investments, thus missing the deadline for filing suit, Intel added.  Sulyma countered that while employed at Intel between 2010 and 2012 he was unaware of the alternative investments, that they performed poorly or even what hedge funds were. He said that he did not have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the alleged investment problems because he did not read the relevant documents that were only posted online.  The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 let the case proceed, ruling that the three-year deadline applied only if Sulyma was actually aware of the facts of a violation, not merely that those facts were available.  In Wednesday\u2019s ruling, the Supreme Court agreed.  \u201cThe question here is whether a plaintiff necessarily has \u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of the information contained in disclosures that he receives but does not read or cannot recall reading. We hold that he does not,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the ruling.  In its appeal, Intel had warned that such a decision would make it too easy for a plaintiff to sustain a lawsuit simply by asserting \u201cthat he did not read the relevant plan documents, or simply that he cannot recall whether he saw them.\u201d  During December arguments in the case, conservative and liberal justices alike voiced doubt that most people read investment documents that companies send out.","26":"(Corrects to show that Renduchintala is chief engineering officer of Intel, and not of a particular unit)  July 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp will reorganize its Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group into five separate units, a move that will see Chief Engineering Officer Murthy Renduchintala depart, the chipmaker said on Monday. (Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber)","27":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Monday said it will switch to its own chips for its Mac computers, saying the first machines will ship this year and ending a nearly 15-year reliance on Intel Corp to supply processors for its flagship laptops and desktop.  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it marked the beginning of a major new era for a product line that powered the company\u2019s rise in the 1980s and its resurgence in the late 1990s.  \u201cSilicon is at the heart of our hardware,\u201d Cook said during a virtual keynote address recorded at the company\u2019s Cupertino, California headquarters for its annual developer conference. \u201cHaving a world class silicon design team is a game changer.\u201d  The silicon switch brings the Mac into line with the company\u2019s iPhone and iPads, which already use Apple-designed chips. Cook said that Apple expects the Mac transition to take about two years and that Apple still has some Intel-based computers in its pipeline that it will support for \u201cmany years.\u201d  But the move will give software developers for Apple\u2019s largest pool of third-party apps - those built for iPhones and iPads - new access to its laptops and desktop for the first time. Apple software chief Craig Federighi said that for those offerings, \u201cmost apps will just work, with no changes from the developer\u201d on the new Macs. He also said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of existing apps for Intel-based machines can be modified to work in \u201cjust a few days.\u201d  But analysts said Intel would likely to continue to supply Apple with data center chips that power services such as iCloud. In a statement, Intel said Apple remained a customer \u201cacross several areas of business\u201d and that it was still focused on the PC market.  \u201cWe believe Intel-powered PCs \u2014 like those based on our forthcoming Tiger Lake mobile platform \u2014 provide global customers the best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers, both today and into the future,\u201d Intel said.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  Ben Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, said Apple\u2019s two-year window at moving to its own chips was likely aimed at holding on to Mac sales to corporations, where Apple has double-digit market share.  \u201cThere are just standards there (in corporate software) that run on x86\u201d chips from Intel, he said. Apple \u201ccannot abandon that as quickly as they want if they want to maintain the enterprise and commercial share for Mac, which is one of their major segments.\u201d  As with previous Macs, the new Apple-chipped machines will remain able to download software from outside Apple\u2019s official app stores, in contrast to iPhones and iPads, which for the most part can only run software from Apple\u2019s stores.  Apple shares gained 2.7% to a record high, helping the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to a record close of its own.  FOCUS ON THE APP STORE  Apple announced the moves at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The conference has gained new prominence since paid services sold through the App Store have become central to the company\u2019s revenue growth as consumers have slowed the growth of iPhone upgrades. Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of the sales developers make through the App Store, which is the only way to distribute software onto Apple\u2019s mobile devices.  Those fees, and Apple\u2019s strict app review process, have come under antitrust scrutiny in the United States and Europe, where regulators last week unveiled a formal probe into the company. In what appeared to be an acknowledgement of some critics, Apple said it would let users select non-Apple apps as default apps for tasks like email and web browsing on iPhones and iPads.  Apple this year added privacy protections, saying it would let users only share their approximate location with app developers and would require those developers to seek permission before sharing user data with other apps and websites. Apple also said it would require a privacy and security label, akin to a food nutrition label, to be shown to users before they download apps.","28":"(Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit and raised its full-year revenue forecast, powered by sales to data centers and easing concerns about slowing demand during the U.S.-China trade war.  FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The chipmaker\u2019s shares rose 3.5% to $54.08 in extended trading.  The results came as a relief to the industry after dour forecasts from major chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc TXN.O and Xilinx Inc XLNX.O earlier this week.  After years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders, Intel under Chief Executive Bob Swan has reined in spending, slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.  Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, has doubled down on its core markets such as personal computers and data centers, both of which beat analysts\u2019 third-quarter expectations.  Chief Financial Officer George Davis said Intel anticipated most of the year\u2019s data center spending would come in the second half because many customers bought chips in 2018 and took time to install them.  \u201cData center came back much more strongly than even we anticipated this quarter,\u201d Davis said in an interview. \u201cCloud customers actually grew year over year, and last year was an extraordinary year.\u201d  Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross said Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW, which supplies some of Intel's rivals, had also forecast strong data center demand, suggesting a broader market recovery.  \u201cWe\u2019ve finally seen another major semiconductor company that sees the data center returning as a major driver, as we\u2019ve seen in our measurements, and the electronics supply chain sees,\u201d he said.  Intel has also been contending with a U.S.-China trade war that led to tariffs on its chips. About $200 million of Intel\u2019s third-quarter revenue came from Chinese data center owners purchasing chips sooner than they otherwise would have, likely out of trade concerns, Davis said.  But analyst Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said he suspected much more of Intel\u2019s results were driven by sped-up buying because of tariffs and that could slow sales during the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020.  \u201cWe think this could result in the supply chain inventory digestion\u201d as Intel\u2019s customers work through the chips they have bought, he said.  Intel, which is racing against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co to make smaller chips, said the move to the newer process, called 10-nanometer, was on track and it would have its next-generation, 7-nanometer, chips by 2021.  Swan also said Intel was \u201cwell down the engineering path\u201d for even more advanced 5-nanometer chips.  Revenue in Intel\u2019s client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is the biggest contributor to sales, fell 5% to $9.7 billion, but still beat FactSet estimates of $9.60 billion.  Davis said revenue could have been higher but Intel was unable to make enough chips for entry-level PCs.  \u201cDemand has just outstripped our ability to add capacity,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIn some ways it\u2019s a good problem to have, but anytime you can\u2019t satisfy your customers, that\u2019s not a good outcome.\u201d  Asked by an analyst on a conference call whether Intel would consider turning to an outside foundry to make central processing units, or CPUs, to alleviate shortages, Swan noted that Intel had used outside suppliers in the past and would evaluate the option.  \u201cWe\u2019re investing to recapture process leadership going forward. At the same time, we\u2019re going to be extremely open-minded about, \u2018How do we ensure that we\u2019re building the best products?\u2019\u201d Swan said. \u201cWhere we build them is something that we\u2019ll always evaluate.\u201d  Revenue from its higher-margin data center business rose 4% to $6.4 billion in the quarter, while analysts were expecting revenue of $5.62 billion, according to FactSet.  Intel forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $19.2 billion, and adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share.  Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $18.82 billion and a profit of $1.21 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  For the full year, the company expects revenue of $71 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $69.5 billion. That came in above analysts\u2019 estimate of $69.43 billion.  Intel said net revenue was steady at $19.19 billion, beating estimates of $18.05 billion.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share, above estimates of $1.24 per share.","29":"(Reuters) - Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) said on Tuesday it would buy Xilinx Inc in a $35 billion all-stock deal, intensifying its battle with Intel Corp in the data center chip market.  The deal, which AMD expects to close at the end of 2021, will create a combined company with 13,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC).  The two U.S. companies have benefited from a more nimble approach to grab market share from Intel, which has struggled with internal manufacturing.  AMD has long been Intel\u2019s chief rival for central processor units (CPUs) in the personal computer business.  Since Chief Executive Lisa Su took over AMD in 2014, she has focused on challenging Intel in the fast-growing business of data centers that power internet-based applications and services and are fueling the rise of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation telecommunications networks.  Xilinx has also been working to penetrate data centers with programmable processors that help speed up specialized tasks such as compressing videos or providing digital encryption. Its primary rival in the area, Altera Corp, was scooped up by Intel for $16.7 billion in 2015 in what was then Intel\u2019s largest-ever deal.  \u201cThere are some areas where we\u2019re very strong, and we will be able to accelerate some of the adoption of the Xilinx product family,\u201d Su told Reuters in an interview. \u201cAnd there are some areas where (Xilinx CEO) Victor (Peng) is very strong, and we believe that we\u2019ll be able to accelerate some of the AMD products into those markets.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Lisa Su, president and CEO of AMD, gives a keynote address during the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, Jan. 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo  The tie-up comes at a time when Intel\u2019s manufacturing technology has fallen years behind TSMC\u2019s. AMD, which spun off its factories nearly a decade ago, has rocketed ahead of Intel with chips that perform better. The performance edge helped AMD gain its best market share since 2013 at slightly less than 20% of the CPU market, which has in turn pushed its shares up 79% this year.  Shares of AMD were down 1.8% shortly after markets opened at 9:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT), while those of Xilinx surged nearly 12% after the two companies held a joint conference call about the deal.  Xilinx also uses TSMC\u2019s factories, called \u201cfabs\u201d in the industry, to make its chips, with both U.S. companies using modular designs that let them swap out different pieces of a chip to avoid bottlenecks or delays.  \u201cWe ended up with TSMC, and have stayed with them, not due to any contractual reason - we could go to any fab at any time - but because they are best-in-class,\u201d Peng told Reuters in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about the choices you make.\u201d  Under the deal, Xilinx shareholders will receive about 1.7 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, valuing Xilinx at $143 per share based on a 10-day average for AMD share prices up to Oct. 8, or about 24.8% higher than its $114.55 closing price on Oct. 26. AMD shareholders will own about 74% of the combined firm, with Xilinx shareholders owning the remaining 26%.  AMD\u2019s Su will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Xilinx\u2019s Peng serving as president responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives. The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings.  AMD also reported earnings on Tuesday earlier than scheduled. It reported revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.80 billion and 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.57 billion and 36 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said there is a danger that a major acquisition in an adjacent chip market could distract AMD\u2019s leadership while Intel fights to regain market share.  \u201cThe worry would be, AMD has this great self-grown story of their own, which is just starting to play out. Why are you doing this now? Is it just opportunistic? Does it distract from the current story?\u201d he said.  Xilinx\u2019s Peng, however, said meetings between the two companies have already revealed they have very similar methods for designing chips.  \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really as challenging as some other combinations,\u201d he said. \u201cI had one of my leadership teams who was not familiar with AMD say to me after a meeting, \u2018Boy, they\u2019re just like us.\u2019\u201d","30":"FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Intel Corp and a group of security researchers on Tuesday said they had found a new set of security flaws in its processors that will be difficult to fix and are related to problems found last year.  Intel calls the newly discovered flaws \u201cMicroarchitectural Data Sampling,\u201d or MDS for short. The vulnerability could let hackers read nearly all data flowing through one of Intel\u2019s chips, though the company said the attack is difficult to carry out and that it has not seen it used outside of labs.  Intel chips released this year contain a fix for the bug. But previous generations of chips will need to be patched, and in some instances that fix could slow the performance of the chip by as much as 19%, Intel said in a post announcing the news.  Intel last year disclosed that hackers could potentially read sensitive data on its processors, which power most data centers and personal computers, by exploiting a feature called speculative execution, in which the chip tries to guess which computations it will carry out ahead of time in an effort to speed up the chip.  The so-called Meltdown and Spectre flaws came to be known as side-channel attacks. The flaws - along with how Intel handled its public response - sent its stock price tumbling as investors guessed about how customers would respond to the headaches of patches and performance slowdowns. Intel also faced questions from lawmakers about why it did not disclose the vulnerability to U.S. cybersecurity officials before it was made public.  At the time, security researchers and Intel said similar side-channel flaws were likely to be found in the future. Intel said Tuesday that its security researchers found the new flaws, which were also reported to Intel by external security researchers.","31":"mousesports announced the hiring of Torbjorn \u201cmithR\u201d Nyborg as head coach of their Counter-Strike: Global Offensive team Saturday.

FILE PHOTO: Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Swan, 58, who was previously Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, served as eBay Inc\u2019s CFO for nine years before a stint in private equity and joining Intel in 2016.  His career in corporate finance marks a sharp break from tradition at Intel, which has typically been led by engineers who spent decades at the company and time in both its microchip architecture and manufacturing businesses.  Intel shares fell 2.6 percent to $46.29 in midday trading and shares of competing chip firms gained.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc shares jumped 6.7 percent and Nvidia Corp rose 4.1 percent, helping drive the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up nearly 8 percent. Intel shares were the biggest loser in the index.  Swan will be tasked with getting Intel\u2019s manufacturing operations back on track and fending off newer chip rivals that are eating into Intel\u2019s dominance in personal computers and data centers.  Intel intends to keep manufacturing its flagship CPU chips but remains open to using outsiders to make chips in newer markets like chips for cars or artificial intelligence, Swan told Reuters.  \u201cThis is a capital-intensive industry, and we always have to evaluate whether it makes sense to have manufacturing for a given technology,\u201d Swan said. \u201cIn the high-performance computing arena, we just believe we\u2019re the best in the world at it.\u201d  Given Swan\u2019s short tenure and lack of experience in manufacturing, many analysts believed he was unlikely to be named permanent CEO.  Swan has also publicly said he was not interested in becoming the permanent Intel CEO. But sources familiar with the matter said Swan had privately said he would accept the role if offered.  Swan has kept Intel\u2019s profit consistent with tight cost controls, analysts said. He helped Intel shares rebound after investors were spooked by a July disclosure that the company would miss the target date for its newest-generation chips, though the stock tracked the tech sector lower in the following months.  But questions remain about Intel\u2019s ability to get its next generation of 10-nanonmeter chips to market by the end of this year in personal computers and early next year in data centers.  \u201cSwan is a rock-solid leader and financial manager,\u201d Chaim Siegel of Elazar Advisors said. \u201cMy guess why the stock\u2019s down is investors may have been hoping for someone with more of an operations focus to get them through these (chip manufacturing) transitions.\u201d  In recent decades the chip industry has split between design and manufacturing, with manufacturing firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co specializing in factories that make chips while firms like Qualcomm Inc specialize in designing chips but outsource manufacturing.  Intel is one of the few remaining companies that both designs and manufactures chips. But it has lost its lead in making the world\u2019s smallest chip features to TSMC last year and is facing a growing threat from rivals like AMD and Nvidia that do not make their own chips.  Swan will likely continue Intel\u2019s strategy of recent years to identify areas where it can expand beyond its core CPU chips, such as artificial intelligence chips, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.  \u201cBob will keep the ship afloat. The ship is going where it\u2019s going,\u201d Rasgon said. \u201cHopefully there\u2019s no iceberg.\u201d  But Swan will face tough choices, like whether to keep focusing on businesses like memory and modem chips that connect phones to wireless data networks. Those businesses are much lower margin than Intel\u2019s CPU business, Rasgon said.  Others who analysts saw as contenders, such as Murthy Renduchintala, Intel\u2019s chief engineering officer and a longtime Qualcomm executive, and Intel\u2019s data center chief Navin Shenoy, have been immersed in the details of the chip business for decades.  Media reports had also said Intel\u2019s board was interested in Johny Srouji, the Apple Inc executive responsible for driving the increasing number of custom chips in Apple\u2019s devices.  \u201cPeople wanted a Microsoft kind of announcement, like (Satya) Nadella\u201d said Joel Kulina, a Wedbush trader in Toronto. Nadella led a resurgence at Microsoft that has it vying with Amazon.com Inc and Apple to be the world\u2019s largest technology company.  \u201cBut what do we get? The CFO, because the CEO search produced nothing. ... It\u2019s bizarre for a company like Intel to have a leader who does not have a technical background. He\u2019s a cost cutter.\u201d  Swan told Reuters his skills complement Intel\u2019s existing technologists, some poached from rivals such as AMD in recent years.  \u201cThis company is extremely rich in technical talent, both on the design and architecture side and the process and manufacturing side,\u201d Swan said. \u201cMy role, and my challenge, is how do we unleash that technical talent going forward to continue to do special things?\u201d  Swan had been in temporary charge of the chipmaker since last June when Brian Krzanich left after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee in breach of company policy. Swan will be the seventh CEO in Intel\u2019s 50-year history.  Intel said Todd Underwood, vice president of finance, would become interim chief financial officer as the company undertakes an internal and external search for a permanent CFO.","41":"Jan 31 (Reuters) - Intel Corp named interim Chief Executive Officer Robert Swan to the role on a permanent basis on Thursday while also naming a new interim chief financial officer.

The development comes as chipmakers and machine-vision system manufacturers compete to provide the brains and eyes of automated vehicles.  Intel showed part of the unedited video here at a news conference at tech show CES in Las Vegas. The chipmaker's demo is notable as self-driving car technology companies generally pair cameras with other sensors like radar or lidar to help the vehicle \"see\" its surroundings.  The video showed the car navigating through four-way intersections with no traffic lights, and changing lanes to weave into traffic and avoid pedestrians.  In the video, Mobileye, Intel\u2019s Israel-based autonomous driving unit, said its technology can create 3D models from 2D camera images to help an autonomous driving system better sense the environment. It said the processing is done with two of its latest autonomous driving EyeQ5 chips.  Mobileye also said it can merge the information from its camera-only system with that from radar and lidar systems to use together on self-driving cars.","53":"FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018.

Shortly afterward, Intel Corp said it will exit the smartphone modem chip business.  FILE PHOTO: Silhouette of mobile user is seen next to a screen projection of Apple logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The entire drama played out as the mobile phone industry prepares to shift to a technology called 5G.  Echoing complaints from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Apple had alleged that Qualcomm used its patent licensing business to keep a monopoly on modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks. Qualcomm insisted that Apple was using its valuable technology without proper payment, and Apple later dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips in favor of those from Intel.  In the end, Apple and Qualcomm ceased all litigation, with Apple signing a six-year licensing deal with Qualcomm and also agreeing to buy Qualcomm chips. Hours later, Intel said it was getting out of the modem chip business. [nL3N21Y466]  WHAT IS 5G?  5G is a new network technology for wireless communications that could be up to 100 times faster than current 4G networks. The networks are coming on line in the United States, China, South Korea and other places this year, but probably will not be widespread until 2020. Modem chips connect devices like phones to these networks.  WHO ARE THE PLAYERS IN 5G?  Prior to Tuesday, five companies had disclosed 5G modem chips or plans to make them: Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek Inc, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Samsung and Huawei, however, only make chips for their own mobile phones.  WHY DOES APPLE CARE ABOUT 5G?  Some of Apple\u2019s rivals in the smartphone market - notably Samsung - plan to release 5G devices this year, which could put pressure on Apple to match the feature. Many carriers that are investing heavily to build 5G networks are also likely to put their marketing efforts behind 5G phones.  WILL APPLE HAVE A 5G PHONE THIS YEAR?  It would require an extraordinary effort from both companies. New modems take months of testing to ensure phones will work on carrier networks. Under traditional time lines, Apple would have needed to start testing a 5G iPhone last year, but its supplier Intel did not have a chip ready.  WILL APPLE LOSE MARKET SHARE WITHOUT A 5G PHONE?  Apple was slow to 4G too and did not pay a price. Samsung and others released 4G phones in 2011 as the networks were rolling out. Apple waited until 2012, when 4G networks become widely accessible. Many analysts believe Apple is making the same bet with 5G.  WHY DOES APPLE NEED QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Apple\u2019s only current modem supplier, Intel, said that it would not have a 5G chip ready until 2020, which could have pushed Apple\u2019s launch of a 5G iPhone into 2021 - a long enough delay that it could hurt sales. Qualcomm, on the other hand, is preparing to ship its second generation 5G chip and can meet Apple\u2019s needs with its current products.  WILL APPLE EXCLUSIVELY USE QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Not necessarily. While Apple and Qualcomm signed a supply agreement, Apple is working on developing its own modems and disclosed in court earlier this year that it has held talks with MediaTek and Samsung around modems.  WHY DID INTEL SHARE RISE AFTER IT EXITED THE MODEM BUSINESS?  Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan has told investors in the past that modem chips are not likely to fetch the same high margins as its CPU chips. Intel has plenty of other ways to make money from 5G, like selling CPUs to makers of base stations and so-called programmable chips to makers of networking gear.

FILE PHOTO: A visitor passes an Intel logo at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Sergio Perez\/File Photo  The company\u2019s sales in its closely watched data center business jumped 19%, helping it beat fourth-quarter profit and revenue estimates and sending its shares up 7% in extended trading.  Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview that sales to cloud computing providers were up 48% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, a trend expected to continue this year.  The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker expects fiscal year 2020 revenue of about $73.5 billion, more than $1 billion ahead of the Wall Street consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Davis did not name specific customers, but so-called \"hyperscale\" cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services AMZN.O and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O in the United States and Alibaba Group Holding BABA.N and Baidu Inc BIDU.O all purchase Intel chips for data centers whose capacity they rent out to large businesses.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is very strong demand from cloud players,\u201d Davis told Reuters. \u201cI have to give credit to the hyperscalers for this quarter.\u201d  Intel said its transition to a newer generation of chipmaking technology was progressing better than it expected and that it would boost its capacity to make chips for personal computers, in a sign that the manufacturing woes that plagued the chipmakers over the past year were starting to ease.  \u201cWe think this is going to help us close the gap to customer demand that we\u2019ve been experiencing.

However, Intel\u2019s Davis cautioned that the positive forecast was not directly attributable to the trade deal signed between U.S. and Chinese officials last week.  \u201cIt\u2019s a little fresh to really have a good understanding of how that specific trade deal is going to have an impact on (Intel\u2019s customers\u2019) thinking,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut we like the demand signals we\u2019re getting.\u201d  After years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders, Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan has set a goal of becoming more disciplined about spending, slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.  Intel has doubled down on its core markets such as personal computers and data centers, both of which beat analysts\u2019 fourth-quarter expectations.  Revenue from Intel\u2019s client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is still the biggest contributor to sales, rose 2% to $10 billion in the fourth quarter, beating FactSet estimates of $9.74 billion.  Shares in Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O, Intel's biggest rival in the processor market, rose about 0.8% after Intel's results.  \u201cAMD (stock) is up because Intel saw flattish PC demand even as PC units were up, which implies AMD likely saw strong PC demand,\u201d Cascend Securities analyst Eric Ross told Reuters.  Net revenue rose 8.3% to $20.21 billion, beating estimate of $19.23 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.52 per share, above estimates of $1.25.","68":"Oct 28 (Reuters) - Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier ASM International on Wednesday raised its guidance for the fourth quarter, saying it expected strong demand for wafer fabrication equipment.  The company, which supplies Intel Corp and Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) , raised its guidance for fourth quarter sales to 330-350 million euros. It previously saw fourth-quarter sales in line with the third quarter.  Sales in the July to September period fell by 8% to 315 million euros, within its forecast of 300-320 million euros ($732.78 million).  \u201cSupported by a continued healthy market development in the second half we now expect the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market to grow with a high single to low double digit percentage in 2020,\u201d the company said in a statement.

The gross profit margin in the third quarter stood at 49.9%, up from 48.3% in the previous quarter.","69":"Jan 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc considered tapping Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc along with existing vendor Intel Corp to supply modem chips for 2019 iPhones, according to an Apple executive\u2019s testimony at the trial between Qualcomm Inc and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Friday.  Apple for years relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm as the sole supplier of such chips, which help iPhones connect to wireless networks. Starting in 2016, Apple split the business between Intel and Qualcomm, but in 2018, Apple moved solely to Intel for its newest phones.  But Apple supply chain executive Tony Blevins testified on Friday that Apple has also considered MediaTek and Samsung, one of its largest rivals in the smart phone market, to supply the chips.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Intel shares fell 9%.  The setbacks will have little effect in the next few quarters, but will cause a years-long domino effect, delaying chips meant to counter the rise of rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O until late 2021 or even 2023.  Intel's 7nm delays extend the lead in the smaller, faster chip technology held by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW, which is now expected to remain at least one generation of technology ahead for years to come. They will likely benefit rivals AMD and Nvidia, which outsource their manufacturing to TSMC.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to be pretty pragmatic about if and when we should be making stuff inside or making outside, and making sure that we have optionality to build internally, mix and match inside and outside, or go outside in its entirety if we need to,\u201d Chief Executive Bob Swan said on a call with investors.  Shares of AMD rose 6%.  Intel is the top supplier for processors for PCs and data centers, but Nvidia and TSMC are challenging the logic of Intel\u2019s business model as a both a designer and manufacturer of its own chips.  Swan told investors that Intel\u2019s \u201cPonte Vecchio,\u201d a data center graphics chip meant to compete with Nvidia, will not be released until late 2021 or early 2022 and could use outside chip factories. He said Intel\u2019s first 7nm chip, meant for personal computers, will not arrive until late 2022 or early 2023. Its first 7nm data center processor will not ship until the first half of 2023.  In recent years, Intel has relied on booming growth in data centers that power cloud computing as PC sales declined, though both segments have expanded as the pandemic forced increased technology spending to facilitate working from home.  The company estimated third-quarter revenue of about $18.2 billion on adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share, compared with analysts\u2019 average forecast of $17.9 billion and $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  It updated its full-year 2020 revenue guidance to $75 billion versus analysts\u2019 consensus estimate of $73.86 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  For the second quarter ended in June, Intel said overall revenue and adjusted profits were $19.73 billion and $1.23 per share, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of $18.55 billion and $1.11 per share, according to Refinitiv.  Revenue for its data center segment was $7.1 billion compared to estimates of $6.61 billion, according to data from FactSet. Sales for PC chips were $9.5 billion, compared to analyst estimates of $9.10 billion, according to FactSet data.  Nvidia, which designs but does not make its own chips, earlier this month overtook Intel as the most valuable U.S. chip supplier, thanks to strong sales to data centers using Nvidia chips for artificial intelligence work.  In the PC market, longtime Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O this week announced new PC chips that analysts expect to be powered by TSMC's manufacturing processes. Last month, Apple Inc AAPL.O said it would end its reliance on Intel chips for Mac computers after nearly 15 years. Apple uses chip technology from SoftBank Group Corp-owed 9984.T Arm Ltd.  \u201cThe delay of its 7nm roadmap timing will create even more headwinds for Intel as its risk increased probability of further share loss to AMD and to other architecture like Arm in both its client and data center markets in the next two to three years,\u201d said Kinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights Group.","71":"JERUSALEM, May 15 (Reuters) - Israeli Economy Minister Eli Cohen said on Tuesday he was told by U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp that the company\u2019s board has approved a plan to expand its operations in Israel.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Israeli technology firm Mobileye is seen on the building hosting their headquarters in Jerusalem, May 15, 2018. REUTERS\/Ronen Zvulun  Luminar shares closed down 17.6% after Reuters reported the move. In November, Mobileye signed a supply agreement with Luminar to use its lidar units in the first generation of Mobileye\u2019s driverless vehicle fleet.  Luminar told Reuters that there has been no change to that agreement and that Luminar has also supplied lidar units for Mobileye development vehicles for nearly two years. Luminar said its units, which are only one part of Mobileye\u2019s broader self-driving system costs, are priced at less than $1,000 and exceed Mobileye\u2019s cost and performance requirements.  Amnon Shashua, CEO of Mobileye and an Intel senior vice president, told Reuters that Mobileye\u2019s first generation of full self-driving kits - which will include Luminar\u2019s lidar units along with a range of other chips, sensors and software - will cost between $10,000 and $20,000. They will be targeted at robo-taxis, which are commercial vehicles that can spread the cost of the system over many trips. Mobileye plans to begin rolling out a test fleet of 100 completely driverless vehicles in Tel Aviv in 2022, with other cities to follow.  But for 2025, Mobileye is developing its own lidar sensor that works on a principle called frequency modulated continuous wave, or FMCW, which is different from Luminar\u2019s technology.  Shashua said the FMCW technology will benefit from Intel\u2019s silicon photonics manufacturing expertise and will drive costs even lower for consumer cars. He said the house-built Mobileye lidar, in combination with cameras and radar, will be used on consumer vehicles and could also replace Luminar\u2019s units in Mobileye-powered robo-taxis.  \u201cWe believe the cost of an entire self-driving system can be in the few thousand dollar range, and that brings us into a consumer vehicle position,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can make this work, it will also be used for robo-taxis. But we have time to make that decision five years from today.\u201d  In a statement, Luminar said that \u201cwe agree achieving high-performance lidar at a sub-$1,000 cost is key for production vehicles, and the fact that we\u2019re the first and only company to make that happen has enabled us to land the first production deals in the industry for autonomy. Mobileye partnered with us directly for that reason, with Luminar contractually delivering lidar that exceeds these cost and performance requirements for their 2022 launch and beyond.\u201d  Mobileye is making rapid progress toward a full autonomous driving system using cameras and a custom-made processor chip, but the company plans to augment its cameras with lidar and radar sensors that will capture a three-dimensional view of the road. Mobileye believes it can meet the safety and reliability requirements automakers are demanding for production vehicles by combining the two approaches.  Mobileye has deals to supply its current camera-based driver assistance systems to BMW, Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. Those systems help with tasks such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping and but also generate and transmit mapping data for Mobileye as they drive.  Shashua said that data allowed the company\u2019s test vehicle to autonomously navigate the streets of Munich with only a week of setup and without flying any engineers from Mobileye headquarters in Israel to Germany.  \u201cThis is a critical milestone - this is what you need for scalability. If you want to have a system at the consumer level, it has to be able to drive everywhere,\u201d he told Reuters after the company posted footage of the successful test, which used a human safety driver as a backup.  Mobileye plans to continue outsourcing the manufacturing of its processor chips, Shashua said. He said the next generation of chip, called the EyeQ6 and expected to arrive in 2023, will continue to be made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co\u2019s using its 7-nanometer chipmaking process.

The new chip, called the M1, marks a shift away from Intel Corp INTC.O technology that has driven the electronic brains of Mac computers for nearly 15 years.  It is a boon for Apple computers, which are overshadowed by the company\u2019s iPhone but still rack up tens of billions of dollars in sales per year. Apple hopes developers now will create families of apps that work on both its computers and phones.  The MacBook Air will start at $999, the same as its predecessor, and have up to twice the battery life, Apple said. The M1 will also power the MacBook Pro notebook, which starts at $1299, and its $699 Mac Mini computer, which comes without a monitor.  The new products will be available from next week, executives said.  Shares of Apple were up about 0.2% as the event ended.  Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, estimated Apple will save between $150 and $200 per chip in costs by using its own central processors. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see Apple add any expensive features,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going with a much higher margin.\u201d  EFFICIENT AND FAST  In June, Apple said it would begin outfitting Macs with its own chips, building on its decade-long history of designing processors for its iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.  Apple executives said on Tuesday that the M1 was intended to be efficient as well as fast, to improve battery life, and that Apple\u2019s newest version of its operating system was tuned to the processor.  \u201cThis announcement underscores how important high-performance, custom processor designs will be to leading the next generation of client computing,\u201d said Jon Carvill, vice president of Nuvia, a data center chip firm founded by former Apple executives. \u201cWe think a similar trend is playing out in the future of the data center as well.\u201d  Apple executives made numerous performance claims against prior generations of Macs and Windows-based laptops, virtually all of which are based on Intel chips, though Apple did not directly name Intel.  \u201cWe believe Intel-powered PCs \u2014 like those based on 11th Gen Intel Core mobile processors \u2014 provide global customers the best experience in the areas they value most, as well as the most open platform for developers, both today and into the future,\u201d Intel said in a statement.

The head of the largest U.S. chipmaker is the latest in a line of men in business and politics to lose their jobs or resign over relationships viewed as inappropriate, a phenomenon highlighted by the #MeToo social media movement.  Krzanich led Intel as rival chipmakers ate away at its dominance in the technology over several decades and he also presided over a series of high-level executive departures.  The change in leadership comes as Intel expands beyond personal computers and servers into areas such as artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, where smaller competitors including Nvidia Corp NVDA.O are strong. Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O leads in the mobile chip market.  The board named Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan as interim CEO and said it has begun a search for a permanent CEO, including internal and external candidates.  \u201cAn ongoing investigation by internal and external counsel has confirmed a violation of Intel\u2019s non-fraternization policy, which applies to all managers,\u201d Intel said in a statement, declining to give any further information about the probe.

In the last few months Martin Sorrell, founder of advertising giant WPP Plc WPP.L, and casino mogul Steve Wynn of Wynn Resorts Ltd WYNN.O resigned after accusations of impropriety. Wynn has denied the accusations and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing.  Krzanich, 58, an engineer and Intel veteran known at the company as \u201cBK,\u201d was appointed CEO in May 2013.

TIME FOR AN OUTSIDER?  His temporary replacement, Robert Swan, has been Intel's CFO since October 2016 and previously spent nine years as CFO of eBay Inc EBAY.O. Given his short tenure and lack of experience in manufacturing, he is not likely to be named permanent CEO, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay said.  While Intel dominates in processors for servers and data centers, global competitors are catching up with its manufacturing technology, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.  \u201cBK will go down in history as the CEO that let Intel\u2019s process leadership advantage slip away,\u201d he said, adding that a change at the top could bring in fresh ideas.  Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel, said that Intel would take the change in stride.  \u201cAlthough we respect Krzanich\u2019s efforts in redirecting Intel\u2019s strategy from a computer-centric to a data-centric company, we view Intel as a process-driven company with a deep bench of CEO candidates that can continue to drive the corporate strategy,\u201d he said.  In its 50-year history, Intel has never appointed a permanent CEO who did not come up through the company\u2019s ranks.  But those ranks are thinner than they used to be, with prominent Intel executives such as former CFO and manufacturing chief Stacy Smith, former president Renee James, ex-architecture chief Dadi Perlmutter and Dianne Bryant, who headed the data center group, leaving in recent years.  Instead, Krzanich\u2019s replacement could end up being one of the outsiders he brought into the company\u2019s executive ranks, a sort of \u201cinsider outsider\u201d such as Murthy Renduchintala, Intel\u2019s chief engineering officer who joined Intel in 2015 after helping lead Qualcomm\u2019s chip business.  \u201cThey\u2019ve got some very good people they\u2019ve brought in,\u201d said Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research Inc, who \u201cknow the company, know the new direction. It\u2019s not a turnaround story.\u201d  UBS analyst Tim Arcuri wrote to clients that \u201cthe door is open to hire from the outside.\u201d  Intel on Thursday raised its second-quarter revenue and profit forecast, saying it expects quarterly revenue of about $16.9 billion and adjusted profit of about 99 cents per share, up from a previous forecast of $16.3 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of 85 cents.

Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, during a keynote address at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, gave a preview of AMD\u2019s third-generation Ryzen CPU chips for desktop users.  The Ryzen CPU chips will be launched in the middle of this year and will compete with Intel\u2019s PC processors.  AMD will start shipping its Radeon VII (seven) graphics chips, which compete with Nvidia\u2019s gaming chips, from Feb. 7 and the next generation of EPYC server chips in mid-2019, Su said.  All the three chips are based on AMD\u2019s partners\u2019 new 7nm manufacturing technology that packs more transistors on smaller chips and can boost performance at lower power.  AMD\u2019s longtime manufacturing partner Global Foundries last year said it would quit trying to develop such advanced manufacturing techniques on its own, and AMD said it would move all of its 7-nanometer production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which analysts also believe is making 7nm chips for Apple Inc.  AMD\u2019s EPYC server chips and the Ryzen CPU chips are based on Zen 2 architecture, an advancement over its Zen chips that was launched in 2017, establishing the chipmaker as an equal, if not better than Intel in terms of chip performance, according to many tech websites.  For Intel, which has faced production delays for its 10nm-based chips, this could mean a loss of market share to AMD, analysts have said. Intel has said it expects to ship 10nm PC chips later this year and 10nm server chips early next year.  During the keynote, Su showed that Ryzen III consumed 30 percent less power than Intel\u2019s Core i9 CPU chip.  Intel, the world\u2019s biggest maker of computing chips for personal computers and data centers, has been a leader in manufacturing the tiniest chips so far but recently lost its title to Taiwan Semiconductor.  Su also announced that Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google was partnering to use AMD\u2019s Radeon graphics chips on its recently announced video game streaming service, Project Stream.","81":"(Reuters) - The incoming chief executive of Intel Corp said on Thursday that most of the company\u2019s 2023 products will be made in Intel factories but he sketched a dual-track future in which it will lean more heavily on outside factories.

REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo  The lack of a strong embrace of outsourcing from new CEO Pat Gelsinger drove shares down 4.7% after hours. Shares rose 6.5% during regular trade, when the results were released ahead of the close. The company said it was investigating \u201cnon-authorized\u201d access to some of the results, with the Financial Times quoting its chief financial officer as saying the microchip maker had been hacked.  Intel also forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street expectations, continuing to benefit from pandemic demand for laptops and PCs that have powered the shift to working and playing from home.  Gelsinger said he was \u201cconfident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally\u201d though he also said the use of outside chip factories is likely to increase \u201cfor certain technologies and products.\u201d  Intel has been considering since last July whether to drop its decades-old strategy of both designing and making chips by turning for help on its central processing units, or CPUS, to \u201cfoundry\u201d manufacturers. Those partners could be Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Samsung Electronics. Intel\u2019s manufacturing technology, called a 7-nanometer process, is expected in 2023.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t get our answer on which foundries and when,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cThey pushed the can down the road.\u201d  Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group, said Intel is not likely to outsource its flagship chips.  \u201cIntel\u2019s 14-nanometer chip transistor speed has always been faster than what any foundry can offer even at 7-nanometer,\u201d Chan said. \u201cWe believe it will increase its use of external foundries over-time - just not for its large-core CPUs.\u201d  Keeping manufacturing in-house means higher investments. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon questioned whether Gelsinger, currently the chief executive of VMware Inc who previously spent 30 years at Intel and announced his intention to return just last week, has had sufficient time to dig into the issue.  \u201cIt was pretty obvious they were trying to borrow his credibility\u201d when Gelsinger endorsed Intel\u2019s delayed 7-nanometer technology, Rasgon said.  Intel\u2019s decision coincides with U.S. lawmakers having passed bipartisan legislation to fund U.S. chip manufacturing. But the new law has yet to specify funding levels or recipients, and Forrester Research analyst Glenn O\u2019Donnell said Intel might take the opportunity to solicit U.S. government support for domestic manufacturing.  Boosted by a new high-end PC processor, Intel regained some momentum in the PC market, with volumes of PC chips rising 33%, faster than the 26% rise for the overall PC market, according to data from IDC.  Data center group sales, which powered Intel\u2019s growth over the past several years, were $6.1 billion compared with analyst estimates of $5.48 billion, according to FactSet data.  But sales to cloud computing customers, some of the largest and fastest-growing purchasers of data center chips, were down 15% in the fourth quarter. Data center chip operating margins were 34% in the quarter, down from 48% a year earlier.  \u201cWe think (data center) operating margins are going to improve as we get toward the second half of the year, when we expect to see a rebound in cloud\u201d chip sales, Intel Chief Financial Officer George Davis said.  The company also raised its dividend by 5%.  The chipmaker said it expects fiscal first-quarter adjusted sales of $17.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.10, both ahead of analyst consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Fourth-quarter revenue of $20 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.52 also beat Wall Street targets.

The chip, known as \u201cDG2\u201d, will be made on a new chipmaking process at TSMC that has not yet been formally named but is an enhanced version of its 7-nanometer process, the two people familiar the matter said.  Intel, long the world leader in chip-making technology, has lost its manufacturing edge in recent years and is now debating whether to outsource some of it flagship central processor unit chips, or CPUs, slated for release in 2023.  Activist investor Third Point LLC last month sent Intel\u2019s board a letter asking it to consider whether to keep its chip design and manufacturing operations under one roof.  Intel has long outsourced chips other than its flagship CPUs and is a major customer of TSMC, the world\u2019s leading contract chip manufacturer. The head of Intel\u2019s self-driving subsidiary Mobileye last month told Reuters that its next autonomous vehicle processor will be continue to be manufactured by TSMC on its 7-nanometer process.  With its graphics chips, Intel is looking to tap into the booming PC gaming market. Its DG2 chip is expected to be released late this year or in early 2022 and compete with Nvidia and AMD gaming chips that cost between $400 and $600, the sources said.  The chip manufacturing technology for the DG2 is expected to be more advanced than the Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 8-nanometer process used in Nvidia\u2019s most recent round of graphics chips released in the fall, the people said. They added it would also have a leg up on the Advanced Micro Devices graphics chips made on TSMC\u2019s 7-nanometer process.  Intel declined to comment and TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

FILE PHOTO: An Intel sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Aly Song\/File Photo  The company\u2019s shares fell 6.7 percent in extended trading as the news further stoked fears of an industry slowdown after sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy.  Those fears had lifted briefly earlier this week with better-than-expected quarterly results from Texas Instruments Inc, Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. But after Intel\u2019s report on Thursday, shares of smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday and Nvidia Corp fell.  Intel said weaker demand from China hurt the company\u2019s data center chip business, which has driven growth in recent years as PC sales have slowed and cloud-based services have become more popular.  In an interview, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said data center providers tend to make large purchases in spurts and then spend time \u201cdigesting\u201d the chips as they build out their centers.  Sales in China fell because some buyers there - especially cloud computing vendors - seem to have bought chips earlier than usual last year because of fears about U.S.-China trade tensions, Swan said. U.S. cloud computing vendors continued their usual buying patterns throughout the year, he added.  \u201cI do believe there was earlier buying (among Chinese cloud customers) for server-type products in the course of the second and third quarter of last year,\u201d Swan said. \u201cBut overall I would say ... the prospects and the health of the industry are as bright as they\u2019ve ever been. We\u2019re just in a digesting period.\u201d  That digestion period could last until the second half this year, when Intel\u2019s management said it expects data center growth to pick up again. \u201cWe see the cloud companies as focusing on optimizing the data centers that have been deployed,\u201d Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy told Reuters.  For years, Intel had been insulated from swings in Apple\u2019s iPhone supply chain because it was not a major supplier. But it was the sole provider in 2018 of iPhone modems, which connect phones to wireless data networks, and earlier this month, Apple cut its revenue forecast, citing weak demand in China.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Swan said Intel\u2019s modem business grew by 60 percent over last year but still came in about $200 million below target. The modem unit had \u201cfantastic growth, but weaker than we expected, and as a result that impacted our revenues for the quarter,\u201d Swan said.  Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $17.35 billion and a profit of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe macro environment does not look good at the moment and if it gets worse, Intel could see a further downside to its outlook,\u201d said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group.  Intel\u2019s search for a permanent CEO has lasted six months. Last June, then-CEO Brian Krzanich resigned after a probe of a relationship with another Intel employee.  \u201cI am convinced the board will close on a new CEO in the near future, and I believe the management team, myself and the 107,000 employees will rally behind him or her to take this company as a whole new level,\u201d Swan said on a conference call with investors. \u201cIn the meantime, we will not be distracted by the void.\u201d  Fourth-quarter revenue in the higher-margin data center business came in at $6.07 billion, below expectations of $6.35 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  A U.S. International Trade Commission judge said Apple\u2019s phones infringed one Qualcomm patent related to power management technology, but denied the chipmaker\u2019s request for a ban on the import of some iPhones into the United States.  Thomas Pender, an administrative law judge at the ITC, said that \u201cpublic interest factors\u201d weighed against granting Qualcomm\u2019s request for a ban.  The determination will be reviewed by other judges. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has another pending patent case against Apple before the ITC.  Apple said in a statement that Qualcomm had unfairly demanded royalties for technologies it had nothing to do with.  \u201cWe\u2019re glad the ITC stopped Qualcomm\u2019s attempt to damage competition and ultimately harm innovators and U.S. consumers,\u201d Apple said.  In a statement, Qualcomm general counsel Don Rosenberg said the company was pleased the judge did find patent infringement, but \u201cit makes no sense to then allow infringement to continue by denying an import ban.  \u201cThat goes against the ITC mandate to protect American innovators by blocking the import of infringing products,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cThere are many ways Apple could stop infringing our technology without affecting the public interest.\u201d  Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  San Diego, California-based Qualcomm initiated an ITC case against Apple in July 2017, alleging that iPhones containing Intel chips infringed six patents describing technology that helps smartphones perform well without draining the battery.  Qualcomm did not allege that Intel chips violate its patents, but claimed that the way Apple implemented them in the iPhone does.  In a blog post on Friday after the ITC decision, Intel\u2019s general counsel, Steven Rodgers, said Qualcomm had \u201cpublicly disparaged Intel\u2019s products\u201d as inferior to Qualcomm\u2019s during the case.  \u201cIt is easy to say things, but Intel\u2019s track record is clear,\u201d Rodgers wrote in his post. \u201cEvery day, we push the boundaries of computing and communication technologies. And, the proof is in the pudding: last year, the U.S. Patent Office awarded more patents to Intel than to Qualcomm.\u201d  The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts can.  Qualcomm dropped three of the six patents from the case before a trial that began in June.  Pender said in Friday\u2019s decision that Apple infringed only one of the three patents remaining in the case.","92":"April 25 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp forecast current-quarter revenue below analysts\u2019 estimates and cut full-year outlook on Thursday, sparking worries that an industry-wide slowdown could persist until the end of 2019, sending shares down 7 percent.

FILE PHOTO: The logo for the Intel Corporation is seen on a sign outside the Fab 42 microprocessor manufacturing site in Chandler, Arizona, U.S., October 2, 2020. REUTERS\/Nathan Frandino  For more than 50 years, Intel has operated on the idea that both designing and manufacturing its own semiconductors produce the best results.  It has stuck to that even as most of the global industry has moved to a model where U.S. companies like Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc design chips that are then built by specialized chip manufacturers in Asia, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  But Intel has failed to stay at the cutting edge of manufacturing technology in recent years, allowing rivals including Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc - both of whom outsource chipmaking - to gain share in key markets such as PCs and data center chips.  Intel also famously missed the mobile revolution, opening the door for chips based on designs from Arm Ltd to dominate the smartphone market. And now, customers such as Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have started designing their own chips, to be manufactured by TSMC or other foundries.  Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan says he wants Intel\u2019s design teams to be more flexible about where their chips are made and expects to announce a decision next month on whether the company will outsource some of its 2023 products.  But with shares down nearly 20% this year, Loeb\u2019s Third Point LLC is demanding more dramatic measures. It sent a letter to Intel\u2019s board asking it to retain an investment adviser to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether it should remain an integrated device manufacturer.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Third Point has amassed a $1 billion stake in Intel and wants it to consider separating chip design and manufacturing. That could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to sources.  But spinning off Intel\u2019s manufacturing operations into a separate company \u201cdoesn\u2019t fix anything,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.  Chip factories are only profitable when run at full capacity. Intel has tried to attract outside clients before with little success. And though rival chip factories are struggling to meet demand this year, chip designers must commit to a factory 18 to 24 months ahead of production, meaning it would take the new company time to win new clients.  In the interim, it would likely remain dependent on Intel\u2019s design operations for business - at precisely the time when Intel is considering moving more of its manufacturing away to outside firms.  On the other hand, if Intel\u2019s design teams signed a manufacturing deal with former plants, that agreement could stop Intel\u2019s design operations from competing against rivals that use more advanced production.  AMD signed such an agreement with its former factories when it spun them off in the mid-2000s, which at times prevented it from pursuing advanced technologies as fast as rivals such as Nvidia did.  And selling off Intel\u2019s factories outright to one of the only two other companies capable of making advanced processor chips - TSMC or Samsung Electronics Co Ltd - could also prove difficult, analysts said.  That\u2019s because chip-making requires configuring and programming extremely expensive tools to perform thousands of steps in complex manufacturing process. Retrofitting an Intel factory to replicate, for example, a TSMC chipmaking process would be costly and time consuming.  Intel is \u201clikely to get 20 to 30 cents on the dollar of what they invested, making it a nonstarter,\u201d said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research. For TSMC, buying Intel\u2019s fabs \u201cis almost like trying to take apart one of those big Lego projects that your kids got at Christmas and putting it back together again after the kids threw away the manual.\u201d  A joint venture involving collaboration with TSMC or Samsung is likely the most viable option, said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at The Linley Group.  But any such move would be a permanent fork in the road for Intel\u2019s manufacturing strategy. The company makes more than 800,000 wafers a month at its 15 factories, according to a February report from IC Insights. That is smaller than Samsung and TSMC\u2019s respective 2.9 million and 2.5 million but still enough volume to require a huge investment from a partner over many years.","96":"FILE PHOTO: Qualcomm's logo is seen during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 28, 2017.

FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The accusation, made in a legal filing on Tuesday, is the latest salvo in a drawn-out patent dispute between the two tech heavyweights.  Qualcomm accused Apple of misusing secret Qualcomm software to share information about its chips with Intel engineers in a November lawsuit, but went further on Tuesday by saying Apple stole Qualcomm trade secrets as part of a \u201cmulti-year campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct\u201d designed to improve rivals\u2019 chipsets and ultimately divert Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel.  Apple declined to comment. Intel, which is not named as a defendant in Qualcomm\u2019s lawsuit, declined to comment.  The world\u2019s most valuable technology company previously used Qualcomm\u2019s modem chips in its iPhone, which helped the device connect to wireless data networks. With the iPhone 7, launched in 2016, Apple began using Intel modem chips in some models instead.  Qualcomm told investors in July it believed its modem chips were completely removed from the newest generation of iPhones released this month, leaving Intel as the sole supplier. Teardowns of the new devices have confirmed that Intel is supplying the modem chips.  Apple has cast doubt on Qualcomm\u2019s claims. Last month, it alleged that Qualcomm refused to answer its questions about which specific confidential information it had improperly shared with Intel. Apple has also alleged that it gave Qualcomm the chance to verify that Qualcomm\u2019s software had been used properly.  The dispute, taking place in San Diego County Superior Court, is one strand of a wide-ranging legal battle in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm asked Judge Jacqueline Stern on Tuesday to allow it to attach the new allegations to its existing complaint rather than force it to file a new lawsuit.  DISCOVERY PHASE  Qualcomm has previously said it gave Apple access to its confidential software tools to help Apple integrate its modem chips into the iPhone.  On Tuesday, Qualcomm alleged that, since filing its lawsuit in November, it has discovered that Apple repeatedly used Qualcomm software to help Intel\u2019s engineers \u201cimprove the sub-par performance of Intel\u2019s chipsets.\u201d  It did not present evidence or say how it found that out. The case is currently in the discovery phase, where parties can exchange evidence.  Qualcomm\u2019s modems rely on a combination of chips and software to allow phones to receive wireless data. Qualcomm gave Apple access its source code and software development tools so Apple could modify Qualcomm\u2019s software for use in the iPhone, on the condition that Apple did not use the code or tools to help another chipmaker.  In Tuesday\u2019s filing, Qualcomm alleged that Apple used the tools to open so-called \u201clog files\u201d from Qualcomm and then gave those files to Intel engineers. Log files contain rows of data generated by computer hardware or software, and engineers often analyze them to pinpoint technical problems and optimize the performance of a chip.  \u201cIntel engineers even complained to Apple engineers about being unable to open Qualcomm log files, which Apple had provided to Intel, for lack of the appropriate Qualcomm tools,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing.  \u201cIn response, Apple engineers routinely used Qualcomm tools to create post-processed log files, which they sent to Intel engineers to use in improving Intel\u2019s chipset solutions,\u201d it added.  Qualcomm did not specify in its filing what within those log files, or within the other information Apple allegedly gave to Intel, constituted trade secrets. But it said the information helped Intel.  \u201cIt apparently improved Intel chipsets to the point where Apple decided to divert some of Qualcomm\u2019s Apple-based business to Intel,\u201d Qualcomm said in its filing.","104":"May 21 (Reuters) - Micron Technology Inc :  * MICRON AND INTEL EXTEND THEIR LEADERSHIP IN 3D NAND FLASH MEMORY  * MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC - CO, INTEL ALSO ANNOUNCED DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS ON THIRD-GENERATION 96-TIER 3D NAND STRUCTURE  * MICRON TECHNOLOGY INC - CO, INTEL ANNOUNCED PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT OF A 4BITS\/CELL 3D NAND TECHNOLOGY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","105":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday appeared skeptical of Intel Corp\u2019s bid to avoid a lawsuit accusing it of violating federal law in making employee retirement plan investments that cost beneficiaries hundreds of millions of dollars.

The case is significant for companies because it could expand the time that many plan beneficiaries have to bring lawsuits, which could lead to higher damages.  Conservative and liberal justices alike seemed to sympathize with the former Intel employee who filed suit in 2015 claiming he did not have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the alleged investment problems because he did not read the relevant documents that were only posted online.  \u201cMost people don\u2019t read them, or many,\u201d conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \u201cSo how do you have actual knowledge if you haven\u2019t read it?\u201d  \u201cI must say, I don\u2019t read all the mailings that I get about my investments,\u201d echoed liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  At issue is the time period for alleging violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a federal law requiring plan managers to invest prudently.  Beneficiaries generally have six years to sue over ill-advised investment decisions. That deadline is cut to three years if a problem is known sooner.  The lawsuit, filed by former Intel engineer Christopher Sulyma, accused company retirement plans and administrators of breaching their fiduciary duty to the participants by placing an overly heavy emphasis on hedge funds and private equity, in contrast to peer funds.  Sulyma, backed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in the case, said that while employed at Intel between 2010 and 2012 he was unaware of the alternative investments in the online documents, that they performed poorly or even what hedge funds were.  California-based Intel said the lawsuit should be thrown out because the fund participants knew of the issue more than three years before the lawsuit was filed based on emails the company had sent with links to documents about the investments.  The investments were chosen to better diversify the plans\u2019 portfolios, the company said.  The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year let the case proceed, ruling that the three-year deadline applied only if Sulyma was actually aware of the facts of a violation, not merely that those facts were available.","106":"FILE PHOTO: A logo of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) is seen at its headquarters in Hsinchu, Taiwan August 31, 2018.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Britain's ARM, a unit of Japan's Softbank Corp 4726.T, said on Monday it had struck a strategic partnership with Intel to use common standards developed by Intel for managing IoT devices, connections and data.  The IoT involves connecting simple chips that detect distance, motion, temperature, pressure and images to be used in an ever wider range of electronics such as lights, parking meters or refrigerators.  Some of the world\u2019s dumbest electronics devices get smarter by becoming connected into cloud networks, but also harder to protect.  ARM\u2019s agreement to adopt Intel standards for securely managing such networks marks a breakthrough that promises to drive the spread of IoT across many industries, the two companies said.  \u201cWe see a significant acceleration in terms of how the market will grow in terms of the number of managed devices and the volume of data that moves through these systems,\u201d Himagiri Mukkamala, an ARM senior vice president and general manager for its IoT Cloud Services division, told Reuters in an interview.  The announcement came ahead of ARM\u2019s annual technical conference set for this week in Silicon Valley.  ARM and Intel have long competed more broadly in processors for computers, networks and smartphones.  Most of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of IoT chips rely on low-power ARM designs, including NXP, Renesas and Microchip\u2019s Atmel, while Intel, known for its powerful data-crunching processors, dominates the cloud data centre market, where IoT data are analyzed and processed, Gartner analyst Bill Ray said.  Chipmakers are expected to ship around 100 billion ARM-based IoT devices in the next four to five years, matching the total number of ARM chips shipped in the last 25 years, Mukkamala said.  ARM has predicted that as many as 1 trillion IoT devices will be put to work in the world over the next two decades.  Typically, IoT devices come pre-loaded at the factory with network access credentials, leaving them open to many security vulnerabilities. Periodic fixes require manual upgrades by technicians in the field.  By allowing their devices to be managed via a single management platform, ARM and Intel are enabling such tasks to be automated to keep them secure.  ARM\u2019s recently introduced Pelion IoT management platform will rely on Intel\u2019s Secure Device Onboard specifications announced a year ago. This will allow customers using IoT chips based on either company\u2019s products to manage them in the same system, executives at the two companies said in separate blog posts.","111":"Complexity and Team Vitality each advanced into the playoff semifinals on Friday with quarterfinal victories at the Intel Extreme Masters XV - Beijing Online: Europe event.

Intel\u2019s shares fell 6% in extended trading, as executives tried to brace investors for the possibility that a short-term bump in demand for its processor chips from cloud computing centers and locked-at-home consumers buying PCs could become a slump if the economy enters recession.  \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to think about the second half in terms of how demand is going to look compared to what we ultimately thought when we first gave guidance,\u201d Chief Financial Officer George Davis told investors on a conference call.  The COVID-19 pandemic has ripped through the semiconductor industry, disrupting operations as lockdown orders hit countries in the chip supply chain such as Malaysia, where chip operations were eventually allowed to resume but suffered disruptions.  Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan said the company had to \u201ctemporarily pause\u201d some projects due to local government restrictions at some sites, but said Intel\u2019s factories largely have been able to meet demand.  In an interview with Reuters, Davis said stay-at-home orders around the world drove higher demand for Intel\u2019s chips during the first quarter. Demand for PCs also rose, Davis said.  There was increased demand for data center chips \u201cas people tried to make sure their infrastructure could match the requirements of having so many of their employees working remotely. And obviously with the cloud, there\u2019s much more activity on the cloud.\u201d  But Davis said Intel expects lower gross margins in the second quarter because of the costs of readying its \u201cTiger Lake\u201d 10-nanonmeter processors for the PC market. Intel plans to sell those chips starting in the third quarter. The costs drove Intel\u2019s profit forecast for the quarter below Wall Street expectations, he said.  The costs would not effect the margin for the full year, Davis said, because Intel would be able to sell the chips at high margins in the third quarter as the costs of readying them would already have been accounted for in the second quarter.  \u201cGiven the timing of when the product is releasing, it just has a very big impact in one quarter. That explains more than the difference with consensus on EPS,\u201d Davis said.  But Intel\u2019s ability to recoup the money it is investing in the Tiger Lake chips in the second quarter depends on its ability to sell them in the third-quarter and beyond. Intel executives said the chip is likely to be included in 50 different laptops that will go on sale during the 2020 holiday shopping season but they declined to forecast sales that far ahead.  Intel's tepid forecast also weighed on shares of other chipmakers. Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, Micron Technology MU.O, Applied Materials AMAT.O, and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.O fell between 1% and 2% after the bell.  Intel expects second-quarter adjusted profit of $1.10 per share, compared to analysts' average estimate of $1.19 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

REUTERS\/ Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Semiconductor firm Nvidia Corp on Thursday announced a new chip that can be digitally split up to run several different programs on one physical chip, a first for the company that matches a key capability on many of Intel Corp\u2019s chips.  The notion behind what the Santa Clara, California-based company calls its A100 chip is simple: Help the owners of data centers get every bit of computing power possible out of the physical chips they purchase by ensuring the chip never sits idle. The same principle helped power the rise of cloud computing over the past two decades and helped Intel build a massive data center business.  When software developers turn to a cloud computing provider such as Amazon.com or Microsoft Corp for computing power, they do not rent a full physical server inside a data center. Instead they rent a software-based slice of a physical server called a \u201cvirtual machine.\u201d  Such virtualization technology came about because software developers realized that powerful and pricey servers often ran far below full computing capacity. By slicing physical machines into smaller virtual ones, developers could cram more software on to them, similar to the puzzle game Tetris. Amazon, Microsoft and others built profitable cloud businesses out of wringing every bit of computing power from their hardware and selling that power to millions of customers.  But the technology has been mostly limited to processor chips from Intel and similar chips such as those from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Nvidia said Thursday that its new A100 chip can be split into seven \u201cinstances.\u201d  For Nvida, that solves a practical problem. Nvidia sells chips for artificial intelligence tasks. The market for those chips breaks into two parts. \u201cTraining\u201d requires a powerful chip to, for example, analyze millions of images to train an algorithm to recognize faces. But once the algorithm is trained, \u201cinference\u201d tasks need only a fraction of the computing power to scan a single image and spot a face.  Nvidia is hoping the A100 can replace both, being used as a big single chip for training and split into smaller inference chips.  Customers who want to test the theory will pay a steep price of $200,000 for Nvidia\u2019s DGX server built around the A100 chips. In a call with reporters, Chief Executive Jensen Huang argued the math will work in Nvidia\u2019s favor, saying the computing power in the DGX A100 was equal to that of 75 traditional servers that would cost $5,000 each.  \u201cBecause it\u2019s fungible, you don\u2019t have to buy all these different types of servers. Utilization will be higher,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got 75 times the performance of a $5,000 server, and you don\u2019t have to buy all the cables.\u201d","116":"FILE PHOTO: Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018.

The California-based chipmaker will receive an Israeli government grant of 9 percent of its planned 40 billion shekel investment to expand its manufacturing operations in the country.  As a condition, the economy ministry said, Intel agreed to spend 15 billion shekels in \u201creciprocal procurement\u201d from Israeli companies.  Economy Minister Eli Cohen said an agreement of this magnitude \u201cwill lead to the growth of many companies in the economy, to an increase in their activities and to success in international markets as well\u201d.

The expansion of its Kiryat Gat manufacturing site will add 1,000 new employees to Intel\u2019s workforce of almost 13,000 in Israel, government officials said.  Last month the chip giant said it began plans for site expansion projects in Ireland, Israel and at its U.S. plant in Oregon as it looks to diversify its products for a broader set of customers, such as auto safety and wireless connections for mobile phones.  Intel\u2019s exports from Israel rose by $300 million in 2018 to $4 billion, while it bought $1.7 billion of products from local companies.

Nvidia chips dominate the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms \u201clearn\u201d a task such how to recognize a human voice, but one of the biggest growth areas in the field will be deploying computers that implement the \u201clearned\u201d tasks. Intel dominates data centers where such tasks are likely to be carried out.  \u201cFor the next 18 to 24 months, it\u2019s very hard to envision anyone challenging Nvidia on training,\u201d said Jon Bathgate, analyst and tech sector co-lead at Janus Henderson Investors.  But Intel processors already are widely used for taking a trained artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests, what is called \u201cinference.\u201d  Intel\u2019s chips can still work just fine there, especially when paired with huge amounts of memory, said Bruno Fernandez-Ruiz, chief technology officer of Nexar Inc, an Israeli startup using smartphone cameras to try to prevent car collisions.  That market could be bigger than the training market, said Abhinav Davuluri, an analyst at Morningstar, who sees an inference market of $11.8 billion by 2021, versus $8.2 billion for training. Intel estimates that the current market for AI chips is about $2.5 billion, evenly split between inference and training.  Nvidia, which posted an 89 percent rise in profit Thursday, hasn\u2019t given a specific estimate for the inference chip market but CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday that believes it \u201cis going to be a very large market for us.\u201d  Nvidia sales of inference chips are rising. In May, the company said it had doubled its shipments of them year-over-year to big data center customers, though it didn\u2019t give a baseline. Earlier this month, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Cloud unit said it had adopted Nvidia\u2019s inference chips and would rent them out to customers.  But Nvidia faces a headwind selling inference chips because the data center market is blanketed with the CPUs Intel has been selling for 20 years. Intel is working to persuade customers that for both technical and business reasons, they should stick with what they have.  Take Taboola, a New York-based company that helps web publishers recommend related content to readers and that Intel has touted as an example of how its chips remain competitive.  The company uses Nvidia\u2019s training chips to teach its algorithm to learn what to recommend and considered Nvidia\u2019s inference chips to make the recommendations. Speed matters because users leave slow-loading pages.  But Taboola ended up sticking with Intel for reasons of speed and cost, said Ariel Pisetzky, the company\u2019s vice president of information technology.  Nvidia\u2019s chip was far faster, but time spent shuffling data back and forth to the chip negated the gains, Pisetzky said. Second, Intel dispatched engineers to help Taboola tweak its computer code so that the same servers could handle more than twice as many requests.  \u201cMy options were, you already have the servers. They\u2019re in the racks,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking with Intel, I can now cut back my new server purchases by a factor of two because I can use my existing servers two times better.\u201d  Nvidia has been working to solve those challenges. The company has rolled out software this year to make its inference chips far faster to help overcome the issue of moving data back and forth. And it announced a new family of chips based on a technology called Turing earlier this week that it says will be 10 times faster still, Huang said on the analyst call Thursday.  \u201cWe are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack,\u201d Huang said. He gave the example that \u201cvoice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time. And our platform is just really, really excellent for that.\u201d (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)","118":"March 29 (Reuters) - Intel Corp:  * INTEL ANNOUNCES JUDGMENT OF THE ENTERPRISE CHAMBER IN COMPULSORY ACQUISITION PROCEEDING FOR REMAINING MOBILEYE SHARES  * INTEL - ENTERPRISE CHAMBER ORDERED ALL MINORITY MOBILEYE SHAREHOLDERS TO TRANSFER THEIR SHARES TO CYCLOPS IN EXCHANGE FOR PAYMENT OF $63.54\/SHARE IN CASH  * INTEL - FROM MARCH 27 TO APRIL 25, MOBILEYE SHAREHOLDERS CAN ADHERE TO THE ENTERPRISE CHAMBER JUDGMENT BY TRANSFERRING THEIR MOBILEYE SHARES TO CYCLOPS HOLDINGS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","119":"FILE PHOTO: Computer chip maker Intel's logo is shown on a gaming computer display during the opening day of E3, the annual video games expo revealing the latest in gaming software and hardware in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2019.

Intel, the world\u2019s second-largest chip maker by revenue, got into the wireless data business with its acquisition of German modem maker Infineon in 2011. Its sole major modem customer is Apple Inc, whose iPhones feature Intel modem chips to connect to mobile data networks.  But the cutthroat modem business, where Intel competes against rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and MediaTek Inc, has lower margins than Intel is accustomed to making on its flagship processor chips that go into personal computers and data centers.  But Bob Swan, Intel\u2019s chief executive, said Intel\u2019s future in 5G networks, which are expected to roll out this year and next and be much faster than current 4G networks, extends beyond selling modems to phone makers.  Intel plans to also sell modems to automakers for use in connected vehicles, as well as to manufacturers for use in connecting industrial equipment. And Intel also plans to land its other chips - including processors and the so-called programmable chips it gained by acquiring Altera Inc in 2016 - in a variety of networking gear, he said.  \u201cWhere investors have been most anxious is, we were catching up for a while.

Gelsinger, who started his career at Intel at 18 and spent 30 years at the company, was among the most credible candidates to take the company\u2019s helm, analysts said, and shares rose more than 8% in morning trading. He joined Intel before college, went on to have a storied career at EMC and VMware, and will return to a company at a historic crossroads.  Activist investor Third Point LLC last month sent Intel\u2019s board a letter asking it to consider dividing its chip design and manufacturing operations, given that rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp outsource their manufacturing work to specialists such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd.  Gelsinger has confronted similar transitions as the chief of VMware since 2012. He successfully guided the company, whose software helps companies squeeze more work out of data center servers, from an era of privately owned data centers to public cloud providers, in part by striking a seminal deal with Amazon.com\u2019s Amazon Web Services and keeping abreast of open-source software trends that swept the industry.  Gelsinger, who will take the helm at Intel on Feb. 15, led more than a dozen microprocessor programs at Intel and became its first chief technology officer. He started there before college, attending Santa Clara University and Stanford University while also working at Intel.  He is a prominent Christian in the largely secular world of Silicon Valley and has written a book on balancing his faith, family and career.  In a letter to Intel\u2019s employees, Gelsinger likened the move to coming \u201chome.\u201d  \u201cHaving begun my career at Intel and learned at the feet of Grove, Noyce and Moore, it\u2019s my privilege and honor to return in this leadership capacity,\u201d Gelsinger said in a statement, referring to the early leaders of Intel. \u201cI have tremendous regard for the company\u2019s rich history and powerful technologies that have created the world\u2019s digital infrastructure.\u201d  Analysts expect Intel to strike a partnership with another major chip manufacturer as part of its plan to address its manufacturing challenges.  With a company veteran at the helm and recent legislation passed in the United States aimed at retaining advanced domestic semiconductor manufacturing, Intel\u2019s \u201codds of success are now greatly improved,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said in a note to clients.  Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Gelsinger had turned down the top Intel job before, and it was not immediately clear what had changed his mind.  Gelsinger will face years of missteps in Intel\u2019s manufacturing business. Under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, Intel sprawled into new fields such as modem chips without success, while blowing three years of deadlines for its 10-nanometer chipmaking process, allowing rivals such as TSMC and Samsung to gain a lead that some analysts believe is now all but insurmountable.  Third Point\u2019s Dan Loeb had sent a letter to Intel\u2019s board of directors late last month urging the company to rein in an outflow of engineers to rival firms, though he stopped short of blaming Swan for the company\u2019s troubles.  On Jan. 4, Swan met with Third Point Chief Executive Dan Loeb and Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, according to a person familiar with the matter. Loeb pushed Intel to find new executives and potential new board members and held at least one followup meeting.  Intel on Wednesday said it expects to beat its financial forecast for the fourth quarter of 2020 and that it has made \u201cstrong progress\u201d in addressing issues with its 7-nanometer chip manufacturing technology.  \u201cFrom a credibility standpoint, he\u2019s great - he\u2019s probably the one at the top of most people\u2019s list for who they would want to see,\u201d Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, said of Gelsinger\u2019s appointment.  Swan, a former chief financial officer from eBay, had served as Intel\u2019s finance chief and was named its interim CEO when Brian Krzanich resigned in June 2018, later getting the permanent job.","123":"July 27 (Reuters) - Intel Corp shares fell more than 6 percent on Friday, after the chipmaker\u2019s upbeat results were overshadowed by concerns that Advanced Micro Devices Inc may be chiseling off market share from its high-margin data center business.  The company\u2019s profit and revenue beat Wall Street targets, but double-digit growth in its data center chip business fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations and disappointed investors.  \u201cIntel stock continues to be under pressure as investors are looking past near term outperformance and struggling with the storyline of potential future share loss to AMD,\u201d Barclays analysts said.  Intel was at the forefront of selling chips used in making servers where data is stored remotely or in so-called cloud servers. Over the past few years as more companies rushed to the cloud to move data online, Intel enjoyed healthy gains.  Amazon, which beat profit estimates on Thursday due to its cloud business, and Microsoft have been the main beneficiaries of the cloud adoption.  Intel\u2019s Xeon family of server chips had a near-monopoly of the market, but started to face competition last year after smaller rival AMD re-entered the server business after a decade with EPYC 7000 series processors that earned positive reviews.  EPYC chips outperformed Xeon in certain tasks and provided better performance-per-dollar than what Intel chips offered, according here to tests done by Anandtech after the launch last year.  While AMD currently has a small share of the server business, a loss of market share will hamper Intel\u2019s plans to focus on data centers to diversify away from stagnating PC business, where it is the market leader.  AMD shares are up 5 percent at $19.32 in early trade. Intel shares were trading down at $48.75.  \u201cWe see the stock as increasingly binary around their ability to hold off AMD in the data center,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts said of Intel. \u201cWe don\u2019t see the stock outperforming if AMD successfully takes 3-4 points of server market share in the next 2 quarters and gets to 10% by the end of next year.\u201d  At least four brokerages cut their price targets on Intel stock, while six brokerages had raised their targets on AMD stock after it reported strong quarterly results earlier this week, mainly due to high demand for server chips.

Rubio is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees human rights, and McGovern chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.  The letters were sent to the chief executives of the companies, who were asked to respond to questions about their exports to China.  The executives were also asked whether they knew their technology would be used to support surveillance activities conducted by China\u2019s police forces and whether they took steps to ensure their products were not used for human rights abuses or to compromise U.S. national security.  Nvidia declined to comment. Intel spokesman William Moss said the company does not tolerate its products being used to violate human rights and when the company becomes aware of such a concern it ceases or restricts business with third parties until it has confidence its products are not used to commit such violations.  The United Nations has estimated that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region. The U.S. State Department has accused Chinese officials of subjecting Uighur Muslims to torture, abuse \u201cand trying to basically erase their culture and their religion.\u201d  Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions over the repression of China\u2019s Uighurs.

REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - SK Hynix\u2019s chip deal is just what the sector needs right now. South Korea\u2019s semiconductor giant will buy Intel\u2019s NAND memory business for $9 billion - its largest acquisition ever. Less competition might prop up prices, which have plunged on uncertain demand. In the long term, stronger chipmakers may stand a better chance against Chinese entrants.  Tuesday\u2019s all-cash deal will propel SK Hynix to become the world\u2019s second largest maker of so-called NAND chips, widely used in PCs, servers and smartphones. It\u2019s a prudent move for Intel boss Bob Swan, who has been grappling with product delays and technological fumbles while fending off competitors like AMD and Nvidia, which are muscling in on the company\u2019s main processor business. Offloading the NAND unit, which accounted for less than a tenth of total first-half sales, should help Intel refocus.  Financially, the deal is a bold move for the $55 billion chipmaker, which specialises in making dynamic random-access memory chips. Adding the new business will help it overtake Japan\u2019s Kioxia and catch up with market leader Samsung Electronics, but will probably drag down profitability. NAND chips have lower margins than DRAM, and intense competition in the sector makes it prone to price wars. Analysts at Bernstein estimate gross margins at SK\u2019s DRAM and NAND divisions this year to be roughly 50% and negative 5% respectively.  Before this deal was announced, Morningstar analysts projected average selling prices for NAND chips would fall 18% annually between 2019 to 2024. Consolidation might slow or stop this slide. It will also provide a bulwark against eager rivals from the People\u2019s Republic like Yangtze Memory Technologies Company, which are pouring billions of dollars into catching up. In this case, the best offense is a good defense.","129":"FILE PHOTO: Computer chip maker Intel's logo is shown on a gaming computer display during the opening day of E3, the annual video games expo revealing the latest in gaming software and hardware in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2019.

Intel said it would buy Smart Edge, a software that helps split up data and store it closer to users to make computing devices respond faster.  The software is designed to run on Intel\u2019s chips, which are best known as the heart of most personal computers but which the company is aiming to sell into equipment for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks that is being rolled out starting this year.

Pivot, which has a market value of about $43 million, was issued a U.S. patent on Smart Edge\u2019s technology in July.  Intel, which expects to close the Smart Edge deal in the fourth quarter, views 5G as a chance to expand its sales beyond personal computers and data centers, its two largest business segments.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen  (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O on Thursday disclosed a new method for making transistors on semiconductors that its chief architect said could boost the performance Intel's next round of processors by as much as 20%.  The Santa Clara, California-based company is one of the few remaining in the world that both designs and manufactures its own chips. But its manufacturing operations have become a concern among investors after Intel last month said that its next-generation chip-making process, called its 7-nanonmeter process node, would be delayed.  Analysts believe the delays could cement the lead that rivals such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW have gained in making smaller, more power efficient chips. Intel's shares have fallen nearly 20% since the delays were disclosed.  On Thursday, Intel sought to buck the notion that the single-number names given to each generation of chip process node tell the entire story by disclosing improvements on its existing 10-nanonmeter process node. It announced a new way of making what it now calls \u201cSuperFin\u201d transistors, which, along with a new material being used to improve the capacitors on chips, is expected to boost the performance of Intel\u2019s forthcoming processors, despite their still being made on 10-nanonmeter manufacturing lines.  \u201cIt is 20%, the largest intra-node jump ever in our history,\u201d Raja Koduri, Intel\u2019s chief architect, said of the performance gain in an interview with Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s actually same as what you would get with one full Moore\u2019s Law node of performance.\u201d  It will not be possible to test those claims in the real world until Intel\u2019s new chips come out, but its \u201cTiger Lake\u201d laptop chips slated for release this fall will use the chips.

On Friday, Trump said he planned to push ahead with tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports. While chips were largely spared from the initial list of targeted goods released in April, U.S. trade officials on Friday released a second tariff list of 284 products worth $16 billion that includes the processor and memory chips at the heart of Intel\u2019s business.  Those tariffs will not go into effect until after a public comment period, and there is a chance that chips could be cut from it before it is made final, analysts said. But Intel shares dropped 3.4 percent to $53.22 on Monday on investor concerns. Late Monday, Trump also announced he might pursue $200 billion more in tariffs on Chinese goods, though it was unclear whether the list would include more chips or computing products that might impact Intel.  Intel could shift its production strategies to avoid much of the blow. Intel produces raw chips at six so-called wafer fabs, with three in the United States, one in Ireland, one in Israel and one in China. From there, chips go to so-called assembly and test facilities.  After that, they are sold to Intel\u2019s customers, large computer brands or contract manufacturers who work on their behalf. Most of those entities are legally based in China because that is where most electronics are built, and that explains why Intel booked $14.8 billion in China revenue in 2017.  But it is Intel\u2019s $12.5 billion revenue from the United States that is at risk. If Intel makes a chip at its U.S. plants in Oregon, Arizona or New Mexico, then sends it to China for low-level assembly work and then brings it back so it can be put into a device manufactured in the United States, the chip would get hit by the tariff.  But Intel also has assembly and test centers in Costa Rica, Malaysia and Vietnam. Chips from non-Chinese wafer fabs sold to American companies that pass through those facilities likely would not be hit.  \u201cMy sense is they can probably skip most of the tariffs,\u201d said Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research Inc.  Intel does have a factory in Dalian, China where it makes memory chips, which would be directly impacted by the tariff if purchased by U.S. customers directly. While memory chips made up only $3.5 billion of Intel\u2019s $62.7 billion in revenue last year, they are viewed as a key driver of the company\u2019s plan to diversify away from its heavy dependence on CPU chips.  \u201cTrade wars in general are going to be bad for the global economy, and semiconductors tend to be global,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.  The assembly and test work that many chipmakers carry out in China makes up only about 10 percent of the value of a chip, with the design and manufacturing making up the bulk of a chip\u2019s value. Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of policy for the Semiconductor Industry Association, said chipmakers could be forced to pay tariffs on their own products simply for doing a small portion of the work in China.  \u201cWe should be talking about a policy frame work that supports, not slows down, an industry that, unlike many others, still manufactures here in the U.S.,\u201d Goodrich said.","135":"(Reuters) - Intel Corp executives said on Friday its 5G modem chips will not appear in mobile phones until 2020, raising the possibility its biggest customer, Apple Inc, will be more than a year behind rivals in delivering a device that uses the faster networks.

Reuters reported on Feb. 7 that Apple earlier this year moved its modem engineering efforts into the same division that makes its proprietary processor chips.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  While Apple remains Intel\u2019s only major modem chip customer now, Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan said the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker plans to pursue other lines of business, such as selling modems to carmakers.  He also said that modems could appear in a range of other devices, such as network gear, alongside Intel\u2019s computing chips as 5G networks proliferate. But Intel executives declined to comment on whether Intel would combine its modem and processors into a single chip the way that rivals such as San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc have done.

(Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Anil D\u2019Silva)","138":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc took a major step toward supplying its own smartphone chips by purchasing the majority of Intel Corp\u2019s modem business in a deal valued at $1 billion, the companies said on Thursday.  Under the deal, about 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Combined with its existing portfolio, Apple will have 17,000 wireless technology patents, ranging from cellular communication standards to modems, making it a more powerful player in global licensing talks that will likely take place between major 5G patent holders such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.  Intel shares rose 5.7% to $55.05 after the news and the company\u2019s report that its earnings beat analysts\u2019 expectations. Apple shares edged up 0.1% to $207.29.  After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.  Modem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm Inc over Qualcomm patent licensing practices.  Cupertino, California-based Apple reached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.  Apple\u2019s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.  The deal with Intel will bolster Apple\u2019s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple\u2019s biggest global rivals - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei - already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.  Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple\u2019s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker has never formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signaling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Apple is seen at a store in Zurich, Switzerland January 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate, what analysts have called the \u201cCook Doctrine.\u201d  \u201cWe believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,\u201d Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.  SPEEDING UP DEVELOPMENT  The purchase of Intel\u2019s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.  A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm\u2019s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have an internally developed 5G modem technology ready for use in some of its products by 2021. Intel previously disclosed plans to have a 5G modem ready by 2020, so tapping the Intel assets could help Apple hit its target.  But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where Apple sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm\u2019s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on Qualcomm for some modems during a transition period to its own devices.  \u201cThere\u2019s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have Independence, but they also realize it has to be done responsibly,\u201d this person said.  Apple\u2019s license deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm\u2019s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.  Apple has engaged with Taiwan\u2019s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.  \u201cClearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,\u201d this person said.  Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  PATENTS AS LEVERAGE  The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.  Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm\u2019s licensing division in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.  \u201cI don\u2019t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-license deals.\u201d","139":"FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Intel Corp INTC.O said on Thursday that it plans to acquire eASIC, a small chipmaker that will help further Intel's efforts to diversify away from CPU chips.  Intel did not disclose terms of the deal for eASIC, which is based in Intel\u2019s hometown of Santa Clara, California. An Intel spokeswoman said the price was \u201cnot material,\u201d but that about 120 people would join Intel\u2019s so-called programmable solutions group as a result.  The programmable chip group grew out of Intel\u2019s $16.7 billion acquisition of chipmaker Altera Corp in 2015, one of Intel\u2019s moves to expand its revenue base as the market for personal computers, and Intel\u2019s best-known CPU chips, declined.  Altera specialized in field programmable chips, which aim to solve one of oldest problems in computing - the balance between carrying out computing operations in software running on top of a general-purpose chip like Intel\u2019s CPUs, versus baking those operations directly into the silicon of a custom chip.  Custom chips are more efficient, but they are costly to develop and do not work well for anything other than their original purpose. Altera\u2019s chips aim to find a middle ground. They let customers re-wire different parts of the chip together after their purchase by re-programming them, getting some of the benefits of a custom chip without committing to a baked-in design.  With the eASIC deal, Intel will have yet another option. If a customer has a favorite way to set up Intel\u2019s programmable chips, that program can be frozen into the chip at the factory, getting a little closer to the benefits of a fully custom chip but without much extra cost.  \u201cInstead of getting programmed in the field, it gets programmed in the factory,\u201d Dan McNamara, who heads Intel\u2019s programmable solutions group, told Reuters in an interview. \u201cIt still costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, but you get it done in four months as opposed to two years.\u201d  While Intel designs all of current programmable chip lineup, it uses its own foundries to physically manufacture the most advanced models but Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW for lower-end ones, McNamara said. The chips from eASIC are currently manufactured by TSMC and GlobalFoundries, he said, but no decisions have been made about whether Intel will start manufacturing eASIC's chips.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to dig in and figure out where do we go for the road map for the next generation,\u201d McNamara said.","140":"FILE PHOTO: Computer chip maker Intel's logo is shown on a gaming computer display during the opening day of E3, the annual video games expo revealing the latest in gaming software and hardware in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Quantum computers aim to carry out tasks in just a few minutes that would take today\u2019s best conventional computers thousands of years. But in nearly every photograph of the devices, there\u2019s a tangle of wires in the background connected to equipment that controls the quantum computer.  Intel Corp INTC.O on Monday announced a chip that it hopes will change that. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker announced a chip called \"Horse Ridge\" that is designed to take all the work being done by the wires and shrink it down to a chip and electronics about the size of a tea cup saucer.  Quantum computers remain years away from everyday use but have drawn the interest of major technology companies. In October, researchers at Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google said they had created a machine that can outpace conventional computers. Other major technology firms such as International Business Machines IBM.N and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O are also pursuing the technology.  Intel has two quantum efforts, each examining a different way of building the core of a quantum computer. That central part of a quantum machine uses what are known as \u201cqubits.\u201d  In many quantum computers, the qubits must be kept very cold, near the temperatures where atoms stop moving, inside a special refrigerator. That makes it very difficult to connect wires to the qubits to send and receive information. Most of those wires and additional electronics have to sit outside the special refrigerator.  Intel said its chip - which is named for one of the coldest spots in the U.S. state of Oregon, where many of its factories are located - is designed to be able to sit inside the quantum refrigerator. The company hopes the chip will make its quantum computers more practical to produce in the future.  \u201cIntel recognized that quantum controls were an essential piece of the puzzle we needed to solve in order to develop a large-scale commercial quantum system,\u201d Jim Clarke, Intel\u2019s director of quantum hardware, said in a statement.","141":"Natus Vincere advanced to the playoffs at Intel Extreme Masters XV -- Beijing Online: Europe, becoming the first of two teams to make it through from the lower bracket of Group A play.

REUTERS\/Caroline Humer\/File Photo  Intel once dominated the most important chip market with more than 90 percent share for the brains of personal computers. As PC sales have stagnated, it has expanded into data center processors, memory and networking chips.  That positions Intel as a smaller player in a bigger market. The company said on Wednesday it expects to have just 28 percent market share by 2023, or about $85 billion in sales in a $300 billion addressable market for the chips it makes, according to the company\u2019s forecast.  Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said on Wednesday the company sees both revenue and earnings per share growing in the \u201csingle digit\u201d percentage range over the next three years, with flat PC chip sales offset by \u201cdouble digit\u201d percentage revenue growth in data center chips.  Swan also said operating margins would remain relatively steady at 32 percent, but that gross margins would decline as the company ramps up its 10-nanometer chip-making technology, which makes chips faster by making their features smaller.  Intel shares dropped in late trading on Wednesday as executives gave the presentation and closed 2.5 percent lower at $49.24.

Chan said Intel\u2019s peers were likely to report 5 percent revenue growth in coming years, but with profits growing faster than revenue rather than along with it as Intel has forecast.  Swan gave the long-term outlook less than two weeks after Intel cut its 2019 sales forecast, citing weak data center sales in China.  \u201cWe let you down. We let ourselves down,\u201d Swan said of the quarterly results last month.  Swan told investors the primary driver of gross margin pressure was the transition to new chip-making technology. Intel struggled with delays for its 10-nanometer technology, losing its lead in making the smallest chips to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC). Intel plans to launch 10nm chips for high-end PCs later this year, and for servers early next year.  Swan said Intel plans to deliver even smaller 7nm chips by 2021.","155":"(Reuters) - Mapping startup Mapbox Inc said on Wednesday it is teaming up with Microsoft Corp, Intel Corp and Softbank Group Corp\u2019s ARM Holdings chip unit to deepen its push into providing maps for self-driving cars.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Mapbox does not make a mapping app itself. It instead competes against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google Maps and HERE Technologies, the map firm owned by a group of companies, to provide the underlying maps inside of other apps. Mapbox maps are found in Snap Inc\u2019s messaging app and the Instacart grocery delivery app.  But the Washington, D.C.-founded startup, which has raised about $228 million from Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, DFJ Growth and others, has been pushing into providing tools for software developers who are making the software for self-driving cars.  \u201cOur main focus has been in making maps for humans,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Eric Gundersen told Reuters in an interview. But maps for self-driving cars are read by the cars\u2019 computers and need more detailed data, he said.  At an event it held for software developers in San Francisco on Wednesday, Mapbox announced a handful of partnerships designed to make its technology more useful for self-driving cars.  One of Mapbox\u2019s products is software that lets either a mobile phone or a car\u2019s computer see the road as the car drives, picking out things like lanes or speed-limit signs. The company said it will weave that software together with an offering from Microsoft.  The combination will let drivers in the car see real-time events like speed limit changes but then split off some of the camera data and send it to Microsoft\u2019s cloud computer service, Azure. Once there, the data can be processed later by powerful servers to help improve the algorithms that help self-driving cars navigate.  Separately, Mapbox is also working with chipmaker ARM to optimize its self-driving vision software so features detected by ARM\u2019s chips can be recognized as lanes, pedestrians and road signs even faster. In one form or another, ARM\u2019s chips power the majority of mobile phones, tablets and other mobile computers that are making their way into cars.  Mapbox is also pairing with Intel\u2019s Mobileye self-driving unit, which the chipmaker purchased last year for $15.3 billion.  Mobileye is building its own detailed database of road features that is stored in the cloud. Mapbox has built software that will live in cars to beam down Mobileye\u2019s data without hogging up mobile data bandwidth. Cars that use the system will get a constant map ahead of about 200 meters (660 ft), providing a key backup to the car\u2019s onboard sensors, the companies said.

FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker rose 5.4 percent to $55.95 in after-market trading after it said it expects full-year revenue of $67.5 billion, up $2.5 billion from prior guidance.  Intel has been focused on transforming itself from a supplier of processors for personal computers to a maker of chips for growing data center business and newer areas such as driverless cars and artificial intelligence. That shift appeared to be taking hold as revenues for Intel\u2019s data center business accounted for almost half of the company\u2019s revenue in the first quarter, the highest proportion ever.  \u201cThey certainly outperformed the most bullish expectations,\u201d said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group.  Intel said fresh demand for applications such as artificial intelligence fueled the data center business. But Intel Chief Financial Officer Robert Swan warned that the brisk growth of that business in the past two quarters, particularly from business customers building out their own computing clouds, would be hard to match in the second half the year.  \u201cWe do expect there to be deceleration for [data center business] growth from first half to second half for sure,\u201d Swan said on a conference call with investors. \u201cWe hope we\u2019re wrong.\u201d  Still, the better-than-expected results and brighter forecast pushed shares to their highest in at least five years. The data center results also suggest the chipmaker\u2019s large customers have not been deterred by two chip flaws that emerged earlier this year.  Intel said it plans to allot $14.5 billion to capital spending this year, much of which will go toward building up its relatively new memory chip business.  But the company also said $1.7 billion of its free cash flow for the quarter came from long-term supply agreements for its memory business, which could help protect the company against a drop in memory prices that has spooked chip investors this year. That business grew 20 percent year over year to $1 billion.  Intel executives also said that the unit that contains its modem chips that help Apple Inc AAPL.O's iPhones connect to mobile data business will grow faster than the rest of Intel's sales. Intel's Swan said investments in that division to ramp it up could compress Intel's margins in the short term.  Last fall, Reuters reported that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that could drop Qualcomm Inc's QCOM.O modem chips in favor of Intel chips, though it is not clear Apple has yet made a final decision.  Revenue from Intel\u2019s client computing business, which supplies chips to PC makers and is the biggest contributor to sales, rose 3 percent to $8.2 billion, beating estimates of $7.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen\/File Photo  An official at the Israel Export Institute told Reuters that new data showed semiconductor exports to China jumped 80 percent last year to $2.6 billion. An industry source told Reuters that Intel Israel accounted for at least 80 percent of those sales.  The data will be welcome news for the Israeli government as it pushes for deeper ties with China and because semiconductors accounted for $3.9 billion of overall goods exports in 2018, according to the institute, a government agency.  The two countries have started negotiating a trade deal and technology is expected to be a major part of the discussions. Overall exports of Israeli goods to China, excluding diamonds, rose 50 percent to $4.7 billion, statistics.  Intel announced a $5 billion investment to expand capacity in its Kiryat Gat plant in southern Israel in 2017, which makes some of the smallest and fastest chips in the world.  That year it also bought Israeli auto-focused chip and technology firm Mobileye for $15 billion. It said this year it would invest $11 billion in a new Israeli plant.  A spokesman for Intel said the firm exported $3.9 billion worth of goods from Israel last year, up from $3.6 billion in 2017. He declined to give further details of Intel\u2019s operations in Israel.  Chinese officials have said they are looking to develop a domestic chip market because Chinese companies import $270 billion of semiconductors each year. Israel has a reputation for exporting high-end chips.  Israel\u2019s export institute also said sales to China of inspection equipment for semiconductor manufacturing jumped 64 percent to $450 million last year.  That equipment is used to control and inspect manufacturing processes in semiconductor plants and is useful for China as its domestic chip manufacturing increases.  Companies in Israel making such equipment include Orbotech, which was just acquired by fellow semiconductor equipment maker KLA-Tencor of California for about $3.4 billion.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  That deal was announced a year ago but was held up by Chinese regulators, who only gave their approval in February.  PIVOT TO ASIA  China is now Israel\u2019s second largest export market for goods after the United States, having overtaken Britain last year.  Sales of semiconductors to the United States slipped 20 percent to $860 million, contributing to a 3 percent drop in goods exports. But at $10.9 billion, overall goods exports still dwarf those to China.  Israel has been pivoting its economy toward Asia in the past few years both because of perceived political hostility in some European countries and the fact that Asian markets are growing rapidly.  In recent years, Chinese-based airlines have started direct flights to Tel Aviv, the two countries signed a visa agreement and are working on the trade deal. Israel is also in talks for free trade agreements with Vietnam and South Korea.  Some analysts in China expect the ties to get stronger due to the tit-for-tat trade war between the United States, a major chip producer, and China.  \u201cBecause of the trade war, China and Israel\u2019s cooperation is closer than it has been before,\u201d said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at ICWise, a semiconductor consultancy in Shanghai.  \u201cIsrael has the technology and China has the market \u2013 the space for cooperation is big.\u201d  Eyal Waldman, founder and CEO of Israeli chipmaker Mellanox, said his company was benefiting from China\u2019s policies.  \u201cIn China they prefer to use Chinese silicon and then after that non-U.S. silicon and only if they don\u2019t have that then U.S. silicon, so we are benefiting from that,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cWe are seeing better growth in China.\u201d  Mellanox agreed this week to sell itself to California-based chipmaker Nvidia Corp for almost $7 billion. Intel lost the bidding war to Nvidia.

Ampere said the new chips, which cost $550 to $850, have been selected by Lenovo Group Ltd and several other companies that make servers, which power Internet-based services.  The server chip market is dominated by Intel, which controls more than 90 percent of the market. But longtime Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc is expected to take market share in the coming year because Intel has delayed its newest generation of chip-making technology, saying that server chips made with it are not likely to hit the market until 2020.  But Ampere is taking a different path from both Intel and AMD. Those two use an underlying technology called x86, which powers most PCs.  Ampere is using an underlying technology licensed from Softbank Group Corp\u2019s Arm Holdings - the same technology that powers both Android and Apple Inc\u2019s mobile phones. The Arm-based chips require less electricity to run and are cheaper to make.  But the Arm technology has not yet matched Intel\u2019s computing muscle, which Ampere, along with rivals such as Qualcomm Inc and Cavium Inc, are aiming to change in hopes of luring data center customers away from Intel. Major technology firms like Alphabet\u2019s Google Inc and Facebook Inc are some of the world\u2019s biggest buyers of Intel server chips.  James spent 28 years at Intel working closely with some of those very customers. Ampere says its chips - which come in 16- and 32-core versions with speeds of up to 3.3 gigahertz - are designed to compete with mid-level traditional server chips. But James said the company put extra care into ensuring the chips run customers\u2019 software well as opposed to acing speed tests.  \u201cMaking things run fast in the abstract is great on PowerPoint presentations, but it doesn\u2019t help things run fast in your customer\u2019s data center,\u201d she told Reuters in an interview.  Unlike Intel, Ampere does not make its own chips. It contracts that work out to Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd , similar to Apple and Qualcomm. But that means Ampere\u2019s next generation of chips, due in 2019, will take advantage of TSMC\u2019s 7-nanometer manufacturing technology, which is more advanced than Intel\u2019s current generation of technology and is being used on Apple\u2019s newest iPhones and Qualcomm\u2019s latest phone processors.  \u201cWe benefit from the fact that we\u2019re on the same process as people who are making billions of units,\u201d James told Reuters.","160":"FILE PHOTO: An Intel computer cup logo is shown during opening day of E3, the annual video games expo revealing the latest in gaming software and hardware in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2019.

Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor firms that both designs and manufactures its own chips, but the business model has come into question in recent years as the company lost its manufacturing lead to the Taiwanese and Korean companies.  One option urged by some investors would be to outsource manufacturing. The company said, however, on Thursday that while it plans to increase its use of outside factories, the majority of its 2023 products would be made internally.  But licensing technology could help Intel avoid major investments in rivals\u2019 factories that outsourcing deals would likely entail.  \u201cBroadly speaking, that may mean sharing technologies that we have that they could use or leveraging technologies that others have developed that we can use as well,\u201d outgoing Chief Executive Bob Swan told an earnings call.

The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.  The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.  The company\u2019s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel\u2019s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.  It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.  Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich\u2019s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).  Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d.  Google says it informed the affected companies about the Spectre flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the Meltdown flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.  The two securities-related class action suits were filed by individuals who claim to represent classes of buyers of Intel\u2019s stock between July 27 last year and Jan. 4.","166":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O on Tuesday announced three new computers with its own microprocessor chip, called the M1, as it starts to move away from its longtime partner Intel Corp INTC.O.  Apple, which has used Intel chips in its computers since 2006, had said in June it would make Macs with its own new \u201cApple Silicon\u201d chips.  The M1 chip is expected to improve battery life, be faster and more efficient, and will run on the latest version of Mac operating system, Big Sur.

It will be used in three of its devices.  NEW MINI  The entry-level desktop computer, Mac mini, will come with the latest M1 chip that has an 8-core CPU in its familiar 7.7-inch silver aluminum square design. Its price starts at $699.  MACBOOK AIR  Apple also launched a 13-inch MacBook Air with the new chip, starting at $999 and with a battery life of up to 18 hours, the longest ever for the sleek wedge-shaped notebook that has not radically changed its form-factor since founder Steve Jobs removed it from a manila envelope in the 2008 launch event.  PRO WITH THE LONGEST CHARGE  Its new 13-inch MacBook Pro will have a starting price of $1,299 and will have a battery life of 20 hours in a single charge, promising to deliver up to twice the battery life of the previous generation using the latest chip.  The three new computers will be available for pre-order from Tuesday and will begin arriving to customers starting next week.  NEW SOFTWARE  The new Macs will come with Big Sur, the latest version of its desktop operating system. It will let iPhone and iPad apps to run directly on the Mac. The update will be available to eligible device owners beginning Thursday.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Idaho-based memory chipmaker Micron Technology on Thursday challenged rival Intel Corp with a new line of solid-state drives aimed at data centers, just as the two companies are on the cusp of formally ending a joint venture of more than a decade that developed the technology.  Micron and Intel worked together starting in 2006 to bring to market what is called 3D cross-point memory technology. The technology uses three-dimensional features on storage chips to make them faster.  Micron said a year ago that it would buy out Intel\u2019s share of the joint venture, called IM Flash Technologies, for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $1 billion of Intel\u2019s share of the venture\u2019s debt. The deal will close this month, leaving Micron in full control of a factory built in Utah to make the chips.  Solid-state drives made with the new chips are faster than previous drives. That has captured the interest of data center owners carrying out computing jobs like deep learning, where artificial intelligence software ingests huge amounts of data to learn new tasks.  Intel released a second generation of its version of the technology earlier this year. Micron is now jumping into the market, testing it with what a handful of customers.  \u201cThis is just the very, very beginning,\u201d Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra told Reuters at a launch event in San Francisco. \u201cThese kinds of technologies do take multiple years before are they broadly deployed.\u201d  Micron launched its Intel competitor Thursday, a device it calls X100. The device itself is a solid-state drive that can be plugged directly into a server, and Micron claims it is faster than its rival due in part to a piece of technology called a controller that take instructions from the server\u2019s computing brain about which data to read or write on the solid-state drive.  Micron developed the controllers internally and is hoping they will set its products apart in the memory market, where supply and demand dynamics can produce dramatic shifts in prices.  Mehrotra\u2019s strategy since taking over as chief executive in 2017 has been to increase the number of storage products that include technologies beyond just commodity memory chips. About half of the company\u2019s storage revenue now comes from such products, versus 20% when he arrived, he said.  \u201cThis is hugely attractive,\u201d Mehrotra said of differentiating features. \u201cWe are making strong progress there.\u201d","169":"** Chipmaker\u2019s shares down as much as 8 pct at $45.75 - on track for their worst day in ~6 months  ** Co forecast Q1 revenue and profit below Street\u2019s view and missed Q4 2018 sales estimates on Thursday, leading at least 6 analysts to cut their PTs and 2 to downgrade the stock  ** INTC misses revenue est for the first time in the past 7 quarters but beat profit for the 8th straight qtr  ** Barclays analysts say INTC faces a costly battle ahead to retain share, as competitive threat from AMD heats-up, along with a near-term slowing of end markets  ** 17 of 40 brokerages rate the stock \u201cbuy\u201d or higher, 16 \u201chold\u201d and 7 \u201csell\u201d or lower  ** Street\u2019s median of $55 is ~18 pct above its current levels  ** INTC touched a record high of $74.93 in 2000 and has since traded ~23 pct below that level  ** Including session\u2019s losses, stock down ~1 pct in 2019, giving up ~6 pct gains it boasted of before earnings. up ~10 pct YTD (Reporting by Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru)","170":"Jan 13 (Reuters) - Intel Corp will replace Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan with VMware Inc CEO Pat Gelsinger next month, CNBC reported on Wednesday, citing sources.

The consensus forecast for the S&P 500 dipped again to a 0.3% year-over-year decline after turning flat earlier in the week. Still it was an improvement on the 2.3% drop estimated at the start of the quarter.  Improving confidence in earnings had helped push the S&P 500 closer to its all-time high, reached in September. Stocks have rallied this year on hopes of a U.S.-China trade resolution and a turnaround in the Federal Reserve\u2019s stance to abandon further interest rate hikes this year.

Offering support was Amazon.com Inc, which rose 2.4% after the e-commerce giant\u2019s quarterly profit doubled and beat Wall Street estimates though its second quarter guidance was lower than expectations.  Also Ford Motor Co surged 10.5% and was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market.

Cars drive past U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp's \"smart building\" in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, Israel December 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Amir Cohen  Intel, one of the biggest employers and exporters in Israel, plans to invest $11 billion to build a manufacturing facility in the country, where some of its most advanced technologies have been hatched.  Home to more startups per capita than any other nation thanks to its advanced military and government support, Israel is suffering from a shortage of talent.  While multinationals like Intel, Apple and Google have snapped up local startups and set up research centers, competition is making it tough to find skilled workers.  Tech companies in Israel were unable to fill about 17,000 positions in 2018, according to Start-Up National Central, a nonprofit research organization, and that figure continues to climb.  To address this gap and lure talent, Intel has upped the ante at its new development center in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva. Replete with environmentally friendly systems, a smart gym, massage parlor, the structure also has 14,000 sensors that monitor motion, light and air to make sure workers are comfortable.  If these efforts give Intel an edge in hiring, rival companies are expected to follow suit.  \u201cAnything you offer as a perk, whether it\u2019s a gym membership or a paperless work environment or additional days for maternity leave or a go-green policy, all of these things are going to help you,\u201d said David Gantshar, chief executive of California-based Shepherd Search Group.  Intel\u2019s box-shaped, 10-story building is covered in glass and will accommodate up to 2,700 of its local 13,000 workforce.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  The company declined to comment on how much it spent on the development center. Israeli media reported a cost of 650 million shekels ($188 million).  David Hareli, deputy CEO of Afcon Holdings AFHL.TA, which constructed the building, said it was a challenge to finish the project within Intel's three-year timetable.  Originally designed to be seven stories high, Intel asked to add three floors. Once the contract was signed, Intel asked for LEED Platinum certification, the highest standard of green construction, rather than the lesser gold level.  This required a double-skin facade to improve ventilation and prevent the building from heating up under the strong Middle Eastern sun.  Architect Dagan Mochli, who designed the building, said he was working on a new development center for Intel in the northern city of Haifa that will also be smart and LEED Platinum.  He called Intel\u2019s building a \u201cbreakthrough,\u201d with demand growing among clients for similar structures. He is planning a smart 15,000-square-meter banking campus in Israel as well as a 240,000-square-meter smart biotech park in China.  SMART TRAVEL  The building has an open-space format. An atrium in the center is roofed by skylights, and caps the five top floors. Health-conscious employees often use the internal stairs in the atrium instead of the elevator.  For those seeking seclusion, there are small soundproof rooms and noise-insulated armchairs near the windows.  The 14,000 sensors - twice the number found in similar buildings, according to company officials - detect when someone enters a room and adjust the lighting and air conditioning.  For example, when carbon dioxide levels rise, fresh air is introduced to keep people energetic.  The sensors and corresponding app can also help employees find the best way to travel to and from work and let them know which of the building\u2019s three restaurants has room during lunch. The app lets workers alert other staff as to their whereabouts.  Not everybody was excited about the new workspace. Some employees anonymously complained on an Israeli news website about a lack of privacy.  Intel Israel CEO Yaniv Garty said the tracking and collection of data is on an opt-in basis.  \u201cWe don\u2019t ask people to clock in or clock out. We believe in a relationship which is based on output,\u201d Garty said.  Ido Melamed, a hardware engineer who has worked at Intel for 16 years, moved to the new building from an office with cubicles. He said the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.  \u201cWe see each other, we can talk more openly and collaborate more effectively,\u201d Melamed said. \u201cThere is real trust between the company and employees that the data (collected) is used for the right purposes.\u201d  (This story is refiled to read \u201cplans to\u201d, adds story link, paragraph 2)","195":"Oct 2 (Reuters) - A jump in Intel powered the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-time intraday high on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were little changed as U.S. stocks, much like global peers, remained pressured due to Italy\u2019s troubles.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it is working with Facebook Inc to finish a new artificial intelligence chip in the second half of this year.  The chips are Intel\u2019s gambit to retain hold of a fast-growing segment of the artificial intelligence computing market but will face competition from similar chips from Nvidia Corp and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Amazon Web Services unit.  The new chip will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by tagging friends in photos automatically.  Intel\u2019s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel.  In November, Amazon also said it had created an inference chip. Amazon\u2019s chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia\u2019s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer.  Also at the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday, Intel said that Dell Technologies Inc will feature Intel\u2019s next generation of processors in its XPS line of laptops. The so-called 10-nanometer chips have been plagued by delays.  But Navin Shenoy, Intel\u2019s data center chief, reiterated that the new chips will be available in laptops by the 2019 holiday shopping season and in data centers by early next year.  Also at the conference, Amnon Shashua, the head of Intel\u2019s Mobileye self-driving car computer unit, said Mobileye has mapped out all of the roadways in Japan, using cameras that were already embedded in vehicles produced by Nissan Motor Co Ltd that come with Mobileye systems from the factory.

FILE PHOTO: Intel Corporation CEO Bob Swan gives an interview to Reuters outside the Fab 42 microprocessor manufacturing site in Chandler, Arizona, U.S., October 2, 2020. REUTERS\/Nathan Frandino\/File Photo  Intel, the dominant provider of processor chips for PCs and data centers, has struggled with manufacturing delays. In July, it said its next generation of chipmaking technology was six months behind schedule.  Chip sales are booming, but customers want lower-priced chips rather than Intel\u2019s pricier high-performance offerings, dragging down overall gross margins.  The pandemic has given Intel a boost in the form or surging laptop sales as employees and students work and learn from home. Sales in its PC group were $9.8 billion, beating analyst estimates $9.09 billion, according to FactSet.  But Intel sold a higher volume of less-profitable chips in its PC business, driving operating margins down to 36% in the third quarter from 44% a year earlier.  \u201cYou\u2019re seeing the demand shift from desktops and higher-end enterprise PCs to the entry-level consumer and education PCs,\u201d Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters in an interview. \u201cEven though the volume is good, your (average selling prices) are coming down, so that impacts your gross margins a little bit.\u201d  Davis said a similar dynamic hit the data center business, where spending by government and business customers plummeted 47% after two quarters of growth and operating margins dropped from 49% to 32%. Revenue from Intel\u2019s data-center business fell 7% to $5.9 billion in the reported quarter versus analyst of $6.21 billion, according to FactSet.  While cloud computing customers and operators of 5G networks helped make up for some of the shortfall, those chips are lower priced, Davis said.  \u201cThe main issue for Intel moving into 2021 remains gross margin pressure and further deterioration of its leadership position due to its process node roadmap delays,\u201d KinNgai Chan, analyst with Summit Insights Group.  Intel faces a challenge from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O. Those competitors use outside manufacturers and have capitalized on Intel's woes to gain market share in both data centers and PCs, with AMD in particular hitting its highest market share since 2013 earlier this year.  Intel, however, said a 10-nanometer chip factory in Arizona had reached full production capacity and that it now expects to ship 30% higher 10nm product volumes in 2020 compared to January expectations.  Excluding items, it earned $1.11 per share, in line with estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company said it was expecting fourth-quarter revenue of about $17.4 billion, while analysts were expecting revenue of $17.36 billion.  Earlier this week, Intel said it would sell a money-losing commodity memory chip business to Korea's SK Hynix 000660.KS in a $9 billion all cash deal, with Intel hanging on to a more advanced memory chip unit and using the cash to invest in other products.  The company also said it started a $10 billion share repurchase program in August.  \u201cIts stock is trading at 10 times earnings and looks cheap,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst Moor Insights & Strategy.

Intel\u2019s major customer for modem chips, which help phones connect to wireless data networks, is Apple Inc.  It is unclear whether Intel\u2019s timing on modem chips means that Apple will not have an iPhone with 5G capabilities in 2019. Apple executives have held talk with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and MediaTek Inc over 5G modem chips for iPhones to be released this year, but the outcome of those talks is unknown. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)","204":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O held talks with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS and MediaTek Inc 2454.TW along with existing vendor Intel Corp INTC.O to supply 5G modem chips for 2019 iPhones, according to an Apple executive's testimony at a trial between Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: A chef walks past an Apple store in Beijing, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Thomas Peter  Between 2011 and 2016, Apple relied on San Diego-based Qualcomm as the sole supplier of such chips, which help iPhones connect to wireless networks. Starting in 2016, Apple split the business between Intel and Qualcomm, but in 2018, Apple moved solely to Intel for its newest phones.  But Apple supply chain executive Tony Blevins testified on Friday that Apple has also considered MediaTek and Samsung, one of its largest rivals in the smart phone market, to supply the chips for the next generation of wireless networks known as 5G. Those networks are expected to start rolling out this year and provide faster data speeds than current 4G networks.  The FTC is suing Qualcomm alleging the chip supplier engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices to preserve a dominant position in the premium modem chip market.  On the stand at a federal courthouse in San Jose, California, Blevins testified that Apple has long sought multiple suppliers for modem chips but signed an agreement with Qualcomm to exclusively supply the chips because the chip supplier offered deep rebates on patent license costs in exchange for exclusivity.  In 2013, Apple broke off work with Intel to start supplying modems for the iPad Mini 2 because Apple would lose its rebates by using Intel\u2019s chips, rendering Intel\u2019s products \u201ceconomically unattractive\u201d overall.  Later that year after cost negotiations with Qualcomm did not go as Apple hoped, Apple kicked off \u201cProject Antique\u201d to secure a second modem supplier, Blevins testified.  By 2016 and 2017, Apple introduced Intel\u2019s modems in some of its iPhones but also still used Qualcomm chips. But Apple\u2019s lawsuit against Qualcomm filed in early 2017 caused their business relationship to change \u201cin a very profound and negative manner,\u201d leading to using only Intel\u2019s modems for the phones released last year.  \u201cThe entire concept of Project Antique was to find a second supplier. No offense to (Intel) but we don\u2019t want to be single supplier with them. We wanted both Qualcomm and (Intel) in the mix,\u201d Blevins said. Blevins also testified Apple considered making Intel the sole supplier of modems for the Apple Watch, which added 4G connectivity in 2017 using Qualcomm chips.  Blevins said that talking with Samsung, whose Galaxy and Note devices compete against the iPhone, is \u201cnot an ideal environment\u201d for Apple, but that Samsung is currently the largest component supplier to Apple.  Blevins did not say whether Apple had reached a decision on a 5G modem supplier or whether it would release a 5G iPhone in 2019. Citing sources, Bloomberg previously reported that Apple would not release such a phone until 2020.","205":"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp on Thursday cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed analysts\u2019 estimates for first-quarter sales for the data center business that has driven growth as PC sales declined in recent years, sending its shares down as much as 7.5%.  FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Intel said China\u2019s economy was consuming fewer microchips than it had expected, adding to concerns that an industry-wide slowdown could persist until the end of 2019. Intel\u2019s outlook follows a similar warning earlier this week from chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc, whose broad lineup of products makes it a proxy for the industry chip industry.  Intel marginally beat Wall Street targets for revenue and profit in the fiscal first quarter, but sales in the data center group unit fell 6.3% to $4.9 billion, hit by weakness in China as customers worked through stockpile of chips purchased last year. Analysts had expected revenue of $5.1 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm Fact Set.  \u201cThe data center rebound the company was banking on for back-half (of 2019) improvements doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Patrick Moor head of Moor Insights & Strategy.  Intel\u2019s chief executive, Bob Swan, said in an interview that customers in China had \u201cabsolutely\u201d bought extra data center chips last year due to fears of a tariff or supply constraints owing to the U.S.-China trade dispute.  \u201cThe belief at the time was that they were ordering well ahead of what their real needs were, but the expectation was that they would consume that over the course of Q4 and Q1,\u201d Swan said. \u201cBut today we think ... it\u2019s not being consumed quite at that level; there\u2019s going to be another quarter.\u201d  While Intel highlighted problems in China, \u201cthere was weakness, in terms of orders, across almost every single end-market for them,\u201d said Christopher Roll and, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. \u201cIt\u2019s really across the board.\u201d  The chipmaker cut its 2019 revenue forecast to $69 billion, from the $71.5 billion it told investors to expect when it last reported earnings in January.  A year-long U.S.-China trade war and weakening smartphone sales have taken a toll on the global semiconductor industry. Investors are banking on the launch of 5G telecom networks and demand for chips used in self-driving vehicles to reignite growth. Swan said a 30% boost in so-called programmable chips that go into 5G networking equipment showed early gains for Intel.  Shares of rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc rose 1.5% in extended trade after Intel\u2019s report, while graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp fell 2.5%. Intel also suffered a decline in its memory chip business, affected by the same pricing declines that have hurt rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Micron Technology Inc .  Intel\u2019s business unit that sells modem chips to connect Apple Inc\u2019s iPhones to wireless data networks was a growth spot, despite Intel\u2019s announcement last week that it would exit the market for 5G modem chips. That news came the same day that Apple resolved a long-standing dispute with Qualcomm Inc and the companies signed a chip supply agreement.  Swan said Intel expects to continue shipping 4G modems, though, as is customary for Intel, he did not mention Apple by name.  \u201cOur expectation is we will continue to deliver on the 4G modem throughout the course of this year, including the second iteration of that product coming in the fall back-to-school season,\u201d Swan said.  The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker estimated profit of 89 cents per share on revenue of $15.6 billion for its second quarter that ends in June, compared with analysts\u2019 expectation of $1.01 per share on $16.85 billion.  For the first quarter, net income fell to $3.97 billion, or 87 cents per share, from $4.45 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 89 cents per share, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of 87 cents.  Revenue in Intel\u2019s client computing business, which caters to PC makers and still the biggest contributor to sales, rose 4.45% to $8.59 billion, beating Fact Set estimates of $8.38 billion.

Shortly afterward, Intel Corp said it will exit the smartphone modem chip business.  The entire drama played out as the mobile phone industry prepares to shift to a technology called 5G.  Echoing complaints from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Apple had alleged that Qualcomm used its patent licensing business to keep a monopoly on modem chips that connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks. Qualcomm insisted that Apple was using its valuable technology without proper payment, and Apple later dropped Qualcomm\u2019s chips in favor of those from Intel.  In the end, Apple and Qualcomm ceased all litigation, with Apple signing a six-year licensing deal with Qualcomm and also agreeing to buy Qualcomm chips. Hours later, Intel said it was getting out of the modem chip business.  WHAT IS 5G?  5G is a new network technology for wireless communications that could be up to 100 times faster than current 4G networks. The networks are coming on line in the United States, China, South Korea and other places this year, but probably will not be widespread until 2020. Modem chips connect devices like phones to these networks.  WHO ARE THE PLAYERS IN 5G?  Prior to Tuesday, five companies had disclosed 5G modem chips or plans to make them: Qualcomm, Intel, MediaTek Inc , Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Samsung and Huawei, however, only make chips for their own mobile phones.  WHY DOES APPLE CARE ABOUT 5G?  Some of Apple\u2019s rivals in the smartphone market - notably Samsung - plan to release 5G devices this year, which could put pressure on Apple to match the feature. Many carriers that are investing heavily to build 5G networks are also likely to put their marketing efforts behind 5G phones.  WILL APPLE HAVE A 5G PHONE THIS YEAR?  It would require an extraordinary effort from both companies. New modems take months of testing to ensure phones will work on carrier networks. Under traditional time lines, Apple would have needed to start testing a 5G iPhone last year, but its supplier Intel did not have a chip ready.  WILL APPLE LOSE MARKET SHARE WITHOUT A 5G PHONE?  Apple was slow to 4G too and did not pay a price. Samsung and others released 4G phones in 2011 as the networks were rolling out. Apple waited until 2012, when 4G networks become widely accessible. Many analysts believe Apple is making the same bet with 5G.  WHY DOES APPLE NEED QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Apple\u2019s only current modem supplier, Intel, said that it would not have a 5G chip ready until 2020, which could have pushed Apple\u2019s launch of a 5G iPhone into 2021 - a long enough delay that it could hurt sales. Qualcomm, on the other hand, is preparing to ship its second generation 5G chip and can meet Apple\u2019s needs with its current products.  WILL APPLE EXCLUSIVELY USE QUALCOMM\u2019S CHIPS?  Not necessarily. While Apple and Qualcomm signed a supply agreement, Apple is working on developing its own modems and disclosed in court earlier this year that it has held talks with MediaTek and Samsung around modems.  WHY DID INTEL SHARE RISE AFTER IT EXITED THE MODEM BUSINESS?  Intel Chief Executive Bob Swan has told investors in the past that modem chips are not likely to fetch the same high margins as its CPU chips. Intel has plenty of other ways to make money from 5G, like selling CPUs to makers of base stations and so-called programmable chips to makers of networking gear.","208":"Complexity Gaming, FaZe Clan and OG all won by sweeps Tuesday on the opening day of the Intel Extreme Masters XV - New York Online: Europe event.

Slideshow ( 5 images )  Armed with a raft of free trade deals envied by regional peers and increasingly luring factories away from China, the ruling Communist Party on Monday formally approved ambitions to raise growth beyond an annual 6% in the pre-pandemic era to 6.5%-7.0% for the 2021-2025 period.  In an economic development blueprint confirmed at its five-yearly congress, it said it would boost its growing role as a key manufacturing hub for global giants like Samsung Electronics Co and Intel Corp. At the same time, the Party is targeting raising the country\u2019s profile beyond a low-cost labour destination to a centre for science and technology.  With more than a dozen free trade agreements now under its belt, Vietnam aims to expand and diversify export markets, the Party said.  The country has reaped the benefit of China and the United States, its largest trading partners, being locked in a bitter trade war that has seen Western manufacturers look to move more and more of their production out of China - with Vietnam a popular choice.  Speaking after the congress, Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong - re-selected to serve a rare third term as party chief on Sunday - said Vietnam would aim to be a fully developed country by 2045, and that an ongoing crackdown on corruption across party ranks would continue.  HI-TECH INVESTMENT  The lofty 2021-2025 targets come as Vietnam recoils from its worst outbreak of COVID-19 in nearly two months, a reminder that future success will depend in the short term at least on keeping the virus at bay.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon said late on Monday he was informed by the chip giant, already one of the biggest employers and exporters in Israel where many of its new technologies are developed, that it would invest about 40 billion shekels ($11 billion) in a new factory.  California-based Intel said it would submit a business plan \u201cfor continued investment in the company\u2019s Kiryat Gat manufacturing site\u201d in central Israel, but did not disclose details, including the schedule, costs and technologies.  \u201cThe moment the company comes to Israel and invests $10 billion, and it receives a grant of 9 percent, that means 91 percent of it stays here,\u201d Kahlon said in an interview on Army Radio. \u201cThere are always such discounts, there are always incentives.\u201d  This is in addition to a 700 million shekel grant the company will get in return for a separate $5 billion expansion of its production operations in Israel.  Last month Intel said it had begun plans for site expansion projects in Ireland, Israel and at its U.S. plant in Oregon starting in 2019 as it looks to diversify its products for a broader set of customers, such as auto safety and wireless connections for mobile phones.  Kahlon\u2019s spokesman told Reuters the government and Intel had agreed on the size of the grant after talks regarding the new factory had intensified over the past year. He noted that grants were crucial for Israel to compete with for investment with countries such as Ireland.  The expansion is expected to add 1,000 new employees to Intel\u2019s workforce of nearly 13,000 in Israel, the spokesman said.  Economy Minister Eli Cohen said it was the biggest investment of its kind ever in the country, adding it would \u201cstrengthen the economy and employment in Israel\u201d.  Intel\u2019s exports from Israel rose by $300 million in 2018 to $4 billion, while it bought $1.7 billion of products from local companies.

The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 19, declined to comment. Nvidia and Mellanox also declined to comment.  U.S. authorities have already cleared the deal without conditions while approval is still pending in China where Mellanox has major customers such as Alibaba and Baidu .

FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The company\u2019s 39 percent rise in profits and better-than-expected fourth-quarter forecast should come as a relief for investors after three days of grim news from other major chipmakers that have shaken stock markets globally.  Amazon Inc and Alphabet Inc also reported disappointing earnings on Thursday, sending technology stocks down in after hours trading.  Intel executives do not see any near-term weakness from the trade tensions or Chinese economy, despite the fact that large data center customers like Baidu Inc and consumer PC factories are located there. But Intel\u2019s share gains in extended trading diminished to less than 1 percent when Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said trade tensions could be a \u201cheadwind\u201d in the longer term next year.  Texas Instruments Inc, STMicroelectronics NV and SK Hynix have all warned of slowing demand for the remainder of the year.  Intel bucked the trend thanks to strong sales of chips for PCs, the second quarter in the row the company benefited from the sector after years of stagnation in that business, and increasing sales of iPhone modem chips.  Swan told Reuters the PC chip strength came from computer purchases by business customers in developed economies as well as gamers building high-end machines. Many businesses are upgrading their PCs because Microsoft Corp has said it will end support for some older versions of Windows in early 2020.  At first, Intel\u2019s results seemed to allay concerns that a trade conflict between the United States and China or a slowdown in the Chinese economy could drag down the global chip business.  \u201cWe\u2019ll be working with our domestic Chinese customers and our global [PC manufacturers] to adjust and adapt the supply chain to deal with constraints,\u201d Swan told Reuters in an interview before holding a conference call with analysts. But later on the call, Swan conceded that the trade tensions could a \u201cheadwind\u201d for Intel in 2019, though the company has not specified how much sales could suffer.  Also boosting Intel sales this quarter was its business for modems, which connect smart phones to wireless data networks which was up 131 percent in the quarter. The gain resulted from Intel completely replacing rival modem supplier Qualcomm Inc in the most recent models of Apple Inc\u2019s.  But Swan said the modem sales are also pressuring Intel\u2019s margins and contributed to the firm lowering its fourth-quarter operating margin outlook to 34.5 percent.  \u201cThat being said, what the modems and memory do for the company is allow us to play in a much larger market,\u201d he said.  Intel forecast current-quarter revenue of $19 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $18.40 billion and a profit of $1.09 per share, according to Refinitiv data.  Intel has been increasingly catering to a booming data center market as revenue from PCs has flattened since 2011.  Revenue from its data center business rose 25.9 percent to $6.14 billion in the quarter, while analysts were expecting revenue of $5.89 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.  Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc, which has been gaining ground with its new EPYC chips for servers, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday but forecast fourth-quarter revenue below estimates due to falling demand for its graphics chips from cryptocurrency miners.  Revenue in Intel\u2019s client computing business, which caters to PC makers and is still the biggest contributor to sales, also rose 15.5 percent to $10.23 billion, beating FactSet estimates of $9.33 billion.  Intel\u2019s PC sales have trended positive in recent quarters, lifted by stronger demand. Many businesses have started the process of buying new PCs because Microsoft Corp has said it will end support for Windows 7 in early 2020.  \u201cThere\u2019s been really strong demand for both the consumer and enterprise for PCs which helped. They also did a great job managing through some supply disruptions,\u201d said Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel.  Intel recorded a $290 million charge as a result of Micron Technology Inc\u2019s decision to buy out Intel\u2019s portion of a memory fabrication plant in Utah where the two had partnered to build advanced memory chips, a move analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy called \u201cnegotiation tactics.\u201d He expects the two to find a way to work together.  Intel\u2019s Swan told Reuters that Intel has retained its rights to the technology and intends to eventually build its own factories to produce the chips.  \u201cDespite their announcement, we will still have access to supply from the fab for the next 18 to 24 months, and that will give us time to explore the alternatives we have to produce the product,\u201d Swan said.  On an conference call with investors, Swan said he expected capital expenditures on memory chips to be \u201ca little bit lower\u201d in 2019 \u201cdespite building self sufficiency\u201d after Micron\u2019s move.  Net income rose to $6.40 billion, or $1.38 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 29 from $4.52 billion, or 94 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned $1.40 per share.  Net revenue rose 18.7 percent to $19.16 billion.

Intel made the claims in a brief filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where Qualcomm is seeking to overturn a sweeping antitrust decision against it after losing a lawsuit by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Intel, whose executives testified at the trial, argued on Friday that the ruling should stand. Appeal proceedings are expected to begin in January.  In a 233-page decision issued in May, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose wrote that Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices \u201cstrangled competition\u201d in parts of the market for modem chips that connect smartphones to mobile data networks. She ordered the San Diego-based company to renegotiate licensing agreements at reasonable prices.  Qualcomm appealed Koh\u2019s ruling and won a pause in enforcement while the appeal unfolds.  Intel was Qualcomm\u2019s chief rival in modem chips, and sold the components to Apple for the iPhone. But Apple signed a chip supply agreement with Qualcomm after they settled a major legal battle in May. Hours later, Santa Clara, California-based Intel said it would sell its modem chip business.  In July, Apple bought the Intel unit in deal valued at $1 billion.  In its court filing and an accompanying blog post published on Friday, Intel said it was forced out of the market because of Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing practices and supported the FTC\u2019s case against Qualcomm.  \u201cWe invested billions, hired thousands, acquired two companies and built innovative world-class products that eventually made their way into Apple\u2019s industry-leading iPhones, including the most recently released iPhone 11,\u201d Steven R. Rodgers, Intel\u2019s general counsel, wrote in the post.  \u201cBut when all was said and done, Intel could not overcome the artificial and insurmountable barriers to fair competition created by Qualcomm\u2019s scheme and was forced to exit the market this year.\u201d  Qualcomm has denied the FTC\u2019s accusations, and other parts of the U.S. government urged the appeals court to pause enforcement of the FTC ruling against it. In July, the Pentagon and the Department of Energy said Qualcomm was a \u201ctrusted\u201d supplier of 5G technology and would be \u201cimpossible to replace\u201d in the short term if put out of business.

Intel jumped 5.1 percent, but analysts could not find a new trigger, with some suggesting that the stock was reviving Friday\u2019s rally after the chipmaker assuaged concerns over its business.  The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index climbed 1.20 percent, its strongest gain in what is set to be a four-day rally, while technology stocks rose 0.48 percent.

At 12:31 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.49 percent, at 26,780.56, easing after hitting a record high of 26,793.35. The S&P 500 was up 0.16 percent, at 2,929.15, while the Nasdaq was little changed at 8,041.40.  But, underscoring the influence of large-cap stocks, declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.29-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.71-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The smallcap Russell 2000 index was off 0.59 percent. Smaller names had been seen as more immune to trade pressures and had dropped on Monday after the NAFTA deal was salvaged.  Also holding on to their losses were financials, which shed 0.3 percent as U.S. lenders followed their Italian peers lower after a senior lawmaker in one of Italy\u2019s ruling parties said most of the country\u2019s problems would be resolved if it readopted a national currency.  Those comments, which added to concerns over Italy\u2019s coalition\u2019s proposal last week of a budget with a higher-than-expected deficit target, pressured world stocks and weighed on Wall Street earlier in the day.  \u201cSome of the flat-modestly lower sentiment could be a spillover from the situation in Italy and with banks being hit rather hard there is some potential spillover,\u201d said Larson.  The defensive utilities sector was the biggest gainer among sectors, rising 1.4 percent.  The laggards included Facebook, falling more than 1 percent for the third session in a row amid continuing calls to use legislation to force technology firms take responsibilities for online security seriously.  PepsiCo fell 0.9 percent as disappointing margins due to higher commodity and transport costs overshadowed a quarterly profit that beat estimates.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The justices will take up Intel\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling that revived the proposed class action lawsuit, initiated by a former employee in 2015, after a judge earlier agreed with the technology company that the litigation was filed too late.  The lawsuit accused the company committees managing the retirement contribution and 401(k) savings plans of breaching their fiduciary duty to the participants by placing an overly heavy emphasis on alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity, in contrast to peer retirement funds.  The lawsuit was brought by former Intel engineer Christopher Sulyma in San Jose, California federal court.  The dispute centers on the time period that retirement plan participants have to file suit for alleged violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a federal law that requires plan managers to invest prudently.  Beneficiaries generally have six years to sue over ill-advised investment decisions. But that deadline is cut to three years if a problem is known sooner.  California-based Intel said the lawsuit should be thrown out because the fund participants had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the issue more than three years before the lawsuit was filed based on emails the company had sent with links to documents about the investments. The company said in court papers the investments were chosen to better diversify the plans\u2019 portfolios.  Sulyma said that while he was employed at Intel between 2010 and 2012 he was unaware of the alternative investments in the documents posted online, or that they carried high fees and performed poorly. He said he did not even know what hedge funds were.  A federal judge threw out the case as untimely, but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year let it proceed, ruling that the three-year deadline would apply only if Sulyma knew not only that the investments had occurred but also that they had been imprudent.  Intel appealed to the Supreme Court. The company said the 9th Circuit\u2019s decision would make it too easy for a plaintiff to sustain a lawsuit simply by asserting \u201cthat he did not read the relevant plan documents, or simply that he cannot recall whether he saw them.\u201d  The justices last week took up a separate retirement fund dispute involving IBM Corp, agreeing to decide whether managers of a fund that invested in the company\u2019s stock can be sued for failing to disclose that its microelectronics business was over-valued.","231":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Futures up: Dow 0.24%, S&P 0.19%, Nasdaq 0.28%  Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures edged higher on Friday, as a strong forecast from chipmaker Intel and encouraging business activity data out of Europe lifted the mood as investors tracked latest developments related to the coronavirus outbreak.

FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  As PC sales have stagnated, Intel has increasingly been depending on its sales to data centers, which provide behind-the-scenes computing power for mobile and web-based apps. Those apps, in turn, rely on artificial intelligence for features like photo and speech recognition.  But researchers widely believe that so-called graphical processors like Nvidia\u2019s are better suited to \u201ctraining\u201d artificial intelligence computer models than the central processor units, or CPUs, that have been Intel\u2019s mainstay for decades.  At an event for Wall Street analysts at Intel\u2019s Santa Clara, California headquarters to explain its strategy, Navin Shenoy, its data center chief, said the company has been able to modify its CPUs to become more than 200 times better at artificial intelligence training over the past several years. This resulted in $1 billion in sales of its Xeon processors for such work in 2017, when the company\u2019s overall revenue was $62.8 billion.  \u201cThe step-function increase in performance led to a meaningful business impact for us,\u201d Shenoy told the audience.  Naveen Rao, head of Intel\u2019s artificial intelligence products group, said the $1 billion estimate was derived from customers that told Intel they were buying chips for artificial intelligence and from calculations of how much of a customer\u2019s data center is dedicated to such work.  \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s probably a lot higher. We left a lot on the table because we wanted to be conservative,\u201d Rao told Reuters in an interview.  The new number is important because Intel's stock dropped last month after it delivered earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations for its data center business. Intel also said then its newest generation chips would be delayed until 2020, leading analysts to worry it will lose data center share to Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O.  \u201cIntel must be very confident in its (artificial intelligence) roadmap and future performance given it committed to a revenue number, as analysts will ask them every quarter about it,\u201d said analyst and former chip executive Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. He said the $1 billion figure was conservative because it only included CPUs and not its other product lines, he said.  Intel stock was up 22 cents at $49.92.","236":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Tuesday it had submitted plans to expand its production operations in Israel, with the government saying the U.S. chipmaker would invest about $5 billion.

The new investment will upgrade its Kiryat Gat manufacturing plant in southern Israel, the company said in a statement.  Intel did not provide financial details.  Israel\u2019s Finance Ministry said the company would invest about 18 billion shekels ($5 billion) in the factory between 2018-2020 and had agreed to spend 3 billion shekels on local suppliers.  \u201cAccording to company officials, this investment is expected to pave the way for a future significant investment for a technological upgrade at the Israeli site,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.

That has translated into a nearly $18 billion reduction in income tax provisions in the first quarter, more than half of which accrued to the benefit of the tech and finance industries.  Graphic: FAANG Blunts its Tax Bill - reut.rs\/2I3okPN  The financial and technology sectors lead others in the size of their profits, and they also reduced their effective tax rates more than others during the most recent quarter.  In the latest big example, Apple Inc AAPL.O on Tuesday reported a $13.8 billion net profit for the March quarter, up $2.8 billion from the year before, with nearly half of that increase resulting from a reduced tax rate. Changes to how overseas profits are treated also allowed it to plow a record amount of cash into stock repurchases.  Companies\u2019 tax rates rise and fall over time for a variety of reasons, making it difficult to say how much of the quarter\u2019s broad tax-rate decline was a direct results of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Republican lawmakers in December.  However, this quarter\u2019s drop in average tax rates provisioned by recently reporting S&P 500 companies was dramatic compared with changes in the same quarter in recent years, and many companies attributed their lower tax rates to the fiscal overhaul. The companies in the Thomson Reuters analysis had median tax rates of 27 percent in the first quarter of 2017 and 29 percent in the first quarter of 2016.  Intel INTC.O halved its tax rate in the first quarter to 11 percent, primarily because of the tax cuts, reducing the chipmaker's effective tax bill by around $560 million.  Amazon.com's AMZN.O tax rate declined by 9 percentage points in the March quarter, adding $170 million to its bottom line.  Morgan Stanley MS.N, Citigroup C.N, JPMorgan JPM.N, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and Bank of America BAC.N trimmed their tax bills by a combined $2 billion in the first quarter, compared to what they would have set aside using last year's tax rates.  About a third of expected U.S. corporate earnings expansion in the March quarter is a result of the tax cuts, a trend that is likely to continue through 2018, said Patrick Palfrey, an earnings analyst at Credit Suisse.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing is a very strong underlying growth trend, which is being driven by revenue and margin growth,\u201d Palfrey said. \u201cThat\u2019s being augmented by the tax change.\u201d  The biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, the new law slashes the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and reshapes how the government taxes multinational corporations.  Its passage pushed Wall Street to record highs, with analysts recently forecasting a 25 percent leap in aggregate S&P 500 earnings in the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  S&P 500 information technology companies on average slashed their first-quarter effective tax rates by 9 percentage points, outdone only by the telecommunication group\u2019s 10 percent reduction. They are followed by financials, which on average cut their tax rates by 8 percentage points.  Apple cut its effective tax rate to 15 percent in the March quarter from 25 percent a year before.  Alphabet's GOOGL.O effective tax rate of 11 percent in the first quarter netted the Google owner an additional $1 billion in net income compared to what it would have earned using its tax rate of 20 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Alphabet attributed its lower tax rate to changes in accounting rules for reporting investments, as well as to the Tax Act.  Twitter TWTR.N said that $21 million of its $70 million increase in non-GAAP quarterly net income was due to the tax cut.  Raytheon RTN.N cut its tax rate by 10 percentage points in the March quarter, equivalent to $83 million, and the missile maker raised its 2018 earnings forecast in part because of the tax cuts.  Hershey Co HSY.N cut its adjusted tax rate to 25 percent in the March quarter from over 30 percent the year before, an improvement it attributed to the tax cut.","238":"Jan 24 (Reuters) - Intel Corp\u2019s shares rose 5% on Friday after demand from data centres fired up the chipmaker\u2019s cloud business and allayed concerns of market share loss to rival AMD, lifting shares across the sector.

The chip industry is in a slowdown, with research firm Gartner forecasting a 9.6% drop in global semiconductor revenue in 2019, to $429 billion. U.S.-China trade tensions, including tariffs on some products and the restrictions on sales to Huawei, are pressuring chipmakers.  But those factors did not trouble Intel, which was the second chipmaker this week to beat analysts\u2019 earnings estimates. On Tuesday, Texas Instruments Inc said U.S.-China trade tensions were not hampering its ability to conduct business in China.  Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, George Davis, told Reuters the company had resumed some product sales to Huawei that comply with U.S. regulations. Tariff threats between the United States and China actually helped second-quarter sales by about $400 million, Intel executives said.  \u201cCustomers concerned about supply risk in the second half of the year related to those items pulled in some demand into the second quarter,\u201d Davis said in an interview. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a net add to the full year (forecast), but it certainly de-risks some of the full year.\u201d  Intel reported second-quarter revenue of $16.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $15.7 billion and adjusted earnings of 89 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  But it was the company\u2019s forecast that drove up shares, with third-quarter revenue and profit forecast to be $18 billion and $1.24 per share, above analysts\u2019 estimate of $17.72 billion and $1.16 per share.  The company estimated 2019 revenue of $69.5 billion, instead of the $69 billion it told investors to expect in April. Chief Executive Bob Swan told investors on a conference call that Intel has two factories now producing 10-nanometer chips - the next generation of manufacturing technology which Intel has struggled to bring online - and said plans to produce 7-nanometer chips by 2021 remain on track.  \u201cWe\u2019re most impressed by progress on 10-nanometer ramp,\u201d Abhinav Davuluri, an equity analyst with Morningstar, said.  Intel also said it planned to sell the majority of its modem business to Apple Inc for $1 billion. About 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, which will acquire a trove of patents under the deal.  Davis told Reuters the payment was all cash. Intel will retain the rights to make non-smartphone modems for self-driving cars and PCs under the deal.  The company estimated a $500 million after-tax gain from the sale of the modem business.  After years of acquisitions outside its core area of processing chips under previous leaders, Swan has set a goal of becoming more disciplined about spending, slowing investments in areas like memory chips and shedding struggling businesses.  Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the sales were a step in the right direction.  \u201cWe believe further divestitures of non-core businesses would certainly make (Intel) look more attractive, while allowing management to more closely focus on improving core operations increasing the likelihood of future execution, but we are not yet convinced management will move in this direction,\u201d he said in a note.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen  (Reuters) - Intel Corp's INTC.O Chief Engineering Officer Murthy Renduchintala is departing, part of a move in which a key technology unit will be separated into five teams, the chipmaker said on Monday.  Intel said it is reorganizing its technology, systems architecture and client group. Its new leaders will report directly to Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan.  Ann Kelleher, a 24-year Intel veteran, will lead development of 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer chip technology processes. Last week, the company had said the smaller, faster 7-nanometer chipmaking technology was six months behind schedule and it would have to rely more on outside chipmakers to keep its products competitive.  Renduchintala, who was president of the wide-ranging group before its reorganization and widely seen as a No. 2 to Swan, joined Intel in 2015. He was executive vice president of Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, and has been on Accenture's ACN.N board since April 2018.  Renduchintala was one of several key hires from outside Intel, which had been famous in Silicon Valley for developing and promoting talent from within. He was hired as part of a strategy to go after broader markets than the central processing units, or CPUs, the company became known for in the PC era.  One major effort, creating modem chips to connect smart phones to mobile data networks, ended last year. Intel sold the business to Apple for $1 billion, a fraction of what it had invested in the effort.  Renduchintala eventually took responsibly for turning around Intel\u2019s process technology, which struggled with years of delay for its current 10-nanometer process. CEO Swan told investors in November that Intel was set start catching up to rivals with its 7-nanometer process in early 2021, but was forced to reverse himself last week because of the delays.  Intel said Renduchintala will depart Aug. 3.","244":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from Intel Corp INTC.O, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.  FILE PHOTO: A man is reflected in a Apple store logo in San Francisco, California, U.S., August 21, 2017. REUTERS\/Kevin Coombs\/File Photo  The initiative, code-named Kalamata, is still in early developmental stages but is part of a bigger strategy to make Apple\u2019s family of devices work more similarly and seamlessly together, according to the report.  Apple, which has used Intel chips in its computers since 2005, and the computer chipmaker both declined to comment. Intel shares closed down 6.1 percent at $48.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq .IXIC ended down 2.7 percent.  Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a note he believed the market was \u201cover reacting\u201d to the report on Apple\u2019s plans and that Intel\u2019s prospects remained good. \u201cWe do not expect any other PC manufacturers will consider designing its own CPUs,\u201d he wrote in the note.  Other analysts said Apple would likely phase Intel\u2019s chips out over time.  \u201cWhile it\u2019s possible that Apple may replace Intel in some of its lower-end product lines, we think it will be difficult for Apple to completely replace Intel by 2020, especially on its higher-end offerings,\u201d said Summit Insights group analyst Kinngai Chan.  The Mac plays a small part in Apple\u2019s overall financial picture, with sales of 19.2 million units last year and accounting for 11 percent of Apple\u2019s $229.2 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017.  But while the laptop and desktop computer market has been in a years-long slump amid the rise of smartphones and tablet computers, Mac sales rose 4 percent in 2017. The growth came even as PC sales declined slightly to 259.5 million units, the smallest drop since 2011, according to data from research firm IDC.  While Apple\u2019s reported move away from Intel would be a major shift for its Mac lineup, it follows years of increasing focus on designing its own chips for its devices. The company has been designing its own iPhone processors since the release of the iPhone 4 in 2010 and has steadily increased the amount of chip work it handles itself.  \u201cWe can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost and over quality,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said of Apple\u2019s chip efforts last year.","245":"(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Third Point LLC is pushing Intel Corp to explore strategic alternatives, including whether it should keep chip design and production under one roof, according to a letter it sent to the company\u2019s chairman on Tuesday that was reviewed by Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp's logo is seen on their \"smart building\" in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, Israel December 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Amir Cohen  Were it to gain traction, Third Point\u2019s push for changes could lead to a major shakeup at Intel, which has been slow to respond to investor calls to outsource more of its manufacturing capacity. It could also lead to the unwinding of some of its acquisitions, such as the $16.7 billion purchase of programmable chip maker Altera in 2015.  Third Point Chief Executive Daniel Loeb wrote to Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak calling for immediate action to boost the company\u2019s position as a major provider of processor chips for PCs and data centers. The New York-based fund has amassed a nearly $1 billion stake in Intel, according to people familiar with the matter.  Intel shares rose 6.1% to $49.95, the most in more than eight months on the news, giving the company a market value of more than $200 billion. The stock had declined about 21% this year, compared with a 43% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index.  Intel\u2019s most urgent task was addressing its \u201chuman capital management issue,\u201d as many of its talented chip designers have fled, \u201cdemoralized by the status quo,\u201d Loeb wrote in the letter.  Intel has lost its pole position in microprocessor manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Loeb wrote in the letter.  Intel is also losing market share in its core PC and data center markets to Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Loeb added. NVIDIA Corp is dominating computational models used in artificial intelligence applications, while Intel has been largely absent in this nascent market, according to the letter.  \u201cWithout immediate change at Intel, we fear that America\u2019s access to leading-edge semiconductor supply will erode, forcing the U.S. to rely more heavily on a geopolitically unstable East Asia to power everything from PCs to data centers to critical infrastructure and more,\u201d Loeb wrote.  In a short statement, the Santa Clara, California-based company said, \u201cIntel welcomes input from all investors regarding enhanced shareholder value. In that spirit, we look forward to engaging with Third Point LLC on their ideas towards that goal.\u201d  Loeb asked Intel to retain an investment adviser to evaluate strategic alternatives, including whether it should remain an integrated device manufacturer and the potential divestment of failed acquisitions, according to the letter. Third Point believes that Intel should consider separating its chip design from its semiconductor fabrication plant manufacturing operations, according to the sources. This could include a joint venture in manufacturing, according to sources.  Intel customers, such as Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc, are developing their own in-house silicon solutions and sending those designs to be manufactured in East Asia, Loeb wrote. He suggested Intel must offer new solutions to retain these customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away.  Third Point, which has $15 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to pursue deals, including at Prudential Plc, Yum! Brands Inc, Dow Chemical and United Technologies. The firm\u2019s Third Point Offshore fund was up 19.9% for the year through the middle of December, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Loeb said in the letter that Third Point reserved the option to submit nominees for election to Intel\u2019s board at its next annual meeting, should it sense \u201ca reluctance to work together to address the concerns\u201d it raised.  OUTSOURCING MANUFACTURING  The COVID-19 pandemic has given Intel a boost in the form or surging laptop sales, as employees and students work and learn from home. But the company has failed to capitalize on strong demand for semiconductors more broadly, needed to power everything from smartphones to artificial intelligence.  This is because Intel\u2019s in-house manufacturing capabilities have often struggled with the customized chips its clients want. The ability of its rivals to use a wide network of suppliers also results in many of its offerings lagging its rivals in speed and energy consumption.  Splitting its design and manufacturing operations could help it produce better chips at a lower cost by tapping outside vendors to make its most advanced central processors, a step executives have long resisted.  But selling Intel\u2019s factories, or even opening them up more to contract manufacturing, could pose a challenge because they are geared toward its own design process, rather than broader industry standards that other companies follow.  U.S. national security concerns could present another obstacle to a potential divestment. Intel\u2019s most formidable manufacturing rivals - TSMC and Samsung - have their manufacturing base overseas, and it is unclear whether regulators would approve a sale of any of Intel\u2019s chipmaking operations to a foreign entity, given its central role in the supply chain.  Intel named its former chief financial officer, Bob Swan, chief executive last year. In June, it lost one of its veteran chip designers, Jim Keller, over a dispute on whether the company should outsource more of its production, sources said at the time.","246":"WASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Representative Jim McGovern on Tuesday sent letters to Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp seeking information on the sale of advanced computer chips allegedly used by China to conduct mass surveillance on Uighurs in the country\u2019s remote Xinjiang region.  Rubio is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee which oversees human rights, and McGovern chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.  The letters were sent to the chief executives of the companies, who were asked to respond to questions about their exports to China.  The executives were also asked whether they knew their technology would be used to support surveillance activities conducted by China\u2019s police forces and whether they took steps to ensure their products were not used for human rights abuses or to compromise U.S. national security.  The United Nations has previously estimated that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region. The U.S. State Department has accused Chinese officials of subjecting Uighur Muslims to torture, abuse \u201cand trying to basically erase their culture and their religion.\u201d Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions over the repression of China\u2019s Uighurs.

The Commerce Department said gross domestic product rose at a 3.2 percent annualized rate, boosted by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold goods since 2015 - temporary factors that are likely to reverse in the coming quarters.  The report also showed consumer and business spending slowed sharply, and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter, giving it a weak tone.  \u201cWe had a pretty big beat on GDP today, but some underlying numbers are giving investors a pause on where they see future growth coming from given the consumer spending levels,\u201d said Mike Loewengart, vice president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial.  \u201cEarnings have largely been good, but there have been some misses, which investors are trying to make sense of and that\u2019s why we have this sideways move in markets.\u201d  Dragging down the three main indexes was Intel Corp , which slumped 10.4% after it cut its full-year revenue forecast and missed quarterly sales estimate for its key data center business.

Exxon Mobil Corp was down 2.7% as the company\u2019s quarterly profit missed estimates on lower oil and gas prices and weakness across its businesses.  Despite weak results from some marquee names, more than three-quarters of the 229 S&P 500 companies, which have reported so far, have topped earnings estimate, according to Refinitiv data.  The forecast for earnings growth has also improved to a 0.3% decline from a 2.3% drop estimated at the start of the quarter.  That, in part, has put the S&P 500 closer to an all-time high and pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Wednesday.

Offering support to markets was Amazon.com Inc, which rose 1.3% after the e-commerce giant reported quarterly profit that doubled and beat estimates on soaring demand for its cloud and ad services.  Walt Disney Co rose 1.3% after Marvel Studios superhero spectacle \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d hauled in a record $60 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices during its Thursday night debut.  Ford Motor Co surged 10.3% and was the biggest gainer on the S&P after the automaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings largely due to strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market.  Their shares drove a 0.6% gain in the consumer discretionary sector.  The energy sector fell 1.74%, the most among the three S&P sectors in the red, weighed down by lower crude prices and Exxon\u2019s downbeat results.

FILE PHOTO: Intel's logo is pictured during preparations at the CeBit computer fair, which will open its doors to the public on March 20, at the fairground in Hanover, Germany, March 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Fabian Bimmer  The Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago said they are working on a supercomputer dubbed Aurora with Intel, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of data center chips, and Cray, which specializes in the ultra-fast machines.  The $500 million contract for the project calls on the companies to deliver a computer with so-called exaflop performance - that is, being able to perform 1 quintillion - or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations per second.  If the project succeeds, Aurora would represent nearly an order of magnitude leap over existing machines that feature so-called petaflop performance, capable of doing 1 quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000 - calculations a second.  It also heightens the stakes in a race in which the United States, China, the European Union, and Japan have all announced plans to build exaflop-capable supercomputers.  One of Aurora\u2019s primary functions would be simulating nuclear blasts, a pillar of weapons development since the ban of live detonation testings.  Aurora will be built with artificial intelligence capabilities for projects such as developing better battery materials and helping the Veterans Administration prevent suicides, Rick Stevens, an associate lab director with Argonne overseeing the exascale computing project, said during a news briefing.  The project is a win for Intel, which will supply its Xeon CPU chips and Optane memory chips for Aurora.  Intel has been fending off rival U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp\u2019s rise in the chip content of supercomputers as the machines take on more artificial intelligence work. Nvidia\u2019s chips are found in five of the world\u2019s current top-10 supercomputers, though the Nvidia chips are found alongside chips from its rivals, according to TOP500, which ranks the machines.  The world\u2019s current most powerful machine, the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, contains chips from International Business Machines Corp and Nvidia.  The source of chips for supercomputers has become a factor in trade tensions between the United States and China. The world\u2019s third-fastest supercomputer - the Sunway TaihuLight in China - has chips developed domestically in China.  Chirag Dekate, an analyst with Gartner who studies the supercomputing market, said that despite the small contract size relative to Intel\u2019s overall revenue, the work done on Aurora will eventually filter down to the company\u2019s commercial customers.  \u201cIt\u2019s not just a jingoistic race between the U.S. and China,\u201d Dekate said. \u201cThe innovations that Intel is developing here will percolate down to other parts of its business.\u201d","257":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's Nokia Oyj NOKIA.HE has entered into partnership with Intel INTC.O to accelerate its so-far sluggish shift to 5G, the company said on Thursday, a day after announcing a similar deal with Marvell Technology MRVL.O.

Raja Koduri, senior vice president of the Core and Visual Computing Group at Intel Corporation in Santa Clara, Californai, U.S., is shown in this handout taken October 8, 2018. Courtesy Intel Corp\/Handout via REUTERS  Intel, the world\u2019s biggest maker of computing chips for personal computers and data centers, for decades followed Moore\u2019s law, named for Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, by doubling the number of transistors on a chip every two years, thus roughly doubling their performance.  But as those transistors have shrunk to just a few nanometers apart, Intel has fallen years behind schedule on its own plans. The company said in July that chips featuring its newest 10-nanonmeter manufacturing technology will not arrive until the holiday shopping season of 2019.  In the meantime, most of Intel's biggest rivals such as Nvidia Corp NVDA.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O long ago quit manufacturing chips and outsourced the work to firms like TSMC. The Taiwanese firm rolled out its newest generation of chipmaking technology this year and snatched away Intel's title of making the tiniest chips.  But Intel said it now has technology to stack computing circuits on top of each other and wire them together with speedy connections, enabling it to pack more onto a single chip. Stacking has been used in memory chips before, but Intel would be the first company to successfully stack the so-called \u201clogic\u201d chips that handle computing tasks, Raja Koduri, Intel\u2019s chief of chip architecture, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this packaging technology for nearly 20 years,\u201d Koduri said. \u201cThere\u2019s some real physics problems to solve in stacking logic on logic.\u201d  The stacking technology will be available in the second half of next year, Intel said. It will also Intel break up its chip designs into smaller units called \u201cchiplets\u201d so that, for example, memory and computing chips can be stacked in different combinations.  Koduri said that will let Intel meet changing customer needs instead of selling \u201cmonolithic\u201d chips.  But Jack Gold, an analyst with J.Gold Associates, said the technology will also help Intel move faster against rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O which are using TSMC's technology.

The companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal.  The software is designed to run on Intel\u2019s chips, which are best known as the heart of most personal computers but which the company is aiming to sell into equipment for 5G, the next generation of wireless data networks that is being rolled out starting this year.  According to Pivot\u2019s securities filings, Smart Edge did not generate significant revenue for Pivot in the first six months of 2019, but made a loss of about $1 million before depreciation and amortization. Pivot, which has a market value of about $43 million, was issued a U.S. patent on Smart Edge\u2019s technology in July.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Under the project, Intel will help the military develop prototypes of chips using its semiconductor packaging technology at factories in Arizona and Oregon. The packaging technology allows pieces of chips called \u201cchiplets\u201d from different providers to be combined into one package, helping cram more features into a smaller finished product while lowering its power consumption.  \u201cAs more and more semiconductor manufacturing has moved offshore, the (Department of Defense) is very interested in ensuring that they have advanced microelectronics for national security manufactured here in the U.S.,\u201d Bob Swan, Intel\u2019s chief executive, told Reuters in an interview as he toured a recently completed $7 billion factory expansion in Arizona, where Intel\u2019s workforce totals 12,000.  \u201cAs a U.S.-based company, it\u2019s important to us to be able to address some of the fundamental concerns that the U.S. would have about access to these critical technologies going forward,\u201d he said.  Intel declined to disclose a dollar figure for its portion of the contract, which is being overseen by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division. Intel won part of the first phase of the contract in 2019.  Intel\u2019s work with the Defense Department comes as U.S. officials focus on boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing in response to the rise of China as a strategic competitor. About 75% of the world\u2019s chipmaking capacity is in Asia, with many of the most advanced plants in Taiwan and Korea, within the reach of the Chinese and North Korean militaries.  \u201cI think one of the areas where we can have the most impact on China broadly is re-shoring microelectronics,\u201d Ellen Lord, the Pentagon\u2019s chief weapons buyer, told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee in a hearing on Thursday.  Intel is one of three companies in the world that can make highly advanced computer chips. The other two - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd - have packaging technology similar to Intel\u2019s.  But Intel has been working on the technology longer and can perform the work in the United States, which the other two cannot, said Dan Hutcheson, chief executive officer of VLSI Research.  \u201cThere\u2019s no one else with the mix of technology that they have in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cPackaging is a big win for them.\u201d  With Washington\u2019s relations with Beijing at their worst in decades, U.S. officials have cracked down on suppliers to Chinese firms such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], with new rules on Sept. 15 barring most U.S. companies from selling to the Chinese telecommunications giant. Intel confirmed last month that it has licenses to keep supplying some products.  Swan said that global market access was \u201cvery important\u201d to helping Intel generate the cash needed to build chip factories, called \u201cfabs\u201d in the industry.  \u201cWe make money, we take that money, and we reinvest predominantly here, in fabs in the U.S. and in research and development,\u201d he said.","276":"Evil Geniuses and 100 Thieves swept to wins Wednesday and clinched first place in their groups at the Intel Extreme Masters XV - New York Online: North America event.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/FIle Photo  Intel expects the fast-growing AI chip market to exceed $25 billion by 2024, with its own AI-driven revenues this year seen rising 20% from 2018 to more than $3.5 billion.  Intel has increasingly been depending on sales to data centers as PC sales stagnate.  Habana, an AI processor firm, was founded in 2016 and has offices in Tel Aviv, San Jose, Beijing and Gdansk, Poland. It has raised $120 million to date, including $75 million in a funding round led by Intel Capital last year.  The deal follows a string of AI-related acquisitions by Intel in recent years, including Movidius, Nervana, Altera and Mobileye.  Navin Shenoy, who oversees Intel\u2019s data center group, told Reuters in an interview that each set of chips is designed to solve a different problem, whether it is helping cars drive themselves or training machine-learning algorithms in data centers.  Shenoy said Habana\u2019s chips are aimed at so-called deep learning, a subset of machine learning, being done in data centers.  \u201cWhat we hear from our customers is that there\u2019s a heterogonous set of needs,\u201d Shenoy said. \u201cThe market opportunities are significant and large enough that we can build out a specialized portfolio to go solve those problems and do it in a way that customers feel good about and respond well to.\u201d  Habana launched its new Gaudi AI training processor in June that it said will deliver much faster processing speeds to compete with similar offerings from Intel\u2019s rival Nvidia Corp.  Nvidia outbid Intel last March to buy Israeli chipmaker Mellanox for $6.9 billion, boosting its data-center chip business.  Habana will remain an independent business unit led by its current management team and report to Intel\u2019s data platforms group.  The company will continue to be based in Israel and its Chairman Avigdor Willenz will serve as a senior adviser to Intel, the companies said.  Willenz sold chip designer Galileo Technologies to Marvell Technology Group for $2.7 billion in 2001, and Annapurna Labs to Amazon for an estimated $370 million in 2015.  With five facilities, Intel already has a significant presence in Israel and has become one of the country\u2019s top exporters since launching operations there in 1974.  The California-based chip giant moved its automotive technologies headquarters to Jerusalem after buying Mobileye for $15 billion in 2017. It is investing $11 billion to expand its local chip factory and also launched a tech accelerator in Israel in June.","278":"WASHINGTON, Feb 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to back stricter deadlines for workers to sue retirement plans over alleged mismanagement, ruling Intel Corp cannot void a lawsuit accusing it of violating federal law by making high-risk investments that cost retirement plan beneficiaries hundreds of millions of dollars.  In a unanimous ruling, the justices upheld a lower court decision that revived the proposed class-action lawsuit by former Intel engineer Christopher Sulyma against Intel.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The company\u2019s gaming chip business powered the quarterly results, but it said it expects the biggest revenue generating unit to be impacted in the fourth quarter by seasonal weakness for gaming cards used in personal computers and laptops.  The strong quarterly performance by the top chipmakers comes as a relief to the industry that is reeling under slowing demand due to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war.  Nvidia said it expects data center growth to come from a rise in conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, and inference, the process of using an algorithm for tasks such as translating audio into text-based requests.  \u201cLike Intel, Nvidia saw big demand from its hyperscale customers, undoubtedly driven by machine learning training and inference needs,\u201d Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said.

FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Federal and state officials could still force companies to change their data practices and even pay restitution under the proposal, which Intel wrote and began talking to Congress members about this week in an unusual step for a corporation.  But the protection from civil actions would constitute a major win for Silicon Valley tech companies that would come at the cost of being more forthright about how they process user data. Repeat offenders could lose protection, and executives who falsely certify their compliance could face criminal prosecution, according to the proposed legislation provided by the company.  David Hoffman, Intel\u2019s global privacy officer, told Reuters on Tuesday that executives\u2019 fear of imprisonment would drive \u201cthe best privacy protection you can get.\u201d  Intel itself does not collect much consumer data. Big data collectors, such as Facebook Inc FB.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, are among the top buyers of Intel's lucrative computer server chips.  Hoffman said increasing consumer privacy concerns over the last five years have lead to \u201cpushback\u201d on electronic health records and education data systems.  \u201cThat\u2019s all bad for our business,\u201d he said.  Marc Groman, an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University and former White House senior adviser on privacy, said Intel\u2019s proposal should be taken seriously.  He described the safe harbor from fines as reasonable and the grant of rulemaking authority to the FTC as crucial for the legislation to keep up with new technology.  Data privacy has become a pressing political issue in the United States, with major technology companies Facebook, Google and Twitter Inc TWTR.N questioned by Congress on their practices.  In Europe, a General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, took effect in May. Breaking privacy laws in Europe can now result in fines of up to 4 percent of a firm\u2019s global revenue.

Intel currently controls more than 90% of the server processor market, with AMD controlling most of the remainder.","291":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, on Thursday pushed further into the PC market with a line of chips designed to power business machines.  Qualcomm's \"Snapdragon\" processor chips historically have been at the heart of mobile phones like Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Pixel phone and many Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS devices.  Over the past year, though, Qualcomm adapted its chips to operate PCs running Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Windows operating system, making those machines start up more quickly and stay connected to the Internet constantly, much like a mobile phone or tablet.  But the chips Qualcomm used in those early PCs were essentially modified versions of the chips it sold for mobile phones. At an event in Hawaii on Thursday, Qualcomm officials said they have created a new series of chips called the Snapdragon 8cx that will be dedicated to PCs.  The biggest difference is the new Qualcomm chips will support Windows 10 Enterprise, the version of Microsoft\u2019s popular operating system that is sold to businesses. Previous Qualcomm chips supported only the consumer versions of Windows, making business customers less likely to purchase computers powered by them.  Qualcomm's move puts it in greater competition with chipmaker Intel Corp INTC.O, which last year still derived more than half of its $62.8 billion in revenue from PC chips and dominates that market. Intel's association with Windows PCs was so strong that the computer industry referred to them as \"Wintel\" machines for decades.  Qualcomm and others are also challenging Intel's supremacy in the data center business. Qualcomm's chips are powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Several companies - including Amazon.com's AMZN.O cloud division Amazon Web Services, a major Intel customer - are working to make ARM-based chips suitable for data centers. [nL2N1Y31HG]","292":"(Reuters) - Intel Corp, the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker by revenue and a prominent U.S. manufacturer, could avoid the most severe effects of a new list of Chinese tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump by shifting its production among its facilities, analysts said Monday.  FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at E3, the world's largest video game industry convention in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  On Friday, Trump said he planned to push ahead with tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports. While chips were largely spared from the initial list of targeted goods released in April, U.S. trade officials on Friday released a second tariff list of 284 products worth $16 billion that includes the processor and memory chips at the heart of Intel\u2019s business.  Those tariffs will not go into effect until after a public comment period, and there is a chance that chips could be cut from it before it is made final, analysts said. But Intel shares dropped 3.4 percent to $53.22 on Monday on news of a stock downgrade and investor concerns over tariffs. Late Monday, Trump also announced he might pursue $200 billion more in tariffs on Chinese goods, though it was unclear whether the list would include more chips or computing products that might impact Intel.  Intel could shift its production strategies to avoid much of the blow. Intel produces raw chips at six so-called wafer fabs, with three in the United States, one in Ireland, one in Israel and one in China. From there, chips go to so-called assembly and test facilities.  After that, they are sold to Intel\u2019s customers, large computer brands or contract manufacturers who work on their behalf. Most of those entities are legally based in China because that is where most electronics are built, and that explains why Intel booked $14.8 billion in China revenue in 2017.  But it is Intel\u2019s $12.5 billion revenue from the United States that is at risk. If Intel makes a chip at its U.S. plants in Oregon, Arizona or New Mexico, then sends it to China for low-level assembly work and then brings it back so it can be put into a device manufactured in the United States, the chip would get hit by the tariff.  But Intel also has assembly and test centers in Costa Rica, Malaysia and Vietnam. Chips from non-Chinese wafer fabs sold to American companies that pass through those facilities likely would not be hit.  \u201cMy sense is they can probably skip most of the tariffs,\u201d said Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research Inc.  Intel does have a factory in Dalian, China where it makes flash memory chips. The kind of flash memory chips Intel makes are not targeted by the tariff list. But the risks of a broader escalation of a trade war could hurt Intel\u2019s efforts to expand into new areas.  \u201cTrade wars in general are going to be bad for the global economy, and semiconductors tend to be global,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.  The assembly and test work that many chipmakers carry out in China makes up only about 10 percent of the value of a chip, with the design and manufacturing making up the bulk of a chip\u2019s value. Jimmy Goodrich, vice president of global policy for the Semiconductor Industry Association, said chipmakers could be forced to pay tariffs on their own products simply for doing a small portion of the work in China.  \u201cWe should be talking about a policy frame work that supports, not slows down, an industry that, unlike many others, still manufactures here in the U.S.,\u201d Goodrich said.

Intel, which for decades has dominated in processors for PCs and servers, has struggled to diversify its business after making critical stumbles in the smartphone revolution.  U.S. chipmakers have mostly outperformed since the S&P 500 hit a low on March 23, but Intel has enjoyed much less of that rebound than Nvidia, which is frequently among the most traded stocks on Fidelity and other retail investing websites.  While Intel\u2019s stock has lost almost 3% in 2020, Nvidia\u2019s has surged 68%. Investors have been betting that the shift to working remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic will continue to fuel fast growth in Nvidia\u2019s datacenter business.

The move marks the latest effort by the U.S. chip giant to divest its non-core businesses, move away from the volatile commodity NAND chip industry and focus on its remaining Optane memory business, which is smaller but more lucrative because it taps more advanced technology.  It is the biggest acquisition to date for SK Hynix and follows its $3.7 billion investment in Japanese rival Kioxia in 2017, as the Korean firm tries to boost its capacity to build NAND chips - used to store data in smartphones and data centre servers - and beef up its pricing power.  The deal will help SK Hynix overtake Kioxia 6600.T in the NAND memory market while narrowing the gap with market leader Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS.  SK Hynix shares jumped immediately after the news before valuation concerns saw them reverse gear to fall 2%, while the wider market .KS11 was down 0.7%. Samsung Electronics gained 1%.  \u201cShareholders are negative about the deal because they believe the price is too expensive. It\u2019s good news for other memory chipmakers, because the move would lead to industry consolidation,\u201d said Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities.  SK Hynix said Intel would sell all of its NAND business including its solid-state drive business, NAND component and wafer operation, and its factory in Dalian, China.  Intel would keep its advanced Optane memory technology, developed in partnership with Micron Technology Inc MU.O, which makes the Optane chips for Intel under a supply agreement.  The Intel division which includes its NAND and Optane businesses posted a fourth consecutive annual loss in 2019, although it swung to a profit in the first half of this year. SK Hynix has also posted losses in its NAND business.  FILE PHOTO: Employee walk past the logo of SK Hynix at its headquarters in Seongnam, South Korea, April 25, 2016. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  TRADE WAR  Analysts said U.S-China tensions may have influenced Intel\u2019s decision to sell its NAND flash memory factory in China. The moves comes a month after Kioxia cancelled a planned initial public offering amid market uncertainty.  Intel\u2019s Dalian factory makes chips that compete in the cut-throat commodity memory business where prices cycle through booms and bust that can eat profits.  \u201cThis transaction will allow us to further prioritise our investments in differentiated technology,\u201d Intel CEO Bob Swan said in a statement.  Swan has told investors he plans to divest non-core businesses. The company earlier sold its 5G modem business to Apple Inc AAPL.O.  SK Hynix said the companies aimed to obtain government approvals in late 2021, and close the deal in March 2025.  PANDEMIC-DRIVEN DEMAND  The Nand Flash industry grew in the April-to-June quarter thanks to robust demand for PCs and servers as the COVID-19 pandemic forces millions of people to work from home, according to market researcher Trendforce.  SK Hynix, which counts Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd as customers, is a distant fourth in the NAND memory chip market, although it ranks second after Samsung Electronics in DRAM memory sales.  Samsung is the leader in the NAND flash market with a 31.4% share, followed by Kioxia with 17.2%, SK Hynix with 11.7%, and Intel and Micron MU.O with 11.5% each.  With the acquisition, SK Hynix, part of South Korean conglomerate SK Group, will have a market share of 23.2%.  \u201cAlthough the competitive environment surrounding us is not easy, we have made a bold decision to pave the way for our leap toward securing a firm position in the NAND business as in DRAM,\u201d SK Hynix President and CEO Lee Seok-hee said in a statement.","300":"(Reuters) - Microchip maker Intel Corp INTC.O responded to a news report that it is considering a possible bid for Broadcom Ltd AVGO.O by saying that it is focused on integrating previous acquisitions, raising doubt over the idea.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel's competitive concern about Broadcom's attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom.  In response to an inquiry about the Journal\u2019s report, Intel said it does not comment on \u201crumors or speculation\u201d related to mergers and acquisitions but that it is focused on its previous acquisitions.  \u201cWe have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months - including Mobileye and Altera - and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders,\u201d Intel said in a statement to Reuters. Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015.  Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively.  Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues.  Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centers, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O.  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft.  Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalization alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination.  Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips.  VLSI Research chief Dan Hutcheson agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s product overlap, but it\u2019s really inconsequential,\u201d he said.","301":"NEW YORK\/LONDON\/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights.

Afterpay, an Australian group that lets shoppers delay payments for online purchases, announced Friday the Chinese internet giant had bought a 5% stake. The $6 billion company\u2019s shares have been on a roller coaster amid uncertainty about the coronavirus-induced downturn. Afterpay\u2019s value jumped 24% on Monday.  The buy-now-pay-later business has expanded rapidly by appealing to young consumers without credit cards. Yet it is nascent in China, which McKinsey estimates has an online retail market 2.5 times bigger than in the United States. Tencent rival Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba, took a small stake in Afterpay\u2019s Swedish rival Klarna in March.  Tencent\u2019s endorsement has limits, though. Regulatory scrutiny of Chinese investment in Australia would complicate a bigger shareholding. More importantly, with retailers closing their doors and unemployment rising, the buy-now-pay-later business model looks particularly vulnerable. (By Karen Kwok)  FREEFALL. Private equity groups Advent International and Cinven are stuck in a lift, with no one returning their call for help. The buyout duo lead a consortium that won the battle for Thyssenkrupp\u2019s elevator business with a 17.2 billion euro offer just before Covid-19 struck the West. Now they\u2019re searching for investors to help cover the 7 billion euro equity portion, the Financial Times reported on Monday. They\u2019ve already raised 2 billion euros from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and others.  The rest will be a stretch. Rival Kone said recently that 2020 revenue could fall by 5%-10% if \u201cbroad and strict\u201d lockdowns persist into the second half of the year. Avoiding crowded elevators is a major obstacle to reopening offices. Advent and Cinven have little scope to absorb a deterioration: Breakingviews estimated the internal rate of return, assuming growing sales and margins, at a meagre 15%. That\u2019s usually the hurdle rate for private equity deals. Any less will be a hard sell. (By Liam Proud)  ANBANG\u2019S UNCOMFORTABLE STAY. South Korea\u2019s Mirae Asset Global Investments is walking away from a deal to buy $5.8 billion worth of U.S. hotels from the troubled Chinese insurance giant, which is fresh out of two years of regulatory administration. Anbang Insurance\u2019s assets have been ported into a new company called Dajia Insurance, 98% owned by the China Insurance Security Fund, which is in turn controlled by the Ministry of Finance.

With fewer people planning business trips and holidays, there are fewer reasons to buy travel luggage. Net debt was already at $1.3 billion as of the end of last year, or nearly 3 times EBITDA.  The easier conditions should help it weather a rough few months until travel picks up: Samsonite expects net sales for the first quarter to fall by roughly 26% compared to the same period last year, and its Hong Kong-listed shares have slid 65% so far this year, underperforming local carrier Cathay Pacific Airways. If Samsonite is a proxy for future travel plans, it might need an even longer holiday on its debt terms.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Amazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon\u2019s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips.  Amazon\u2019s so-called \u201cInferentia\u201d chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests.  The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia\u2019s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer.  Intel\u2019s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel.  In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton. That chip is powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Arm-based chips currently power mobile phones, but multiple companies are trying to make them suitable for data centers. [nL2N1W402B] The use of Arm chips in data centers potentially represents a major challenge to Intel\u2019s dominance in that market.  Amazon is not alone among cloud computing vendors in designing its own chips. Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u2019s cloud unit in 2016 unveiled an artificial intelligence chip designed to take on chips from Nvidia.  Custom chips can be expensive to design and produce, and analysts have pointed to such investment driving up research and capital expenses for big tech companies.  Google Cloud executives have said customer demand for Google\u2019s custom chip, the TPU, has been strong. But the chips can be costly to use and require software customization.  Google Cloud charges $8 per hour of access to its TPU chips and as much as $2.48 per hour in the United States for access to Nvidia\u2019s chips, according to Google\u2019s website.","304":"FILE PHOTO: Computer chip maker Intel's logo is shown on a gaming computer display during the opening day of E3, the annual video games expo revealing the latest in gaming software and hardware in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2019.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Nvidia chips dominate the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms \u201clearn\u201d a task such how to recognize a human voice, but one of the biggest growth areas in the field will be deploying computers that implement the \u201clearned\u201d tasks. Intel dominates data centers where such tasks are likely to be carried out.  \u201cFor the next 18 to 24 months, it\u2019s very hard to envision anyone challenging Nvidia on training,\u201d said Jon Bathgate, analyst and tech sector co-lead at Janus Henderson Investors.  But Intel processors already are widely used for taking a trained artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests, what is called \u201cinference.\u201d  Intel\u2019s chips can still work just fine there, especially when paired with huge amounts of memory, said Bruno Fernandez-Ruiz, chief technology officer of Nexar Inc, an Israeli startup using smartphone cameras to try to prevent car collisions.  That market could be bigger than the training market, said Abhinav Davuluri, an analyst at Morningstar, who sees an inference market of $11.8 billion by 2021, versus $8.2 billion for training. Intel estimates that the current market for AI chips is about $2.5 billion, evenly split between inference and training.  Nvidia, which posted an 89 percent rise in profit Thursday, hasn\u2019t given a specific estimate for the inference chip market but CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call with analysts on Thursday that believes it \u201cis going to be a very large market for us.\u201d  Nvidia sales of inference chips are rising. In May, the company said it had doubled its shipments of them year-over-year to big data center customers, though it didn't give a baseline. Earlier this month, Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google Cloud unit said it had adopted Nvidia's inference chips and would rent them out to customers.  But Nvidia faces a headwind selling inference chips because the data center market is blanketed with the CPUs Intel has been selling for 20 years. Intel is working to persuade customers that for both technical and business reasons, they should stick with what they have.  Take Taboola, a New York-based company that helps web publishers recommend related content to readers and that Intel has touted as an example of how its chips remain competitive.  The company uses Nvidia\u2019s training chips to teach its algorithm to learn what to recommend and considered Nvidia\u2019s inference chips to make the recommendations. Speed matters because users leave slow-loading pages.  But Taboola ended up sticking with Intel for reasons of speed and cost, said Ariel Pisetzky, the company\u2019s vice president of information technology.  Nvidia\u2019s chip was far faster, but time spent shuffling data back and forth to the chip negated the gains, Pisetzky said. Second, Intel dispatched engineers to help Taboola tweak its computer code so that the same servers could handle more than twice as many requests.  \u201cMy options were, you already have the servers. They\u2019re in the racks,\u201d he said. \u201cWorking with Intel, I can now cut back my new server purchases by a factor of two because I can use my existing servers two times better.\u201d  Nvidia has been working to solve those challenges. The company has rolled out software this year to make its inference chips far faster to help overcome the issue of moving data back and forth. And it announced a new family of chips based on a technology called Turing earlier this week that it says will be 10 times faster still, Huang said on the analyst call Thursday.  \u201cWe are actively working with just about every single Internet service provider in the world to incorporate inference acceleration into their stack,\u201d Huang said. He gave the example that \u201cvoice recognition is only useful if it responds in a relatively short period of time.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was prioritizing election cyber security above all other critical infrastructure it protects, such as the financial, energy and communications systems, the agency\u2019s chief, Kirstjen Nielsen, told the Senate Intelligence Committee.  The hearing to examine the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to improve election security came following U.S. intelligence officials\u2019 repeated warnings that Russia will attempt to meddle in the 2018 contests after doing so during the 2016 presidential campaign.  It was held on the same day that lawmakers were expected to unveil a federal spending bill that sources familiar with the negotiations said included nearly $400 million for election security.  Nielsen endorsed paper ballot backups for electronic voting systems as an important safeguard in ensuring that tabulated election results are not tampered with.  New Jersey, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina have no verifiable paper ballot backup across their states, though some are looking to purchase systems that provide such audits. Eight other states, including Pennsylvania, have some electoral districts without paper backups.  Nielsen testified alongside her predecessor, former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, as the two sought to defend their work over the past two years overseeing efforts to steer the agency more toward protecting election systems. Under Johnson, the agency designated election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, months after President Donald Trump was elected.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  Both Johnson and Nielsen said they had \u201cno doubt\u201d that Russian leadership at a very high level was involved in the attempt to interfere in the U.S. election, which U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was done in order to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.  They also acknowledged challenges the agency had faced but agreed progress had been made to work better with states and more fully understand the threat posed by Russia and others.  \u201cToday I can say with confidence that we know whom to contact in every state to share threat information,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cThat ability did not exist in 2016.\u201d  Nielsen said that more than half of U.S. states have signed up for the agency\u2019s cyber scanning services designed to detect potential weaknesses that could be targeted by hackers. Nielsen repeated the agency\u2019s findings last year that 21 states had experienced initial probing of their systems from Russian hackers in 2016 and that a small number of networks were compromised, but that there remains no evidence any votes were actually altered.  Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday the need for improvements in election security was \u201curgent\u201d but it was unclear if fixes would be in place this year or even by the next presidential election in 2020. The committee on Tuesday released draft recommendations to bolster election security.  Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the committee, faulted voting machine vendors for being \u201caccountable to no one\u201d and refusing to answer questions he has repeatedly asked them about their security efforts.  Nielsen said she was unaware of any federal agency, including her own, that had the authority to mandate that vendors comply with security standards.  On a later panel, Wyden asked DHS cyber security official Jeanette Manfra how confident she was that voting machine vendors sold equipment that complied with common best security practices.  \u201cIt is hard for me to judge right now,\u201d Manfra responded. \u201cI do not have perfect insight into the machines that the states buy,\u201d adding that some vendors voluntarily submitted machines to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission for security review.","317":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc's AAPL.O latest iPhones hit stores around the world on Friday, featuring components made by Intel Corp INTC.O and Toshiba 6502.T among others, according to two firms that cracked open the iPhone Xs and Xs Max models.

That makes teardowns the only way of establishing the breakdown of parts in the phones, although analysts also recommend caution in drawing conclusions because Apple sometimes uses more than one supplier for a part. What is found in one iPhone may not be found in others.  Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.  The breakdowns listed no parts from Samsung 005930.KS and no chips from Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O.  Samsung in the past has supplied memory chips for Apple\u2019s iPhones and was believed by analysts to be the sole supplier of the costly displays for last year\u2019s iPhone X.  Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years, but the two have been locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices.  U.S.-based Qualcomm, the world\u2019s largest mobile phone chipmaker, has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.  Qualcomm said in July that Apple intended to solely use \u201ccompetitor\u2019s modems\u201d in its next iPhone release.  The iFixit teardown showed iPhone Xs and Xs Max used Intel\u2019s modem and communication chips instead of Qualcomm\u2019s hardware.  The latest iPhones also had DRAM and NAND memory chips from Micron Technology MU.O and Toshiba, according to iFixit's study. Previous teardowns of the iPhone 7 had shown DRAM chips made by Samsung in some models.  TechInsights' dissection of a 256-gigabyte storage capacity iPhone Xs Max, on the other hand, revealed DRAM from Micron but NAND memory from SanDisk, which is owned by Western Digital Corp WDC.O and works with Toshiba for its supply of NAND chips.  Toshiba\u2019s chip unit Toshiba Memory was purchased by a private equity-led consortium earlier this year that Apple joined.  In the past, TechInsights found Apple used different DRAM and NAND suppliers in the same generation of phones.  \u201cFor memory \u2013 Apple obviously competes with Samsung and wants to reduce their reliance as much as possible \u2013 so totally consistent that we\u2019d see Toshiba for NAND flash storage and Micron for DRAM,\u201d Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said.  Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, said in an interview that it appeared that one of Dialog Semiconductor's DLGS.DE chips had been replaced in the iPhone Xs Max by one of Apple's own chips, but it was not yet known whether that also applied to the iPhone Xs.  Dialog declined to comment. In May, the company said Apple had cut orders for its chips.  IFixit and TechInsights technicians also found components from companies including Skyworks Solutions SWKS.O, Broadcom AVGO.O, Murata 6981.T, NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O, Cypress Semiconductor CY.O, Texas Instruments TXN.O and STMicroelectronics STM.BN.","318":"Astralis and Team Liquid will meet in Sunday\u2019s best-of-five grand final at the $500,000 Intel Extreme Masters XV -- Global Challenge.

Reliance has now sold just over a quarter of Jio Platforms, the unit that houses its telecoms venture Jio Infocomm and its music and movie apps, raising $15.8 billion from investors including Facebook Inc FB.O and KKR & Co KKR.N.  The deals highlight Jio Platforms\u2019 potential to become the dominant player in India\u2019s digital economy.  The telecoms unit has already decimated several rivals with cut-throat pricing, while Reliance is also using Jio Platforms' technology in its new e-commerce venture that seeks to rival Amazon AMZN.O and Walmart's WMT.N Flipkart. Jio Platforms is also working on connected cars, security systems and smart homes.  The sale of the 0.39% stake for 18.95 billion rupees gives Jio Platforms an enterprise value of 5.16 trillion rupees ($69 billion), Reliance said in a statement.  The deals and a $7 billion share sale have helped Reliance become net-debt free, the company said last month. It had previously planned to rid itself of net debt of just over $21 billion by the year end.  The oil-to-retail conglomerate, controlled by India\u2019s richest man Mukesh Ambani, plans to wrap up most of its private fundraising for Jio Platforms by the third quarter of 2020 and then explore a potential public listing in the United States in 2021, a source familiar with matter has said.","322":"FILE PHOTO: Lisa Su, president and CEO of AMD, gives a keynote address during the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., January 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O raised its full-year revenue forecast on Tuesday, driven in part by an overall surge in chip demand due to a global shift to work from home, and market-share gains from larger rival Intel Corp INTC.O.  AMD\u2019s shares jumped 10% in extended trading after it also forecast current-quarter sales above Wall Street targets. The stock has gained about 50% this year through Tuesday\u2019s close as investors cheered its success in next-generation chips, at a time when Intel faces delays in building the smaller, faster 7-nanometer chip technology.  AMD, which relies on outside foundries to make its chips, has started to take market share from Intel with offerings made on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd's 2330.TW 7-nm process technology.  On a conference call with analysts, AMD Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said capacity for making 7-nm chips at TSMC factories was \u201ctight\u201d but that AMD believes it can meet demand as customers switch from Intel.  \u201cThe full-year raise is because demand has gone up from our initial expectations, and some of that is due to the market, and some of that is due to the strength of our product traction. We are increasing capacity to meet those needs. But it is tight,\u201d Su said.  AMD also met its goal of double-digit market share in server processors, Su said.  Revenue from AMD\u2019s computing and graphics segment, which includes graphic chip sales to data centers, rose 45% to $1.37 billion, beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.36 billion, according to research firm FactSet.  AMD now expects 2020 revenue to grow by about 32%, driven by strength in PC, gaming and data center products.  It expects third-quarter revenue at about $2.55 billion, plus or minus $100 million, compared to analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."}}
