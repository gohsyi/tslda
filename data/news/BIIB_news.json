FILE PHOTO: A sign marks a Biogen facility, some of whose employees have tested positive for the coronavirus after attending a meeting in Boston, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., March 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  Biogen\u2019s Spinraza, the list price of which drops to $375,000 a year after the first year, was the first approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a leading genetic cause of infant death, and was dominant until Zolgensma\u2019s entry last year.  Zolgensma is the world\u2019s most expensive one-off treatment, bringing in $205 million for Swiss drugmaker Novartis in the second quarter.  A proposed global clinical study by U.S.-based Biogen would test if Spinraza improves outcomes in patients who do not respond sufficiently to Zolgensma, it said.  In a call with analysts after Biogen\u2019s announcement, Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan did not directly address whether patients had adequate responses to Zolgensma or if they could benefit from Spinraza treatment after gene therapy.  Narasimhan did say that patients had not lost progress gained after treatment with Zolgensma, but that Novartis continues to evaluate another SMA medicine, branaplam, with the gene therapy.  Biogen, which achieved $2 billion in 2019 Spinraza sales, aims to enroll up to 60 children up to 3 years of age, starting in 2021.  Rare diseases such as SMA are attractive treatment areas for drug companies despite small patient numbers because they often affect children, which means that drugmakers can command high prices for advanced treatments.  The SMA market is poised to become more competitive, however.  Swiss drugmaker Roche and U.S. partner PTC Therapeutics are awaiting approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of risdiplam next month.  The one-a-day oral drug is viewed as a potential a rival to Spinraza, which is administered every four months via spinal infusion. Some analysts predict risdiplam\u2019s sales could eventually top $2 billion.

Eight members of the expert panel voted that both trials must be taken into consideration, one voted that the successful trial could stand as proof of efficacy on its own and two were uncertain.  The FDA is expected to make its approval decision by March. The drug, aducanumab, is poised to become the first new treatment for the disease in decades and the first that appears to be able to slow progression of the fatal, mind-wasting condition, should it win U.S. approval.  Biogen shares were halted ahead of the advisory panel meeting.  Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and there is \u201ca profound and enormous unmet medical need\u201d for new treatments, Billy Dunn, director of neurology products for the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said during the meeting.  Biogen in October last year revived its plans to seek approval for aducanumab, months after it had said that an independent futility analysis of its two pivotal trials showed they were unlikely to succeed.  Biogen said it changed course after a new analysis showed a high dose of the drug could slow disease progression.  The FDA staff earlier this week said data from one of the trials \u201cprovides the primary evidence of effectiveness\u201d and a clinically meaningful treatment effect.  They said failure of a second large trial did not detract from the findings of the positive study.  The expert panel on Friday is set to vote on three other questions including whether the results from the successful study alone could be considered as the main evidence of the drug\u2019s effectiveness in treating Alzheimer\u2019s.  The panel will also discuss results from a third early-stage study providing supportive evidence of aducanumab\u2019s efficacy.  The FDA is not obligated to abide by its advisory panel recommendations, but typically does.","2":"FILE PHOTO: A sign marks a Biogen facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. January 26, 2017.

Results from patients in the failed second trial who had received high doses also supported the findings of the first, it added. Patients who received aducanumab experienced significant benefits on measures of cognition and function such as memory, orientation and language.  Biogen said it had met with the Food and Drug Administration twice, once in June and again on Monday to discuss the data.  \u201cThey (FDA) thought it was reasonable for us to submit an application for approval,\u201d said Chief Medical Officer Alfred Sandrock, who earlier this month became the company\u2019s R&D head.  Credit Suisse analyst Fumiyoshi Sakai said the new datasets would be presented at clinical trials meetings in early December. FDA approval was not guaranteed, and investors and analysts would remain cautious \u201cuntil we see a real product,\u201d he said.

Baird analyst Brian Skorney said he believed FDA approval for aducanumab was highly unlikely and predicted Biogen would have an uphill task to convince regulators that the results were more than random chance.  Aducanumab works on the hypothesis that removing deposits of amyloid, a type of plaque, from the brain of patients in the early stages of the disease could stave off its ravages, which include loss of memory and the inability to care for oneself.  Biogen executives on a conference call said the results from the new analysis were positive for another Alzheimer\u2019s drug, BAN2401, which works on a similar principal and is also being jointly developed along with Eisai.

Bradner\u2019s comment to an investor conference in London comes as cross-town rival Roche has won the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s accelerated priority review for its oral SMA therapy that could result in a decision by May 2020.

Roche, which plans to seek approval for the investigational medicine this year, said its SUNFISH trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in patients aged 2-25 years with Type 2 or 3 SMA, compared to a placebo.  The muscle-wasting disease, which hits 1 in every 10-11,000 newborns, has been a target of significant interest as drugmakers move into a rare disease area that commands ultra-high prices. Biogen\u2019s Spinraza, approved in 2016, lists at $750,000 in year one and $375,000 thereafter, while Novartis\u2019s Zolgensma is the costliest one-time treatment at $2.1 million.  Roche\u2019s risdiplam, which would be the third treatment to market, is taken by mouth, as opposed to injected into the spine like Spinraza. Roche is also hoping data from its studies stacks up to that of Zolgensma, including in older SMA patients with forms of the disease that may emerge months after their birth but leave them with profound disabilities.  In its statement, Roche underscored the safety profile of Risdiplam just weeks after Novartis\u2019s trial of Zolgensma in a similar population of SMA patients was halted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when primate study raised concerns of possible nerve damage or loss.  \u201cNo treatment related safety findings leading to study withdrawal have been seen in any risdiplam trial to date,\u201d Roche said, adding it would release specific data from the SUNFISH trial at an upcoming medical conference.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  Biogen shares were up nearly 5% at $281.34 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.  The number of people in the United States living with Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common form of dementia, is expected to triple to nearly 14 million by 2050 without effective treatments, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If approved, Biogen\u2019s aducanumab would be the first treatment designed to delay progression of the fatal, memory-robbing disease.  The drug has had a tumultuous journey, with promising early data raising hopes and Biogen\u2019s share price, only to be dashed by disappointment in later trials.  Biogen in October revived plans to seek approval for aducanumab based on a detailed analysis of what had seemed like less than compelling data, months after scrapping its development.  The biotech company said its analysis showed patient improvements in memory and other measures of cognition and ability to function. Some experts have expressed skepticism over Biogen\u2019s interpretation of the data and called for another large trial that could take several years to complete.  Wall Street analysts have been betting on aducanumab to restore Biogen\u2019s growth prospects following a successful patent challenge to its top-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera and with looming competition for its high-priced gene therapy Spinraza weighing on its shares.  However, the drug\u2019s approval is far from guaranteed despite the desperate need for treatments. It has been at least 15 years since the Food and Drug Administration has reviewed an application for a new Alzheimer\u2019s treatment, as drugs that were tested failed in trials.  Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association advocacy organization, declined to comment on the chances of the drug winning approval, saying, \u201cThat really is up to the FDA.\u201d  \u201cWe are looking forward to that rigorous review and their decision,\u201d Carrillo said, adding that a \u201cdrug like this that addresses the biological causes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia would be historic and no doubt impactful for the Alzheimer\u2019s community.\u201d  Prior to the focus on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, the wait for aducanumab\u2019s filing and approval was probably the most-watched saga to play out in biopharma this year, SVB Leerink analyst Marc Goodman said.  The FDA now has 60 days to decide whether to accept the application for review, Biogen and partner Eisai Co Ltd said in a joint statement.  \u201cIt is unclear to us if the totality of the data support FDA approval.

Biogen said it has asked for a \u201cpriority review\u201d for the drug that could cut the time for an approval decision to six months, if granted.  Any successful Alzheimer\u2019s treatment is expected to eventually be a multibillion-dollar seller. Analysts are forecasting aducanumab sales of $673.7 million in 2022 if approved, according to Refinitiv IBES estimates.  Biogen said it was also working toward submitting marketing applications for the drug in Europe, Japan and elsewhere.","26":"SAN DIEGO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc, looking to win over skeptics and health regulators, later on Thursday will present highly anticipated data on its experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug aducanumab, which the U.S. biotech company had declared a failure earlier this year.  The turnabout has raised concern that the company is being more optimistic than its trial results warrant as it makes a case for a desperately needed treatment that, if approved, could be the first to slow progression of the mind-wasting disease.  For Biogen, the financial prospects are enormous. Wall Street analysts have forecast annual aducanumab sales reaching nearly $4 billion a year by 2024.  The decades-long search for a disease-modifying Alzheimer\u2019s treatment is littered with failures, and experts say aducanumab still needs to overcome serious questions over Biogen\u2019s new analysis of the trials.  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it done where a trial has been stopped (for futility) and then they come back and say, \u2018Hey, we did some more analysis and guess what? It\u2019s better,\u2019\u201d said Laurie Ryan, who heads the dementias of aging branch at the National Institute on Aging. \u201cNone of us has seen the raw data. We hope we see that.\u201d  Biogen\u2019s drug had been seen as a potential game changer, offering proof of the long-held theory that removing a toxic protein called beta-amyloid from the brain would slow progression of the disease.  Those hopes appeared to be dashed in March with an announcement that an interim analysis of two late-stage trials indicated they were likely to fail.  In October, however, Biogen surprised investors and the medical community, saying additional data showed a significant benefit in one of the twin trials, and that results for a subset of patients in the second trial support those findings.  Biogen said after discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the agency encouraged it to file for approval.  The company will present the additional aducanumab data at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease conference in San Diego.  Skeptics have raised numerous questions about scientific standards employed by Biogen in its more positive assessment, including a decision to compare results from a subset of patients who received a higher dose of aducanumab in each trial to the full placebo group.  Dr. Adam Boxer, head of the Alzheimer\u2019s clinical trials program at the University of California, San Francisco, said in a phone interview that a big question is \u201cwhy did they see efficacy in one Phase III trial and not the other?\u201d  Others have questioned the drug\u2019s safety data and other aspects of the trial analysis.  \u201cThe safety concern is swelling or even bleeding in the brain that may result from the process of lowering beta-amyloid levels,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Grill, a neurological disorders expert from the University of California, Irvine.  Some aducanumab patients were taken off the drug due to brain swelling and later allowed back into the trial, further complicating findings.  Biogen has partnered with Japan\u2019s Eisai Co Ltd to develop aducanumab as well as BAN2401, which works in a similar way.

The deal, announced by the U.S. Justice Department on Thursday, was the latest to result from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers\u2019 financial support of patient assistance charities that has resulted in more than $1.04 billion in settlements.  A specialty pharmacy that performed services for the Biogen, Advanced Care Scripts, will also pay $1.4 million to resolve claims it conspired to help it use the charities to pay kickbacks to patients taking the MS drugs Avonex and Tysabri.  Neither Biogen nor ACS admitted wrongdoing. Biogen said it believed its conduct was appropriate but entered into the deal to put the investigation behind it. ACS\u2019 lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.  Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in Medicare, the government healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.  But the government has alleged that various pharmaceutical companies used such charities as means to improperly pay the co-pay obligations of Medicare patients using their drugs, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The investigation came amid heightened attention to rising drug prices. Co-pays are partly meant to serve as a check on healthcare expenses by exposing patients to some of a medicine\u2019s cost.  The government alleged that Biogen from 2011 to 2013 used the foundations Good Days, previously known as the Chronic Disease Fund, and The Assistance Fund as conduits to pay thousands of patients\u2019 co-pay obligations.  Good Days and TAF in 2019 paid $2 million $4 million, respectively, to resolve similar allegations.","28":"April 16 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc:  * BIOGEN, BROAD INSTITUTE OF MIT AND HARVARD, PARTNERS HEALTHCARE LAUNCH CONSORTIUM TO BUILD AND SHARE A COVID-19 BIOBANK Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","29":"(Adds details on treatment)  Oct 30 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc and Eisai Co Ltd said on Friday the European health regulator has accepted for review the marketing application for their closely watched experimental Alzheimer\u2019s treatment aducanumab.

The rejection came despite a lower British price tag of 450,000 pounds ($573,000) for the first year and Biogen offering an undisclosed discount to the National Health Service.  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality, affecting one in every 10,000 live births. About 60 percent of patients have the most severe Type 1 form of the disease, which often leads to paralysis, impaired breathing and death by the second birthday.  Between 600 and 1,200 children and adults are currently living with the condition in England and Wales, according to NHS England. Spinraza will be made available immediately to Type 1 patients by Biogen, it said.  It said that Spinraza will be made available for other patients - including adults and siblings who have yet to show symptoms - in a few weeks, after NICE publishes guidance.  Spinraza was the first approved treatment for SMA, but is expected to soon face new competition.

Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman confirmed on Monday that he was recused from the scheduled meeting of outside advisors to the FDA. Expert advisory panels often play an important role ahead of FDA approval decisions, although the agency is not required to take their advice.  Knopman, who said he was recused because of his involvement in conducting clinical trials of aducanumab, has been a vocal critic of the drug, including in a paper published on Sunday in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia.  \u201cAducanumab\u2019s efficacy as a treatment for the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer\u2019s disease cannot be proven by clinical trials with divergent outcomes,\u201d he wrote.  The FDA, which is slated to decide by early March whether to approve aducanumab, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  If approved, aducanumab would be the first drug to treat an underlying cause of the fatal, mind-wasting disease, a field that has for decades produced nothing but failure. By 2025, the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia is projected to reach 7.1 million in the United States alone, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.  Biogen has said aducanumab, an antibody designed to remove harmful plaques from the brain, was shown in one of two major studies to significantly slow cognitive and functional decline. A second trial, however, showed a benefit only for a subset of patients who were given a high dose for at least 10 months.  Biogen abruptly ended a pivotal trial of aducanumab last year after an early look at results suggested it did not provide a desired benefit. Months later, the biotech company shocked many by reversing course, saying it had decided to seek FDA approval after all.  Shares of Biogen were down about 0.5% at $250.78.","35":"(Reuters) - U.S. health experts this week will decide whether to recommend approval for Biogen Inc's BIIB.O Alzheimer's drug, which could become the first new treatment for the mind-wasting disease in decades even as serious questions persist over whether data show if it works.  FILE PHOTO: A sign marks a Biogen facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. January 26, 2017. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  In a field littered with unrelenting failure, Biogen believes in aducanumab it has the first drug that can treat an underlying cause, and therefore slow progression, of Alzheimer\u2019s. But its path to approval has been anything but smooth or assured.  Biogen abruptly ended clinical trials of aducanumab last year after an early look at trial results showed it was not effective. Last October, the company shocked many Alzheimer\u2019s experts by reversing course, saying that a new analysis showed aducanumab could help patients with early-stage disease preserve their ability to function independently for longer. In July, Biogen filed for approval from the Food and Drug Administration.  Now the agency faces tremendous pressure to approve a treatment option for millions of Americans suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s and the millions more expected to face it in coming years.  Patient advocates say the need for a new Alzheimer\u2019s treatment that could help people remain independent is heightened by the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 229,000 people in the United States, including tens of thousands of seniors in nursing homes.  \u201cThe pandemic came and it changed everything,\u201d said Russ Paulsen, chief operating officer at patient advocacy group UsAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s. \u201cWe need something to keep people out of nursing homes.\u201d  A committee of outside advisers to the FDA will discuss aducanumab on Nov. 6. The agency\u2019s final decision is expected by March. European health regulators have also accepted the drug for review.  Charles Flagg, a 79-year-old retired minister from Jamestown, Rhode Island, had been enrolled for years in a trial of aducanumab before it was stopped. He started receiving the drug again in August as part of a follow-up study, according to his wife Cynthia Flagg.  \u201cHe\u2019s not 100 percent himself, but overall I\u2019m not dealing with someone that needs to be led around or be in a care home,\u201d Flagg said.  Aducanumab, an antibody designed to remove amyloid plaques from the brain - a strategy tried with many failed Alzheimer\u2019s drugs - would reap billions of dollars in sales if approved.  Biogen, along with partner Eisai Co Ltd 4523.T, is one of the last large drugmakers pursuing treatments for a disease that afflicts nearly 6 million Americans and millions more worldwide. Biogen estimates about 1.5 million people with early Alzheimer\u2019s in the United States could be candidates for the drug.  \u2018CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL\u2019  Late last year, Biogen said one of its two pivotal studies of aducanumab showed a statistically significant benefit at slowing cognitive and functional decline in patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s. A second trial failed to achieve that goal, but did show a benefit for a subset of patients who were given a high dose for at least 10 months.  In March, it opened a follow-up long-term safety study to 2,400 people who had previously participated in trials of aducanumab, like Flagg.  Many Alzheimer\u2019s researchers say Biogen should conduct a third large study to prove aducanumab works. They worry about its possible side-effects, such as brain-swelling, and the potential cost.  \u201cAducanumab\u2019s efficacy as a treatment for the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer\u2019s disease cannot be proven by clinical trials with divergent outcomes,\u201d said Mayo Clinic neurologist Dr. David Knopman, who was recused from the expert panel because he helped conduct the trials.  Others believe the FDA could approve the drug without another trial.  Previous clinical studies had largely targeted patients in later stages of the disease, while many experts now believe attacking Alzheimer\u2019s as early as possible may be the key to success. But there was a lack of clarity on how to assess a drug\u2019s success when functional deficits are less pronounced.  In 2018, the FDA revised its standard of proof guidance for reviewing Alzheimer\u2019s drugs by essentially combining what had been separate goals for cognition, or memory, and day-to-day function. The new guidance stressed the need for a drug to show \u201cclinically meaningful\u201d benefits, a term it has not clearly defined.  Alzheimer\u2019s advocacy groups are pushing for a broad definition, saying it should include preserving the ability to perform daily activities such as shopping independently or remembering to turn off a stove.  \u201cThey have been trying to lower the bar and help any company to get a drug approved,\u201d said Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, from the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. \u201cHow much (improvement) do you need to be clinically meaningful? Naturally this is very subjective.\u201d  The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","36":"Oct 30 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc and partner Alkermes Plc said on Wednesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved their oral drug to treat multiple sclerosis.

The companies said on Friday the decision was based on the results of a review conducted by a data safety monitoring board, which recommended discontinuing the trials as benefits from the treatment, elenbecestat, did not outweigh its risks.  Shares of Biogen were up 2.3% at $237.60 as some analysts said ending the trial would save the company costs associated with running it through its completion.  \u201cThis was widely expected by the investment community, including ourselves, and amounts to a further step in the unwinding of Biogen\u2019s expensive, painful and ultimately fruitless investment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease drug development,\u201d SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.  The companies in March ended two late-stage trials of another experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug, aducanumab.  Aducanumab\u2019s failure wiped out more than $18 billion of Biogen\u2019s market value, as investors were betting on the treatment to buoy the drugmaker, which is mired in patent issues over its big-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera and possible competition to spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza.  Elenbecestat belongs to a class of drugs called beta amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitors, which act by inhibiting the production of amyloid beta - a protein believed to be a major cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  However, drugmakers such as Amgen Inc and Novartis AG, Eli Lilly and Co and AstraZeneca Plc have all abandoned some of their BACE inhibitor trials earlier.  While there may have been similar failures in other companies, as a percentage of one large company\u2019s value and its total R&D investment, it would be hard to find a bigger disappointment, Porges said.  Biogen and Eisai said on Friday their latest decision does not impact their other Alzheimer\u2019s study testing experimental treatment, BAN2401, which belongs to a different drug class.","40":"* Biogen shares tumble 27 percent in morning trading  * Failure comes after Eisai CEO expressed confidence  * Analysts question Biogen\u2019s growth prospects (Adds context, details, background)  March 21 (Reuters) - Biogen and partner Eisai Co Ltd are ending two late-stage trials for the experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug aducanumab, in a setback to efforts to find treatments for the disease and for Biogen\u2019s stock, which lost more than $17 billion of its value on Thursday.  Without the potential revenue from an Alzheimer\u2019s drug, the company has poor growth prospects as it faces patent issues over its flagship Tecfidera multiple sclerosis drug and possible competition to spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza, Wall Street analysts said.  \u201cWe view this as a transformative failure for Biogen\u2019s pipeline,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research note.  Abrahams said he was reducing the stock\u2019s valuation to $240 per share and further declines were likely given that \u201cinvestors owned BIIB to not miss out on what could have been one of the biggest blockbuster products in the pipeline of large biopharma.\u201d  Shares of Biogen sank 27 percent to $233.98 in U.S. morning trading, its largest drop since Aug. 1, 2008 when it fell 28 percent.

Investors believe the successful development of a treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s, which affects about 5.7 million Americans, will result in multi-billion dollar annual sales. Still-experimental treatments have had a dismal track record, with more than 100 failures.  The decision to discontinue the trials was made after an independent data monitoring committee reported the drug was unlikely to be successful, the companies said. The recommendation was not based on safety concerns, they added.  The company had two trials, Engage and Emerge, that were testing aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\u2019s and mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia.  The trials ended just two weeks after Eisai\u2019s chief executive had expressed confidence in the drug. \u201cI believe we have already gone through the riskiest stage,\u201d Haruo Naito had said at a news briefing earlier this month.  Both Eisai and Biogen, which have collaborated on the development and commercialization of the drug, said they would continue to work on Alzheimer\u2019s treatments.  \u201cThis disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience,\u201d Biogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said. \u201cWe will continue advancing our pipeline of potential therapies in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d  Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said that would be a mistake for Biogen, which should instead start looking at merger and acquisition opportunities in treatments that target the central nervous system.  \u201cThey need to stop wasting or stop investing money in Alzheimer\u2019s now,\u201d Suneja said.  Big drug companies, including Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca Plc, Roche AG, Pfizer Inc, Merck and Co Inc, and Johnson and Johnson, have all previously abandoned Alzheimer drug trials over lack of effectiveness or due to safety concerns.  The companies will also discontinue a mid-stage study and a long-term extension study of aducanumab, which was designed to target the brain-destroying protein beta amyloid. It is still assessing whether to conduct a separate aducanumab late-stage prevention trial.

The move announced by the U.S. biotech company late on Thursday is expected to be taken into consideration by South Korean regulators who are investigating Samsung BioLogics\u2019 bookkeeping in 2015, sources said.  Samsung BioLogics shares plunged in early May after the financial watchdog said it had breached accounting rules concerning its valuation of subsidiary Samsung Bioepis in 2015.  Samsung BioLogics\u2019 valuation of Samsung Bioepis jumped 18 times to about $4.5 billion in 2015 after it switched to valuing the unlisted firm at fair market value instead of book value, a result of it being treated as an affiliate instead of a unit.  BioLogics has denied any wrongdoing and said the change was necessary to reflect different accounting standards in the event its partner exercised its call option.  The matter is now being examined by a body within the Financial Services Commission (FSC), South Korea\u2019s top financial regulator.  Biogen\u2019s call option exercise will be one of the matters considered when the FSC decides whether BioLogics\u2019 accounting was sound, regulatory sources previously told Reuters.

The therapy, gosuranemab, failed to hit statistical significance in its main goal and did not demonstrate effectiveness on key secondary goals when tested in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).  PSP results in deterioration of cells in areas of the brain that control body movement and thinking, causing serious problems with walking, balance and eye movements. There are no therapies for treating the underlying cause of the disease.  Therapies for PSP remain elusive, with many candidates failing advanced development programs. Earlier this year, AbbVie Inc scrapped development of its anti-tau antibody for the condition.  The trial setback further underscores Biogen\u2019s need for building out a pipeline of drugs other than aducanumab, its Alzheimer\u2019s therapy, noted JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov.  Analysts said that market expectations for gosuranemab, also an anti-tau antibody, were very low given AbbVie\u2019s trial failure and the focus still remained on approval of aducanumab.  Months after it had scrapped development for aducanumab, Biogen in a surprise move announced plans in October to pursue approval for the therapy, based on benefits seen in a fresh analysis of its trials.

Biogen stock was last up 3.4%.  Experts had been watching closely for any statistical abnormalities or excess safety issues that would affect how the drug is reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), likely in the second half of 2020.  It has been at least 15 years since the FDA has reviewed an application for a new Alzheimer\u2019s treatment, and an agent that can slow progression of the mind-wasting disease is desperately needed.  Alzheimer\u2019s experts on a panel organized by the company, who had seen the data previously, expressed confidence that the complicated study did show that the drug was able to slow progression of the disease.  \u201cAll of the data suggests this is a disease modification. That means the impact of the treatment will continue to accrue with time,\u201d said Dr. Paul Aisen, an Alzheimer\u2019s expert from the University of Southern California.  Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer\u2019s expert from Mayo Clinic who moderated the panel and has been a paid adviser for Biogen, said while one of the two studies, known as Emerge, was \u201coverwhelmingly positive,\u201d the twin study known as Engage, was not. \u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s more positive than negative,\u201d he said of the results.  Petersen was not too worried about the rates of a brain swelling side effect, known as ARIA-E, which occurred in 33-35 percent of patients in the high-dose groups.  \u201cThe side effects are there. They\u2019re not zero. They\u2019re to be expected. But I think they\u2019re manageable.\u201d  Others, however, acknowledged that the affected sample size was small and the trials were cut short early. Only one of the two phase 3 trials showed a statistically significant benefit.  \u201cThis reinforces what I thought before. That we need a third study. The data are encouraging, but there are still questions about whether the drug has a clinical effect,\u201d said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation, who was at the meeting.  Fillit said the company only measured one timepoint - 78 weeks after treatment. \u201cIt still remains to be seen if this effect is sustained. It could be an anomaly.\u201d  Dr. Eric Siemers, a former Alzheimer\u2019s researcher for Eli Lilly and a consultant on drugs for neurodegenerative disease who was not involved with the study, said based on his read of the data, the patient responses are not happening by chance.  \u201cThe regulators will have a very difficult job.

Multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera is facing competition from newer treatments such as Roche Holding AG\u2019s Ocrevus, and Biogen has been banking on its spinal muscular atrophy treatment, Spinraza, to drive future growth.  In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, sales from the company\u2019s multiple sclerosis franchise, which also includes Tysabri, came in at $2.17 billion, beating consensus estimates of $2.14 billion, according to William Blair.  Sales of Spinraza, the first approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, rose 29.5 percent to $470 million, but fell short of analysts\u2019 estimate of $487.9 million, largely due to pricing pressure and dosing schedule.  The company said overseas sales of Spinraza came under pressure from patients moving to a lower-priced maintenance dose from an induction dose in some mature markets in Europe.  The treatment starts with four induction doses, followed by maintenance doses once every four months. The first three initial doses are administered at 14-day intervals and the last 30 days after the third, meaning all four can fall in the same quarter.  \u201cWhile the dosing schedule of Spinraza (once every four months) creates potential for irregular quarterly sales, we had estimated continued new patient accrual in international markets,\u201d William Blair analyst Matt Phipps said in a note.  Britain\u2019s healthcare cost agency NICE said last year that it could not recommend Spinraza, which has a list price of $750,000 in the first year of treatment in the United States and $573,000 in the UK, as a cost-effective treatment.  Overseas Spinraza sales came in at $234 million in the fourth quarter, while U.S. sales were $236 million. In the third quarter, overseas sales were $244 million and U.S. brought in $224 million.  The company said on Tuesday it expects global Spinraza revenue to be relatively stable in the current quarter and sees mid- to high-teen growth in sales for the drug this year.  Biogen said it expects 2019 adjusted earnings in the range of $28.00 to $29.00 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $27.94.

An FDA approval could come by March, which would make the drug, aducanumab, the first new treatment for the disease in decades and the first that appears to be able to slow progression of the fatal, mind-wasting condition that affects millions of people.  Shares of Biogen and its partner Eisai Co Ltd both jumped 40%. The FDA staff comments also buoyed shares of other Alzheimer\u2019s drug developers, including a 15% rise in shares of Eli Lily and Co.  The agency\u2019s documents were released ahead of a meeting on Friday of outside experts who will review, and decide whether to recommend approval of, aducanumab, an antibody designed to remove amyloid plaques from the brain.  \u201cBriefing documents suggests a positive Advisory Committee vote, which bodes well for approval,\u201d Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said in a research note. Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Syed called it \u201calmost a best-case scenario\u201d for Biogen.  FDA drug reviewers said results from one pivotal trial of aducanumab were persuasive and strongly positive. They acknowledged that a second large trial did not succeed, but maintained it did not detract from the findings of the positive study. The FDA is not obligated to abide by its expert panel recommendations, but typically does.  One statistical reviewer at the FDA said another study is needed to confirm whether aducanumab is effective. \u201cThere is no compelling substantial evidence of treatment effect or disease slowing,\u201d FDA staffer Tristan Massie wrote in the review.  Alzheimer\u2019s disease afflicts nearly 6 million Americans and millions more worldwide. Biogen estimates about 1.5 million people with early Alzheimer\u2019s in the United States could be candidates for its drug.  Patient advocacy groups have argued that aducanumab needs to be approved due to that large unmet medical need.  \u201cIf a third trial is recommended then years could go by ... while people aren\u2019t granted access to the drug,\u201d said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer at the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation.

Shares in the company rose more than 3%.  The reaction from other scientists attending the meeting, however, was more mixed, with some suggesting the company should do another trial. \u201cIt was a well-curated presentation.

The company has said it plans to file for U.S. approval of the drug early next year.  CRACKING THE CODE  For decades, companies have tried and failed to crack the code of Alzheimer\u2019s. It has been 16 years since the FDA last reviewed an application for a new treatment, and the need for an effective a drug is dire. Wall Street analysts estimate aducanumab could reap $4 billion in annual sales within a few years of approval.  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people in the United States living with Alzheimer\u2019s is expected to triple to 13.8 million by 2050.  Alzheimer\u2019s experts on a panel organized by Biogen, expressed confidence the complicated aducanumab studies showed that the drug was able to slow progression of the disease.  \u201cAll of the data suggests this is a disease modification. That means the impact of the treatment will continue to accrue with time,\u201d said Dr. Paul Aisen, an Alzheimer\u2019s expert from the University of Southern California.  Dr. Ronald Petersen, an Alzheimer\u2019s expert from Mayo Clinic who moderated the panel and has been a paid adviser for Biogen, said while one of the two studies, known as Emerge, was \u201coverwhelmingly positive,\u201d the twin study known as Engage, was not. \u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s more positive than negative,\u201d he said of the results.  Petersen was not too worried about the rates of a brain swelling side effect, known as ARIA-E, which occurred in 35% of patients in the high-dose group.  \u201cThe side effects are there. They\u2019re not zero. They\u2019re to be expected. But I think they\u2019re manageable.\u201d  Others, however, expressed skepticism, noting that the trials were cut short early and even after all the analysis, only one of the two phase 3 studies showed a statistically significant benefit at slowing declines in cognition and daily function using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes, a tool commonly used to gauge dementia severity.  \u201cThis reinforces what I thought before. That we need a third study. The data are encouraging, but there are still questions about whether the drug has a clinical effect,\u201d said Dr. Howard Fillit, chief science officer of the Alzheimer\u2019s Drug Discovery Foundation, who was at the meeting.  Dr. Eric Siemers, a former Alzheimer\u2019s researcher for Eli Lilly and a consultant on drugs for neurodegenerative disease who was not involved with the study, said based on his read of the data he does see a signal the drug is working.  \u201cThe regulators will have a very difficult job. Do you look at the totality of the data, or require more study, which would be years away,\u201d he said.

NHS England did not disclose the price it will pay for the drug.  Biogen confirmed the deal on Tuesday and said it applauded the decision by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to recommend funding for Spinraza in the United Kingdom.  Spinraza, which is administered by spinal injection every four months, has a U.S. list price of $750,000 for the first year and $375,000 annually thereafter.  Britain\u2019s healthcare cost agency, NICE, said in August it could not recommend Spinraza as a cost effective treatment. The rejection came despite a lower British price tag of 450,000 pounds ($573,000) for the first year and Biogen offering an undisclosed discount to the National Health Service.  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality, affecting one in every 10,000 live births. About 60 percent of patients have the most severe Type 1 form of the disease, which often leads to paralysis, impaired breathing and death by the second birthday.  Between 600 and 1,200 children and adults are currently living with the condition in England and Wales, according to NHS England. Spinraza will be made available immediately to Type 1 patients by Biogen, it said.  It said that Spinraza will be made available for other patients - including adults and siblings who have yet to show symptoms - in a few weeks, after NICE publishes guidance.  Spinraza was the first approved treatment for SMA, but is expected to soon face new competition. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to decide on approval for Novartis\u2019 gene therapy Zolgensma this month, with other regulators expected to follow suit later this year.  Novartis says the one-time treatment could be a cure for SMA and is pushing for a price in the range of $1.5 million to $5 million.

FILE PHOTO: A sign marks a Biogen facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. January 26, 2017. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  Assessments by the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) have become increasingly influential in U.S. drug pricing and are taken into consideration by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers making decisions about payments and patient access to treatments.  Boston-based ICER has been looking at Biogen\u2019s Spinraza and Novartis\u2019 Zolgensma since last year. The extremely high cost of new treatments for rare conditions has placed SMA at the center of the drug affordability debate.  In its final report that largely mirrors a draft issued in February, ICER urged the drugmakers to balance innovation with affordability for health systems, which translates to significantly lower prices.  The group said Spinraza\u2019s list price of $750,000 for the initial year and $375,000 annually thereafter needs to be \u201cfar lower\u201d to be cost effective.  Spinraza, an important growth driver for Biogen, took in $1.7 billion in 2018 sales.  To determine value, ICER used a measure known as \u201cquality-adjusted life year\u201d (QALY), in which each year of healthy or near-healthy life resulting from the treatment is worth $100,000 to $150,000.  SMA can lead to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death within months for babies born with the most serious Type I form of the disease. It is the leading genetic cause of death in infants.  Novartis has not set a price for Zolgensma, which could get U.S. approval next month. The Swiss drugmaker has said its one-time treatment would be cost effective at up to $5 million.  Gene therapies use engineered viruses to carry healthy genetic material into a person\u2019s cells to replace faulty or mutated genes that cause a disease or condition.  \u201cThe price for Zolgensma should be lower than the hypothetical $4-$5 million price the manufacturer has suggested could be justified,\u201d ICER concluded.  Using the QALY benchmark, ICER said Spinraza would need to cost between $72,000 and $130,000 for the first year of treatment, and cost $36,000 to $65,000 per year after that, for infants not yet showing symptoms of the disease.  With an alternative benchmark, known as life-year gained (LYG) based on the additional number of years a person lives due to a treatment, Spinraza is worth $83,000 to $145,000 in year one, and $41,000 to $72,000 annually thereafter, ICER determined.  Zolgensma would be worth $310,000 to $900,000 for Type 1 SMA patients based on the QALY assessment, or $710,000 to $1.5 million using the LYG calculation, ICER said.  \u201cThese treatments will be covered by U.S. insurers regardless of the pricing, but the ripple effect of pricing decisions like these threatens the overall affordability and sustainability of the U.S. health system,\u201d said ICER Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Rind.  Novartis contends the rare disease community believes that $500,000 per QALY is a more-appropriate standard for transformational therapies. At that level, Zolgensma would be cost effective at $5 million.  \u201cThe value measures and thresholds employed by ICER in this report are designed around the status quo of chronic care management and cannot possibly capture the full benefits of disease-modifying treatments delivered as a one-time administration,\u201d Novartis said in a statement.  Biogen, in an emailed statement, said Spinraza is the standard of care for SMA and has benefited more than 6,600 people. It noted that Novartis has so far reported Zolgensma results for only 15 patients.  ICER also recommended providers, payers, and manufacturers cooperate on so-called \u201coutcomes-based contracts.\u201d Such arrangements pay drugmakers based on the effectiveness of their treatments or offer refunds if they do not work.","86":"A sign marks a Biogen facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. January 26, 2017.

Zinbryta was approved by U.S. regulators in 2016 with a warning on the packaging due to risks of liver damage, with Biogen selling the self-administered drug in Switzerland, Canada and the EU and AbbVie in the United States.  In November, the European regulator flagged safety concerns about the drug, restricting its usage to reduce the risk of serious liver damage.  The drug, which has been used to treat over 8,000 patients so far, brought in worldwide sales of $107 million last year, with Biogen\u2019s share being $53 million.  Zinbryta became part of the U.S. political debate over high drug costs in September, when Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings asked the government to take action on the drug\u2019s $87,000 price tag.","87":"(Reuters) - A U.S. district court on Thursday ruled in favor of generic drugmaker Mylan NV in a patent dispute over Biogen Inc\u2019s blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, sending Biogen\u2019s shares down nearly 6%.  Tecfidera has been Biogen\u2019s main growth driver since it was launched in 2013, generating sales of $4.43 billion in 2019, accounting for nearly a third of total revenue.  A court in the Northern District of West Virginia ruled Mylan had established that the asserted claims of Biogen\u2019s patent were invalid.  The \u2018514 patent provided exclusivity into 2028 and with another Biogen patent set to expire on Friday, the ruling creates a significant issue for the company to contend with, Wedbush analyst Laura Chico said.  Biogen said it would appeal the ruling. Mylan did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  The patent loss is a major setback and an appeal process could take up to a year, Citi analyst Mohit Bansal said. Biogen would likely seek an emergency order to prevent Mylan from launching its generic version during the time, he added.  Adding to investor concerns is Biogen\u2019s recent decision to delay seeking approval for its Alzheimer\u2019s drug. Development of the potential blockbuster has faced many hurdles.  Biogen late last year revived plans to pursue an approval for the Alzheimer\u2019s drug, aducanumab, months after deciding to scrap its trials.  Mylan\u2019s shares were up 3.9% at $16.58, while Biogen was down 5.9% at $264.97.","88":"NEW YORK\/ZURICH (Reuters) - Biogen Inc\u2019s Spinraza treatment for spinal muscular atrophy and Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG\u2019s experimental gene therapy are both expensive, but the gene therapy could be more cost effective once more is known about its U.S. price and long-term success rates, a preliminary report from an independent U.S. nonprofit organization said on Thursday.  Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), whose assessments of the value of new medicines are increasingly influential in U.S. drug price negotiations, calculated a measure known as \u201cquality-adjusted life year\u201d to evaluate the drugs.  The findings may be revised based on comments from the drugmakers, health plans and patients before a final assessment in late February.  While there are questions about the long-term effectiveness of the treatments, both provide substantial clinical benefit, ICER said.  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare disease that can lead to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death. Spinraza, introduced two years ago, is the only U.S.-approved treatment for the condition and one of the most expensive drugs on the market, costing $750,000 for the first year of use and $375,000 annually thereafter. It has been shown to slow progression of the disease for some patients but is not a cure.  ICER\u2019s preliminary estimate is that Spinraza represents a cost of $728,000 per quality-adjusted life year, or year of healthy or near healthy life, for patients who are diagnosed before they exhibit symptoms.  \u201cThat is expensive by the way most people value things,\u201d said ICER\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. David Rind.  A Biogen spokeswoman said the draft report is \u201can incomplete representation of Spinraza\u2019s value to patients and healthcare systems.\u201d She also said that it was misleading and wrong to compare its treatment of nearly 6,000 patients with the gene therapy treatment group of only 15 patients.  Novartis aims to provide a cure with its gene therapy, which is to be called Zolgensma and is expected to receive U.S. approval in the first half of 2019. The drugmaker says the therapy\u2019s price will eventually be determined in negotiations with health plans but believes that it would be cost-effective at $4 million to $5 million as a one-time treatment.  ICER said it used a much lower benchmark - $2 million \u2013 as an estimated price for the gene therapy. On that basis, when used in patients with symptomatic Type I SMA, it said the Novartis therapy represents a cost of $240,000 per quality- adjusted life year.  Generally, treatments that cost between $100,000 to $150,000 per QALY are considered a good value, though that can stretch higher for rare diseases, Rind said.  Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said Novartis would like the drugs to be compared against an ultra-rare threshold of $500,000 per QALY and against Spinraza. \u201cWhile a range of QALY thresholds were used, we believe cost-effectiveness assessments in SMA should be compared to currently available, chronic therapy and be assessed at the ultra-rare disease QALY threshold,\u201d he said.  Some payers are already pushing back well before the Novartis therapy reaches the market. Express Scripts told Reuters last month that Novartis\u2019s estimate for the value of the gene therapy would be unsustainable.","89":"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc BIIB.O raised its 2020 earnings forecast on Wednesday after better-than-expected sales of its multiple sclerosis treatment Tecfidera helped the drugmaker beat second-quarter profit estimates.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The companies have been trying to put to rest concerns about trial results of the drug, BAN2401, which in July showed that patients in early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s experienced 30 percent less cognitive decline after 18 months of treatment than those on a placebo.  Those results were muddied by concerns that the data was tainted by a decision from European regulators to remove patients with an Alzheimer\u2019s genetic mutation called APOE4 from the trial group that received the highest dose, potentially lowering the bar for success.  \u201cI think that the data is promising and intriguing but continues to beg more questions that we don\u2019t have all the answers for,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee told Reuters, adding that the drug needs a much larger study to confirm any benefit.  There is a desperate need for an Alzheimer\u2019s treatment that works after dozens of failures of experimental drugs. The most common form of dementia affects nearly 50 million people worldwide and is expected to rise to more than 131 million by 2050, according to Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International.  Eisai scientists who presented the data at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease conference in Barcelona stressed that patients with the APOE4 mutation who completed 18 months of treatment at the highest dose experienced 63 percent less cognitive decline than the placebo group, while non-carriers did only 7 percent better than placebo.  Dr. Jeffrey Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic, a consultant to the companies and an Alzheimer\u2019s expert, said on Thursday the APOE4 genotype had \u201cvery little effect on the rate of decline,\u201d suggesting that it was not a factor in the results.  But other experts pointed out that because of those who were removed from the study, the data included only 10 patients with the APOE4 mutation who received the highest dose.  And when the highest and second-highest dose groups were combined, the overall 30 percent reduction in cognitive decline shrank to 21 percent, skewed by APOE4 carriers who had a 25 percent benefit versus only a 6 percent benefit in those who did not carry the mutation.  Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges called the data unconvincing and confusing. He said the small number of patients remaining on the drug after 18 months and a lack of clear dose responses diminish the reliability of Thursday\u2019s data.  \u201cYou have to be careful with small numbers,\u201d Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, said in a telephone interview.

Experts see Zolgensma becoming the treatment of choice for newborn patients who test positive for SMA, because gene therapy may offer infants yet to exhibit symptoms hope for normal development.  Risdiplam, seen by analysts as topping $1 billion in annual sales, and Spinraza, already a roughly $2 billion per year seller, are seen competing for older patients. Oral, daily risdiplam may be less complicated, given Spinraza is given every four months via an infusion in the spine.  Zolgensma is also being tested in older patients with a spinal infusion, though the trial has been halted due to safety concerns. Novartis is awaiting the FDA\u2019s go-ahead to restart.  Novartis also is developing an oral drug, branaplam, though its chief researcher, Jay Bradner, in December indicated the company had cooled to the medicine, saying he did not \u201csee a big opportunity for oral therapy there, or we would develop this molecule further\u201d.  Novartis has since clarified its stance, saying its trial of branaplam would continue, with a decision to be made after the study produces data later this year.","107":"June 2 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc:  * BIOGEN INC - DIRECTOR LYNN SCHENK WILL RETIRE FROM BOARD AT END OF HER CURRENT TERM Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","108":"(Reuters) - Biogen Inc on Wednesday forecast full-year adjusted profit below Wall Street estimates as it expects a sharp drop in sales of its multiple sclerosis treatment to counter any benefit from a potential approval of its Alzheimer\u2019s drug.

Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said while the company remains optimistic, investors will closely watch for the opinion of a panel of independent experts to assess the drug that the FDA usually convenes.  Aducanumab belongs to a class of drugs that have seen multiple trial failures and its approval remains doubtful as some experts have called for an additional trial to demonstrate its clinical benefits.  Biogen\u2019s growth has been driven by its multiple sclerosis drugs, which grew in the fourth quarter, helping it beat profit expectations.  Tecfidera brought sales of $1.16 billion, beating estimates of $1.12 billion, despite the threat of patent challenges and increasing competition.

Biogen fell 2 percent to $294.71 in early trading.  Results of the highly anticipated mid-stage trial, presented in July, showed that patients in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s treated with the highest dose of the drug, BAN2401, experienced 30 percent less cognitive decline than those on a placebo.  However, the results were muddied by concerns that the finding may have been skewed by a decision of European regulators to remove patients with an Alzheimer\u2019s genetic mutation called APOE4 from the group that got the highest dose, potentially lowering the bar for success in the group.  \u201cI think that the data is promising and intriguing but continues to beg more questions that we don\u2019t have all the answers for,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee told Reuters, adding that the drug needs a much larger study to confirm any benefit.  Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said the data was unconvincing and confusing, suggesting only limited value for the drug in the population with APOE4.  The small number of patients remaining on the drug after 18 months and a lack of clear dose responses diminish the reliability of Thursday\u2019s dataset, Porges added.  The findings, in which the company offered a further analysis of data earlier presented in July, may not be able to fully dampen concerns.  \u201cIt\u2019s still an early study. They have to do further testing,\u201d said Laurie Ryan, chief of the Dementias of Aging Branch at the National Institute on Aging, who is at the meeting in Barcelona, where the data was presented on Thursday.  Ryan said the presentation supported the initial argument of a positive signal in an early phase study, and offered data suggesting the imbalance in patients with APOE4 may not have had an impact.  \u201cClearly, that still needs to be tested.

FILE PHOTO: Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) made the determination using a commonly cited cost-effectiveness threshold that values each \u201cquality-adjusted life year\u201d (QALY) gained at $100,000 to $150,000.  If each QALY gained were assessed at $500,000, ICER found the gene therapy, Zolgensma, would be cost effective at just over $5 million.  Novartis has said the price will be determined in negotiations with health plans, but it believes the gene therapy would be cost effective at $4 million to $5 million as a one-time treatment.  The company said in an emailed statement on Friday that \u201cboth the rare disease community and various governmental bodies\u201d suggest that $500,000 per QALY \u201cis the appropriate standard to protect vulnerable populations and allow access to innovative, transformational therapies.\u201d  SMA can lead to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death. It is the leading genetic cause of death in infants.  Gene therapies use engineered viruses to carry healthy genetic material into a person\u2019s cells to replace faulty or mutated genes that cause a disease or condition.  ICER also found that Spinraza, Biogen Inc\u2019s SMA treatment would require a substantial price decrease to be considered cost effective. Spinraza\u2019s current list price is $750,000 for the initial year and $375,000 per year thereafter.  Biogen noted that Zolgensma is experimental and has reported data for only 15 patients, compared with Spinraza\u2019s track record of use by more than 6,600 patients. Spinraza is considered by Wall Street to be one of Biogen\u2019s most important growth drivers.  \u201cThe promise of gene therapy in general is that it would be once and done ... but that is uncertain at this point,\u201d Biogen Chief Medical Officer Alfred Sandrock told Reuters.  \u201cSpinraza is still a very viable option for babies with SMA. For children, teenagers and adults it may be the only option open to them,\u201d Sandrock said.  Spinraza was approved in 2016 to treat SMA in children and adults.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide sometime in May whether to approve Zolgensma, which has been studied in infants with SMA.  ICER\u2019s assessments have become increasingly influential in U.S. drug price negotiations and are taken into consideration by insurers making decisions about patient access to treatments.  Using an alternate measure known as \u201clife years gained\u201d (LYG), ICER found the Novartis gene therapy cost effective at a price as high as $1.5 million.  ICER found that Spinraza, when used for patients who do not yet show symptoms, would have value at up to $130,000 for the first year and $65,000 for each successive year. Based on the LYG measurement, the price could be as high as $82,000 during the initial year and $41,000 per year thereafter, according to the ICER report.

Without potential future revenue from Alzheimer\u2019s, Biogen has poor growth prospects as it faces patent issues over its big-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera and possible competition to spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza, Wall Street analysts said.  \u201cWe view this as a transformative failure for Biogen\u2019s pipeline,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a research note.  Abrahams, who reduced his Biogen price target to $240 per share, said further declines were likely given that \u201cinvestors owned Biogen to not miss out on what could have been one of the biggest blockbuster products in the pipeline of large biopharma.\u201d  Any successful treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s, which affects about 5.7 million Americans, is virtually guaranteed to become one of the world\u2019s top-selling drugs. Even so, experimental treatments have had a dismal track record, with more than 100 failures.  The two halted trials were in the final stages of testing aducanumab in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer\u2019s and mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia. Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting.  \u201cThis disappointing news confirms the complexity of treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the need to further advance knowledge in neuroscience,\u201d Biogen Chief Executive Officer Michel Vounatsos said.  Both Eisai and Biogen said they would continue to work on other Alzheimer\u2019s treatments.  Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said Biogen instead should start looking at merger and acquisition opportunities in treatments that target the central nervous system.  \u201cThey need to stop wasting or stop investing money in Alzheimer\u2019s now,\u201d Suneja said.  Suneja said Biogen has about $42 billion in financing capacity and should start looking at other companies in the space such as Sage Therapeutics Inc, GW Pharmaceuticals and Zogenix Inc.  \u201cThose are very, very interesting companies that should be considered now, more seriously.\u201d  Major drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Co, AstraZeneca Plc, Roche Holding AG, Pfizer Inc , Merck & Co, and Johnson & Johnson, have all abandoned Alzheimer\u2019s drugs over lack of efficacy or safety issues.  Scientists have long believed that to be effective, Alzheimer\u2019s drugs must be tested very early, before the disease begins destroying key parts of the brain.  Many companies are pursuing alternative theories for attacking Alzheimer\u2019s, such as focusing on tau, another Alzheimer\u2019s-linked protein, or on inflammation, which is believed to play a role in the very early formation of the disease.

They questioned the FDA\u2019s stance that an early-stage trial of the drug was supportive enough to offset the failure of the second pivotal trial.  Five panel members did vote \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether aducanumab has an effect on levels of amyloid plaque in the brains of people diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s, but six voted \u201cuncertain\u201d on the question.

The advisory committee on Friday also heard testimony from a number of people suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s, including several who said they had benefited from aducanumab while enrolled in trials of the drug, adding pressure on the agency to approve it.  \u201cWe know firsthand that it was helping Kevin,\u201d said Kim Bonham, speaking of her husband, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 2016.  Biogen in October last year revived its plans to seek approval for aducanumab, months after it had said that an independent futility analysis of its two pivotal trials showed they were unlikely to succeed.  The company said it changed course after a new analysis showed a high dose of the drug could slow disease progression.  The FDA staff earlier this week said data from one of the trials \u201cprovides the primary evidence of effectiveness\u201d and a clinically meaningful treatment effect.

Roche, which plans to seek approval for the investigational medicine this year, said its SUNFISH trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in patients aged 2-25 years with Type 2 or 3 SMA.  Specifically, the study met its primary endpoint of change from baseline in the Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) scale after one year of treatment with risdiplam, compared to placebo, the company said.  Risdiplam is a survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2) splicing modifier, designed to increase SMN protein levels in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues.  Spinal muscular atrophy, which hits 1 in every 10-11,000 newborns, has been a target of significant interest as drugmakers move into a rare disease area that commands ultra-high prices. Biogen\u2019s Spinraza, approved in 2016, lists at $750,000 in year one and $375,000 thereafter, while Novartis\u2019s Zolgensma, approved for use in babies and toddlers, is the costliest one-time treatment at $2.1 million.  Roche\u2019s risdiplam, which would be the third treatment to market, is taken by mouth, as opposed to injected into the spine like Spinraza. Roche is also hoping data from its studies stacks up to that of Zolgensma, including in older SMA patients with forms of the disease that may emerge months after their birth but leave them with profound disabilities.  In its statement, Roche underscored the safety profile of risdiplam just weeks after Novartis\u2019s trial of Zolgensma in a similar population of SMA patients was halted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration when primate study raised concerns of possible nerve damage or loss.  \u201cNo treatment related safety findings leading to study withdrawal have been seen in any risdiplam trial to date,\u201d Roche said, adding it would release specific data from the SUNFISH trial at an upcoming medical conference.  Roche has partnered on risdiplam with PTC Therapeutics.","135":"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Biogen Inc's BIIB.O quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates on Tuesday as it had disappointing sales of its promising drug Spinraza to treat spinal muscular atrophy because fewer new patients used the expensive treatment.  Biogen shares fell in early trade after sales of Spinraza as well as its flagship drug, Tecfidera, were weaker than expected, underscoring investor concerns about the company\u2019s drug development prospects. But shares pared losses and were up 0.6 percent at $260.94 in midday trade.  The company has been banking on Spinraza\u2019s success to prop up slowing growth of its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, which is facing increasing competition.  Spinraza, the first Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, had quarterly revenue of $364 million, short of analysts\u2019 estimates of $381.55 million, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The miss was partly due to lower uptake in the United States and more patients moving to a lower-priced maintenance dose from an induction dose, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee told Reuters.  In the U.S. about 40 percent of Spinraza revenue in the first quarter was from maintenance doses compared with 25 percent in the fourth quarter, Biogen said, noting early adoption was largely from a big influx of new patients.  The number of patients receiving Spinraza grew 16 percent in the U.S. from the preceding quarter and Biogen said it would focus on reaching more adults, the largest group of patients afflicted with the disease in the United States.  \u201cWe believe that the international opportunity for Spinraza is even greater than in the U.S.,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Capello said on a conference call.

However, looming competition from treatments such as Novartis AG\u2019s Zolgensma and Roche\u2019s risdiplam is expected to weigh on the long-term prospects for Spinraza.  Sales of Biogen\u2019s top-selling multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera came in at $999 million in the quarter, but narrowly missed consensus estimates.  The drug is facing patent challenges and losing market share to newer treatments like Roche\u2019s Ocrevus, which is expected to outpace Tecfidera sales by 2021, according to Refinitiv.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said it agreed with a March 2017 ruling by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board that freed Biogen BIIB.O from future royalty payments to Forward.  Forward said in a statement it was disappointed with the ruling and considering its options. Biogen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The companies had been locked in a dispute over patents for dimethyl fumarate, the key active ingredient in Tecfidera, the leading oral MS treatment. Tecfidera had sales of about $4.2 billion in 2017.  Biogen\u2019s Tecfidera exclusivity in the United States is secured through 2028 under the ruling.  In January 2017, Biogen took out an insurance policy against a potential defeat in the patent dispute, agreeing to pay Forward $1.25 billion to license the company\u2019s patents covering MS drugs and gain a share of Forward\u2019s intellectual property.  The 2017 agreement would have allowed Forward to receive additional royalty payments if it had won the Federal Circuit appeal.","147":"ZURICH, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Roche expects its risdiplam medicine for spinal muscular atrophy to get U.S. approval by next May, the Swiss drugmaker said on Monday, as it takes on Novartis and Biogen in the lucrative rare disease area.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted priority review for risdiplam, an oral medicine for those suffering from the potentially deadly muscle-wasting disorder. Roche, whose drug is seen as a potential rival for Biogen\u2019s Spinraza and Novartis\u2019s Zolgensma gene therapy, said the FDA is due to make its decision by May 24.
