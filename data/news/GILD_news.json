VIRTUAL-ONLY FORMAT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","3":"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis\u2019s Kymriah cell therapy won the blessing of health authorities in England for adult lymphoma patients, the Swiss drugmaker said on Friday, reversing last year\u2019s rejection.  FILE PHOTO: Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  The list price is 282,000 pounds ($369,000) per patient, given as a single intravenous infusion, but Novartis agreed to offer the therapy for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) at a confidential discounted price, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said.  NICE had turned down a previous proposal from Novartis in September, saying it exceeded the level considered an acceptable use of resources.  \u201cToday\u2019s positive announcement regarding access to Kymriah treatment in England and Wales was secured as a result of our close working collaboration with NICE and NHS England, with all parties showing flexibility,\u201d Novartis said.  DLBCL patients eligible for Kymriah have life expectancies of just months, after failing previous treatments.  Novartis expects Kymriah to eventually top $1 billion in annual sales, though the drug has started modestly with $76 million in 2018. Over 2019, the company expects to increase commercial and clinical capacity for Kymriah four-fold after buying more production facilities and deals with partners.  The Swiss firm hopes expanding its treatment geography will narrow the sales gap with Gilead Sciences\u2019 Yescarta, which reaped $183 million in the first nine months of 2018.  Novartis already has NICE\u2019s go-ahead for children and young people with aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when other drugs have failed.  The Basel-based company now has 26 treatment centers in the European Union and Kymriah is now commercially available to patients from 10 countries, it said.  Kymriah belongs to a new class of treatments, like Yescarta, called CAR-T therapies where disease-fighting T cells are removed from a patient and genetically modified to better recognize and attack cancer.  They are then re-infused into the same patient where they can circulate for years to seek out and fight the disease.  Novartis is also working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to resolve a snag in which some batches of Kymriah did not meet commercial specifications, forcing the company to give it away for free to some patients.  \u201cWe expect resolution ... soon,\u201d a spokeswoman said.","4":"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s appeal of a ruling that allowed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging it defrauded the government into paying for HIV medications whose main ingredient came from an unregistered Chinese facility to move forward.  Gilead had asked the high court to review a July 2018 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals holding that the two former Gilead employees who filed the lawsuit had raised a plausible claim under the False Claims Act, allowing the litigation to proceed.

Remdesivir has been at the forefront of the global battle against COVID-19 after the intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times, according to data in April from a separate U.S. government trial. That study showed a trend toward better survival for remdesivir but the difference was not statistically significant.  In the latest analysis, Gilead said it analyzed data from 312 patients treated in its late-stage study and a separate real-world retrospective cohort of 818 patients with similar characteristics and disease severity.  Gilead\u2019s late-stage study evaluated the safety and efficacy of five-day and 10-day dosing durations of remdesivir in hospitalized patients. The study did not have a placebo comparison.  Dr. Susan Olender from Columbia University Irving Medical Center said in the Gilead statement that the analysis draws from a real-world setting and serves as an important adjunct to clinical trial data even as it is not as vigorous as a randomized controlled trial.  However, Dr. Walid Gellad, a professor at University of Pittsburgh\u2019s medical school, called it \u201ca joke\u201d to compare clinical trial data with observational data and conclude anything definitive about mortality.  \u201cThe mortality in the remdesivir trials has generally been lower for both control and intervention groups than other trials and other real world cohorts I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Gellad said in an email.  \u201cThe real world patients are taken care of at different hospitals than those in the trial and potentially different adjunct treatments. They\u2019re different.\u201d  Findings from the analysis showed that 74.4% of remdesivir-treated patients recovered by Day 14 versus 59.0% of patients receiving standard of care, the company said.  The mortality rate for patients treated with remdesivir in the analysis was 7.6% at Day 14, compared with 12.5% among patients not on remdesivir.  The U.S. government trial in April showed that patients given remdesivir recovered 31% faster than those given a placebo.  Gilead\u2019s shares rose 2% to $76.27 in afternoon trading.","6":"(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline said an injection every other month of its cabotegravir drug was shown to avert an HIV infection more effectively than Gilead\u2019s daily Truvada pill, potentially giving its ViiV unit a foothold in HIV prevention.  FILE PHOTO: General view outside GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) headquarters in Brentford, following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), London, Britain, May 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Matthew Childs  The drug trial involving men who have sex with men was stopped early by an independent monitoring board after cabotegravir was found to be 69% more effective than the current standard of care, Truvada, the British drugmaker said on Monday.  But the market segment GSK is eyeing is about to become more competitive as cheaper generic versions of Truvada are expected to be launched in the United States in September, as the patent expires.  Gilead, for its part, hopes that Truvada users will opt against the cheaper copies and switch to its new daily pill Descovy, approved in October 2019 after it was shown to be less toxic to the kidneys and bones.  Truvada generated $2.8 billion in sales last year, both from treatment and preventing an HIV infection.  Kimberly Smith, ViiV\u2019s head of research, said a long-acting injection was a better route of administer because users have shown to struggle with a strict routine of daily pills, heightening the infection risk.  \u201cIndividuals have to show up every eight weeks in the clinic for the injection but in-between there is not a need to take a pill daily, so you really change the equation for adherence with a long acting (drug),\u201d Smith said.  GSK, which is trailing Gilead in the HIV treatment market, will speak to drug regulators about a possible approval of cabotegravir based on the prevention trial, a spokesman said.  Its shares were up 1.25% at 1120 GMT, outperforming a 0.8% gain in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care  Prevention \u201chas turned into a multi-billion opportunity for Gilead but we think consensus estimates include little or nothing for GSK in this market,\u201d UBS analysts said in a research note.  GSK has won approval in Canada for cabotegravir as one of two key ingredients in long-acting HIV treatment combination Cabenuva, whereas in the United States, the company has run into delays seeking the go-ahead for Cabenuva.  An initial readout from the trial, which started in late 2016, was previously not expected before next year.  A similar trial to test the cabotegravir injection to prevent HIV in women, is still ongoing.

It said its push for two-drug regimens addressed long-term toxicity concerns of people living with HIV by reducing the number of medicines.  Rival Gilead Sciences in February won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for Biktarvy, a triple-combination HIV treatment, paving the way for the biotech company to capture more of the multibillion-dollar HIV drug market.  Thursday\u2019s results should help GSK defend its dolutegravir-based business against competition from Biktarvy, said Jefferies analyst Ian Hilliker, who forecast peak year sales of $1.5 billion for the dolutegravir\/ lamivudine combination.  The shares were up 2 percent at 1200 GMT, also bolstered by further delays in Mylan\u2019s quest to bring a generic version of GSK\u2019s blockbuster inhaled lung drug Advair to market.  Jefferies\u2019s Hilliker said that GSK\u2019s dolutegravir\/ lamivudine cocktail would likely have an edge over another two-drug combination by GSK known as Juluca, which won approval in Europe and the United States over the last six months.  \u201cKey opinion leaders we have spoken to see the dolutegravir\/ lamivudine combination as a more attractive initial therapy or switch strategy as lamivudine has a very good toxicity profile and generic versions are available, which should reduce cost,\u201d the analyst said.

The justices declined to take up Merck\u2019s appeal of a lower court\u2019s ruling that overturned the massive damages verdict after finding that Merck\u2019s patent was invalid.  The case concerns a new generation of highly effective drugs for hepatitis C, a viral infection that can cause serious liver damage, able to cure more than 90% of patients, with few side effects.  New Jersey-based Merck\u2019s Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2013 accused California-based Gilead of infringing its patent on a family of compounds with the same basic chemical structure that is effective against the hepatitis C virus.  After a federal court trial in 2016, a jury sided with Idenix, awarding $2.54 billion for Gilead\u2019s infringement with its drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized patent court, invalidated the patent in 2019 after determining that its claims on the family of compounds were overly broad, in violation of U.S. patent law.  In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Merck said that the Federal Circuit\u2019s ruling undermined biotechnology breakthroughs in which discoveries often begin with a family of compounds that share a particular property.  A group of intellectual property scholars backed Merck in a written brief, telling the justices that the Federal Circuit ruling made it \u201cunreasonably difficult for a pharmaceutical company that comes up with an innovative new class of drugs to protect that class against imitation.

At least three brokerages downgraded Gilead on Friday after its earnings report.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Brain Abrahams said Gilead\u2019s management remained vague on their plans to recoup the production, distribution, and trial costs for the treatment, citing a balance between access and sustainability.

Gilead\u2019s second-quarter sales fell nearly 10% from a year earlier to $5.1 billion, short of the average analyst estimate of $5.3 billion, according to Refinitiv.  The results reflected weak sales of Gilead\u2019s hepatitis C drugs and flagship HIV treatments during coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. The company said it expects its HIV drugs and hepatitis C sales to begin regaining momentum in the current third quarter.  Adjusted earnings for the second quarter of $1.11 per share fell short of analysts\u2019 average estimate by 34 cents.  Shares of Gilead, which closed up about 1% in regular trading, were down 3.5% at $69.80 in extended trading.  Second-quarter sales of Gilead\u2019s HIV drugs fell 1% from a year earlier to $4 billion, while sales of drugs to cure hepatitis C fell 47% to $448 million due to fewer new patients and competition from rival drugs.  Gilead this month began commercial sales of remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients by infusion. The drug was granted emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May after it demonstrated an ability to shorten hospital stays for COVID-19 patients, but does not yet have full U.S. approval. It was approved in Japan.  Demand for remdesivir continues to outstrip supply in many parts of the world.  Gilead\u2019s chief executive, Daniel O\u2019Day, on a conference call, said the company expects by the end of September to be producing enough remdesivir to meet real-time global demand.  Gilead said it still expects to manufacturer 2 million or more remdesivir treatment courses cumulatively in 2020, and its revenue outlook reflects expected sales of up to 1.5 million courses this year.  The company said it has launched a clinical trial of an inhaled formulation of remdesivir, with the aim of more effectively delivering the drug to lung tissue. Gilead also plans to study the drug in patients with earlier-stage COVID-19.  The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is currently conducting a trial of remdesivir in combination with Olumiant, an arthritis drug from Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N, and those results are expected next month.  So far, only remdesivir and the generic steroid dexamethasone have been shown in rigorous clinical trials to help patients with COVID-19.","41":"Dec 9 (Reuters) - Drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc will name Roche Holding AG executive Daniel O\u2019Day as its new chief executive officer, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The data detailed in the journal is similar to early results that the NIH released last month from the study, which began in February with 1,063 participants in 10 countries.  Researchers now calculate that after follow up, 7% of patients given remdesivir will have died, compared with 12% in the placebo group, but they said the difference in the death rate was not significant.  \u201cOur findings highlight the need to identify COVID-19 cases and start antiviral treatment before the pulmonary disease progresses to require mechanical ventilation,\u201d the researchers wrote.  They noted that \u201cgiven high mortality despite the use of remdesivir,\u201d it is likely that the antiviral drug would be more effective in combination with other treatments for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.  Gilead said it expects results from its own study of remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19 at the end of this month.  \u201cWe look forward to the initiation of combination studies of remdesivir to understand whether the addition of other drugs may enhance patient outcomes,\u201d Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said in a statement.

FILE PHOTO: An ampule of Ebola drug remdesivir is pictured during a news conference at the University Hospital Eppendorf (UKE) in Hamburg, Germany, April 8, 2020, as the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues. Ulrich Perrey\/File Photo  Preliminary findings from the randomized trial of the antiviral drug remdesivir, begun in February by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), could come even sooner, lead researcher Dr. Andre Kalil told Reuters in an interview. There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new virus that has killed over 190,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally.  Remdesivir has drawn tremendous attention as a therapy with the potential to alter the course of the disease, based on anecdotal reports that it may have helped some patients.  Those hopes were dampened somewhat on Thursday, when details from a Chinese remdesivir trial in patients with severe COVID-19 inadvertently released by the World Health Organization suggested it provided no benefit.  Gilead pushed back on that interpretation saying the study, which was stopped early due to low patient enrollment, cannot provide meaningful conclusions.  Other reports have provided reason for optimism.  Doctors at Houston Methodist Hospital told Reuters that since March 23, they have treated 41 mostly severely ill COVID-19 patients with the drug. None have died and half are back home. But they and other doctors contacted by Reuters said they need much more information than the few details available from the Chinese trial and anecdotal reports on its emergency use in the United States to form a view on remdesivir.  They emphasized a need to see how patients on remdesivir fare compared to those who do not receive the therapy in a rigorous clinical trial at different stages of illness to know whether and under what circumstances it may provide benefit.  The NIAID trial \u201chas all the necessary scientific standards that are really going to help us define if this drug works or not,\u201d said Dr. Kalil, a professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. It is a randomized, double-blind study in which half the patients were given the drug and the other half a placebo. Enrollment in the trial closed on Sunday, but has far exceeded initial goals of 400 to 500 patients, he said. The investigator would not disclose total enrollment, but the latest public update says trial size may exceed 800 patients. The NIAID trial is designed to show whether remdesivir, when given to patients with a range of disease severity, improves outcomes such as length of hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation and survival. Dr. Kalil declined to comment on precisely how much of an improvement on those metrics is needed to deem the trial a success and the drug a viable treatment. \u201cWe are looking for not only a statistical difference, but also for a meaningful clinical improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect to have results sometime from mid- to late May.\u201d  Gilead on Thursday said it expected results from the NIAID trial in late May. The company\u2019s shares, up more than 20% so far this year due largely to remdesivir prospects, were 1.7% higher at $79.10 on Friday.  A lack of hard evidence has given U.S. medical associations, as well as the National Institutes of Health, pause. They have not recommended remdesivir to treat COVID-19.  The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), which represents more than 12,000 U.S. specialists, said it will make a formal recommendation once the entire body of evidence for remdesivir is available.  Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who helped draft the IDSA guidelines, explained that most patients with COVID-19 will recover with little or no medical care. He is awaiting more clinical trial data before remdesivir can be deemed a useful therapy. EARLY INTERVENTION?  In general, doctors say they would expect remdesivir to work better if given early in the course of the disease. The drug, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to keep a virus from replicating in the body and overwhelming a patient\u2019s immune system.  \u201cYou can put out a campfire, but once it becomes a wildfire it\u2019s hard to control,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Grimes, an infectious disease specialist at Houston Methodist, which is participating in Gilead studies.  Gilead is leading its own trials of remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients as an intravenous infusion: One in patients with severe disease and the other in patients with more moderate symptoms.  The company expanded the number of patients it would enroll in the severe disease trial to 6,000 from 2,400, and expects results at the end of April. But that study does not compare remdesivir to another treatment or placebo.  The medical news website STAT last week reported that nearly all participants in Gilead-sponsored studies at a University of Chicago hospital saw rapid recoveries in fever and respiratory symptoms, and many were discharged in less than a week.

CMS, which runs Medicare - the federal government\u2019s health plan for Americans 65 and older - said it will cover the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies when provided in healthcare facilities that have programs in place to track patient outcomes.  The nationwide decision clears up \u201ca lot of confusion\u201d about coverage and will help patients get access to the novel therapies, known as CAR-T, CMS Administrator Seema Verma said during a conference call with reporters on Wednesday.  The decision follows the agency\u2019s finalization last week of a proposal to raise its maximum CAR-T payment to 65% of estimated costs from 50%. Some hospitals will also be eligible for supplemental payments in certain cases.  Both Gilead\u2019s Yescarta and Novartis\u2019 Kymriah were approved in 2017 for certain kinds of lymphoma and leukemia. But government and private health plans have balked at their high price of at least $373,000 for a one-time treatment before hospital costs, which can bring the bill for a single patient to over a million dollars.  More than half of lymphoma patients eligible for CAR-T therapy are estimated to be covered by Medicare.  The agency said it will also cover the CAR-Ts for uses not approved in their labels, as long as they are recommended by CMS-approved medical guidelines.  The novel treatments remove a type of immune system cells from each individual patient and re-engineer them to better fight certain blood cancers, keeping nearly 40% of patients alive for more than two years, according to some studies.","54":"FILE PHOTO: Gilead Sciences Inc pharmaceutical company is seen after they announced a Phase 3 Trial of the investigational antiviral drug Remdesivir in patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19), during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Oceanside, California, U.S., April 29, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said on Wednesday it has started an early-stage study of its antiviral COVID-19 treatment remdesivir that can be inhaled, for use outside of hospitals.

Remdesivir was granted emergency use authorization in the United States to treat severe cases of COVID-19 in patients who are hospitalized.  Gilead is hoping to target the disease at the onset with the inhaled form of remdesivir, by delivering the drug directly to the primary site of infection.  Remdesivir is believed to be at the forefront in the fight against the coronavirus after the drug helped shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial.

Shares of the California-based company closed down nearly 6% at $69.66.  The company was criticized by lawmakers and patient advocates after receiving the orphan designation on Monday for the experimental antiviral drug, saying it was taking advantage of the rapidly accelerating health crisis.  The drug, which previously failed as an Ebola treatment, is being tried on COVID-19 patients. It has been described by U.S. President Donald Trump and health officials as one of the more promising candidates to fight the virus.  Orphan status is granted by the FDA to encourage development of drugs for rare conditions. The designation comes with a seven-year marketing exclusivity period if the drug is approved, and other benefits such as potentially faster approvals.  Rare disease treatments typically cost more than other drugs, allowing drugmakers to recoup development costs and make a profit while serving relatively small patient populations.  The FDA said there have previously been four approved orphan drugs that had the designation withdrawn by their sponsor.  Patients groups and activists criticized Gilead for applying for the status and the FDA for granting it.  Senator Bernie Sanders said on Tuesday the company was profiteering and asked the FDA to rescind the designation.  Gilead said it originally sought orphan status to expedite remdesivir\u2019s approval timeline.  It said on Wednesday that regulatory agencies have been moving quickly and it was now confident of maintaining a faster timeline for review of remdesivir without orphan status.  Advocacy group Public Citizen said on Wednesday it was outrageous that Gilead had sought the designation given that the patient population in the United States could reach into the millions. There are currently more than 60,000 known U.S. cases.  Drugmakers and medical researchers are stepping up their efforts to battle the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected some 460,000 people worldwide and killed over 20,0000.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  Drug patents in India are an important issue as many countries depend on generic drugmakers to make and sell cheaper versions of critical drugs to them. Gilead\u2019s three patents in India for remdesivir stem from 2009 when the drug was in development to treat Ebola.  Remdesivir is the only drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients after promising early trial results prompted U.S. regulators to grant emergency use authorisation on May 2.  To expand its access, Gilead said this week it had signed non-exclusive licensing pacts here with five generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan, allowing them to make and sell remdesivir for 127 countries.  But health access groups say the pacts mean cheaper forms of the drug may not become available in nations seen as non-profitable to the five drugmakers.  \u201cThe licenses divide the global market into two and profitable markets are retained with Gilead and less profitable markets are given to the five generic companies,\u201d said K. Gopakumar, senior legal researcher at Third World Network, which sent a letter to the Indian government on Wednesday.  The letter by Third World Network, a Malaysia-based non-profit group, followed a similar appeal by India\u2019s Cancer Patients Aid Association last week.  The aid group Doctors Without Borders has also opposed Gilead\u2019s patents on remdesivir, saying such licensing pacts are \u201cnot acceptable\u201d amid a global health emergency.  Gilead\u2019s patents on remdesivir in India allow it to exclusively make and sell the drug in the country until 2035 unless it licenses those rights out.  A Gilead spokeswoman told Reuters in an email that the company is \u201cactively considering every potential pathway\u201d to make the drug available to those who need it as fast as possible.  She said the company was in talks with the U.N.-backed Medicines Patent Pool and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund to expand access to it.  \u201cCompulsory licensing will not solve the challenge of limited supply,\u201d the spokeswoman said, referring to a provision under which countries can allow manufacturers to make certain drugs without the patent owner\u2019s consent.  India\u2019s commerce and health ministries did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  India\u2019s Cancer Patients Aid Association said it might pursue legal action, noting that cancer patients have compromised immunity and are highly susceptible to the virus.  \u201cIt is imperative at a time like this that no monopoly rights be granted, so that more manufacturers can produce the drug to be made available to all the people who need it, at affordable costs,\u201d it said.  Except for remdesivir, there are currently no other drugs or vaccines approved to fight coronavirus, which has killed more than 200,000 people globally.","78":"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking full approval for remdesivir, its experimental COVID-19 drug currently used under emergency authorization, the drugmaker said on Monday.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The antiviral drug, which helped shorten the hospital recovery time in a U.S. trial, has been at the forefront of the battle against the pandemic after the FDA granted it emergency use authorization (EUA) in May.  The authorization cleared the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States, which has recorded over 162,600 COVID-19 deaths and over 5 million infections. But the EUA status is designed to be temporary.  Gilead said its marketing application for remdesivir, to be sold under brand name Veklury, is supported by data from two late-stage trials conducted by the drugmaker and another by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Remdesivir has already been approved by multiple regulatory authorities around the world, including in the European Union, Australia and Japan.  The U.S. government has secured nearly all of remdesivir's supply through September. To boost the drug's availability globally, Gilead has signed multiple manufacturing and supply deals, including with Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Britain's Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc HIK.L.  A bipartisan group of state attorneys general urged the U.S. government last week to allow other companies to make remdesivir to increase its availability and lower prices.  Shares of Gilead were down 1.5% in late afternoon trading.

The drugmaker said third-quarter adjusted earnings were $1.75 per share. Wall Street analysts, on average, expected $1.74 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Gilead\u2019s shares, which closed at $66 in regular trading, were down 2% at $64.51 after hours.

Hepatitis C drug sales fell to $674 million from $902 million, which was short of the $729 million forecast by analysts.  Many patients have been cured of the liver-damaging virus and rival products have captured market share from a shrinking patient pool. In addition, Gilead this year launched its own generic, lower-cost versions of key hepatitis C drugs in an effort to have list prices more closely match the discounts that large buyers receive for the branded products.

Gilead said first-quarter sales of Yescarta totaled $96 million, which was short of the average analyst estimate of $103 million.  Sales of Gilead\u2019s hepatitis C drugs continued to fall, dropping to $790 million from $1 billion a year earlier.  Once a major growth driver for Gilead, hepatitis C revenue has declined as many patients have been cured of the liver-damaging virus and rival products, particularly from AbbVie, have seized market share from a diminishing patient pool.

Existing JAK inhibitors include Pfizer\u2019s Xeljanz and Eli Lilly\u2019s Olumiant. Abbvie also has an experimental product called upadacitinib that may be approved next year.  Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said filgotinib\u2019s efficacy was on a par or above rivals and it also offered a potentially superior safety profile, which should drive uptake despite the medicine likely being fourth to market.  He forecasts worldwide peak annual sales for filgotinib of $6 billion - half from rheumatoid arthritis and the rest for treating other diseases.  Berenberg analysts, who put peak sales at $4 billion, said filgotinib was increasingly looking like a \u201cbest-in-class\u201d medicine.  Gilead signed a deal here potentially worth more than $2 billion with Galapagos in December 2015, which included a $725 million upfront payment for the development of filgotinib, as well as an equity stake in the European firm.

Ulrich Perrey\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  Some hospitals said they are still buying the Gilead Sciences GILD.O medicine to build inventory in case the pandemic accelerates over the winter. But they said current supplies are adequate, in part because they are limiting use to severely ill patients.  The Food and Drug Administration has allowed more liberal remdesivir use, but 6 out of 8 major hospital systems contacted by Reuters said they were not using it for moderate cases.  The slowdown suggests that a shortage of the drug is over and threatens Gilead\u2019s efforts to expand use of remdesivir, which it sells under the brand name Veklury in some countries.  An HHS spokesperson confirmed on Friday that between July 6 and September 8, state and territory public health systems accepted about 72% of the remdesivir they were offered. Hospitals in turn purchased only about two-thirds of what states and territories accepted, as previously detailed to Reuters by Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.  Gilead did not respond to a request for comment.  A surplus of remdesivir - which costs $3,120 for a 6-vial intravenous course - marks a turnaround from earlier in the pandemic, when supplies of the drug had fallen short of demand in some regions.  Government-led distribution of remdesivir will expire at the end of September. Hospitals said they have little information on availability after that.  Remdesivir was first authorized by the FDA in May for emergency use in COVID-19 patients hospitalized and on oxygen support after data showed it helped shorten hospital recovery time.  \u2018NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSED\u2019  The agency last month expanded use to hospitalized patients who do not require oxygen support, based on data published in the JAMA medical journal showing that the drug provided a modest benefit for those patients.  The newer data has left many experts unconvinced.  \u201cI am not terribly impressed with the study,\u201d said Dr. Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. He said he remains \u201cskeptical\u201d about using remdesivir in patients with moderate COVID-19, especially given the price.  Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said his center has stayed focused on using remdesivir for the narrower population of seriously ill patients who need supplemental oxygen.  \u201cNo one wants to be in a position of making treatment decisions based on drug availability,\u201d he said.  Houston Methodist Hospital is holding off on broader use of remdesivir, and instead is stockpiling it in case the pandemic flares up in winter - typically the peak season for respiratory illness.  \u201cAt this point, we are buying far more than we are using because we are unsure about what will happen at the end of September,\u201d said Katherine Perez, infectious disease pharmacist at Houston Methodist.  There is no evidence that COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital for a day or two due to an underlying health issue, like diabetes or high blood pressure, would benefit from the drug, she added.  Mark Sullivan, associate chief pharmacy officer at Nashville\u2019s Vanderbilt University Hospitals & Clinics, said his institution also did not expand remdesivir use based on the newer JAMA data.  \u201cWe have kept our treatment protocol the same,\u201d he said.","92":"SEOUL (Reuters) - One in three South Korean patients seriously ill with COVID-19 showed an improvement in their condition after being given Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s antiviral remdesivir, health authorities said.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  California-based Gilead has been counting on its drug pipeline, including the NASH drug selonsertib, as sales of its hepatitis C treatments fall due to a smaller patient pool and intensifying competition, denting profits.  Oppenheimer & Co analyst Hartaj Singh said the expectation were low after the drug failed another late-stage study in February.  Successful treatments for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis have remained elusive, and Gilead stopped developing another treatment for the disease in 2016.  \u201cGilead could face some degree of reputational harm, given that this represents the closure of their second Phase 3 NASH program to fail miserably,\u201d Baird Analyst Brian Skorney said in a note.  The current trial was testing two doses of selonsertib in patients with scar tissue on the liver or fibrosis caused by NASH. The drug was shown to perform worse than placebo in improving fibrosis symptom.  In the 802-patient study, about 9.3 percent of patients treated with an 18 mg dose of selonsertib, and 12.1 percent of patients treated with a lower dose of the drug achieved an improvement of fibrosis by at least one stage, the company said.  However, 13.2 percent of patients treated with a placebo showed an improvement in fibrosis.  Gilead tied up with privately held insitro to develop therapies for NASH earlier this month, and is also testing a combination of drugs which includes selonsertib, and two other experimental drugs cilofexor and firsocostat as single agents in a mid-stage trial.  Analysts have projected the market for NASH treatments to reach between $20 billion and $35 billion as people with fatty diets increasingly develop the disease.  Fat accumulation and inflammation from NASH can lead to scarring of tissue, or fibrosis, that impairs liver function.  Gilead shares were trading down 0.3 percent at $62.64 in morning trade.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a June 2016 ruling that the two Merck patents, which cover methods of treating Hepatitis C, were unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by the company, including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.  A Gilead spokesman said the company was very pleased with the ruling and believe it was \u201cjustified and well supported by the record.\u201d  Merck did not immediately provide a comment on the decision.  Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment of Hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. The viral disease is estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and can lead to liver failure.  A jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in March 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.  A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company\u2019s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.  Merck appealed the ruling, saying there was no \u201cdeliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.\u201d  But the appeals court said in Wednesday\u2019s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were \u201ctainted\u201d by misconduct and should not be enforceable.  In February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs.  The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck\u2019s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.

Gilead\u2019s shares rose more than 5% on Wednesday to close at $83.14 and are up 27% so far this year.  Interest in remdesivir has been high as there are no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, and doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in severe cases.  Doctors have been eager for results from the NIH study because it is a large trial in which patients were randomized to treatment with the drug or a placebo without participants or doctors knowing which group they were in - the gold standard for clinical trials.  Gilead earlier this month said it was prepared to donate to hospitals its existing supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, which it said was enough for more than 140,000 patients, although that number would increase if the drug could be given for a shorter duration.

The study showed a trend toward better survival for remdesivir - 8% of patients given the drug died compared with 11.6% in the placebo group - but the difference was not statistically significant so may not be due to Gilead\u2019s drug.

Also on Wednesday, results were published by the Lancet medical journal of a trial conducted in China that concluded remdesivir failed to improve patients\u2019 condition or reduce the pathogen\u2019s presence in the bloodstream. Gilead said previously that those findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.  \u201cThe drug seems to have antiviral activity - how much is as yet unclear,\u201d Dr. Daniel McQuillen, an infectious disease specialist at Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts, told Reuters. \u201cSeems likely that it might need use with another antiviral agent.\u201d  Combination antiviral treatments have proven highly effective against other diseases.  Gilead also provided data on a study in severe COVID-19 patients it has conducted in dozens of medical centers, which does not have a placebo comparison but tested the drug under five-day and 10-day regimens.  In that 397-patient trial, Gilead said clinical improvements were similar regardlesss of treatment duration, and patients treated early on with remdesivir did better than patients who were treated later in the course of infection.

But Gilead, and other drugmakers, will need to avoid the appearance of taking advantage of a global health crisis to rake in profit, according to pharmaceutical industry consultants and former regulators.  \u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity for drug manufacturers,\u201d to improve the industry\u2019s image, said Ed Schoonveld, a drug pricing expert at consulting firm ZS Associates. \u201cThere has been an overwhelmingly negative focus on drug prices.\u201d  Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O\u2019Day, in the post just over a year, is proceeding with caution. The company is donating enough remdesivir for at least 140,000 patients for distribution by the U.S. government to hospitals nationally.  At a meeting with President Donald Trump in the White House on Friday, O\u2019Day pledged to make the therapy available to those in need.  Gilead also aims to increase worldwide manufacturing to supply over a million coronavirus patients by year-end, rising to several million in 2021, if required. The company has not disclosed its pricing plans.  \u201cI think this will certainly help the industry\u2019s reputation,\u201d O\u2019Day said on a recent conference call with investors. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that there won\u2019t continue to be focus and pressure on drug pricing ... but it\u2019s being done now in a way where we can have an appreciation for the innovation the industry brings.\u201d Gilead on Tuesday said it was talking with chemical and drug manufacturers to produce remdesivir for Europe, Asia and the developing world through at least 2022. The company said it was negotiating voluntary licenses with generic drugmakers in India and Pakistan, who would produce a lower-cost supply of remdesivir for developing countries.  FEDERAL MARCH IN?  Estimates of a fair price for remdesivir in the United States, where drugmakers generally charge the most for a new therapy, vary widely.  The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, suggested a maximum price of $4,500 per 10-day treatment course based on the preliminary evidence of how much patients benefited in a clinical trial. Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen on Monday said remdesivir should be priced at $1 per day of treatment, since \u201cthat is more than the cost of manufacturing at scale with a reasonable profit to Gilead.\u201d  Some Wall Street investors expect Gilead to come in at $4,000 per patient or higher to make a profit above remdesivir\u2019s development cost, which Gilead estimates at about $1 billion.  Gilead shares have risen about 20% since the beginning of the year, largely on hopes for remdesivir. That compares with a drop of 12% for the broad S&P500 Index.  Some experts warn that a much higher U.S. price for remdesivir would put Gilead back in the crosshairs on drug pricing. In a more extreme scenario, the company could risk federal or state government action to march in and invalidate the medicine\u2019s patent protection in the name of public health and issue mandatory manufacturing orders.  The U.S. government has never invoked those rights. But it has sued Gilead over patents on two of its widely-used HIV drugs that received federal funding grants while in development.  \u201cIf there is ever a time when those issues might arise, this would be that time,\u201d said Eric Katz, CEO at consulting firm HealthTech GPS, which advises the industry on pricing.  Katz, a former official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the government could make similar arguments over remdesivir, which was originally developed to treat Ebola with federal funding, and is now being studied in a trial backed by the National Institutes of Health.  Democratic lawmaker Lloyd Doggett of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, sent Gilead a letter this week demanding the company detail its plans for remdesivir, including supply issues, disclosure of taxpayer investment in the drug\u2019s development, and purchase and pricing arrangements. \u201cAmerican taxpayers have made a big investment in remdesivir, but now in return, those who need treatment may get only a big bill while Gilead gets a big payoff,\u201d Doggett warned.","115":"BENGALURU, June 12 (Reuters) - Indian drugmaker Zydus Cadila said on Friday it signed a non-exclusive agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc to manufacture and market antiviral drug remdesivir, the first treatment to show improvement in COVID-19 trials.

California-based Gilead has signed licensing deals with several generic drugmakers in an effort to make remdesivir available in 127 developing countries.  Last month, two Indian drugmakers, Cipla Ltd and privately-held Hetero Labs Ltd, also launched generic versions of the treatment. Cipla will price its version, Cipremi, at less than 5,000 rupees, while Hetero has priced Covifor at 5,400 rupees.  Gilead, last week, priced remdesivir at $2,340 per patient for rich nations and agreed to send nearly all of its supply of the drug to the United States over the next three months.  Mylan\u2019s price was for 100 mg vials, but it was not immediately clear how many of those vials would be required for a full treatment course. Gilead has said for a five-day treatment course, a patient would need six vials of remdesivir.  Remdesivir is in high demand after the intravenously-administered medicine helped to shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial but there has been concerns over its supply.

At a campaign event in the northeastern city of Maceio, center-left candidate Marina Silva said the court invalidated the exclusivity patent for the drug sofosbuvir, sold under the brand name Sovaldi, in a move that she said will reduce costs for patients.  Sovaldi was the first of a new generation of drugs that are effectively a cure for the serious liver disease. But despite Sovaldi representing a major treatment advance, Gilead came under intense criticism for a price that initially came out to $1,000 a pill in the United States. Other nations, such as India, and consumer groups have also challenged the patents.  The Brazil move comes as local pharmaceutical manufacturers Farmanguinhos-Fiocruz, Blanver and Microbiologica Quimica e Farmaceutica fight for the right to produce a significantly cheaper, generic version of the drug, with the support of Silva, a candidate who has championed environmentalism, relatively orthodox economics, and a robust social welfare net on the campaign trail.  According to local media, Farmanguinhos has proposed to Brazilian health officials producing a generic version of sofosbuvir for about a quarter of the price charged by the U.S. biotech company.  \u201cThis patent removal is a legitimate act of defense for the life of those who are in line for an extremely expensive treatment,\u201d Silva said.  Brazilian justice officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. A representative for Gilead did not immediately return a call requesting comment.  The patent decision underscores how individual companies have been dragged into Brazil\u2019s volatile presidential campaign, with right-wing front-runner Jair Bolsonaro criticizing certain investments by Chinese firms, and investors girding for more intervention in state-controlled companies should a leftist win.  Brazilians will go to the polls on Oct. 7 for the first round of the nation\u2019s presidential election. If no candidate wins a majority of valid votes, as is likely, there will be a runoff on Oct. 28.  Right-wing Congressman Bolsonaro and leftist former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad are seen as most likely to face off in the second round, in what polls indicate will be a tight race.","121":"(Adds details on the expanded use guidelines, background)  May 11 (Reuters) - The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Monday recommended that the compassionate use of Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s experimental drug remdesivir be expanded so that more patients with severe COVID-19 can be treated.  Countries across the world have shown a keen interest in remdesivir due to the lack of other approved treatments for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, which has caused over 282,000 deaths globally, according to Reuters tally.  EMA last month recommended that the antiviral drug should be used for treating COVID-19 in compassionate use programmes, which allow the use of medicines still under development outside a clinical study under strictly-controlled conditions.  In addition to patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, remdesivir can now be given to hospitalised patients requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and high-flow oxygen devices or those on extracorporeal life support, EMA said on Monday.

The decision by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is a blow to U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences, which wants to get its Yescarta product approved for use on the National Health Service (NHS).  The NICE rejection comes one day after the European Commission approved Yescarta for two aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. That green light cleared the way for each European country to decide on whether to fund the treatment.  Yescarta is the first CAR-T therapy to be assessed by NICE. The agency is currently appraising Novartis\u2019s rival Kymriah, which also won EU approval on Monday. NICE experts met last week to consider initial recommendations on the Swiss firm\u2019s product, a spokesman said.  Both Yescarta and Kymriah are chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, or CAR-Ts, which reprogram the body\u2019s own immune cells to attack malignant cells.  The treatments represents a brand new approach to fighting cancer, since the therapy involves extraction of infection-fighting cells from a patient. These cells are then genetically engineered to recognize cancer cells and infused back.  The process is complex and expensive but it offers hope for people with certain kinds of blood cancer who have exhausted all other treatment options.  Meindert Boysen, director of the center for health technology evaluation at NICE, said Yescarta was \u201can exciting innovation in very difficult to treat cancers, with a promise of cure for some patients\u201d but said its price was too high for it to be considered cost-effective.  The U.S. list price for Yescarta is $373,000. The UK price is confidential. NICE said Gilead had proposed a \u201ccommercial arrangement\u201d if Yescarta was recommended. Typically, drugmakers provide price discounts in exchange for NHS access.  Gilead said it was \u201cin ongoing discussions with NICE to identify appropriate treatment comparators which can clarify how cell therapy may be made available to patients in the UK\u201d.  Raj Chopra, head of cancer therapeutics at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the NICE rejection was disappointing for patients.  \u201cIf we\u2019re going to see CAR-T therapy widely available on the NHS, we need to find ways to reduce the costs,\u201d he said.

U.S.-based Gilead, whose shares have risen 17% this year on hopes for the treatment, in an-emailed statement said it has not yet set a price.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a June 2016 ruling that the two Merck patents, which cover methods of treating Hepatitis C, were unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by the company, including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.  A Gilead spokesman said the company was very pleased with the ruling and believe it was \u201cjustified and well supported by the record.\u201d  A Merck spokeswoman said in a statement that the ruling \u201cdoes not reflect the facts of the case\u201d and that the company was reviewing its next steps.  Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment of Hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. The viral disease is estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and can lead to liver failure.  A jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.  A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company\u2019s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.  Merck appealed the ruling, saying there was no \u201cdeliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.\u201d  But the appeals court said in Wednesday\u2019s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were \u201ctainted\u201d by misconduct and should not be enforceable.  In February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs.  The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck\u2019s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.","128":"March 12 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc:  * GILEAD SCIENCES\u2019 NORBERT BISCHOFBERGER, PHD, TO STEP DOWN; JOHN MCHUTCHISON, MD, APPOINTED CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER AND ANDREW CHENG, MD, PHD, APPOINTED CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","129":"(Corrects spelling of remdesivir in headline)  July 8 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said on Wednesday it has started an early-stage study of its antiviral COVID-19 treatment remdesivir that can be inhaled, for use outside of hospitals.

REUTERS\/Baz Ratner  The drugmakers are touting rival strategies for fighting the AIDS virus, with GSK betting that a shift to using two drugs rather than the standard three will boost its market share, while Gilead sticks with the tried and tested triple approach.  Deborah Waterhouse, head of GSK\u2019s majority-owned HIV business ViiV Healthcare, aims to overtake Gilead as market leader in the $26 billion-a-year HIV market by the mid-2020s, assuming the gamble on two-drug combinations pans out.  She has her work cut out. Gilead currently has a market share of 52 percent against GSK\u2019s 22 percent - a breakdown that has changed little this year, despite the successful launch of Gilead\u2019s new three-drug medicine Biktarvy.  Last week GSK reported successful headline results with its experimental combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine, paving the way for potential approval next year of a therapy some analysts see selling $1.5 billion annually.  Details of its so-called GEMINI trials, however, will only be disclosed at the biennial International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam on July 24 - a day before GSK reports second-quarter results.  GSK was informed late last Friday that its presentation had been accepted at the meeting, officials said.  Doctors will analyze the trial results closely to assess whether GSK can indeed rewrite treatment standards by delivering a cheaper two-drug regimen with fewer side effects.  The worry is it might risk drug resistance because the virus will only have to evade two drugs rather than three. While no resistance was seen in the latest 48-week trials, there was a case in an earlier study, although GSK believes this was likely down to failure to take the drugs properly.  As a result, analysts think many physicians may stick with using three-drug combinations for now, suggesting a slow sales ramp-up for GSK.  That is certainly the expectation at Gilead, which anticipates imminent approval of Biktarvy in Europe and will also have some additional data to present in Amsterdam.  \u201cPhysicians are interested in anything new that comes along in HIV, as they should be, but are a bit cautious about anything that steps back from established standards,\u201d Mike Elliott, Gilead\u2019s European head of medical affairs, told Reuters.

Under the new deal, payments will be made to Gilead by the European governments covered by the contract only when they buy doses.  A spokesman for the European Commission, which negotiated the contract with Gilead, declined to say whether orders had been already placed.

Gilead declined to comment on whether prices for remdesivir doses it sells to richer countries might change after the results of the WHO trial.  Solidarity has looked at four possible treatments for COVID-19: remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir\/ritonavir, and lopanivir\/ritonavir combined with interferon.  In July it discontinued trials on hydroxychloroquine and on combination HIV drug lopinavir\/ritonavir after they failed to reduce mortality in hospitalised patients.  Remdesivir has been granted a conditional marketing authorisation in the EU to treat COVID-19 patients who need oxygen. The drug has so far shown no effect on milder cases and on more critical patients who need mechanical support to breathe, the EU drugs agency said.  The agency is investigating remdesivir\u2019s potential adverse effects on kidneys.","134":"July 6 (Reuters) - Precision BioSciences Inc:  * PRECISION BIOSCIENCES REGAINS RIGHTS TO IN VIVO HEPATITIS B VIRUS PROGRAM  * PRECISION BIOSCIENCES - WILL REGAIN FULL RIGHTS AND ALL DATA IT GENERATED FOR HBV PROGRAM DEVELOPED UNDER 2018 AGREEMENT WITH GILEAD SCIENCES  * PRECISION BIOSCIENCES - DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY CHANGES TO ITS CASH RUNWAY  * PRECISION BIOSCIENCES - AS OF MARCH 31, HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $154.2 MILLION, EXPECTED TO SUFFICIENTLY FUND OPERATIONS INTO H2 OF 2021 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","135":"FILE PHOTO: A Gilead Sciences, Inc. office is shown in Foster City, California, U.S. May 1, 2018.

Beginning March, the studies will test the experimental antiviral drug, remdesivir, among nearly 1,000 patients at medical centers across Asian countries, as well as in other nations with high numbers of diagnosed cases, the company said.  Two dosing durations of remdesivir will be administered intravenously in the late-stage studies following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s rapid acceptance of remdesivir as a new investigational drug.  U.S. health officials said on Tuesday the first clinical trial testing remdesivir in hospitalized patients with the coronavirus had started.  Earlier this month, the drug, which is currently in clinical trials in China, appeared to prevent the disease in monkeys prior to being infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).  The main goal of the first study will be to evaluate if the drug normalized fever among the patients and oxygen balance in the blood, while the second trial will test remdesivir in proportion of participants in each group discharged by day 14.  The first study will test the drug in about 400 patients with severe manifestations of the coronavirus for five or ten days, while the second one will test it in about 600 patients with moderate symptoms, the company said.

It contains a newer formulation of a drug used in Gilead\u2019s older medication, Truvada, which has been used to treat people infected with HIV since 2004.  Truvada was also approved as a daily pill for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, in 2012.

The FDA-approved label for Descovy, while more limited than Truvada\u2019s, \u201ccomes as expected,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note. \u201cThe key will be the extent to which Gilead can transition the market to branded Descovy ahead of Truvada\u2019s genericization in around one year.\u201d  Descovy was shown in clinical trials to be less toxic than Truvada to the kidneys and bones. But some AIDS advocacy groups question whether it makes sense to prioritize Descovy for PrEP close to the time that cheaper generic versions of Truvada are to become available.  Gilead said on Thursday it has several patient assistance programs in place to help people get access to Descovy.  U.S. Sales of Truvada, which reached $2.6 billion last year, are forecast to drop to $428 million by 2024, while sales of Descovy, which totaled $1.2 billion in 2018, are expected to rise to $2.9 billion in 2024, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1.1 million people in the United States could benefit from PrEP. High-risk populations include people having sex with someone who is infected with HIV or who share injection needle equipment.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  In one case, a fake email login page designed to steal passwords was sent in April to a top Gilead executive involved in legal and corporate affairs, according to an archived version on a website used to scan for malicious web addresses. Reuters was not able to determine whether the attack was successful.  Ohad Zaidenberg, lead intelligence researcher at Israeli cybersecurity firm ClearSky, who closely tracks Iranian hacking activity and has investigated the attacks, said the attempt was part of an effort by an Iranian group to compromise email accounts of staff at the company using messages that impersonated journalists.  Two other cybersecurity researchers, who were not authorized to speak publicly about their analysis, confirmed that the web domains and hosting servers used in the hacking attempts were linked to Iran.  Iran\u2019s mission to the United Nations denied any involvement in the attacks. \u201cThe Iranian government does not engage in cyber warfare,\u201d said spokesman Alireza Miryousefi. \u201cCyber activities Iran engages in are purely defensive and to protect against further attacks on Iranian infrastructure.\u201d  A spokesman for Gilead declined to comment, citing a company policy not to discuss cybersecurity matters. Reuters could not determine if any of the attempts were successful, on whose behalf the Iranian hackers were working or their motivation.  Still, the hacking attempts show how cyber spies around the world are focusing their intelligence-gathering efforts on information about COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Reuters has reported in recent weeks that hackers with links to Iran and other groups have also attempted to break into the World Health Organization, and that attackers linked to Vietnam targeted the Chinese government over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.  Britain and the United States warned this week that state-backed hackers are attacking pharmaceutical companies and research institutions working on treatments for the new disease.  The joint statement did not name any of the attacked organizations, but two people familiar with the matter said one of the targets was Gilead, whose antiviral drug remdesivir is the only treatment so far proven to help patients infected with COVID-19.  The hacking infrastructure used in the attempt to compromise the Gilead executive\u2019s email account has previously been used in cyberattacks by a group of suspected Iranian hackers known as \u201cCharming Kitten,\u201d said Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, who reviewed the web archives identified by Reuters.  \u201cAccess to even just the email of staff at a cutting-edge Western pharmaceutical company could give ... the Iranian government an advantage in developing treatments and countering the disease,\u201d said Moriuchi, a former analyst with the U.S. National Security Agency.  Iran has suffered acutely from the COVID-19, recording the highest death toll in the Middle East. The disease has so far killed more than 260,000 people worldwide, triggering a global race between governments, private pharmaceutical companies and researchers to develop a cure.  Gilead is at the forefront of that race and has been lauded by U.S. President Donald Trump, who met the California company\u2019s CEO Daniel O\u2019Day at the White House in March and May to discuss its work on COVID-19.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week gave emergency use authorization to Gilead\u2019s remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19, clearing the way for broader use in more hospitals around the United States.  An official at one European biotech company said the industry was on \u201cred alert\u201d and taking extra precautions to guard against attempts to steal COVID-19 research, such as conducting all work related to vaccine trials on \u201cair-gapped\u201d computers that are disconnected from the internet.","141":"The trial is currently enrolling adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States and is expected to study the treatment combination in more than 1,000 participants.

Interest in Gilead\u2019s remdesivir has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, and doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.  In the Chinese trial remdesivir, given by intravenous infusion, failed to improve patients\u2019 condition or reduce the pathogen\u2019s presence in the bloodstream, according to draft documents published accidentally by the World Health Organization (WHO).  But details were thin and suggested limitations in interpreting the data that has not yet been fully reviewed.  A screenshot of the WHO posting, captured by the medical news website STAT before it was taken down, said the trial enrolled 237 patients with 158 receiving remdesivir compared with 79 who got a placebo.  The rate of death was similar at 13.9% for remdesivir versus 12.8% in the control group.  \u201cIt\u2019s still not that large of a study and therefore the statistics coming out of the trial aren\u2019t exactly robust,\u201d Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in a research note.

The trial involved 11,266 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in more than 30 countries, including 2,750 who were randomly assigned to receive remdesivir. The trial also tested treating patients with hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, interferon, or lopinavir-plus-interferon. \"No study drug definitely reduced mortality..., initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration,\" the WHO reported Thursday in a paper posted on the preprint server medRxiv ahead of peer review. When asked for comment, Gilead pointed to other studies that showed remdesivir had produced clinical benefits, and said it was \"unclear if any conclusive findings can be drawn\" from the WHO data due to differences in how the trial was conducted from site to site and between the patients who received the medicine.

While there is no gender difference in rates of infection, men are more vulnerable to becoming critical ill, with roughly twice the odds of dying. The new study, reported on Thursday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that along with genetic and immunological factors, behavioral differences also shape COVID-19 disparities between men and women. The authors say public health messages may need to be customized by gender. \"Countries headed by women, such as Germany and New Zealand, have generally responded more effectively to the pandemic,\" the authors wrote. \"In contrast, some of the countries with the worst record, including the United States and Brazil, are led by men who have projected strong masculinity attitudes and dismissed the need for precautionary practices such as wearing masks.\" (bit.ly\/352b6fC)  COVID-19 rare among U.S. dentists: survey  Less than 1% of U.S. dentists have tested positive for COVID-19, even though dental procedures generate aerosols that may contain particles of the new coronavirus, according to a survey of 2,200 dentists published on Thursday in the Journal of the American Dental Association.

However, remdesivir had previously been shown to be protective in monkeys infected with the Ebola virus, but that did not translate to humans.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t successful in Ebola, but there is some indication that it might be successful in the coronaviruses,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said in a recent interview.  NIAID scientists tested remdesivir in monkeys 24 hours prior to infection with MERS and in other monkeys 12 hours after infection - the time frame in monkeys when the virus is most active. They were compared with untreated monkeys in a control group. After six days, all of the untreated animals got sick.  In the monkeys treated prior to infection, the drug appeared to prevent disease. Animals in this group showed no sign of infection, had significantly lower levels of virus in their lungs and no lung damage.  Those treated after infection also fared better than the control group. They had less severe disease, their lungs had lower levels of virus and they had less severe lung damage, researchers found.  Many drugs that succeed in monkeys fail in humans. Nevertheless, the researchers said their findings bolster hopes for the ongoing studies in China and for compassionate use of the drug in severely ill patients.

Gilead\u2019s shares were up marginally in morning trading, paring their earlier gains after CNBC reported, citing sources, that the companies were not in active talks.  Such a merger would unite two drugmakers at the forefront of efforts to fight the new coronavirus, but could be politically sensitive as governments seek control over potential vaccines or treatments.  Gilead, whose drug remdesivir has shown improvement in COVID-19 patients in clinical trials and has been cleared for emergency use in several countries, was not interested in combining with another big drugmaker, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.  \u201cWe would be very surprised if ownership of Gilead was permitted to leave the United States,\u201d said SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges.  \u201cDomestic R&D and manufacturing capabilities, particularly in healthcare, have never been more important to the national interest.\u201d  Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he anticipated that the U.S. administration would likely seek to block potential acquisitions of any major U.S. biopharma company involved in the development of future therapeutics for the pandemic.

Ulrich Perrey\/Pool via REUTERS  Remdesivir, made by U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc, has been in high demand globally, and a handful of companies including Cipla are authorised to make and sell generic versions in 127 developing nations.  Cipla\u2019s launch of remdesivir in late June, along with subsequent launches by others, has helped ease supply bottlenecks in India, Cipla\u2019s Global Chief Financial Officer, Kedar Upadhye, told Reuters.  \u201cOf late, some of the complaints for supplies, and the number of panicky calls that I used to get, have come down dramatically,\u201d Upadhye said. \u201cLooks like things have settled.\u201d  COVID-19 cases in India, the world\u2019s third-worst hit country, have surged in the past month, with new infections topping 50,000 daily.  Yet while hospitals previously reported they were struggling to get their hands on the drug, leading to black market sales, Upadhye said the indications from his supply chain were that pressure had eased.  That suggested severe cases had not surged as much as the overall numbers, he said.  Government data at the end of July showed about 0.3% of the country\u2019s active coronavirus patients were on ventilators, while 1.6% on intensive care unit support and 2.3% on oxygen support.  Severe cases likely amounted to under 3% of all infections, said Giridhara Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India.  India, one of the world\u2019s biggest producer of generic drugs, recommends remdesivir for moderate to severe COVID-19. Doctors also use other drugs, including favirpiravir, another antiviral approved for the disease.  Cipla, which is also free to export the drug, supplies it in South Africa and plans to expand access to \u201cseveral sub-Saharan African countries\u201d, it has said.  India had previously blocked exports of another drug, hydroxychloroquine, used by some doctors in treating the disease. The ban has since been lifted.  Cipla declined to comment on the number of vials of remdesivir it had shipped so far, but said it had started making the drug at a plant in Goa in western India to ramp up production.","156":"(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s experimental HIV injection is as effective when given every other month as monthly, according to a study, a convenience that could help the British drugmaker in its battle against a rival drug from Gilead Sciences.GSK\u2019s two-drug injection was as effective as a monthly dose of the same regimen in maintaining viral suppression at 48 weeks in a late-stage study, said ViiV Healthcare, GSK\u2019s HIV unit.

ViiV, in which Pfizer and Shionogi have small stakes, is working on two-drug combinations and will use the lower drug burden in comparison with three-drug cocktails such as Gilead\u2019s Biktarvy as its main selling point to patients and physicians.  It is banking on longer-term studies to yield hard evidence of fewer side effects over time.  ViiV has taken a two-pronged approach.  While its once-a-day pill Dovato, also a two-drug combination, won U.S. market approval in April, the company is following up with a longer-acting injection combining the two active ingredients cabotegravir and Janssen\u2019s rilpivirine.  The injection has previously proven to be as effective as standard daily pills with three active ingredients when administered monthly. Thursday\u2019s results showed that doubling the time between injections does not compromise efficacy or safety.  Injections - targeted at patients unable to take, or not comfortable with, daily pills - are, however, seen as a smaller market opportunity than oral medicines.  \u201cThis is further progress in our efforts to reduce the number of medicines a person living with HIV must take while also reducing the frequency of treatments,\u201d said Kimberly Smith, Head of Research & Development at ViiV.  The trial focused on the HIV-1 category of the AIDS virus, which has the most widespread strains. If not quelled, an HIV infection causes AIDS, a deadly condition that severely weakens the immune system.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  A jury awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Gilead\u2019s Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents, but a judge later ruled the patents unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by Merck including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.  Merck had urged the Supreme Court to place limits on the doctrine of \u201cunclean hands\u201d that can prevent plaintiffs from winning lawsuits if they acted in bad faith.  Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Injection drug use is among the causes of the infection.  Direct-acting anti-viral medications like Gilead\u2019s Sovaldi and Harvoni have revolutionized treatment of hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. Merck holds patents that it has said cover a compound that is the foundation for all major antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C.  A federal court jury in San Jose, California awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.  A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling that in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.  Merck\u2019s litigation against Gilead has included several reversals of fortune.  In 2016, a jury in Delaware said Gilead infringed a related patent and ordered it to pay Merck $2.54 billion in royalties, the largest verdict ever in a patent case. But a judge threw out the verdict in February 2018, ruling that Merck\u2019s patent was invalid because it was not sufficiently detailed in its wording.","159":"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc on Monday reported a fourth-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street estimates, sending shares lower, as sales of its flagship hepatitis C treatments continued to slide and it recorded one-time charges, and the company .

Fourth-quarter sales of Gilead\u2019s HIV drugs rose to $4.1 billion from $3.4 billion.  But sales of hepatitis C drugs fell sharply to $738 million from $1.5 billion a year earlier, as newer drugs from Gilead and others have cured many patients with the liver-damaging virus and rival products have seized market share amid the diminishing patient pool.  The 2019 outlook reflects strength in Gilead\u2019s HIV franchise as well as rising expenses as the drugmaker builds out its infrastructure for cell therapy and possibly new drugs for a progressive fatty liver disease known as NASH, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note.  The company\u2019s quarterly net income was $3 million, or nil per share, due to a large impairment charge related to discontinuation of a multiple myeloma cell therapy program from Kite Pharma, which was acquired by Gilead in 2017. That compared with a net loss of $3.9 billion, or $2.96 per share, a year earlier, when many large companies took charges related U.S. corporate tax reform.

Gilead will likely look for a new leader with expertise in two of the company\u2019s future growth areas, the liver disease NASH and cancer, Milligan said.  NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is a progressive fatty liver disease tied to obesity that has no approved treatments. It afflicts about five percent of the population and is poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Medicine may be a science but drug pricing is definitely an art. That\u2019s especially true of Gilead Sciences\u2019 treatment for Covid-19, given the lack of alternative treatments for a pandemic. The $2,300 price of a course of remdesivir may sound high \u2013 and is compared with the basic cost of manufacturing the stuff \u2013 but is actually fairly restrained.  Start at the bottom. The marginal cost of producing remdesivir is probably less than $600, according to the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent non-profit. But companies must spend heavily to research and develop drugs. Factor in Gilead\u2019s development expenses for 2020 and the cost rises to $1,600.  Drugs come with many other costs too, including the need to subsidize products that failed in development. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimated in 2014 the average new drug costs about $2.6 billion to develop, all in. If pharma companies keep 40% of their revenue as profit, Gilead would have to sell roughly 3 million courses of remdesivir to cover its costs at that $2,300 price.  An alternative question is not what it costs, but what it\u2019s worth. The drug has been shown to help severely ill patients recover four days faster. Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O\u2019Day says four days in a U.S. hospital costs about $12,000. The real upper limit to what the market could bear for remdesivir might be even higher, since there are no proven alternatives, and Covid-19 has the potential to overwhelm intensive care units.  Gilead is wise not to test that limit. U.S. healthcare costs are already inflated, and charging what people might pay would create a political minefield. A majority of American voters said healthcare costs were one of the most important issues during the 2018 midterm elections, according to pollster KFF. Ahead of November\u2019s presidential election, the $94 billion pharma group\u2019s restraint may help it accumulate political capital. Prevention is better than cure.","178":"Oct 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s remdesivir (Veklury).

The U.S. National Institutes of Health on Wednesday said preliminary results from its trial of remdesivir showed that COVID-19 patients given the drug recovered 31% faster than those given a placebo.  In that 1,063-patient trial, patients who received the Gilead drug recovered in 11 days compared with 15 days for those who received a placebo.  While the data will need more analysis to know just how well the drug might work and for which patients with COVID-19, it was hailed by U.S. health officials as highly significant since it clearly had an effect on the disease for which there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines.  Data from a trial run by Gilead, also unveiled on Wednesday, showed similar clinical improvements in patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, regardless of whether they received five or ten days of treatment.  If the drug works just as well in half the time, there would be twice as much available for patients and the cost of therapy would be less.  More detailed results of the U.S. study are expected next month. There are several other studies also looking at remdesivir for the coronavirus.

Kymriah was the first so-called chimeric antigen T-cell therapy (CAR T) to be approved in the United States.  Gilead's Yescarta, which also has U.S. approval in blood cancer, got the CHMP's nod in DLBCL, where it would go head-to-head with Novartis's medicine, as well as in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL). (bit.ly\/2Ky9Rwj)  The recommendations are usually followed by the European Commission, which must issue final approval before the medicines can be sold in Europe.  Both companies\u2019 CAR T therapies are one-time treatments in which immune cells are removed from patients, genetically engineered in the laboratory using disarmed virus to target their blood cancers, and then re-infused.  Kymriah is priced at $475,000 in the United States in its original indication for young people up to 25 with ALL, and at $373,000 for DLBCL, which matches Yescarta\u2019s U.S. price.  Prices in Europe will likely vary, as the companies reach deals with agencies in individual companies.  Yescarta reaped $40 million in revenues in the first quarter, while Novartis, which has predicted eventual blockbuster status for Kymriah, brought in $12 million for its therapy in the ALL setting.  Gilead gained access to Yescarta with its nearly $12 billion deal last August, a deal in which it was looking for a lucrative cancer drug to help offset flagging sales of its longtime mainstay hepatitis C medicines.

But Richard Peto, an independent statistician hired by the WHO to scrutinize the results of its Solidarity trial, dismissed Gilead\u2019s criticism.  \u201cIt\u2019s a reliable result, don\u2019t let anybody tell you otherwise, because they\u2019ll try to,\u201d Peto told reporters. \u201cThis is real world evidence.\u201d  The results of the trial, announced by the WHO on Thursday, dealt a blow to one of the few drugs being used to treat people with COVID-19.  The U.N. health agency said remdesivir appeared to have little or no effect on keeping people alive or on the length of hospital stays among patients with the respiratory disease.  Its trial was conducted on 11,266 adult patients in over 30 countries and its findings may shift the focus of treatments away from antivirals such as remdesivir to new monoclonal antibodies which the WHO has said could be added to its studies.  In addition to remdesivir, Trump received Regeneron's REGN.O experimental monoclonal antibody infection. But another U.S. company, Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N, said on Tuesday a trial of its own COVID-19 antibody treatment had been paused over safety concerns.  \u201cFAR FROM WON\u201d  Gilead, which quickly repurposed what it had developed as an Ebola drug when the COVID-19 pandemic began, said that other, smaller remdesivir trials showed the treatment cut COVID-19 recovery time by five days and helped reduce the risk of death in some patients who were getting oxygen.  Peto, an Oxford University professor emeritus, said the smaller trial\u2019s perceived benefit in keeping people alive could have been mere \u201cchance\u201d.  \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got to randomise in large numbers,\u201d Peto said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t sufficient emphasis based on the need for large numbers if you want really reliable results.\u201d  For the remdesivir arm of the WHO\u2019s Solidarity trial, 2,743 patients were given remdesivir, compared to 2,708 in the control group. Gilead\u2019s study had 1,062 participants.  \u201cThe real disappointment is that remdesivir has also failed in a larger number of cases and in the \u2018real world setting\u2019,\u201d Clemens Wendtner, Chief Physician of Infectiology and Tropical Medicine at Munich\u2019s Schwabing Clinic, said.  \u201cA major clinical breakthrough looks different and warns us that the battle against COVID-19 is far from won.\u201d  The WHO\u2019s trial also found that other medicines repurposed since the pandemic began -- malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, anti-HIV drug combination lopinavir\/ritonavir and interferon -- offered little or no benefit to COVID-19 patients.  The hydroxychloroquine and anti-HIV studies were abandoned earlier this year, and interferon was dropped on Thursday.  Guidance on how countries should deploy remdesivir will come in two or three weeks after a data review, WHO officials said.  Remdesivir was given emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 1.  The European Union has given remdesivir emergency authorization and agreed to a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) remdesivir deal on Tuesday, weeks after Gilead was informed by the WHO about the results of the Solidarity trial.  The European Medicines Agency said it would review the trial data \u201cto see if any changes are needed to the way these medicines are used.\u201d  Some scientists said Gilead\u2019s complaints merit scrutiny.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - AstraZeneca\u2019s approach to rival Gilead Sciences is a puzzle for shareholders, but also a warning. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot has done well for the $140 billion drugmaker\u2019s investors. The risk is that the company\u2019s debt load, or his bigger ambitions, threaten that record.  The Anglo-Swedish group\u2019s decision to approach Gilead about a merger, as reported by Bloomberg on Sunday, is a strange reversal in corporate logic. Back in 2014, Soriot fended off a bid from Pfizer, arguing that the company would do better on its own. He was right: AstraZeneca\u2019 share price is roughly 50% above Pfizer\u2019s offer of 55 pounds a share.  Yet if a deal with Pfizer was unappealing, a combination with Gilead looks doubly so. The $96 billion U.S. group specialises in HIV drugs and Hepatitis C treatments, neither of which are AstraZeneca\u2019s core areas. Gilead is building up its cancer business, and both companies have potential therapies for Covid-19. However, the lack of common interests would mean fewer cost savings and raise the risk of a botched integration.  A combination, worth $232 billion based on closing share prices on Friday, would therefore be a hard sell. Despite hopes that Gilead\u2019s Remdesivir can help patients with Covid-19, the company\u2019s stock trades at a mere 12 times expected earnings. Shareholders would probably demand a big takeover premium.  AstraZeneca investors, meanwhile, would question the logic of joining forces with a company whose sales are expected to grow by just 0.4% a year over the next five years, according to Morningstar.  Gilead\u2019s clean balance sheet boosts its appeal. It churned out over $9 billion in operating cash flow last year and had barely any net debt as of March. By comparison, AstraZeneca\u2019s roughly $12 billion debt pile in 2019 was nearly twice last year\u2019s EBITDA, and operating cash flows won\u2019t cover its dividend payments until next year, Moody\u2019s reckons. An all-share merger would produce a less leveraged company.  Another worry is that Soriot wants to do a deal. U.S. healthcare providers are joining forces and the pandemic will put greater pressure on governments to lower healthcare costs. With AstraZeneca shares near their all-time high, Soriot has a valuable acquisition currency. A merger with Gilead may be unlikely, but investors can\u2019t ignore it entirely.","195":"May 13 (Reuters) - Cipla Ltd:  * CIPLA LIMITED ENTERS INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH GILEAD TO EXPAND ACCESS TO COVID-19 TREATMENT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","196":"June 24 (Reuters) - The potential U.S. pricing of Gilead Sciences Inc's antiviral remdesivir, among the first drugs shown to be effective against COVID-19, has been a highly debated topic among investors and analysts.

The agency, based on data from a recent non-clinical study, said the co-administration may result in reduced antiviral activity of remdesivir. It also added it had no such evidence from a clinical setting and that it continues to evaluate all data related to remdesivir. (reut.rs\/30I9w1O)  The warning comes hours after the agency revoked the emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, which has been touted by the U.S. President Donald Trump.  FDA said it was no longer reasonable to believe that oral formulations of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine may be effective in treating the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.  Gilead\u2019s drug had received emergency use authorization earlier in May as a potential treatment for COVID-19, clearing the way for broader use of the drug in more hospitals around the United States.","200":"Gilead announced \u201ctop-line\u201d findings from the trial on April 29. The full results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Gilead\u2019s trial involved 397 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, most of whom were not on ventilators. The company said the study, which did not include a placebo comparison, showed that 14 days after treatment with the intravenous drug, 64% of patients treated for 5 days and 54% treated for 10 days showed some clinical improvement.  At the 14-day mark, 8% of patients in the 5-day group and 11% of patients in the 10-day group had died.  Gilead said the results should not be interpreted as indicating that the shorter duration worked better since evidence of improved outcomes occurred early on, leading investigators to attribute the difference to imbalances in patient status at enrollment.  Adverse events included nausea and worsening respiratory failure. The company said 2.5% of patients in the 5-day group and 3.6% in the 10-day group discontinued treatment due to elevated liver enzymes.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to remdesivir on May 1, citing results from a different study run by the National Institutes of Health showing that the drug reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment.  Gilead has said it anticipates results from a company study of remdesivir in patients with more moderate COVID-19 around the end of this month.  Gilead has pledged to donate 1.5 million doses of remdesivir - or enough to treat at least 140,000 patients - to fight the global pandemic.

Gilead\u2019s drug has shown promise in helping patients infected with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, and is being closely watched on how the limited supply is distributed.  Last Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave emergency use authorization for the drug for patients with severe COVID-19, clearing the way for broader use in more hospitals around the United States. Data has shown Gilead\u2019s antiviral drug remdesivir helped to reduce hospital stays for COVID-19 patients.  Gilead Chief Executive Dan O\u2019Day said in late April that Gilead would donate 1.5 million doses and work with the U.S. government on distribution.  On Saturday, HHS said the 1.5 million doses were a global figure and that 607,000 would be distributed through the agency.  The allocation by Gilead Sciences to the United States was finalized on May 3, HHS said.  The U.S. is sending the drug remdesivir to local agencies in Illinois, Iowa, Connecticut, Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey.  Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) on Thursday said it is asking for more information on the federal government\u2019s plan for deciding how and where to distribute the drug. The federal government began distributing the drug this week but doctors across the country, particularly in COVID-19 hotspots like New York and Boston, became concerned after being denied their request to obtain the new therapy, IDSA president Dr. Thomas File told Reuters on Thursday. The IDSA on Wednesday called on the Trump Administration to explain how it will ensure equitable distribution of remdesivir to states and hospitals based on COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates.

Spot gold was down 1.9% at $1,685.84 an ounce by 1:55 p.m. EDT (1755 GMT), more than $60 lower than the 7-1\/2 peak hit earlier this week on concerns over the worst recession in decades. \"Gold and stocks are negatively correlated today with the overnight equity rally pressuring gold. The guidelines from Trump for re-opening the economy have boosted equity markets,\" said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO. \"If stocks can extend overnight gains it could trigger more profit-taking in gold,\" he added. World stock markets sprinted towards a second straight week of gains after Trump laid out guidelines for gradually reopening the coronavirus-hit U.S. economy. Bullion has on occasion moved in tandem with stock markets this year, with recent sharp sell-offs prompting investors to sell precious metals to cover their losses elsewhere. Late on Thursday, Trump outlined a plan to ease the shutdown in a staggered, three-stage process, but the plan was a set of recommendations rather than orders and left the decision largely up to state governors. Also lifting the mood, a report detailed encouraging data from trials of U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc's experimental drug remdesivir in severely ill COVID-19 patients. The pandemic has infected more than 2 million people globally and killed more than 149,000. Many countries have extended lockdowns to curtail its spread, while central banks have unleashed a wave of monetary support measures. \"Risk appetite is soaring, but it might be overdone as permanent damage to the economy will see a battered U.S. consumer,\" said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at broker OANDA, in a note. \"Gold will remain supported by the boatload of monetary and fiscal stimulus that will be in place for the foreseeable future.

After doctors had questioned the transparency of the allocation process, the federal agency said state health departments would distribute the intravenous drug.  Gilead has not responded to requests for information about further global allocation plans. Company spokeswoman Seiko Noma confirmed in an email late Wednesday that an undisclosed portion of remdesivir vials have been donated to the Japanese government.  \u201cThere are far more patients that may benefit from remdesivir than there are doses to go around.\u201d Dr. Michael Ison, professor of infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said in a Journal of the American Medical Association editorial on Thursday.

Gilead said the drug has improved outcomes for people suffering from the respiratory disease and has provided data suggesting it works better when given in the early stages of infection.  Preliminary results from a trial led by the U.S. Institutes of Health showed remdesivir cut hospital stays by 31% compared with a placebo treatment, although it did not significantly improve survival.

FILE PHOTO: The GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) logo. March 21, 2018. REUTERS\/Loriene Perera\/File Photo  GSK\u2019s majority-owned ViiV Healthcare unit said on Wednesday the experimental two-drug injection of cabotegravir and rilpivirine maintained similar rates of viral suppression compared with a standard three-drug oral regimen, after 48 weeks of a clinical trial.  The result from the big Phase III study is a boost for GSK\u2019s goal of developing dual therapies that are easier to tolerate than conventional triple ones, and shares in GSK rose 1.5 percent. It follows recent positive data from combining two oral drugs.  GSK hopes its new approach will allow it to compete more effectively against Gilead Sciences, the U.S. drugmaker that dominates the $26 billion-a-year HIV market.  Shares in Gilead, which also announced late on Tuesday that its Chief Medical Officer Andrew Cheng was leaving the company, fell 3 percent.  Gilead currently has a market share of around 52 percent against GSK\u2019s 22 percent, but Deborah Waterhouse, who heads the British drugmaker\u2019s HIV unit, says she hopes to overtake her U.S. rival by the mid-2020s.  That is a bold ambition, since many analysts have been expecting GSK to lose market share to Gilead\u2019s new triple drug Biktarvy, rather than see it gain ground.  \u201cSLOW BURN\u201d  Liberum analyst Roger Franklin, who rates GSK a \u2018buy\u2019, believes the company\u2019s dual-drug strategy has been under-appreciated by the market.  \u201cWhilst duals will likely be a slow burn as resistance data is collected and the regimen gains credence among physicians, the prospects are much improved now versus a year ago,\u201d he said.  GSK is betting that a shift to using two drugs rather than three will boost its sales by offering patients a therapy with greater convenience and fewer toxic side effects. In certain cases, depending on the drugs used, two-drug regimens will also be significantly cheaper.  Still, some doctors worry that using just two drugs to keep the AIDS virus at bay might risk drug resistance because HIV will only have to evade two drugs rather than three. That is certainly the view at Gilead, which is sticking with three.  In the case of the cabotegravir and rilpivirine monthly injection, GSK said drug resistance results in the latest study were consistent with data from earlier smaller trials. It did not go into further details but said full results would be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting.  ViiV Chief Scientific and Medical Officer John Pottage argued the novel injection offered an alternative long-term treatment for patients.  \u201cIf approved, this regimen would give people living with HIV one month between each dose of antiretroviral therapy, changing HIV treatment from 365 dosing days per year, to just 12,\u201d he said.  Results from a second trial of cabotegravir and rilpivirine are expected later this year. Rilpivirine was developed by Johnson & Johnson and GSK is working with the U.S. drugmaker on the new injection regimen.","210":"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has started distributing stocks of the COVID-19 treatment remdesivir that have been donated by Gilead Sciences Inc and plans to begin talks to purchase more supplies in August, its disease control agency said on Wednesday.  It is the first country to disclose a timeline for talks with Gilead. The drugmaker said this week it has priced remdesivir at $390 per vial in developed countries and agreed to allocate nearly all of its supply of the drug to the United States over the next three months.  One of the few treatments shown to alter the course of COVID-19, remdesivir is expected to be in high demand. The intravenously administered medicine has won emergency-use authorisation in several countries and full approval in Japan after a clinical trial showed it helped shorten hospital stays.  Only patients severely ill with COVID-19 are eligible for remdesivir and South Korea currently has 33 such patients, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.  KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong told a briefing that patients who developed symptoms in less than 10 days and were suffering from pneumonia and a shortage of oxygen would be considered eligible. A domestic panel of experts has found that anti-viral drugs like remdesivir are more effective if given in the early stages of the disease, she added.  The KCDC did not disclose how many doses have been donated by the U.S. firm.  South Korea will consider whether remdesivir should be covered by national health insurance after the purchase negotiations in August, said Jeong.  Based on current treatment patterns, a course of remdesivir equates to $2,340 per patient.

Remdesivir is in high demand after the intravenously-administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial. It is believed to be most effective in treating COVID-19 patients earlier in the course of disease than other therapies like the steroid dexamethasone.  Still, because remdesivir is given intravenously over at least a five-day period it is generally being used on patients sick enough to require hospitalisation.  Britain and Germany said they had sufficient reserves for now, though they were weighing options for when those might be exhausted.  South Korea, for its part, has started distributing stocks, but plans talks to purchase more supplies in August.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) this week said it had secured all of Gilead\u2019s projected production for July and 90% of its production in August and September, in addition to an allocation for clinical trials.  The European Union (EU) said on Wednesday it was in negotiations to obtain doses for its 27 member nations.  \u201cSUPPLY CHAINS UNDER STRAIN\u201d  \u201cThe buying-up of remdesivir is disappointing news, not necessarily because of the shortages it implies for other countries, but because it so clearly signals an unwillingness to cooperate with other countries, and the chilling effect this has on international agreements about intellectual property rights,\u201d said Ohid Yaqub, senior lecturer at the Science Policy Research Unit of Britain\u2019s University of Sussex.  Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer and lead for Britain\u2019s Department for Health and Social Care, told a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday that new drugs such as remdesivir were likely to be in \u201crelatively short supply in the first instance\u201d versus existing generic ones like dexamethasone.  The German health ministry said that the conditional market approval Gilead is expected to receive from the EU\u2019s executive Commission this week carries an implied obligation to deliver sufficient quantities in the future.  \u201cWe trust Gilead will meet this obligation,\u201d it said.  Gilead has said it linked up with generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan to supply remdesivir in 127 developing countries, but it has not discussed in detail its supply strategy for developed nations outside the United States.  \u201cThe issue is the high demand for a drug that is still an investigational medicine and probably had not been scaled up to a manufacturing level when the outbreak occurred,\u201d said Gino Martini, the UK Royal Pharmaceutical Society\u2019s chief scientist.  \u201cThe U.S. action means clinical supply chains will be under strain.

Gilead Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier said the company expects by next week to be in a position to fulfill orders coming through Europe and by the end of October to be able to meet real-time global demand for remdesivir.  She said the company is working with EU regulators so that remdesivir can be distributed more widely, but without going through the country-by-country economic review process typically required before a pharmaceutical product can be sold in Europe.  In July, the 27 European Union countries and Britain, with a combined population of 500 million, secured doses to treat about 30,000 patients. The United States signed a deal for more than 500,000 courses of treatment, accounting for most of Gilead\u2019s output through September.  \u201cRemdesivir has run out,\u201d Dutch Health Ministry spokesman Martijn Janssen told Reuters, adding however that new deliveries were expected shortly.  \u201cWe want to make sure not only that there is enough supply to go around, but more importantly that everybody has access to it across Europe,\u201d Gilead\u2019s Mercier said in a telephone interview.  The antiviral drug has been shown to shorten hospital recovery time in severe cases of COVID-19. Remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone are the only drugs authorised in Europe to treat COVID-19. Both have been given to U.S. President Donald Trump, who is also receiving an experimental antibody cocktail.  Hospitalisations across Europe have been rapidly increasing, although in most countries still far below levels of the spring.  \u201cDue to the increased hospital admissions, the demand for remdesivir is increasing rapidly,\u201d the Dutch spokesman said.  Poland\u2019s health minister Adam Niedzielski said on Tuesday the drug was in short supply in some hospitals. Its latest shipment from the EU order arrived just last Friday.  Spain, which has Europe\u2019s highest infection rate, experienced shortages in late August, its medicine agency said. It has now enough doses to meet needs for the coming weeks, the health ministry said on Tuesday.  Britain, which has joined the EU procurement for remdesivir, has rationed its supply, prioritising COVID-19 patients who need it most, the health ministry said.  Shortages are likely to stir debate about the availability and pricing of COVID-19 drugs. While dexamethasone, a generic medicine, is widely available and cheap, remdesivir is protected by Gilead\u2019s patent.  The company has set a $2,340 price per patient for wealthier nations.

Remdesivir is the only drug so far that has been shown to help patients with COVID-19, but Gilead and other companies are looking for ways to make it work better.  For critically ill patients, Roche ROG.S and Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N are testing drugs in combination with remdesivir.  Gilead is also seeking to treat the virus earlier. Other antivirals, like influenza pill Tamiflu, work best when given as early as possible after someone becomes infected.  Gilead in a statement on Monday said it is looking at ways to use remdesivir earlier in the course of disease, including via alternate formulations. The company confirmed in an email that it is researching an inhaled version, but declined further comment.  Company executives such as Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson have been doing interviews with Wall Street analysts in recent weeks to discuss the plans, which are in early stages.  They have said that in the longer term, the company is exploring a subcutaneous injection formulation of remdesivir, as well as dry powder versions to be inhaled. Remdesivir cannot be given as a pill because it has a chemical makeup that would degrade in the liver, and the intravenous (IV) formulation is only used by hospitals.  In the short term, Gilead is studying how its existing IV formulation of remdesivir can be diluted for use with a nebulizer - a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs.  The idea is that a nebulizer would make remdesivir more directly available to upper airway and lung tissue as the coronavirus is known to attack the lungs. It would also allow for early treatment of coronavirus patients who are not hospitalized.  \u201cPeople look forward to an inhaled formulation in time,\u201d but development is in the very early stages, said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee, adding that demand may be limited as many people infected with the virus require minimal treatment.  He said Gilead is building up its capacity to supply remdesivir and has begun talking to governments around the world about commercial pricing.  Gilead on Monday reported trial results showing that IV remdesivir provided a modest benefit for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 compared to standard care.

GSK\u2019s HIV drugs division ViiV, in which Pfizer Inc and Shionogi & Co Ltd have small stakes, will use the lower drug burden as its main selling point to patients and physicians, while hoping that longer-term studies will yield hard evidence of fewer side effects over time.  As HIV positive patients grow older thanks to highly effective treatment, the focus shifts to long-term side effects as nearly half of all HIV patients in the profitable markets of North America and Europe are now over 50.  \u201cWe are trying to establish a new normal for people with HIV. We absolutely believe that people living with HIV should not take more medicines than they need,\u201d said Deborah Waterhouse, who heads the British drugmaker\u2019s HIV unit.  ViiV accounted for about 39 percent of GSK\u2019s group operating profit last year, according to UBS analysts. With a 23 percent share in the $26 billion-a-year HIV market, it is seeking to catch up with Gilead\u2019s 53 percent.  Gilead will keep up the pressure with new anti-retroviral drug Biktarvy, a combination of three HIV medicines in a daily tablet, which was approved early last year. Market researcher Evaluate pharma expects sales from the product to reach $6.1 billion in 2024.  Hopes for growth - despite harsh competition from Gilead - rest on Dovato as well as on another two-drug combination that will be given as a monthly injection but regulatory approval of the latter is not expected before next year.  The company\u2019s growth prospects are clouded by the recent U.S. launch of cheap generic copies of blockbuster asthma treatment Advair, generated 2.4 billion pounds in revenues for GSK last year.

During a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House with President Donald Trump, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O\u2019Day called the move an important first step and said the company was donating 1.5 million vials of the drug to help patients.  The donation is expected to be enough for at least 140,000 patients, depending on the number of days they need to be treated.  Gilead said on Wednesday the drug, which is given by intravenous infusion, had helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of infection.  With many countries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, interest in Gilead\u2019s drug has been high because there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19. Doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.  \u201cIt\u2019s the first authorized therapy for COVID-19, so we\u2019re really proud to be part of it,\u201d FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during the meeting.  Data released this week from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed that remdesivir reduced hospitalization stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.  Gilead did not immediately respond to a request for the price it plans to charge for the drug after its pledged donations are used up. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which assesses effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested that the price would rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.  Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or for patients cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs. Through Gilead\u2019s trials, more than 181 hospital locations around the world, including hospitals in 27 U.S. states, have been administering the drug.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the 1.5 million vials would start being distributed to hospitals on Monday.  Gilead said the federal government will coordinate the donation and distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in cities hardest hit by COVID-19. Citing the drug\u2019s limited supply, the company said hospitals with intensive care units and other hospitals that the government deems most in need will receive priority.  There have been more than 3.2 million people infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 232,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally.  The United States has the most cases and fatalities at more than 1 million and at least 63,200 with much of the country in lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.  The recent clinical data has raised hopes remdesivir might be an effective treatment.  A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients\u2019 condition or reduce the pathogen\u2019s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.  Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host\u2019s immune system.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Nearly 40 percent of lymphoma patients treated with a single infusion of Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s Yescarta were still responding to the cell therapy after at least two years of follow-up, the company said on Sunday.  The question of how long patients will benefit from Yescarta and other therapies in an expensive new class known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, or CAR-Ts, has been a key topic at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) in San Diego.  Both Yescarta and rival Kymriah from Novartis AG have U.S. prices for lymphoma of $373,000 for health insurers including the Medicare government program for seniors. Cancer centers have to be certified to administer the treatments and sales have been slow to build - reaching $183 million for Yescarta and $48 million for Kymriah in the first nine months of this year.  Hospitals also complain that mainly because of problems with Medicare reimbursement of the novel therapies, they can lose money treating some patients with CAR-Ts.  \u201cThe technology has moved faster than CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) rules,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Alvarnas, hematologist oncologist at City of Hope in Duarte, California. He said stakeholders, including ASH, were working with the agency and legislators \u201cto address this crucial issue.\u201d  Unlike traditional one-size-fits all cancer drugs, CAR-T therapy requires extracting white blood cells from an individual patient, altering them in a lab to sharpen their ability to spot and kill cancer cells, and infusing them back into the same patient.  Yescarta was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2017 for aggressive large B-cell lymphoma that has not responded to other treatments. Kymriah, first used for pediatric leukemia patients, was approved earlier this year in the same setting.  At the hematology meeting, Novartis reported 19-month follow-up on Kymriah in lymphoma patients, showing that more than half were responding to the therapy.  Novartis has acknowledged problems meeting regulatory specifications for its lymphoma product. Doctors say patients will still be treated with their processed cells, although Novartis cannot bill for them.  \u201cWe are working with regulatory agencies on our specifications and we are implementing manufacturing process improvements,\u201d Novartis said in an email.  Celgene Corp, expected to be the third CAR-T to enter the market, did not present lymphoma data at ASH on its candidate, JCAR017. The company did report results for JCAR017 in a small number of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, showing that 81 percent of them responded to the cell therapy.  A spokeswoman for Celgene, which presented six-month lymphoma trial results for JCAR017 in June, said the company aimed to eventually seek FDA approval based on at least nine months of data for all study patients.  \u201cCelgene is looking ahead to a timeline of potential U.S. approval for JCAR017 in mid-2020,\u201d the company said in an email.  \u2018FOURFOLD IMPROVEMENT\u2019  Gilead\u2019s update of its Yescarta study showed that at a median follow-up of 27.1 months, 37 percent of 101 treated lymphoma patients remained in remission.  \u201cHistorically in this patient population, median survival has been about six months, so this is a fourfold improvement,\u201d said Dr. Sattva Neelapu, co-leader of the Yescarta study and professor of lymphoma and myeloma at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.  He also said previous studies had shown two-year remission to be a good indicator of long-term survival for lymphoma patients.  The Novartis update of 99 patients who had gone through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and unsuccessful stem cell transplants showed that 54 percent were responding to the therapy. The median duration of response had not been reached, indicating that most of the patients who had responded were still benefiting from the therapy at the time of analysis.  The median duration of response for all patients infused in the Kymriah trial was 11.1 months, but the median had not been reached for patients achieving remission.  Gilead\u2019s trial update showed that for patients who reached complete remission 12 months after Yescarta treatment, 93 percent remained in remission after two years.  The company said 61 of 101 patients had their lymphoma worsen or died during the study. Median overall survival had not yet been reached and 51 trial patients were still alive.  CAR-T treatments can cause serious side effects. A severe inflammatory condition known as cytokine release syndrome was experienced by 11 percent of Yescarta trial patients and 23 percent of Kymriah patients. High-grade neurological side effects were seen in 32 percent of Yescarta patients and 11 percent of Kymriah patients.","239":"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc:  * GILEAD SCIENCES INC SAYS IN FEBRUARY 2018, CO RECEIVED NOTICES FROM NATCO PHARMA LIMITED AND TEVA PHARMA - SEC FILING  * GILEAD SCIENCES INC - NATCO PHARMA LIMITED,TEVA EACH SUBMITTED ANDA TO FDA REQUESTING PERMISSION TO MANUFACTURE AND MARKET GENERIC VERSION OF SOVALDI  * GILEAD SCIENCES - TEVA ALLEGES THAT NINE PATENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SOFOSBUVIR INVALID, UNENFORCEABLE AND\/OR WILL NOT BE INFRINGED BY TEVA\u2019S MANUFACTURE  * GILEAD SCIENCES-NATCO PHARMA ALLEGES THAT TWO PATENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SOFOSBUVIR INVALID,UNENFORCEABLE AND\/OR WILL NOT BE INFRINGED BY NATCO\u2019S MANUFACTURE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Bengaluru Newsroom: +1 646 223 8780)","240":"BRUSSELS, July 29 (Reuters) - The European Union\u2019s executive said on Wednesday it has signed a contract with Gilead for its COVID-19 medicine remdesivir that would cover 30,000 patients in the bloc from early August.  \u201cThe Commission signed a contract with the pharmaceutical company Gilead for ensuring treatment doses of Veklury - the brand name for remdesivir.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended Novartis\u2019s Kymriah for treatment of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Kymriah was the first so-called chimeric antigen T-cell therapy (CAR-T) to be approved in the United States.  Gilead\u2019s Yescarta, which also has U.S. approval in blood cancer, got the CHMP\u2019s nod in DLBCL, where it would go head-to-head with Novartis\u2019s medicine, as well as in primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL).  In a related move, the panel also recommended that the approval for Roche\u2019s RoActemra medicine, typically prescribed for severe rheumatoid arthritis, be expanded to include the treatment of serious side effects of CAR-T cell therapies.  The recommendations are usually followed by the European Commission, which must issue final approval before the medicines can be sold in Europe.  Both companies\u2019 CAR-T therapies are one-time treatments in which immune cells are removed from patients, genetically engineered in the laboratory using disarmed virus to target their blood cancers, and then re-infused.  Kymriah is priced at $475,000 in the United States in its original indication for young people up to 25 with ALL, and at $373,000 for DLBCL, which matches Yescarta\u2019s U.S. price.  Prices in Europe will likely vary as the companies reach deals with agencies in individual companies.  Yescarta reaped $40 million in revenues in the first quarter, while Novartis, which has predicted eventual blockbuster status for Kymriah, brought in $12 million for its therapy in the ALL setting.  Gilead gained access to Yescarta with its nearly $12 billion deal last August, a deal in which it was looking for a lucrative cancer drug to help offset flagging sales of its longtime mainstay hepatitis C medicines.  The CHMP recommended Roche\u2019s RoActemra, known as Actemra in the United States, because it has helped CAR-T patients who develop potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome, notably saving the life of a six-year-old girl.  She was the first paediatric ALL patient to get the drug that became Novartis\u2019s Kymriah in 2011, and her successful treatment at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pennsylvania helped to kick off the buzz in the medical world about the promise of CAR-T therapies.

In July, the 27 European Union countries and Britain, with a combined population of 500 million, secured doses to treat about 30,000 patients. The United States signed a deal for more than 500,000 courses of treatment, accounting for most of Gilead\u2019s output through September.  \u201cRemdesivir has run out,\u201d Dutch Health Ministry spokesman Martijn Janssen told Reuters, adding however that new deliveries were expected shortly.  The antiviral drug has been shown to shorten hospital recovery time in severe cases of COVID-19. Remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone are the only drugs authorised in Europe to treat COVID-19. Both have been given to U.S. President Donald Trump, who is also receiving an experimental antibody cocktail.  Hospitalisations across Europe have been rapidly increasing, although in most countries still far below levels of the spring.  \u201cDue to the increased hospital admissions, the demand for remdesivir is increasing rapidly,\u201d the Dutch spokesman said.  Poland\u2019s health minister Adam Niedzielski said on Tuesday the drug was in short supply in some hospitals. Its latest shipment from the EU order arrived just last Friday.  Spain, which has Europe\u2019s highest infection rate, experienced shortages in late August, its medicine agency said.  Britain, which has joined the EU procurement for remdesivir, has rationed its supply, prioritising COVID-19 patients who need it most, the health ministry said.  Shortages are likely to stir debate about the availability and pricing of COVID-19 drugs. While dexamethasone, a generic medicine, is widely available and cheap, remdesivir is protected by Gilead\u2019s patent.  The company has set a $2,340 price per patient for wealthier nations. It says it has also donated treatments for research and to treat hundreds of thousands of patients around the world.

The supplies secured so far by the EU were supposed to cover needs until the end of September. Several officials said new deliveries were expected shortly.  Gilead has expanded its production capacity. Last week it said it was meeting U.S. demand and expected to cover global needs in October, even in the event of future surges of COVID-19.

GILD.O, according to new data based on patient observation.  The analysis, published on Friday by the New England Journal of Medicine, does not detail what other treatments the 61 hospitalized patients were given and data on eight of them were not included -- in one case because of a dosing error.  The paper\u2019s author called the findings \u201chopeful,\u201d but cautioned that it is difficult to interpret the results since they do not include comparison to a control group, as would be the case in a randomized clinical trial. In addition, the patient numbers were small, the details being disclosed are limited, and the follow-up time was relatively short.  There are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 100,000 people worldwide.  Gilead last month sharply limited its compassionate use program for remdesivir and is conducting its own clinical trials of the antiviral drug, with results expected in coming weeks. Researchers in China as well as the U.S. National Institutes of Health are also testing the drug in COVID-19 patients.  The new analysis includes patients in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan who received a 10-day course of intravenous remdesivir.  Before the treatment, 30 patients were on mechanical ventilators, and four were on a machine that pumps blood from the patient\u2019s body through an artificial oxygenator. After a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients, or 68%, had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including more than half of the 30 patients receiving mechanical ventilation who had their breathing tubes removed.

Its shares jumped 10% to 2,373 pence by 0948 GMT, jolting the stock to the top of the gainers list of London\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index.  The company\u2019s largest unit, which supplies needle-based drugs primarily to hospitals, posted double-digit growth in revenue, driven by demand for critical medicines to treat patients infected by the new coronavirus in the United States and Europe.  The injectables division will also take on production of U.S. based Gilead\u2019s antiviral remdesivir at Hikma\u2019s manufacturing facility in Portugal.  Remdesivir has been a front-runner treatment for COVID-19, which has killed more than 800,000 people globally, as one of the first drugs shown to be effective in countering the disease. Several countries have approved, recommended or taken action in support of the drug for patients with the illness.  \u201cToday\u2019s deal with Gilead to supply remdesivir highlights Hikma\u2019s growing strategic importance as a trusted source of essential medicines,\u201d said a research note from Peel Hunt analysts who have a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on the stock.  Hikma, founded in Jordan in 1978, said it now expects 2020 revenue from the injectables business of between $950 million and $980 million.  It said this was an increase on its previous expectation, thanks in part to a boost from the Gilead partnership, but didn\u2019t say what its previous expectation had been.  Stocking of medicines for intensive care during the pandemic and longer prescriptions from doctors were a key performance driver, especially in the months of March and April, Chief Executive Siggi Olafsson told Reuters.  \u201cWe have delivered strong first-half results, which are ahead of our initial expectations,\u201d Olafsson said, without saying what those expectations had been.  Hikma also lifted sales guidance for its generics division - which supplies to the United States - to a range of between $720 million and $760 million, versus $700 million to $750 million.  The company makes treatments including anaesthetics, pain medications, sedatives, neuromuscular blocking agents and anti-infectives. Most importantly it also supplies the steroid drug dexamethasone, touted as a treatment for COVID-19 after a UK study showed it reduced death rates by about a third in severely ill, hospitalised patients.  Group core operating profit rose 15% to $284 million and Hikma raised its interim dividend by 2 cents to 16 cents per share.

The move comes just a week after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave its go-ahead for the drug, produced by Gilead Sciences GILD.O, to be used in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age who are also suffering from pneumonia and require oxygen support.  It also comes just days after the company allocated nearly all of its supply of remdesivir to the United States over the next three months, stirring concerns about availability elsewhere.  \u201cWe will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to secure efficient treatments or vaccine against the coronavirus,\u201d said Stella Kyriakides, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, in a statement.  The Commission said on Wednesday it was in negotiations with Gilead to obtain doses of remdesivir for the 27 European Union countries.  Remdesivir is in high demand after the intravenously-administered medicine helped to shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial.  It is believed to be most effective in treating COVID-19 patients earlier in the course of disease than other therapies like the steroid dexamethasone.  Still, because remdesivir is given intravenously over at least a five-day period it is generally being used on patients sick enough to require hospitalisation.  The EU\u2019s green light broadens the use of remdesivir around the world - the United States has cleared it for emergency use and it is also approved as a COVID-19 therapy in Japan, Taiwan, India, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates, Gilead said on Friday.  A conditional marketing authorisation is one of the EU regulatory mechanisms created to facilitate early access to medicines that fulfil an unmet medical need, including those for emergency situations in response to public health threats such as the current pandemic, the Commission said.

AstraZeneca contacted Gilead last month, but its U.S. rival was not interested in combining with another big pharmaceuticals company, the Bloomberg report bloom.bg\/3h2GU9e said.  A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said the company does not comment on rumours or speculation.  Gilead, the world\u2019s largest maker of HIV drugs, declined to comment on the report.  If combined, the two companies would have a market capitalisation of about $232 billion, based on Friday\u2019s closing share prices.  That would exceed Merck & Co MRK.N and Pfizer PFE.N at $207 billion and $200 billion respectively.  Two sources familiar with AstraZeneca\u2019s thinking questioned the rationale of a tie-up, telling Reuters that Gilead\u2019s remdesivir drug for COVID-19 patients was insufficient to justify pursuing a multibillion-dollar deal that would detract from AstraZeneca\u2019s work on a coronavirus vaccine.  One of the sources questioned the timing. Given the potential impact a successful vaccine would have on AstraZeneca\u2019s share price, it does not need the additional strain of pursuing a record-breaking deal, especially when travel constraints make face-to-face meetings difficult.  While Gilead may look cheap with its price-to-earnings ratio of 12 times and AstraZeneca may be attracted by the potential cost-cutting and decent free cashflow, Jefferies analysts said they do not view a deal as likely.  \u201cWe think Gilead believes its HIV business is very underappreciated,\u201d they said in a note, adding that the company \u201cwould prefer to build value over time and do its own tuck-in deals\u201d.

Both companies\u2019 shares have jumped this year as the healthcare sector has drawn fresh investor interest as drugmakers race to develop treatments and vaccines to counter the pandemic.  AstraZeneca\u2019s shares hit record highs in late April while Gilead\u2019s stock is up 20% since the start of the year.  Gilead, AstraZeneca and other drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N, Pfizer PFE.N and Merck & Co MRK.N, are racing to develop vaccines or treatments for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.  More than 6.9 million people have been reported infected with the coronavirus globally and 399,025 have died, a Reuters tally showed on Sunday.  It is unclear whether a vaccine will work, but AstraZeneca\u2019s partnership with Oxford University to develop one is among a handful of initiatives U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s COVID task force has backed.

But the market segment GSK is eyeing is about to become more competitive as cheaper generic versions of Truvada are expected to be launched in the United States in September, as the patent expires.  Gilead, for its part, hopes that Truvada users will opt against the cheaper copies and switch to its new daily pill Descovy, approved in October 2019 after it was shown to be less toxic to the kidneys and bones.  Truvada generated $2.8 billion in sales last year, both from treatment and preventing an HIV infection.  Kimberly Smith, ViiV\u2019s head of research, said a long-acting injection was a better route of administer because users have shown to struggle with a strict routine of daily pills, heightening the infection risk.  \u201cIndividuals have to show up every eight weeks in the clinic for the injection but in-between there is not a need to take a pill daily, so you really change the equation for adherence with a long acting (drug),\u201d Smith said.  GSK, which is trailing Gilead in the HIV treatment market, will speak to drug regulators about a possible approval of cabotegravir based on the prevention trial, a spokesman said.  Prevention \u201chas turned into a multi-billion opportunity for Gilead but we think consensus estimates include little or nothing for GSK in this market,\u201d UBS analysts said in a research note.  GSK has won approval in Canada for cabotegravir as one of two key ingredients in long-acting HIV treatment combination Cabenuva, whereas in the United States, the company has run into delays seeking the go-ahead for Cabenuva.  An initial readout from the trial, which started in late 2016, was previously not expected before next year.  A similar trial to test the cabotegravir injection to prevent HIV in women, is still ongoing.  Pfizer and Shionogi & Co Ltd hold small stakes in GSK\u2019s HIV-focused ViiV Healthcare division.","281":"Dec 9 (Reuters) -  * DRUGMAKER GILEAD SCIENCES PLANS TO HIRE DANIEL O'DAY AS ITS NEXT CEO - WSJ, CITING SOURCES Source text : on.wsj.com\/2C1oCCN Further company coverage:","282":"FILE PHOTO: An ampule of remdesivir is pictured during a news conference at the University Hospital Eppendorf (UKE) in Hamburg, Germany, April 8, 2020, as the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues. Ulrich Perrey\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche plans to test if mixing its anti-inflammation drug Actemra with Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s anti-viral treatment remdesivir works better against severe COVID-19 pneumonia than remdesivir alone, the Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday.  Actemra and remdesivir are being used separately in some settings and clinical trials, with the former drug used to tackle massive immune reactions that sometimes occur in patients stricken with the new coronavirus and the latter aimed at interfering with viral replication.  Roche is hoping that by combining the two in a global study of 450 hospitalised patients worldwide, it will be able to offer doctors a one-two punch against the disease that has so far stricken 5.8 million people and killed nearly 360,000. The cocktail will be compared against remdesivir and a placebo.  \u201cBased on our current understanding, we believe that combining an antiviral with an immune modulator could potentially be an effective approach to treating patients with severe disease,\u201d Roche Chief Medical Officer Levi Garraway said in a statement.  Remdesivir, a failed Ebola drug repurposed against the new coronavirus amid the COVID-19 pandemic, has captured lots of attention after a 397-patient study showed it helped reduce time of recovery in some patients and suggested it helped keep people alive.  Roche is also studying Actemra, originally developed for arthritis but also used to control immune reactions in some cancer patients, as a monotherapy in a separate trial of 450 patients due to complete enrolment soon and produce results later this year.","283":"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O has questioned the findings of a World Health Organization (WHO) study that concluded its COVID-19 drug remdesivir does not help patients who have been admitted to hospital.  FILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured outside a building of the World Health Organization (WHO) during an executive board meeting on update on the coronavirus outbreak, in Geneva, Switzerland, February 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse  The American company told Reuters the data appeared inconsistent, the findings were premature and that other studies had validated the drug\u2019s benefits.  In a blow to one of the few drugs being used to treat people with COVID-19, the WHO said on Thursday its \u201cSolidarity\u201d trial had concluded that remdesivir appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays among patients with the respiratory disease.  The antiviral medication was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus infection, and has been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery, though the European Union is investigating it for possible kidney injury.  The WHO trial was conducted in 11,266 adult patients in more than 30 countries. The evidence was conclusive, the WHO said.  Gilead said other trials of remdesivir, including with 1,062 patients that compared it with a placebo, showed the treatment cut COVID-19 recovery time.  \u201cThe emerging (WHO) data appears inconsistent, with more robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of remdesivir,\u201d Gilead told Reuters.  Gilead said it was \u201cunclear if any conclusive findings can be drawn\u201d given what it called differences in how the trial was conducted from site to site and between the patients who received the medicine.  In April, the top U.S. infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, predicted remdesivir would become \u201cthe standard of care\u201d.  Companies such as Gilead are racing to find a treatment for COVID-19. Some 1.1 million people have died and 39.1 million have been reported infected in the pandemic, and the global economy has been thrown into chaos.  Remdesivir was developed for Ebola, which causes fever, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea and spreads among humans through bodily fluids.  It was quickly repurposed and has offered some hope for patients, though the WHO's findings may shift the focus of the search for a vaccine to new monoclonal antibodies being developed by companies including Regeneron REGN.O.  The Solidarity trial also evaluated hydroxychloroquine, anti-HIV drug combination lopinavir\/ritonavir and interferon, and concluded that they, like remdesivir, did little to help patients survive or leave the hospital more quickly.  The WHO trial's results are yet to be reviewed and were uploaded on the preprint server medRxiv. (bit.ly\/3nViYIf)  \u201cPREMATURE\u201d  Gilead say the Solidarity conclusions, lacking scrutiny from other scientists, were premature.  \u201cWe are concerned the data from this open-label global trial has not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion, particularly given the limitations of the trial design,\u201d it said.  Remdesivir got emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 1, and has been authorized for use in several countries.  During the Solidarity study, trials of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir\/ritonavir were stopped in June after they proved ineffective, but the studies of Gilead\u2019s drug and interferon continued in more than 500 hospitals and 30 countries.  WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said this week the U.N. health agency was now looking at other, emerging treatment options such as monoclonal anti-bodies, immunomodulators and some newer anti-viral drugs.  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O is developing a monoclonal antibody that Trump received for his COVID-19 infection.  Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N said on Tuesday a trial of its COVID-19 antibody treatment had been paused by the U.S. government because of a safety concern.","284":"The closely-watched drug has moved markets in the past few weeks and on Wednesday broader markets once again rose on the data and Gilead shares also jumped 9%.  In Gilead's study, 62% of patients treated early were discharged from the hospital, compared with 49% of patients who were treated late, the company said in a press release (bit.ly\/3bPsqqe).  The trial was testing 397 patients, evaluating the safety and efficacy of five-day and 10-day dosing regimens of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of COVID-19.  Interest in Gilead\u2019s drug have been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, and doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.  The company also said a separate trial by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases had met the main goal of the study, but it did not provide details on the data.","285":"NEW YORK\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Well-timed trades in Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O options ahead of good news on the biopharmaceutical company's COVID-19 drug treatment may draw regulatory scrutiny, experts said.

Those gains were dwarfed by a price jump in bullish options which traded in unusually high volume just hours before the report and which more than doubled in value overnight.  Remdesivir subsequently received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s emergency use authorization to treat COVID-19 patients on May 1.  Gilead has not heard from regulators regarding the trades, company spokesman Chris Ridley said, declining any additional comment on the matter.  Early in the trading day on April 16, with Gilead shares hovering around $75, four large blocks of its options were purchased for about $1.5 million each. Those unusually large trades bet that Gilead\u2019s shares would rise north of $80 to $87.50 by mid August.  \u201cThey are pretty big trades,\u201d said Henry Schwartz, president of options analytics firm Trade Alert, adding that the fact they were made around the same time was also unusual. \u201cIt stands out,\u201d he said.  In one of the trades, 3,143 calls betting Gilead\u2019s shares would rise above $85 by Aug. 21 were purchased for a total of $1.6 million. Through April 17, the value of those contracts jumped to $3.02 million, according to a Reuters analysis of trading data. The other three trades also made large gains.  On Friday, Gilead shares closed at $77.83.  (GRAPHIC: Timely trades - )  \u201cThis looks problematic,\u201d said Howard Fischer, a partner with law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  \u201cWhen there is a specific spike in the firm\u2019s trading activity \u2014 right before a finding is announced \u2014 it can become a red flag to regulators,\u201d he said.  The SEC scans for unusual trades ahead of news announcements and has used such data to bring insider trading probes in the past, public filings show. The agency declined to comment.  While it is possible the trades were fortuitous, driven by bullish sentiment for drugmakers amid the pandemic, options trades in other pharmaceutical names did not show similar activity, according to a Reuters review.  \u201cIt does look like somebody had some sort of reason to pick that time of day to put a lot of capital to work on Gilead,\u201d said Schwartz.","286":"FILE PHOTO: A Gilead Sciences, Inc. logo is seen outside the company headquarters in Foster City, California, U.S. May 1, 2018.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Shares of Gilead were up 2.5% in extended trading.  Gilead said the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect its sales, including its treatments for hepatitis C and HIV, due to fewer people going to their doctors. It expects a gradual recovery in underlying market dynamics starting the second quarter of this year.  Remdesivir, which is sold under the brand name Veklury, brought in $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.34 billion. Excluding Veklury, Gilead said its quarterly sales fell 7%.  The company said remdesivir continues to be a critical tool during the COVID-19 pandemic, forecasting 2021 sales of up to $3 billion for the drug.  Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said that unlike current COVID-19 vaccines and some other drugs, remdesivir does not target the spike proteins of the coronavirus, which are altered in some recently-identified, more transmissible variants of the virus.  \u201cWe have not so far seen mutations that would impact the efficacy of remdesivir,\u201d he said during a conference call.  Gilead said it continues to work on an inhaled version of the COVID-19 drug - which is given intravenously to hospitalized patients - but more clinical study is required.  For 2021, the California-based company projected an adjusted earnings range with a midpoint of $7.10 per share, on product sales with a midpoint of $24.4 billion, ahead of respective Wall Street estimates of $6.85 per share and $24.27 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cWe think the $7 number is higher than where investors were looking for and provides a good base to continue to grow,\u201d Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in an email.

REUTERS\/Loriene Perera\/File Photo  (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc\u2019s two-drug HIV regimen Dovato was successful in suppressing the AIDS-causing virus in patients over 48 weeks at the same level of a previous three-drug treatment in a late-stage trial, the drugmaker said on Wednesday.  Dovato, a combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine, was approved in the United States in April for newly-diagnosed patients, boosting the British drugmaker\u2019s prospects against Gilead Sciences Inc, which currently leads the HIV treatment market.  Liberium analyst Graham Doyle said the study results will add to the data package supporting Dovato as GSK aims to convince doctors that two drug therapies are just as effective as triple therapies.  GSK is betting that a shift to using two drugs rather than three will boost its sales by offering patients a therapy with fewer potentially toxic side effects.  The study evaluated the effectiveness of Dovato, a combination of dolutegravir and lamivudine, in adults with the HIV-1 virus who switched to the regimen from at least a triple combination containing Gilead Sciences\u2019 Descovy, the British company\u2019s HIV drugs division ViiV said.  ViiV also said adults who used Dovato did not develop any resistance to the treatment.  GSK already has a two-drug regimen Juluca on the market, but only for HIV patients that have received prior treatment.

Gilead bought Kite in 2017 for $12 billion to acquire Yescarta.  Sales of Yescarta, which won U.S. approval in October 2017 and carries a list price of $373,000, were slow to take off due to a range of issues, including high hospital costs and a complicated manufacturing process.  Global sales for the first nine months of 2019 were $334 million. Analysts forecast annual sales reaching $1 billion by 2022 and climbing from there, according to Refinitiv data.  Yescarta belongs to a new class of cancer treatments called CAR-T therapy, seen as potentially revolutionary due to their promise of long-term survival with a one-time treatment for certain deadly blood cancers, such as relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphomas.  The treatment is made by harvesting T-cells from a patient\u2019s own immune system. They are then engineered to more efficiently recognize and attack the cancer cells before being infused back into the patient.  Yescarta competes with Kymriah from Novartis AG, while several companies also are developing CAR-T treatments, including some that aim to be off-the-shelf rather than patient specific.  Gilead also reported that steroids given to one group of patients helped reduce the risk of a serious complication associated with CAR T therapy called cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can cause a range of dangerous symptoms including fever and neurological problems.  \u201cEarly steroid intervention has the potential to reduce the rate of severe CRS and neurologic events while appearing to maintain comparably impressive efficacy for Yescarta,\u201d Dr. Max Topp, a researcher from University Hospital of Wuerzburg, Germany who worked on the study, said in a statement.","294":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O hopes to soon introduce a pricey new pill to prevent HIV in people at risk of contracting the infection, but the drugmaker faces opposition from an unusual source: patient advocates.  FILE PHOTO: A Gilead Sciences, Inc. logo is seen outside the company headquarters in Foster City, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  Such groups have traditionally lobbied for insurance coverage of newer HIV drugs regardless of expense. But at least three U.S. organizations now question whether Gilead\u2019s Descovy would be the best option for most people at risk of exposure.  A generic version of the current prevention pill, Truvada, is due in the United States in September 2020, which should bring down costs and give many more people access to the therapy, they say.  Their resistance is being echoed by some insurers, which are hinting that price will be a barrier to providing coverage for Descovy.  \u201cBased on the science that we have seen thus far, there is no indication that everyone needs to be taking Descovy,\u201d Tim Horn, director of medication access and pricing at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD) told Reuters.  \u201cWe see no reason to push back against commercial payers or Medicaid programs that would move to prefer generic Truvada (for prevention), provided there are guard-rails that do not deny access to Descovy for those who need Descovy,\u201d he said.  Truvada, also made by Gilead, has been used to treat people infected with HIV since 2004. It was approved as a daily pill for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, in 2012, and remains the only preventive therapy on the U.S. market.  Descovy, shown to be less toxic than Truvada to the kidneys and bones in clinical trials, was approved in 2016 for people already infected with HIV. Advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended on Wednesday that the agency approve Descovy to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV infection in men and transgender women who have sex with men.  When asked about the patient groups\u2019 criticism, Gilead said Descovy is safer than Truvada and offers more efficient delivery of its antiviral component, resulting in greater concentration of the drug in cells where HIV infection can occur.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1.1 million people in the United States could benefit from PrEP. High-risk populations include people having sex with someone who is infected with HIV or who share injection needle equipment. Gilead said 213,000 people were taking Truvada for HIV prevention in the second quarter of this year.  The company has pledged to help the Trump administration achieve a goal of stopping the spread of HIV in the United States within a decade. In May, Gilead said it would donate enough Truvada annually to supply 200,000 uninsured Americans with PrEP until Descovy is approved for HIV prevention, then switch patients to the new drug.  PRICING IMMUNITY  HIV drugmakers have largely been shielded from generic competition. Each time one of their therapies came close to losing patent protection, scientific advances allowed them to introduce a new drug that improved on its predecessor, often with a higher price.  Both Truvada and Descovy are priced at $21,000 per year, before discounts provided to public and private health insurers. In the first half of 2019, Gilead\u2019s Truvada sales totaled $1.3 billion. Descovy sales amounted to $700 million and are expected to rise to $3 billion dollars annually by 2024, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA is due to sell a generic version of Truvada next year. More significant price competition is expected when other competitors emerge in 2021.  Teva\u2019s Chief Executive Kare Schultz expressed confidence that he will find a market for generic Truvada, and said the company has held preliminary talks with U.S. payers.  Health insurers \u201cwill normally say that if there was something that was the gold standard then they will prefer to use the generic for the gold standard rather than switch to a new product,\u201d Schultz told Reuters.  Some prominent patient advocates, including community-based Treatment Action Group (TAG) and NASTAD, which advocates for public health, told Reuters that Gilead has not proven the newer treatment provides enough of a benefit to justify its use beyond people at risk of kidney or bone density problems. At a time when HIV drug prices are soaring, their views may provide support to health insurers who routinely push generic drug use to curb costs.  Jeremiah Johnson, HIV project director at TAG, told Reuters he is open to a conversation about health plans requiring individuals try a generic drug before using a significantly more expensive regimen like Descovy.  TAG and PrEP4All Collaboration, which aims to expand access to PrEP for all Americans, earlier this year called for the FDA to convene the advisory committee review of Descovy, citing concerns over Gilead\u2019s trial data and pricing practices.  Not all experts are as vocal in questioning Gilead\u2019s aims. Dr. Paul Volberding, director of the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, told Reuters that Descovy for PrEP should be made available to people that have insurance to pay for it, while a generic could make sense for people with less access to coverage.  \u201cThe safety difference is small, but real,\u201d he said.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters that Descovy may provide an advantage because it remains in the body for longer than Truvada. \u201cIf you miss a dose or two it is unlikely that there is going to be a gap in protection,\u201d he said.  But some health insurers, which largely cover Truvada for PrEP, are not convinced of a significant benefit from Descovy.  \u201cBased on the current information and data available to us at this time, we believe generic Truvada will be the most cost effective option for PrEP,\u201d said David Lassen, chief clinical officer at Prime Therapeutics, which manages pharmacy benefits for Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans.  Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefit manager owned by Cigna Corp CI.N, said cost is a big barrier to U.S. use of Truvada for PrEP.  \u201cWe would certainly look to leverage cost savings from generic Truvada to help improve affordability for patients and payers,\u201d the company told Reuters.","295":"The U.S. Justice Department has moved to dismiss a closely watched whistleblower lawsuit accusing Gilead Sciences Inc of covertly arranging to have key ingredients for HIV medications made at a Chinese facility that had quality control issues.

Earlier in September, center-left presidential candidate Marina Silva and her running mate filed a request asking that the patent be overturned, saying such a move would significantly reduce costs for patients.  Sovaldi was the first of a new generation of drugs that are effectively a cure for the serious liver disease. But despite Sovaldi representing a major treatment advance, Gilead came under intense criticism for a price that initially came to $1,000 a pill in the United States.

The company said a study being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAIS) met its main goal in helping patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Results from that trial have been highly anticipated because it compares how patients who received remdesivir fared versus patients who did not.

More detailed information on that study will be provided at a later date, Gilead said.  Gilead also provided data on a study that it has conducted in dozens of medical centers, which does not compare the use of remdesivir against a placebo.  In that trial, Gilead said 62% of patients treated early with remdesivir were discharged from the hospital, compared with 49% of patients who were treated late.

A draft study abstract released inadvertently by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said remdesivir failed to improve patients\u2019 condition or reduce the pathogen\u2019s presence in the bloodstream. The drugmaker said the findings were inconclusive because the study was terminated early.  Interest in Gilead\u2019s drug has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for COVID-19, and doctors are desperate for anything that might alter the course of the disease that attacks the lungs and can shut down other organs in extremely severe cases.  Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is being tried against COVID-19 because it is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host\u2019s immune system.  The Gilead-led study enrolled patients with blood oxygen levels of 94% or lower but who were not on mechanical ventilators. Normal oxygen saturation levels are 95% to 100%.

The \u201canecdotal data ... looks promising on the surface and continues to support some potential for the drug to be active in certain COVID-19 patients,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note. \u201cNonetheless, there are major limitations to contextualizing and interpreting this data.\u201d  Interest in Gilead\u2019s drug amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been high. The New England Journal of Medicine last week published an analysis showing that two-thirds of a small group of severely ill COVID-19 patients saw their condition improve after treatment with remdesivir.  The paper\u2019s author called the findings \u201chopeful,\u201d but cautioned it is difficult to interpret the results since they do not include comparison to a control group, the patient numbers were small, the details being disclosed were limited, and the follow-up time was relatively short.  The U.S National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in February began an 800-patient trial that randomly assigns patients to treatment with either remdesivir or a placebo. Those results are not expected until after Gilead\u2019s trial reads out.  Shares of Gilead, which closed at $76.54 in regular trading, were up 16% at $89.10 after hours.","321":"FILE PHOTO: Two ampules of Gilead Sciences Inc's antiviral drug remdesivir are pictured during a news conference at the University Hospital Eppendorf (UKE) in Hamburg, Germany, April 8, 2020, as the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues. Ulrich Perrey\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Europe\u2019s drugs regulator on Friday recommended changing some terms of the conditional approval given to antiviral drug remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment, to make clear the conditions under which it can be used.  Doubts over remdesivir\u2019s effectiveness were raised after the World Health Organization (WHO) last month said the drug should not be used for COVID-19 patients, regardless of how ill they are, just months after Europe and the United States approved the treatment.  The new terms of the conditional marketing authorisation in Europe add that a patient could need \"low- or high-flow oxygen or other non-invasive ventilation at start of treatment,\" according to the European Medicines Agency. (bit.ly\/2W4BQb9)  The drug, made by U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc, is already indicated for use in Europe in patients aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg, who are also suffering from pneumonia and require oxygen support.  The European Union in October agreed to pay more than 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to Gilead for a six-month supply.  Research by British scientists showed remdesivir\u2019s benefits, but a WHO-lead trial found there was no evidence the drug improves survival or reduces the need for ventilation, a claim Gilead has questioned.  The top U.S. infectious disease medical association had backed remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment days after the WHO warning.  A EU conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year in the 27-nation bloc before all necessary data on its efficacy and side-effects are available.","322":"FILE PHOTO: An ampule of Ebola drug Remdesivir is pictured during a news conference at the University Hospital Eppendorf (UKE) in Hamburg, Germany, April 8, 2020, as the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues.

Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of severe inflammatory disease in infants who are arriving in hospital with high fever and swollen arteries.  Three U.S. children infected with the virus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns in Britain, Italy and Spain, a specialist treating them told Reuters on Tuesday.  \u201cI want to emphasise, for all the parents out there, the vast, vast majority of children who get COVID will have mild symptoms and recover completely,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert, told a virtual news conference on Wednesday.

The WHO\u2019s clinical network has discussed the report from Britain about a small number of children with an inflammatory response, WHO epidemiologist Dr. Maria van Kerkhove said.  \u201cThere are some recent rare descriptions of children in some European countries that have had this inflammatory syndrome, which is similar to Kawasaki syndrome, but it seems to be very rare,\u201d she said.  \u201cWe have asked the global network of clinicians to be alert on this so they capture information systematically, so we can better understand and guide treatment.\u201d  Ryan, asked about Sweden\u2019s strategy of shunning lockdowns and allowing most schools and businesses to remain open, said: \u201cIf we are to reach a \u2018new normal\u2019, in many ways Sweden represents a future model.\u201d  \u201cWhat it has done differently is that it really, really has trusted its own communities to implement that physical distancing,\u201d he said, adding that Sweden had put in place a \u201cvery strong public health policy\u201d.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus defended the agency\u2019s record in handling the pandemic since the new virus emerged late last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.  The Geneva-based U.N. body has been heavily criticised in recent weeks, especially by its top donor, the United States, which has cut off funding.  Tedros presented a timeline of what the agency knew when in the lead-up to declaring COVID-19 a global emergency on Jan. 30.  \u201cFrom the beginning, the WHO has acted quickly and decisively to respond to warn the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWe sounded the alarm early, and we sounded it often.\u201d","324":"(Reuters) - As evidence grew this spring that the drug remdesivir was helping COVID-19 patients, some Wall Street investors bet on analysts\u2019 estimates that its maker, Gilead Sciences Inc, could charge up to $10,000 for the treatment.  Steven Pearson, Founder and President of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), poses for a portrait for Reuters at ICER\u2019s offices in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., January 2, 2020. Picture taken January 2, 2020. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder To match Special Report USA-DRUGPRICING\/LOBBYING  Then a small but increasingly influential drug-pricing research organization, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), said the treatment only justified a price between $2,800 and $5,000. Shortly after, Gilead announced it would charge about $3,100 for a five-day treatment and $5,700 for ten days - in line with the ICER recommendation.  The episode illustrates the growing power of the Boston-based nonprofit to hold down U.S. drug prices. Over the past five years, ICER has pressured drugmakers to lower the cost of nearly 100 drugs. It aims to play a similar role with emerging COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Health insurers increasingly use ICER's fair-value analyses to limit access to expensive drugs or to negotiate steeper discounts with drugmakers. (For a graphic on drugs ICER has rated overpriced, click tmsnrt.rs\/3hiYULv )  The industry has moved aggressively to combat the threat to its profits in two ways: With open criticism of ICER\u2019s formula and with a stealthier campaign to undermine its credibility through proxies, including veterans\u2019 groups and organizations that claim to advocate for patients but have ties to the pharmaceutical industry, Reuters found in a review of industry connections and funding among groups targeting ICER.  Two such groups \u2013 the Partnership to Improve Patient Care (PIPC) and Value our Health \u2013 are led by employees of Thorn Run Partners, a Washington-based lobbying and public relations firm that counts nearly a dozen drugmakers as clients. PIPC denied it is part of a larger industry-financed proxy campaign to undermine ICER\u2019s impact. Thorn Run declined to comment, and Value Our Health did not respond to inquiries.  As remdesivir gained momentum, PIPC complained to ICER in a June letter that its methodology, which examines how a drug improves patient quality of life, was unfair for COVID-19 drugs. It also held a webinar for patients criticizing ICER\u2019s methods.  The group\u2019s chairman, former U.S. Democratic Representative Tony Coelho, argued in the letter that ICER\u2019s methods yield a flawed value assessment for COVID-19 drugs that could lead insurers or government programs to limit coverage to the elderly and people with disabilities because ICER\u2019s formula attributes a lower value to their medicines than those for healthier patients. In a statement to Reuters, Coelho attacked ICER\u2019s formula as a flawed \u201cone-size-fits-all assessment.\u201d  Gilead also pushed ICER for a higher price during its remdesivir review. The firm told Reuters that ICER\u2019s assessment failed to consider savings from shorter hospital stays and underestimated how much insurers or the government would be willing to pay.  Remdesivir is the only COVID-19 treatment ICER has assessed so far. Steven Pearson, a Harvard academic who started ICER, said it will likely review more coronavirus treatments if they make it to market, including potentially those being developed by Regeneron and Eli Lilly and Co that use antibodies to generate an immune response. The two companies declined to comment.  ICER\u2019s assessments are not used to deny care to patients based on their health, Pearson said. Rather, the formula helps insurers or government programs choose the most cost-effective treatment for a specific condition, based on its price and benefit in providing a better quality of life. Pearson pointed out that the formula has long been used in the health systems of countries including England, Canada, the Netherlands and Sweden.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think of them as hotbeds of discrimination against sick people,\u201d he said, \u201cand neither are we.\u201d  PHONY GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN  The industry has followed the same playbook before: soliciting criticism from outside groups - some of which it finances or staffs - to create the impression of a broad-based patient uprising against ICER\u2019s pricing assessments rather than an industry push to protect profits.  Last year, ICER invited input as it revamped its assessment methods. Two of more than 50 comment letters came from six California veterans\u2019 groups, who blasted an ICER contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), saying its formula denies veterans care and \u201cinherently discriminates\u201d against people with disabilities.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  But no one from the veterans\u2019 groups wrote the complaints. Officials from the organizations told Reuters they lent their names to letters that were composed instead by Peter Conaty, the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s go-to lobbyist in California. A half dozen health policy specialists told Reuters that the veterans\u2019 complaints look like part of an \u201castroturf\u201d campaign \u2013 a phony grassroots movement backed by corporate interests. Conaty did not respond to requests for comment.  Such under-the-radar PR efforts underscore the industry\u2019s determination to protect its pricing power in an era when expensive new drug therapies are increasingly under fire for their role in soaring U.S. healthcare costs. The battle for influence over drug prices could have far-reaching effects on consumers, insurers, employers and the government, industry and policy experts said.  Matt Eyles, president of insurance lobby America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said ICER plays a key role in holding down \u201cout of control\u201d drug prices. \u201cBig Pharma is doing everything in its power - including pushing other groups to levy false claims of analytical bias and discrimination - to undermine ICER\u2019s long history of independence and its commitment to bringing value into drug pricing.\u201d  The VA, which covers health care for more than 9 million people - veterans and their family members - started using ICER drug-value assessments in 2017 to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical firms. VA spokeswoman Ndidi Mojay said the agency uses ICER\u2019s research for those negotiations but not to limit treatments. The VA strives to provide veterans the best possible care and taxpayers the best value, Mojay said.  \u201cICER helps the department do just that,\u201d she said.  PRICING QUALITY OF LIFE  ICER uses a decades-old formula called the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) \u2013 the cost of one year of good health for one patient \u2013 to estimate fair value. European nations have long used QALY to guide their drug coverage, and ICER defends it as the gold standard.  The organization is filling a void left by the federal government, which does not negotiate drug prices for Medicare, the healthcare program for disabled and older Americans, and Medicaid, which serves the poor. Pharmaceutical industry representatives say they fear that ICER is slowly taking over that function for the government and insurers. Congress banned the Medicare program from using QALY to evaluate drug prices in the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - after the industry lobbied for such a provision.  The industry\u2019s largest U.S. trade group - the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA - has publicly criticized ICER\u2019s formula as undervaluing drugs, arguing it fails to consider certain patient benefits, such as the ability to return to work. Randy Burkholder, one of PhRMA\u2019s top lobbyists, called the method \u201cfundamentally and intractably\u201d flawed in an interview. The National Pharmaceutical Council, an industry-financed research group, has regularly criticized ICER in the media, arguing drugmakers will invest less in future treatments if ICER\u2019s recommendations limit prices.  Groups including PIPC are parroting the industry arguments while claiming to represent patients - without disclosing their industry ties, according to a Reuters review of the groups\u2019 press releases, blogs, webcasts and letters. Value our Health - which has been represented by Shea McCarthy, a Thorn Run public relations partner and lobbyist - is one of a half dozen organizations who has regularly flooded health and policy journalists with emails lambasting ICER.  Sara van Geertruyden, PIPC\u2019s executive director, is also a Thorn Run public relations partner. She said the group advocates for patients and denied that PIPC is a proxy for pharmaceutical-industry interests or that it has concealed its industry ties. She blasted ICER as a \u201cpayer-focused\u201d organization delivering skewed assessments that allow insurers to deny patients access to drugs. \u201cIs it any surprise patients would be concerned?\u201d she asked.  Nicole Longo, spokeswoman for the PhRMA trade group, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about whether it was directing a campaign through proxies to undermine ICER. Longo provided PhRMA\u2019s comments to ICER on its remdesivir pricing assessment, which called its methodology biased and \u201cdesigned to devalue remdesivir and other COVID-19 treatments.\u201d  The National Pharmaceutical Council\u2019s Interim Chief Executive Officer Robert DuBois said that it does not advocate or lobby for the drug industry. ICER\u2019s methodology is an inaccurate measure that does not fully account for how a drug helps patients or society, he said.  In January, after ICER called new sickle cell treatments too pricey in a draft report, Value our Health, PIPC and sickle-cell patient groups pushed patients and caregivers to report disease-related costs to ICER to \u201chelp ICER put a price tag\u201d on sickle-cell expenses. ICER postponed the review process due to COVID-19 and has not issued a final report.  Last fall, Reuters reported that CVS Health Corp, one of the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers, decided to scale back a new program for employers that would exclude coverage of drugs that ICER says are not cost effective. The move followed a pressure campaign by PIPC against CVS. At the time, CVS cited fierce criticism from patient groups as the reason for backtracking. CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said, in a statement to Reuters, that CVS still uses ICER\u2019s analyses in a drug-coverage plan for its own employees and a small number of other clients.  The PhRMA Foundation - the trade group\u2019s nonprofit public health advocacy arm - has spent $3 million on research into alternative methods of determining a drug\u2019s value, according to foundation announcements. Foundation President Eileen Cannon said that the foundation consults with PhRMA, the industry group, but makes decisions on academic grants independently.  ICER responds to industry accusations of discrimination by arguing that its review process is flexible and considers additional measures besides QALY when warranted. As an example, ICER points to its verdict on Luxturna, an $850,000-per-patient gene therapy from Spark Therapeutics Inc, now part of Roche Holding AG. Luxturna improves the sight of children who have a rare genetic disease causing blindness. Though the QALY numbers did not support that price, ICER determined that Luxturna was cost-effective because it reduced the burden on the children\u2019s\u2019 caregivers.  PhRMA director of policy Lauren Neves the Luxturna example was an exception to ICER\u2019s typical practice.  DRIVING DOWN DRUG PRICES, PROFITS  ICER started focusing on drug prices in 2015 and has since evaluated nearly 100 treatments, taking on those that insurers worry will raise overall health-care costs. ICER has considered only a handful of those therapies to be cost-effective at full list price, and only a third to be fairly priced after considering drugmaker discounts, according to data that ICER provided to Reuters.  Big Pharma had its first big ICER problem in 2015 when the group recommended to health insurers that two new drugs to treat high cholesterol should cost about one-third of the manufacturers\u2019 prices. The analysis prompted insurers to sharply limit use of the treatments and eventually forced drugmakers Amgen Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA to slash prices. The companies declined to comment.  Today, the largest U.S. health insurers, such as Cigna Corp and CVS, use ICER findings to negotiate discounts. New York\u2019s Medicaid program has used ICER to push drug companies to lower prices, and other states are considering it.  In July, the New York state Medicaid board voted to demand that Biogen Inc sell its spinal muscular atrophy drug to the state at the ICER-prescribed price of about $77,000 for a typical year of treatments - an 80% discount off Biogen\u2019s list price.  Biogen spokeswoman Anna Robinson said that the firm disagreed with the steep discount and hoped to work with New York to ensure patients get the treatment.  PANDEMIC RAISES THE STAKES  With fewer than 30 employees and a budget of about $6 million in 2018, ICER is bankrolled mostly by Houston billionaire John Arnold, the former Enron energy trader and hedge fund owner who has taken on drug-pricing as one of many philanthropic efforts. ICER also takes money from companies on both sides of the drug-pricing debate - insurers and pharma - but says that they together provide only about 20% of its revenue.  Arnold told Reuters in an interview that he finances ICER because past efforts to foster independent drug-price analysis have been co-opted by the pharmaceutical industry and tainted by its money.  \u201cThe status quo works very well in the industry, so it is important for them to label any proposed reform as something radical and something that won\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is not much debate about whether the system we have to price pharmaceutical drugs is broken.\u201d  ICER\u2019s Pearson said the coronavirus pandemic has raised the importance of the organization\u2019s work as the pricing of vaccines and treatments will impact millions of Americans amid a faltering economy.  \u201cThere is a heightened public awareness and sensitivity to the risk of high prices being unfair,\u201d he said.","325":"SEOUL, July 1 (Reuters) - South Korea started supplying Gilead\u2019s antiviral drug for the treatment of the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The price tag is slightly below the range of $2,520 to $2,800 suggested last week by U.S. drug pricing research group the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) after British researchers said they found that the cheap, widely available steroid dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality among severely ill COVID-19 patients.  Remdesivir is expected to be in high demand as one of the only treatments so far shown to alter the course of COVID-19. After the intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a clinical trial, it won emergency use authorization in the United States and full approval in Japan.  The drug is believed to be most effective in treating patients earlier in the course of disease than dexamethasone, which reduced deaths in patients requiring supportive oxygen and those on a ventilator. Still, remdesivir in its currently formulation, is only being used on patients sick enough to require hospitalization as a five-day treatment course.  The company is developing an inhaled version that could be used outside a hospital setting.  For U.S. patients with commercial insurance, Gilead said it will charge $3,120 per course, or $520 per vial. That is a 33% increase over the $390 per vial Gilead said it will charge governments of developed countries and U.S. patients in government healthcare programs.  \u2018OUTRAGEOUS PRICE FOR A VERY MODEST DRUG\u2019  In an open letter, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O\u2019Day said the price is well below the value it provides given that early hospital discharges could save around $12,000 per patient in the United States.  Patient advocates have argued that the cost should be lower since remdesivir was developed with financial support from the U.S. government.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, said it was \u201can outrageous price for a very modest drug, which taxpayer funding saved from a scrap heap of failures.\u201d  Remdesivir had previously failed as an Ebola treatment and has not shown that it can reduce COVID-19 deaths.  Gilead also said it agreed to continue to send most of its supply of remdesivir to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with the agency and states set to manage allocation to U.S. hospitals until the end of September.  There are currently more cases of COVID-19 in the United States than in Europe, with several U.S. states hitting new records for numbers of cases.  HHS has been distributing the drug since May and was due to run out after this week. A senior HHS official said the agency expects the drug will soon be a scarce resource, and so it wanted to remain involved in allocating it.  The agency said it secured more than 500,000 remdesivir courses for U.S. hospitals through September. That represents all of Gilead\u2019s projected production for July and 90% of its production in August and September, in addition to an allocation for clinical trials, HHS said.  Once supplies are less constrained, HHS will stop managing the allocation, Gilead said. The company did not discuss its supply strategy for developed nations outside the United States.  Remdesivir\u2019s price has been a topic of intense debate. Experts have said Gilead would need to avoid appearing to take advantage of a health crisis for profits.  Gilead shares were about flat on Monday.  Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada forecast the drug could generate $2.3 billion in revenue 2020, helping offset more than $1 billion in development and distribution costs. They said additional profits could be limited because vaccines and better treatments are on the horizon.  The European Union\u2019s healthcare regulator last week recommended conditional approval of the drug when used in the critically ill.  Gilead has linked up with generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan, including Cipla Ltd and Hetero Labs Ltd, to make and supply remdesivir in 127 developing countries.

Remdesivir has been available under an FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) since May, after a study led by the National Institutes of Health showed it reduced hospital stays by five days.  However, the World Health Organization (WHO) last week said its global trial of COVID-19 therapies found that remdesivir did not have a substantial effect on patients\u2019 length of hospital stay or chances of survival. That study has not been reviewed by outside experts.  Gilead has questioned the potential for bias in the WHO study, which was not \u201cblinded,\u201d meaning that patients and their doctors were aware of which treatments were being used.  Remdesivir, which will be sold under the brand name Veklury, costs $3,120 for a five-day treatment course, or $2,340 for government purchasers such as the Department of Veterans Affairs. Shares of Gilead rose 4.3% in after hours trading to $63.30.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Remdesivir has become the standard of care for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 even though it has not been shown to improve survival. The drug also has not been proven to significantly help moderately-ill patients, and many doctors remain wary of using it in patients with less severe illness.  \u201cThe formal FDA approval doesn\u2019t change our (sales) estimates or outlook for remdesivir given it has already been branded standard-of-care prior to formal approval,\u201d Raymond James analyst Steven Seedhouse said in a research note, calling the prescribing guidelines and approval \u201cpretty much a best case for Gilead,\u201d given the WHO results questioning remdesivir\u2019s benefits.  Gilead said it is currently meeting demand for the drug in the United States and anticipates meeting global demand by the end of October.  The company said Veklury has regulatory approvals or temporary authorizations in about 50 additional countries.  Also on Thursday, the FDA issued a new emergency use authorization for remdesivir to treat hospitalized pediatric patients under age 12 who weigh enough to receive an intravenous drug.  Gilead said it is still working to understand the full potential of remdesivir, in different settings and as part of combination therapy approaches. The company is also developing an inhaled version of the drug that might be used outside a hospital setting, if approved.","336":"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could update its emergency use authorization for Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O drug remdesivir to include patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19, despite mixed trial results, the company's top research executive said on Friday.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The FDA in May okayed sales of remdesivir on an emergency basis for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, after trial data showed that the antiviral drug helped shorten their hospital recovery time.  Company data published on Friday showed that a 5-day course of intravenous remdesivir modestly helped less severely ill COVID-19 patients, but a 10-day course did not show a benefit.  Diana Brainard, head of clinical research at Gilead, also told Reuters that the company\u2019s formal FDA application for the drug, submitted earlier this month, seeks approval for use in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19.  The 600-patient analysis, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that moderately ill patients treated with the antiviral drug for up to 5 days had significantly higher odds of improvement in certain areas, such as whether or not they needed supplemental oxygen, compared to patients given standard treatment.  Brainard said the clinical importance of the benefit for those patients was uncertain, due to continued questions about how best to measure patient outcomes other than survival.  Differing trial results for remdesivir raise \u201cthe question of whether the discrepancies are artifacts of study design choices, including patient populations, or whether the drug is less efficacious than hoped,\u201d according to a JAMA editorial accompanying the study.  The study in moderately ill COVID-19 patients showed that 11 days after starting treatment, 65% of the 10-day remdesivir patients, 70% of the 5-day patients and 60% of the standard care patients had left the hospital.  Side effects seen more frequently in the remdesivir groups included nausea, low blood potassium levels, and headache.  The JAMA editorial said important questions remain regarding the efficacy of remdesivir, including which patients are most likely to benefit from the drug, the optimal duration of therapy, the drug\u2019s impact on clinical outcomes, and its relative effect if combined with generic steroid treatments.  Shares of Gilead rose 45 cents to close at $66.50 Friday on the Nasdaq exchange.","337":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - One of Bangladesh\u2019s largest drugmakers, Beximco Pharmaceuticals, will start production this month of the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which has shown promise in fighting the new coronavirus, a senior company executive said on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO: Garment workers return from a workplace as factories reopened after the government has eased the restrictions amid concerns over the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Dhaka, Bangladesh, May 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Mohammad Ponir Hossain\/File Photo  Remdesivir, a drug developed by Gilead Sciences, has grabbed attention as one of the most promising treatments for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 250,000 people.  U.S. drug authorities granted emergency use authorisation last week, paving the way for its broader use in U.S. hospitals, after Gilead provided data showing the drug had helped COVID-19 patients.  The company plans to price the drug, which is given via intravenous infusion, at between 5,000 and 6,000 takas per vial ($59-$71\/per vial), Beximco\u2019s Chief Operating Officer Rabbur Reza told Reuters, adding a patient might need anywhere between 5 and 11 vials.  \u201cWe will only know exactly how much a patient needs once studies are complete,\u201d Reza said. \u201cWe do expect the Bangladesh government will try to cover some of the price of the drug.\u201d  Production will begin this month, initially for domestic use, Reza added.  Beximco\u2019s pricing indicates a course of remdesivir treatment could cost between $295 and $781 per patient in the south Asian country depending on the severity of the case, the number of vials required and the final pricing of the drug.  The figures are a first indication of how the drug will be priced, as countries around the world struggle to control the coronavirus that has infected more than 3.5 million people worldwide.  Gilead has donated an initial batch of 1.5 million vials of to help patients in the United States, but has yet to announce its pricing.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), which assesses the effectiveness of drugs to determine appropriate prices, put the cost of producing a 10-day course of remdesivir at $10, but suggested the price could rise to $4,500 based on patient benefits shown in clinical trials.  AFFORDABILITY WAIVER  Gilead\u2019s patent on remdesivir in theory means it has exclusive rights to make it, but international trade rules allow nations defined by the United Nations as least-developed countries, including Bangladesh, to ignore such patents and make drugs more affordable in those markets.  Bangladesh would be allowed to export the drug to other least-developed countries and some European countries have also written to Beximco seeking to import the drug, said Reza, declining to name the countries.  \u201cWe can seek approval from the government to export it for emergencies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we should be able to supply to our people first, that is number one for us.\u201d  Bangladesh has so far reported 10,929 cases and 183 deaths from the disease, although some experts say the number of cases could be much higher given limited testing in the country.  WILL IT WORK?  Remdesivir was previously developed to treat the Ebola virus and did not work.  Its potential to help COVID-19 patients is based on ability to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, replicate themselves and potentially overwhelm their host\u2019s immune system.  Data from a trial by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States showed remdesivir reduced hospitalisation stays by 31% compared to a placebo treatment, but did not significantly improve survival.  Beximco expects to receive marketing approval for remdesivir from Bangladesh authorities by mid-May, following which it plans to launch commercial quantities to be distributed via the government, Reza told Reuters.  \u201cWe\u2019ll produce the drug depending on how much the Bangladesh government requires,\u201d he said, adding officials were checking on quantities required by domestic hospitals.  Reza said a Chinese firm was providing the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make the drug. That supply deal would allow it to make up to 100,000 units of the drug, he said.  Based in Dhaka, Beximco Pharma exports generic drugs to some 50 countries from the United States to South Africa and makes everything from plain generic drugs to complex molecules.  Seven other Bangladeshi pharma companies including Square Pharmaceuticals and Beacon Pharmaceutical have received government approval to develop the drug, Bangladeshi drug regulatory official Mohammad Salahuddin said.  \u201cFor now, we won\u2019t allow the companies to export remdesivir. First, they\u2019ll have to fulfil local demand, then we can consider it,\u201d he told Reuters.  In neighbouring India, drugmaker Cipla Ltd said it was also working on three antivirals, including favipiravir, remdesivir and bolaxavir, which could be used to treat COVID-19. It declined to comment on its launch or pricing plans.","338":"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O said on Tuesday it was in discussions with chemical and drug manufacturers to produce its experimental COVID-19 drug remdesivir for Europe, Asia and the developing world through at least 2022.  The drugmaker did not disclose details about the companies.  With several countries across the globe reeling from the virus outbreak, interest in remdesivir has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus.  Gilead last week received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s emergency use authorization for using remdesivir as a treatment against COVID-19, after the drugmaker provided data showing the drug had helped COVID-19 patients.  Gilead also said on Tuesday it was negotiating long-term licenses with several generic drugmakers in India and Pakistan to produce remdesivir for developing countries and that it would provide technology to aid the production.  One of Bangladesh's largest drugmakers, Beximco Pharmaceuticals BXPH.DH, will start remdesivir production this month, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a senior company executive.  Remdesivir was previously available only for patients enrolled in clinical trials or those cleared to get the drug under expanded use and compassionate use programs.  Gilead, which has already said it will donate the first 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, also previously said it was focused on making the drug accessible and affordable to as many people as possible upon approval.  Gilead said it was working to build a consortium of manufacturing partners to help maximize global supply of the drug, which requires scarce raw materials and specialized manufacturing capabilities with limited global capacity.  The company also said it was in advanced talks with UNICEF to deliver remdesivir using the agency\u2019s distribution networks.","339":"Sept 12 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc is nearing a deal to buy biopharmaceutical company Immunomedics Inc for more than $20 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Wednesday\u2019s early estimate for first-quarter U.S. GDP showed a 4.8% annualized decline. With coronavirus-related shutdowns torpedoing consumption and other economic activity only in late March, that\u2019s still partly guesswork \u2013 as were economists\u2019 forecasts, which ranged from 1% growth to a 15% rate of shrinkage, according to a Reuters poll. More predictable is that the second quarter will look much worse.  There\u2019s something for the V-shaped recovery optimists in the report, however. Inventories declined for the fourth straight quarter. In normal times, at least, that\u2019s a bit like tensioning a spring for a bounce because depleted stocks have to be replenished. Then again, there\u2019s a reminder that business investment, a sign of confidence in the future, was slipping for three quarters even before the appearance of Covid-19.

That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a great one. Gilead Sciences\u2019 remdesivir speeds up the recovery of advanced patients, according to a National Institutes of Health study. That was enough to add $6 billion to the biotechnology company\u2019s value and help send the S&P 500 Index up 3% on Wednesday.  Faster recoveries would help overtaxed hospital systems, thereby also helping doctors and patients. Yet there was only a hint, but no proof, of reduced mortality with Gilead\u2019s treatment. Even so, the drug should receive regulatory approval in record time \u2013 it was probably the best therapeutic already lying on the shelf. Though it\u2019s a positive start, it\u2019s hardly the harbinger of a return to normality. That will require better drugs, or a vaccine, which will take time.

In just weeks, the U.S. central bank\u2019s balance sheet has ballooned to over $6.5 trillion, $2 trillion more than ever before. The Fed probably isn\u2019t done yet. Interest rates, however, may have hit a limit.  Chair Jay Powell and his colleagues cut the low end of their target rate range to zero back on March 15. They don\u2019t subscribe to negative rates \u2013 yet \u2013 but certainly won\u2019t raise them again in Wednesday\u2019s policy announcement. More surprising is that according to a nifty tool from the CME, Fedwatch, traders have 100% confidence that rates are stuck at zero for at least seven more scheduled meetings, or nearly a year.

AstraZeneca\u2019s results have put rebel investors on the defensive. The $134 billion drugmaker said on Wednesday total sales in the first quarter were up 17% to $6.3 billion. Analysts had only been expecting product sales of $5.9 billion. The figures should be a relief to Chief Executive Pascal Soriot as he meets shareholders at the company\u2019s annual meeting.

The board has already cut Soriot\u2019s pension contribution to 20% of his 1.3 million-pound salary, from 30%. But it still far exceeds the retirement awards paid to AstraZeneca staff. BlackRock, the company\u2019s largest shareholder, has previously warned it will vote against the compensation of any CEO whose retirement awards that are out of line with workers.

Banks everywhere are cranking up bad debt charges due to the pandemic-induced slowdown. Yet Hong Kong looks a financial safe haven, despite being one of the first places outside mainland China to impose a lockdown. Standard Chartered on Wednesday said that first-quarter pre-tax profit in the special administrative region was broadly unchanged from the previous three months, at $378 million, even though bad debt charges almost doubled. Larger rival HSBC, a day earlier reported pre-tax profit of $2.85 billion in Hong Kong, up 9% from the previous quarter.  What\u2019s going on? Hong Kong has so far been successful in containing the Covid-19 outbreak. The government is supporting consumers and companies, though its biggest support package only came earlier this month. And Hong Kong banks started raising bad debt charges last year, as violent protests kept visitors away from the financial hub. The global slump will squeeze its economy, which is dependent on tourism and finance. So far, however, Hong Kong\u2019s financial system is holding up. (By Peter Thal Larsen)  UPHILL START. The gears are crunching badly at Daimler and Volkswagen. First-quarter operating profit at the two German automakers fell by roughly four-fifths year-on-year, the pair reported on Wednesday. But China offers a crumb of comfort. Daimler said April unit sales in the country were 97% of the comparable figure a year earlier, up from just 29% in March. And footfall in the company\u2019s dealerships was already back at levels seen in January before an economic lockdown was initiated. Volkswagen, meanwhile, said it expected China car sales would by July match 2019 trends.  Any resurgence would benefit VW more than Daimler. China accounts for around two-fifths of group sales at the Wolfsburg-based company, versus one-tenth at the Mercedes-Benz maker. That may be why boss Herbert Diess still expects VW to report an operating profit in 2020, albeit \u201cseverely\u201d below the prior year. Something is better than nothing. (By Christopher Thompson)  FACE-SAVING MOVE. Chinese electric-car maker BYD unveiled terrible results late on Tuesday, but it was surprisingly chipper about the months to come. The $20 billion company, which reported an 85% decline in quarterly net profit from a year earlier, expects the first-half bottom line to increase by as much as 24% once the April to June period is included. Amid a depressed market for vehicle sales, handset assembly will power some of the growth. Another unlikely source: surgical face masks.  It took less than two weeks for Shenzhen-based BYD to set up the new manufacturing process. By mid-March, the plant was running at full capacity churning out 5 million masks and 300,000 bottles of disinfectant daily. The likes of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors also have shifted gears into making protective and medical equipment. Given some of the virus-induced societal changes in the offing, this might be a form of diversification that pays longer-term dividends. (By Sharon Lam)  CROSSED WIRES. The usual path for an activist investor harbouring a beef with a company is to get on its share register, build a stake and lobby for management to get the boot. Chris Hohn is offering an interesting variation. The head of $24 billion TCI Fund Management has a 1.04% short position in Wirecard\u2019s shares, and is demanding the exit of Chief Executive Markus Braun, who also holds 7% of the German payments group.  A short-seller might want an underperforming boss to stay in post. Either way, it keeps the spotlight on Wirecard. The group\u2019s shares fell on Tuesday after auditor KPMG found no evidence of \u201cbalance sheet forgery\u201d but added big caveats such as an unwillingness to cooperate by Wirecard\u2019s third-party partners. Those businesses were central to allegations of suspect accounting made by the Financial Times, which Wirecard has always denied. With shares off another 7% on Wednesday, greater transparency might be needed. Hohn\u2019s odd activism helps maintain the pressure for more light.

The recommendation is a shot in the arm for Gilead as its third best-selling HIV drug, Truvada, faces exclusivity loss in the United States, beginning 2020.  Truvada is largely boosted by its PrEP use, SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note ahead of the committee\u2019s discussion. \u201cTruvada grew at 15% last year, entirely due to PrEP.\u201d  Descovy\u2019s entry into the still underpenetrated PrEP market is vital to Gilead\u2019s attempts to retain its Truvada patient base after the drug goes off-patent, he said.  Truvada accounted for 20.5% of the drugmaker\u2019s total HIV franchise sales in 2018.  The panel\u2019s backing also comes as a possible launch of Descovy for PrEP faces opposition from patient advocacy groups.  They cite the scheduled U.S. launch next September of a generic version of the only currently approved prevention pill, Truvada, that could lower costs.

The panel voted 10-8 against its approval in this patient population.

Gilead\u2019s drug was among the first to be used as a treatment for the novel coronavirus, and was one of the drugs recently used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump.  Remdesivir received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 1, and has since been authorized for use in several other countries.  Results of the overall study suggested the drug may reduce mortality, but the benefit was not statistically significant. In a separate analysis looking just at patients who received oxygen, however, the drug appeared to reduce the risk of death by 72 percent at day 15, and 70 percent by day 29.  With this analysis, \u201cwe now have data suggesting that giving remdesivir to patients on oxygen may significantly reduce their chances of death compared to other subgroups,\u201d Dr. Andre Kalil, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the study\u2019s principal investigator, said in a press release.","348":"BENGALURU (Reuters) - India\u2019s government has approved Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s antiviral drug remdesivir for emergency use for five doses in treating COVID-19 patients.

Remdesivir, which is administered intravenously in hospital, is the first drug to show improvement in COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials, and new information about its efficacy is being closely watched around the world, as nations battle the pandemic.  The late stage study of nearly 600 patients evaluated the safety and efficacy of 5- and 10-day treatment with remdesivir in addition to standard care for those with moderate COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new coronavirus - compared with standard care alone.  At day 11, around 76% of the patients in the 5-day treatment group showed improvement in clinical status versus 66% for standard care alone, Gilead said.  Around 70% of the patients who received remdesivir for 10 days showed improvement, \u201ctrending toward but not reaching statistical significance,\u201d the drugmaker said.  Further study details than Gilead provided on Monday, such as more information on patient demographics, are needed to explain the difference in the two treatment groups, doctors and analysts said.  Remdesivir is being closely watched after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization (EUA)last month, citing results from a U.S. government study that showed the drug reduced hospitalization stays by 31%, or about four days, compared to a placebo.  The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it would consider expanding the EUA, and Gilead told Reuters it was in discussions with the regulator to determine the appropriate patients to be treated under the authorization.  There are currently no treatments with U.S. approval or vaccines for the new coronavirus that has infected more than 6 million people and killed nearly 373,000 worldwide, including over 104,000 U.S. deaths.  The drug has received approval by Japanese health regulators. U.S. approval requires a rigorous, time consuming FDA review, but EUAs can be used in a health crisis when other options are not available.  Dozens of companies are working on a variety of treatment and vaccine approaches for the illness.  The drug, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to disable the mechanism by which certain viruses, including the new coronavirus, make copies of themselves and potentially overwhelm their host\u2019s immune system.  Dr. Daniel McQuillen, an infectious disease specialist at Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts, said it was difficult to draw a conclusion on why the patients on the shorter course outperformed those on the longer one until the full data is released.

Gilead said it would issue a tender offer to buy all the outstanding shares of Immunomedics for $88 per share, representing a premium of about 108% over their last closing price of $42.25 on Friday.  \u201cThis acquisition represents significant progress in Gilead\u2019s work to build a strong and diverse oncology portfolio,\u201d Gilead Chief Executive Officer Daniel O\u2019Day said in a statement. \u201cTrodelvy is an approved, transformational medicine for a form of cancer that is particularly challenging to treat. We will now continue to explore its potential to treat many other types of cancer.\u201d  Immunomedics is also on track to file for regulatory approval for Trodelvy in Europe in the first half of 2021, according to the statement.  The deal - and a separate transaction between Merck & Co and Seattle Genetics\u2019s announced on Monday - was a sign of renewed confidence in an approach in oncology to pair antibodies with toxic agents to fight cancer.  Immunomedics\u2019 Trodelvy is a so-called antibody-drug conjugates, or ADC, a class described by researchers as \u201cguided missiles\u201d that zero in on tumors to release cytotoxins that deliver up to 10,000 times the potency of standard chemotherapy, while minimizing damage to healthy tissue.  Merck, for its part, struck a deal with Seattle Genetics worth up to $4.2 billion, comprising stock purchases, an upfront payment and milestone rewards, to collaborate with the partner on two ADCs against breast cancer and other tumors.  In previous landmark deals for the field, AstraZeneca last year committed up to $7 billion for rights to Daiichi Sankyo\u2019s Enhertu, another breast-cancer targeted ADC. It followed up in July with a deal worth up to $6 billion for DS-1062, another ADC developed by the Japanese drugmaker.  Trodelvy targets triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other organs. Both aggressive and tough to treat, those tumor types account for 15-20% of breast cancers, lacking three genetic characteristics for which there are more treatment options.  Cancer immunotherapy Tecentriq by Gilead CEO O\u2019Day\u2019s former employer Roche has emerged as a new treatment option for this patient group.  Gilead\u2019s offer will be funded with $15 billion in cash on hand, and through $6 billion in newly issued debt, according to the drugmaker.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020, the companies said.  The acquisition of Immunomedics is the latest of the several Gilead inked this year with the aim of expanding its oncology portfolio.

Some hospitals said they are still buying the Gilead Sciences medicine to build inventory in case the pandemic accelerates over the winter. But they said current supplies are adequate, in part because they are limiting use to severely ill patients.  The Food and Drug Administration has allowed more liberal remdesivir use, but 6 out of 8 major hospital systems contacted by Reuters said they were not using it for moderate cases.  The slowdown suggests that a shortage of the drug is over and threatens Gilead\u2019s efforts to expand use of remdesivir, which it sells under the brand name Veklury in some countries.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told hospitals and other healthcare organizations on Friday that between July 6 and September 8, state and territory public health systems accepted about 72% of the remdesivir they were offered, Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, told Reuters.  Hospitals in turn took only about two-thirds of what states and territories accepted, he added. It was not immediately clear what happened to the surplus supplies.  Neither Gilead nor HHS immediately responded to requests for comment.  A surplus of remdesivir - which costs $3,120 for a 6-vial intravenous course - marks a turnaround from earlier in the pandemic, when supplies of the drug had fallen short of demand in some regions.  Government-led distribution of remdesivir will expire at the end of September. Hospitals said they have little information on availability after that.  Remdesivir was first authorized by the FDA in May for emergency use in COVID-19 patients hospitalized and on oxygen support after data showed that it helped shorten hospital recovery time.  The agency last month expanded use to hospitalized patients who do not require oxygen support, based on data published in the JAMA medical journal showing that the drug provided a modest benefit for those patients.  The newer data has left many experts unconvinced.

The antiviral, known by the brand name Veklury, is one of only two medicines currently authorised to treat COVID-19 patients across the world. But a large WHO-led trial known as the Solidarity Trial showed last month that it had little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays for COVID-19 patients.  The medication was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus infection, and had been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery. It is authorised or approved for use as a COVID-19 treatment in more than 50 countries.

NO MEANINGFUL EFFECT  The WHO\u2019s Guideline Development Group (GDG) panel said its recommendation was based on an evidence review that included data from four international randomised trials involving more than 7,000 patients hospitalised with COVID-19.  After reviewing the evidence, the panel said it concluded that remdesivir, which has to be given intravenously and is therefore costly and complex to administer, has no meaningful effect on death rates or other important outcomes for patients.  Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Britain\u2019s Oxford University, said the WHO\u2019s new advice should prompt \u201ca rethink about the place of remdesivir in COVID-19\u201d.  \u201cRemdesivir is an expensive drug that must be given intravenously for five to 10 days, so this recommendation will save money and other healthcare resources,\u201d he said.  U.S. infectious disease doctors said they would continue to use the drug because a double-blind, placebo-controlled U.S. study showed it decreased the length of hospitalization for some COVID-19 patients.  \u201cMy perspective is, and our institution\u2019s perspective, is that this is still a useful drug. It\u2019s not as useful as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious diseases physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said.  Dr. Helen Boucher, chief of geographic medicine and infectious diseases at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said she was taking into consideration that the Solidarity trial was an open label study - meaning doctors and patients were aware that the drug was given - and not a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Placebo-controlled studies are generally considered more scientifically rigorous.  The recommendation, which is not binding, is part of the WHO\u2019s so-called \u201cliving guidelines\u201d project, designed to offer ongoing guidance for doctors. The panel added that it supported continued enrolment into clinical trials evaluating remdesivir in patients with COVID-19, which it said should \u201cprovide higher certainty of evidence for specific groups of patients\u201d.

Picture taken March 11, 2020. Gilead Sciences Inc\/Handout via REUTERS.  Japan reached the decision just three days after the U.S. drugmaker filed for fast-track approval for the treatment.  \u201cThere has so far been no coronavirus medicine available here so it is a significant step for us to approve this drug,\u201d a Japanese health ministry official said at a press briefing. Remdesivir will be give to patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms, he added.  With no other approved treatments for COVID-19, interest in the drug is growing around the world. Administered by intravenous infusion, it was granted authorisation last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Gilead says the drug has improved outcomes for people suffering from the respiratory disease and has provided data suggesting it works better when given in the early stages of infection.  Japan, with just over 16,000 infections and under 800 deaths, has recorded fewer cases than other major industrialized nations.  However, a steady rise in cases has put pressure on medical facilities in some parts of the country, and a drug that helps patients recover more quickly could help in freeing up hospital beds.  A trial performed by the U.S. Institutes of Health (NIH) showed the drug cut hospital stays by 31% compared with a placebo treatment, although it did not significantly improve survival.  On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe extended a month-long state of emergency until the end of May in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  Japan as yet does not know when it will get its first doses of remdesivir or how much, the health ministry official said.  Gilead on Tuesday said it was in discussion with several companies, including generic drugmakers in India and Pakistan to produce remdesivir in large quantities.  Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to disable the ability by which some viruses make copies of themselves inside infected cells.","366":"A federal appeals court on Tuesday was considering whether to reinstate a $2.54 billion jury verdict Merck & Co Inc won against Gilead Sciences Inc in a dispute over hepatitis C treatments \u2014 the largest ever in a patent infringement case.

FILE PHOTO: A Gilead Sciences, Inc. logo is seen outside the company headquarters in Foster City, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  Both Gilead\u2019s Yescarta and Novartis\u2019s Kymriah - which are part of a class of therapies known in the medical field as \u201cCAR-T\u201d - were approved in 2017. But government and private health plans have balked at their high price of at least $373,000 for a one-time treatment before hospital costs, which can bring the bill for a single patient to over a million dollars.  Sales of both CAR-Ts - billed as potential blockbusters at their launch - have been slow to ramp up. In the second quarter, Novartis, which has struggled to meet U.S. manufacturing specifications, posted $58 million in Kymriah sales, while Gilead reported Yescarta sales of $120 million.  The novel treatments take immune system cells from each individual patient and re-engineer them to better fight certain blood cancers, keeping nearly 40 percent of patients alive for more than two years, according to some studies.  Yet the federal government\u2019s Medicare health plan for seniors, estimated to cover more than half of lymphoma patients eligible for a CAR-T, is still figuring out payment terms after nearly two years of delay. Private insurers are only covering the cell therapies on a case-by-case basis, rather than setting standard coverage guidelines as they usually do for new drugs.  From May 2017 and December 2018, one quarter of nearly 900 adult lymphoma patients treated with CAR-Ts were enrolled in clinical trials, according to healthcare consultancy Vizient Inc.  That is unusual since patients generally seek to use treatments approved by health regulators before considering an experimental drug being tested in trials. A recent National Cancer Institute study estimated that no more than 8 percent of all cancer patients participate in trials.  Vizient analyzed health insurance claims from 58 major U.S. hospitals, including most of the centers authorized to administer CAR-Ts. The consultancy found that medical bills for clinical trial patients, who receive the cell therapies free of charge from the drugmaker, were about 50% percent lower than costs for people treated with Yescarta or Kymriah on a commercial basis. CAR-T patients are almost always admitted to a hospital to monitor for severe side effects.  \u201cInadequate inpatient reimbursement, especially for Medicare patients, can be a significant deterrent for hospitals to use commercially approved CAR-Ts,\u201d Jennifer Tedaldi, associate principal at consulting firm ZS Associates, told Reuters. She said some hospitals instead refer patients to clinical trials, or choose not to use CAR-Ts at all.  In a sign of the wide array of trial options, the Lymphoma Coalition estimates there are 120 mid- and late-stage U.S. trials for advanced diffuse large-cell B cell lymphoma, the indication that Yescarta and Kymriah are both approved for. They include studies that combine Yescarta or Kymriah with other treatments in the hope of making them safer and more effective, as well as competing CAR-T therapies and other novel approaches for attacking blood cancers.  \u201cCAR-T is a very active space given its potential promise as a one-time curative therapy,\u201d Novartis said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs part of our commercial program, we take into account a percentage of patients that are likely to be treated via clinical trials.\u201d  Gilead said the company is working to expand commercial use of Yescarta, and more oncologists are referring patients as word gets out. \u201cOverall the percentage of patients going to clinical trials is small,\u201d said Remus Vezan, head of clinical development, at Gilead\u2019s Kite cell therapy unit.  Speaking on a conference call on Tuesday, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O\u2019Day said \u201cthere are clearly some near-term factors that can affect the trajectory of Yescarta,\u201d adding he has been involved in discussions around CAR-T reimbursement.  A TRADE-OFF  The University of Alabama\u2019s O\u2019Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, said it now refers about a quarter of its lymphoma patients to clinical trials. The Birmingham-based center is authorized to administer Yescarta, but has not yet used it for a paying patient for lack of insurance coverage.  \u201cWe are actively negotiating with the payers ... this is an expensive treatment so they want to have confidence in us,\u201d said Dr. Amitkumar Mehta, head of the center\u2019s lymphoma program. At the same time, \u201cnot all patients will qualify for a clinical trial. It is a trade-off. There is a benefit on the cost, but at the same time you are getting an experimental therapy.\u201d  The high percentage of patients heading to CAR-T trials could skew Medicare\u2019s reimbursement calculations, which are based on average costs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in April sought public comment on \u201chow to address the significant number of cases involving clinical trials.\u201d  The American Society of Hematology urged the agency to exclude trial cases in its calculations, citing claims data showing average pharmacy charges for clinical trial patients near $100,000, compared to over $600,000 for non-trial cases.  Medicare has also proposed raising its maximum CAR-T payment to 65% of estimated costs from 50%.  \u201cThere have been some promising signals, but we still do not have a clear pathway for Medicare payment,\u201d Jack Kolosky, chief operating officer at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, told Reuters. He said Moffitt has $12 million in unpaid Medicare CAR-T claims and expects at least that amount in the current fiscal year that began on July 1.","369":"July 10 (Reuters) -  * AUSTRALIA\u2019S THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION SAYS GRANTED PROVISIONAL APPROVAL TO GILEAD\u2019S REMDESIVIR AS FIRST TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19  * AUSTRALIA'S THERAPEUTIC GOODS ADMINISTRATION-PROVISIONAL APPROVAL TO GILEAD'S REMDESIVIR TO USE IN HOSPITALISED PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COVID-19 SYMPTOMS Source text : bit.ly\/321VKHQ Further company coverage:","370":"April 10 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc:  * DATA ON 53 PATIENTS TREATED WITH INVESTIGATIONAL ANTIVIRAL REMDESIVIR THROUGH THE COMPASSIONATE USE PROGRAM PUBLISHED IN NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE  * GILEAD SCIENCES - REMDESIVIR TREATMENT RESULTED IN CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT IN 68 PERCENT OF PATIENTS IN LIMITED DATA SET  * GILEAD - MAJORITY PATIENTS IN INTERNATIONAL COHORT DEMONSTRATED CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT, NO NEW SAFETY SIGNALS WERE IDENTIFIED WITH REMDESIVIR TREATMENT  * GILEAD - OVERALL MORTALITY RATE IN COHORT WAS 13%, RATE WAS HIGHER IN SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS ON INVASIVE VENTILATION VERSUS THOSE ON NONINVASIVE OXYGEN SUPPORT  * GILEAD - RESULTS FROM COHORT ANALYSIS OF 53 PATIENTS HOSPITALIZED WITH SEVERE COMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19 TREATED WITH INVESTIGATIONAL ANTIVIRAL REMDESIVIR Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","371":"* KOSPI rises, foreigners net buyers * KRW gains against USD * South Korea benchmark bond yield rises SEOUL, July 13 (Reuters) - Round-up of South Korean financial markets: ** South Korean shares climbed over 1% on Monday, tracking Friday's rally on Wall Street as an analysis of Gilead Sciences Inc's antiviral drug to treat COVID-19 yielded positive result, while investors awaited cues from corporate earnings and China's June trade data.

More patients could be served if the drug is proven to work in a shorter period of time than the standard 10-day course, Gilead said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it has been in discussions with Gilead about making remdesivir available to patients as quickly as possible.  Gilead also reported flat first-quarter earnings and its shares fell 2% in extended trading.  The U.S. National Institutes of Health on Wednesday said preliminary results from its trial of remdesivir showed that COVID-19 patients given the drug recovered 31% faster than those given a placebo.  In that 1,063-patient trial, patients who received the Gilead drug recovered in 11 days compared with 15 days for those who received a placebo.  While the data will need more analysis to know just how well the drug might work and for which patients with COVID-19, it was hailed by U.S. health officials as highly significant since it clearly had an effect on the disease for which there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines.  Data from a trial run by Gilead, also unveiled on Wednesday, showed similar clinical improvements in patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, regardless of whether they received five or ten days of treatment.  If the drug works just as well in half the time, there would be twice as much available for patients and the cost of therapy would be less.  More detailed results of the U.S. study are expected next month. There are several other studies also looking at remdesirvir for the coronavirus.

The U.S. government, which provided some financial backing for the drug\u2019s development, signed a deal with Gilead in June for more than 500,000 courses of the treatment, making up most of the company\u2019s output through September.  Gilead agreed to send nearly all of its remdesivir supply to the United States between July and September, according to HHS. The agency and states are managing allocation of the drug to U.S. hospitals over that period.  The government said it would receive around 94,000 treatment courses in July, 175,000 in August, and another 233,000 in September.  Still, the drug has been in scarce supply since the U.S. EUA in May, and hospital staffers and politicians have complained about difficulties getting access to it.  \u201cShipments are coordinated by the federal (government) and we have a bad disconnect between what they think we need and what we really need,\u201d U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida tweeted last month, before announcing further allocation to his hard-hit state.  Over the past four weeks, just under half of the U.S. remdesivir supply has gone to COVID-19 hotspots Florida, Texas, California and Arizona.  Gilead has teamed up with generic drugmakers based in India and Pakistan, including Cipla Ltd CIPL.NS and Hetero Labs Ltd, to make and supply remdesivir in 127 developing countries. But only limited production has begun.  Last month, Cipla priced its generic version of remdesivir at $53.34 per 100 milligram vial, roughly one-tenth of the U.S. price.  Gilead shares were down 1.4% at $70.74.","384":"(Reuters) - U.S. antiviral drugmaker Gilead Sciences GILD.O will invest $5.1 billion in a major expansion of its partnership with Belgo-Dutch biotech Galapagos NV GLPG.AS.

FILGOTINIB  The drug, designed to treat inflammation and auto-immune diseases, has entered phase 3 trials for rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.  Galapagos envisages launching it in Benelux countries in 2020 and in top EU markets in 2021. It plans to seek regulatory approval in the United States and in Europe before the end of this year.  Galapagos has had an alliance in inflammatory and autoimmune treatment with Gilead since 2015.  IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY DISEASE (IPF)  Galapagos has one IPF drug, GLPG1690, that started a phase 3 trial in December 2018. IPF is a disease in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult. Galapagos says there are 75,000 new cases diagnosed every year.  The company envisages selling the drug in the United States and other top global markets from 2022. Under Monday\u2019s deal, Gilead gains rights to GLPG1690.  Galapagos also launched a phase 2 trial for another agent, GLPG1205, for treating the same disorder in October 2018.  OSTEOARTHRITIS  Galapagos has worked in alliance since 2010 with French pharmaceutical company Servier on agent GLPG1972, which is in a phase 2 trial.  Servier has ex-U.S. rights for the molecule. Under Monday\u2019s deal, Gilead gains rights to GLPG1972 for osteoarthritis in the United States.  ATOPIC DERMATITIS  Galapagos has worked in alliance with MorphoSys MORG.DE on MOR106, which has entered a phase 2 trial for treatment of atopic dermatitis, a condition that results in red and itchy skin.  In July 2018, Galapagos and MorphoSys announced a global collaboration with Novartis NOVN.S to develop MOR106 further in atopic dermatitis and potentially other conditions.","385":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday greeted as good news reports that a Gilead Sciences Inc experimental antiviral drug might help fight the coronavirus, and infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said data shows it appears to help patients hospitalized with COVID-19.  Fauci, though, told reporters during a White House meeting with Trump that the data on the drug, remdesivir, needs to be further analyzed.  Some trial data for the drug will likely be announced later on Wednesday at a White House task force briefing, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Gilead on Wednesday said remdesivir helped improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19 in a clinical trial, and provided data suggesting it worked better when given earlier in the course of illness caused by the virus. The closely watched drug has moved markets in the past few weeks following release of partial information on several studies that painted a mixed picture of its effectiveness.  Former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter there was now enough data to support authorizing the drug for emergency use.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Fauci told reporters the data shows the drug had benefit in reducing the time to recover from the virus. While the data still must be peer-reviewed, he said it is opening the door to the possibility of a treatment.  There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the highly contagious novel coronavirus, but many approaches are being tried while awaiting an effective vaccine to prevent infection by the virus.  Trump said it is a beginning that can be built upon.  Asked by Fox Business Network earlier if the results announced by Gilead were a positive for the economy, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said: \u201cHas to be a tremendous positive.\u201d  \u201cThese are confidence-inspiring things that will help open the economy and get folks back to work,\u201d he said of any drug trials that show promise.","386":"July 30 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc, maker of the widely-used coronavirus treatment remdesivir, on Thursday posted a second-quarter loss due to costs from its acquisition of cancer drug company Forty Seven Inc.  Gilead reported a net loss of $3.34 billion, or $2.66 per share, compared with a profit of $1.88 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.11 a share. Analysts had forecast a profit of $1.45 per share.  The company earlier this month began commercial sales of its antiviral drug remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients by intravenous infusion. It was granted emergency authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May and the company had previously been donating supplies to hospitals. But demand for the drug continues to outstrip supply in many parts of the world.

FILE PHOTO: A Gilead Sciences, Inc. logo is seen outside the company headquarters in Foster City, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephen Lam  The move will bring Gilead\u2019s new chief executive Daniel O\u2019Day growth opportunities in Galapagos\u2019s specialist areas including fibrosis and arthritis, and give Galapagos deep funds to develop and commercialize its drugs.  The two companies are going after inflammatory conditions, one of the most lucrative areas in the pharmaceuticals industry.  AbbVie's ABBV.N Humira, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and spondylitis, racked up nearly $20 billion in sales in 2018, while Amgen AMGN.O and Pfizer's PFE.N Enbrel still brings in $7 billion annually after 20 years on the market.  As part of the deal, Gilead will spend $1.1 billion to lift its Galapagos stake to 22% from 12.3%. The rest of the investment will be used to develop and commercialize its treatments for a 10-year period, the companies said.  \u201cWe chose to partner with Galapagos because of its pioneering target and drug discovery platform, proven scientific capabilities and outstanding team,\u201d O\u2019Day said in a statement.  Galapagos, which has more than 500 scientists, is part of a thriving biotech scene centered around Belgium, fueled by tax breaks and other incentives, with companies spun out of universities now listed on the local stock exchange.  The deal follows a spate of biotech mergers last year including the acquisition of fellow Belgian biotech Ablynx by French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA for 3.9 billion euros ($4.4 billion) after a bidding war with Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO.  Galapagos\u2019s most advanced drug in development is filgotinib, an experimental compound being advanced for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease that Gilead intends to submit to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this year.  The two companies first partnered four years ago to develop a drug targeting inflammatory diseases, with Gilead paying more than $2 billion for the development of filgotinib, as well as an equity stake in the European firm.  Gilead is paying a 10% premium to Friday\u2019s closing price for the increased stake in Galapagos, but has a 10-year standstill agreement preventing it from raising its stake above 29.9%.  \u201cWe see a logical rationale for the deal and believe that over time the closer relationship should help both companies,\u201d RBC analyst Brian Abrahams wrote in a note, reiterating his \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation on Gilead stock.  Shares in Galapagos rose 18.8% to 152.20 euros.  Galapagos said it would also seek shareholder approval to allow Gilead to further increase its ownership to up to 29.9%.  The companies will share future development costs for filgotinib equally, replacing the 80-20 cost split provided by the original agreement, they said, with Galapagos gaining a broader role in the treatment\u2019s commercialization in Europe.  Gilead will get access to Galapagos\u2019s drug pipeline outside of Europe.  Gilead will nominate two people to Galapagos\u2019 board.  Barclays, Centerview Partners and Lazard acted as financial advisers to Gilead while Moelis & Co and Morgan Stanley advised Galapagos.","388":"-- Source link: (bit.ly\/2zUq3nP)  -- Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy (Bengaluru newsroom)","389":"-- Source link: (bit.ly\/3gwrsBN)  -- Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy (Bengaluru newsroom)","390":"April 4 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc:  * GILEAD SCIENCES SAYS HAVE BEEN TAKING ACTIONS SINCE JANUARY TO RAPIDLY EXPAND PRODUCTION AND INCREASE SUPPLY OF ITS INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG REMDESIVIR  * GILEAD SCIENCES SAYS EXISTING SUPPLY OF REMDESIVIR AMOUNTS TO 1.5 MILLION INDIVIDUAL DOSES Source text: bit.ly\/3dXrK3l Further company coverage:","391":"June 24 (Reuters) - The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review on Wednesday boosted its benchmark price for Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s remdesivir, suggesting the antiviral could be priced up to $5,080, based on benefits shown in COVID-19 patients.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche's ROG.S attempt to retool its rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra\/RoActemra to treat patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19-related pneumonia has failed in a late-stage trial, the Swiss company said on Wednesday.  Roche launched the 452-patient trial in March as it joined other pharmaceutical companies seeking to re-purpose existing medicines to fight the pandemic.  The \u201cCOVACTA trial did not meet its primary end-point of improved clinical status in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, or the key secondary end-point of reduced patient mortality,\u201d Roche said.  The news follows an Italian study that showed the drug failed to help patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.  Roche shares were little changed.  \u201cFor COVID-19 patients in need of an effective treatment, today\u2019s news is disappointing. From an investment perspective, we never assumed a pandemic-driven long-term increase of Actemra revenues,\u201d Bank Vontobel analysts said.  Pharmaceutical companies have been racing to develop treatments against the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed nearly 660,000 lives and crippled economies.  Around 150 companies are working on vaccines, although their first use cannot be expected until early 2021, the World Health Organization said last week.  Companies, meanwhile, have been trying to find ways to use existing drugs to treat COVID-19 patients.  India's Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd GLEN.NS, for example, has been trialling its anti-flu drug favipiravir on patients with mild to moderate infections.  Despite the setback, a trial of the drug - also known as tocilizumab - will continue in Britain.  \u201cWe are investigating the use of tocilizumab for sicker patients, whereas the Roche trial looked at patients with milder disease,\u201d a spokeswoman for the RECOVERY trial team told Reuters.  Roche is also testing if Actemra mixed with Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O anti-viral treatment remdesivir works better against severe COVID-19 pneumonia than remdesivir or Actemra alone.  So far, remdesivir has been shown to help speed up recovery for COVID-19 patients, while the older generic steroid dexamethasone in a British-led trial reduced death rates by around a third among those with the most severe infections.  Roche said the Gilead collaboration was ongoing and it would continue to examine how Actemra could be used to treat COVID-19-related pneumonia. But it would not be applying for regulatory approval for use of the drug on its own against the condition.  The European Commission had struck a deal with Roche to secure supplies of RoActemra, but it was too early to comment on the commercial impact on the negative results of the COVACTA trial, a Roche spokesman said. [L2N2F00CX]  The Commission declined to comment.  In the COVACTA trial, there was no difference in mortality rates after four weeks between patients who took Actemra\/RoActemra and those who did not.  \u201cPeople around the world are waiting for further effective treatment options for COVID-19 and we are disappointed that COVACTA did not demonstrate a benefit for patients in either clinical status or mortality at week four,\u201d Levi Garraway, Roche\u2019s chief medical officer, said.","395":"May 7 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc:  * GILEAD ANNOUNCES APPROVAL OF VEKLURY\u00ae (REMDESIVIR) IN JAPAN FOR PATIENTS WITH SEVERE COVID-19  * GILEAD SCIENCES INC - EXCEPTIONAL APPROVAL IS BASED ON DATA FROM GLOBAL CLINICAL TRIALS AND GILEAD\u2019S COMPASSIONATE USE PROGRAM  * GILEAD SCIENCES INC - GILEAD CONTINUES TO WORK WITH GLOBAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO REMDESIVIR Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","396":"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window)  * FTSE 100 down 0.7%, FTSE 250 down 0.5%  June 8 (Reuters) - London\u2019s FTSE 100 index opened lower on Monday, hurt by losses in AstraZeneca after a report that the drugmaker approached Gilead Sciences for a potential merger and a warning from an industry body about surging corporate debt.

There are also fears of shortages outside the United States, and separately on Friday, Britain's Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc HIK.L said it has started manufacturing remdesivir at its Portugal plant.  Gilead said its manufacturing network for the drug had grown to more than 40 companies in North America, Europe and Asia to add capacity.  Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of U.S. state attorneys general urged the federal government to allow other companies to make Gilead\u2019s remdesivir, to increase its availability and lower the price of the antiviral drug.  Pfizer will provide contract manufacturing services through its McPherson, Kansas, plant, the drugmaker said. It was not immediately clear if Pfizer would supply only for the U.S. market.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to Pfizer in 2017 saying that the process for manufacturing sterile injectable drugs at the Kansas plant was \u201cout of control\u201d and put patients at risk.  The FDA said several products were contaminated with multiple foreign particulates but a subsequent FDA inspection found that the issues had been resolved.  Pfizer, with Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.F, is also rushing to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus.  Pfizer has helped other drugmakers manufacture their products before.

Jurors determined that Gilead should pay $2.54 billion in damages, which was the largest verdict ever in a U.S. patent case.  But a federal judge in Delaware tossed the verdict in 2018, saying the Merck patent should not have been granted in the first place because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.
