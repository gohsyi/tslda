Hopes of a resolution to the dispute spurred Wall Street to record highs this month, but President Donald Trump recently tempered expectations with the threat of more tariffs if China failed to reach a deal.  China said on Thursday the two sides were holding \u201cin-depth\u201d trade discussions, and cancelling tariffs was an important condition to reaching a deal.  All eyes are on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony before the House Budget Committee on Thursday after his comments about a \u201csustained expansion\u201d ahead for the U.S. economy supported stock markets in the previous session.  A fairly better-than-expected corporate earnings season has also contributed to the stocks rally, with the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its sixth straight weekly increase.  At 8:46 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 55 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 e-minis were down 7.25 points, or 0.23% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 23.5 points, or 0.28%.

Cisco raised its buyback program by $25 billion, taking the total to about $31 billion.  The company said it plans to bring back $67 billion of funds held overseas in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 by taking advantage of the recent changes to the U.S. tax laws.  However, the new tax laws led to an $11.1 billion charge, pushing the company to post a loss for the second quarter.  Faced with sluggish demand for its traditional switches and routers business from telecom carriers, Cisco has been moving to a software- and subscription-focused model.  \u201cWe are clearly seeing the results of the strategy we\u2019ve articulated over the last 10 quarters,\u201d Chief Executive Chuck Robbins said on a post-earnings call.

Cisco has also doubled down on M&As to build up its software business. Since Robbins took charge in July 2015, the company has acquired Internet-of-Things firm Jasper Technologies, software makers Broadsoft and AppDynamics Inc, among others.  The Broadsoft acquisition, which closed earlier this month, helped boost Cisco\u2019s third-quarter adjusted profit.

Cisco\u2019s Talos cyber intelligence unit said it has high confidence that the Russian government is behind the campaign, dubbed VPNFilter, because the hacking software shares code with malware used in previous cyber attacks that the U.S. government has attributed to Moscow.  Cisco said the malware could be used for espionage, to interfere with internet communications or launch destructive attacks on Ukraine, which has previously blamed Russia for massive hacks that took out parts of its energy grid and shuttered factories.  \u201cWith a network like this you could do anything,\u201d Cisco researcher Craig Williams told Reuters.  The Russian government has vehemently denied assertions by Ukraine, the United States, other nations and western cyber-security firms that the Kremlin is behind a massive global hacking program, which has included attempts to harm Ukraine\u2019s economy and interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  The warning about the malware - which includes a module that targets industrial networks like ones that operate the electric grid - will be amplified by alerts from members of the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), a nonprofit group that promotes the fast exchange of data on new threats between rivals in the cyber security industry.  Members include Cisco, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd , Fortinet Inc Palo Alto Networks Inc, Sophos Group Plc and Symantec Corp.  \u201cWe should be taking this pretty seriously,\u201d CTA Chief Executive Officer Michael Daniel said in an interview.  Cisco shared technical details on VPNFilter with the group on Monday during a secret video briefing describing what it has learned over the past few months analyzing the campaign.  While VPNFilter infects routers and internet-connected storage devices used in home offices and small offices, the army of compromised devices can be used to launch coordinated attacks on much larger targets, Williams said.  Although infected devices are scattered across at least 54 countries, Cisco determined the hackers are targeting Ukraine following a surge in infections in that country on May 8, Williams told Reuters.  Researchers decided to go public with what they know about the campaign because they feared the surge in Ukraine, which has the largest number of infections, meant Moscow is preparing to launch an attack there next month, possibly around the time the country celebrates Constitution Day on June 28, Williams said.  Some of the biggest cyber attacks on Ukraine have been launched on holidays or the days leading up to them.  They include the June 2017 \u201cNotPetya\u201d attack that disabled computer systems in Ukraine before spreading around the globe, as well as hacks on the nation\u2019s power grid in 2015 and 2016 that hit shortly before Christmas.  VPNFilter gives hackers remote access to infected machines, which they can use for spying, launching attacks on other computers or downloading additional types of malware, Williams said.  Cisco has discovered about 500,000 infected devices, but believes the actual number may be much higher.  The researchers discovered one malware module that targets industrial computers, such as ones used in electric grids, other infrastructure and in factories. It infects and monitors network traffic, looking for login credentials that a hacker can use to seize control of industrial processes, Williams said.  The malware also includes an auto-destruct feature that hackers can use to delete the malware and other software on infected devices, making them inoperable, he said.  VPNFilter is named after a directory the malware creates to hide its files on an infected device.

One of China\u2019s top market regulators, SAMR has authority akin to the European Commission to approve acquisitions involving multinational corporations.

In 2018 Qualcomm Inc\u2019s planned $44 billion takeover of Dutch chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV collapsed after the regulator stalled on issuing public approval.  That deal\u2019s dissolution came months after Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom withdrew its bid to purchase Qualcomm after a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration stated that the deal would give China an upper hand in technology development.

REUTERS\/Sergio Perez  U.S. employment law does not specifically bar caste-based discrimination, but California\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing contends in the lawsuit that the Hindu faith\u2019s lingering caste system is based on protected classes such as religion.  The lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Jose, does not name the alleged victim. It states he has been a principal engineer at Cisco\u2019s San Jose headquarters since October 2015 and that he was born at the bottom of caste hierarchy as a Dalit, once called \u201cuntouchables.\u201d  Like other large Silicon Valley employers, Cisco\u2019s workforce includes thousands of Indian immigrants, most of whom were born Brahmins or other high castes.  Former Cisco engineering managers Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella also are defendants in the lawsuit, which accuses them of harassment for internally enforcing the caste hierarchy.  Cisco spokeswoman Robyn Blum said the network gear maker followed its process to investigate employee concerns in this case and would \u201cvigorously defend itself\u201d against the lawsuit.  \u201cCisco is committed to an inclusive workplace for all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were fully in compliance with all laws as well as our own policies.\u201d  Iyer and Kompella did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately known if the two have retained attorneys.  The civil rights group Equality Labs in a 2018 report cited in the lawsuit found that 67% of Dalits surveyed felt treated unfairly at their U.S. workplaces.  At Cisco, the unnamed employee reported Iyer to human resources in November 2016 for outing him as a Dalit to colleagues. Iyer allegedly retaliated, but Cisco determined caste discrimination was not illegal and issues continued through 2018, the lawsuit states.  Cisco reassigned and isolated the employee, rejected a raise and opportunities that would have led to one and denied two promotions, according to the lawsuit.  Hindus traditionally grouped people into four major castes based on ancestry, and Dalits in India still struggle with access to education and jobs 65 years after India banned caste-based discrimination.","37":"Nov 13 (Reuters) - Network-gear maker Cisco Systems Inc on Wednesday forecast second-quarter profit below estimates, sending its shares down 5%.

Permira said a subsidiary had agreed to buy the UK-based unit, which it will turn into a new, rebranded company focused on developing video software for the pay-TV industry. It named video industry veteran Abe Peled as chairman of the business.  A source familiar with the deal said Permira was paying $1 billion for the unit, confirming a report in Israeli news website Calcalist.  Peled declined to comment on the price tag.  Peled, who has been advising Permira for the past six years, was CEO of the business, then called NDS, when it was sold by Permira and News Corp to Cisco in 2012.  The company\u2019s customers include Sky TV in the UK, AT&T\u2019s DirecTV, Vodafone in Germany and China\u2019s state satellite TV. However, it is operating in a highly competitive environment as companies like Netflix, Hulu, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s prime video have all been investing heavily to strengthen content.  NDS, established in 1988 in Israel, is now based in the UK and has about 3,500 employees, including about 700 at its research and development center in Israel.  Peled told Reuters by phone that the business is profitable but would not disclose details.  The transaction fits in well with Permira\u2019s strategy, he said, noting the private equity firm has multiple investments in pay-TV and technology.  \u201cThey see opportunity for creating value through innovation and growth,\u201d Peled said.  Streaming piracy is another problem for the industry and Peled noted that Israel\u2019s expertise in cybersecurity could help the company further develop solutions.  Peled said more than 50 percent of major pay-TV operators in the world are customers of the video software unit, with its software installed in over 300 million end-user devices.

Zoom's daily users ballooned to more than 200 million in March from a previous maximum total of 10 million, the company said here on Wednesday. It was, however, not clear if the number was comparable with Cisco's due to the different ways the companies calculate meeting attendees.  \u201cWebex grew 2.5 times in Americas, four times in Europe and 3.5 times in Asia Pacific. Our growth is sourced from enterprise expansion, education and telehealth,\u201d said Sri Srinivasan, senior vice president and general manager, Cisco Collaboration.  About 73 million meetings took place in March and well over 22 million meetings per week in the last two weeks, Sri Srinivasan added.  Cisco said the latest user numbers have more than doubled since January.  The explosion in demand has spurred a huge boom for what were often relatively small businesses while raising issues of privacy and abuse.  Zoom\u2019s share price has surged five-fold in value since going public in April last year, but the company has faced a backlash in the past week from users worried about the lack of full encryption of sessions and zoombombing, where uninvited guests crash meetings.  Cisco said its Webex system, which includes teleconferencing and is older, was fully encrypted.","41":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Dow and S&P up 0.9%, Nasdaq up 0.7%  Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rebounded on Friday as shares of Disney and Cisco advanced after both reported upbeat quarterly results, but investors remained cautious as many U.S. states imposed restrictions to curb the relentless surge in coronavirus cases.  Cisco Systems Inc and Walt Disney Co were the top gainers among the Dow components trading before the bell. Futures tracking the blue-chip index were 0.9% higher.  The network gear maker jumped 7.7% premarket as it gained from work-from-home driven surge in demand, while Disney rose 4.3% as its rapidly growing streaming video business and a partial recovery at its theme parks limited its quarterly loss.  Wall Street\u2019s major indexes ended sharply lower on Thursday as a jump in U.S. coronavirus infections fueled fears about the recovery, with investors also weighing how fast an effective vaccine would be rolled out.  More than a dozen U.S. states reported a doubling of new COVID-19 cases in the last two weeks with Chicago\u2019s mayor issuing a month-long stay-at-home advisory on Thursday.  Positive data on a late-stage vaccine development earlier this week lifted demand for sectors that would benefit from an upswing in the economy - including financial and energy stocks, putting the S&P 500 and Dow on track for weekly gains.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq, however, is headed for a weekly loss as investors booked profits in market-leading technology stocks, which have benefited from a stay-at-home environment.

REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/File Photo  The United States raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% last week, prompting China to increase duties on $60 billion of U.S. goods in retaliation on Monday.  Analysts have been worried about the impact of the trade war on Cisco\u2019s traditional business of selling switches and routers because some are made in China.  However, the company said it had been working for six months to change its supply chain and that it expects minimal impact at this point.  \u201cWe still have some manufacturing happening in China. But we\u2019ve greatly, greatly reduced our exposure working with our supply chain and our suppliers,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said on a post-earnings conference call.  Shares of the Dow component rose 2.5% to $53.75 in extended trading.  Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said only about 3% of Cisco\u2019s overall revenues come from China, shielding it from slowing economic growth there that has caused slower sales for tech companies such as Apple Inc . She told Reuters that some Cisco products still face tariffs even after the company moved manufacturing lines for some U.S.-bound products and found alternative sources for some parts.  \u201cWe still have products that are being tariffed, but we are reducing the size of that pie,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can take some pricing actions to account for the cost.\u201d  The company has been betting on its newer business such as cyber security and software as it looks to counter any impact from slowing sales of routers and switches.  Sales in the company\u2019s security business, which offers firewall protection and breach detection systems, rose 21% to $707 million, beating estimates of $670.4 million.  Revenue in its software business rose 9% to $1.43 billion, but fell short of estimates of $1.52 billion.  Revenue in its infrastructure platform business, which includes switches and routers, rose 5% to $7.55 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.47 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That business is expected to get a boost from 5G communication networks, but Cisco executives said they do not expect an impact until 2020.  The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, implying $13.33 billion at the mid-point, and adjusted profit of 80 cents to 82 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 81 cents per share and revenue of $13.29 billion.  \u201cThe results continue to be consistent. They were pretty much in line which is a relief to investors given all the negative macro news,\u201d Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said.  Net income rose to $3.04 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the third quarter ended April 27 from $2.69 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.

A Cisco Systems sign is seen outside a Cisco health clinic at Cisco Systems in San Jose, California, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Elijah Nouvelage  The settlement resolved U.S. lawsuits filed by Cisco alleging Arista copied its intellectual property.  The deal also called for Arista to drop a lawsuit alleging Cisco engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve its dominant share of the ethernet switch market. The jury trial in that case was to have started on Monday in San Jose, California.  The companies said in a joint statement that the settlement \u201cdemonstrates their commitment to the principles of IP protection.\u201d  Founded in 2004 by former Cisco engineers, Arista has emerged as a rival to Cisco in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches used in data centers.  Cisco sued Arista in 2014, alleging it brazenly copied software that runs switching products and other technology protected by patents and copyrights. Arista has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign intended to stifle competition.  The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in 2016 that Arista infringed three patents and recommended a limited ban on Arista\u2019s products that infringe the patents.  Arista said that in an effort to comply with the ITC\u2019s ruling it redesigned its technology to remove elements found to infringe Cisco\u2019s patents.  Arista scored a major victory of its own in 2016, when a U.S. jury said it owed no damages over Cisco\u2019s claims of copyright infringement.  The settlement came shortly before a trial in a 2016 antitrust lawsuit filed by Arista. It alleged Cisco permitted rivals to use its interface technology and then later, after they were locked into using it, claimed copyright protection on it.  Cisco denied the allegations in court filings, saying it never encouraged Arista to adopt its technology and that it acted reasonably in suing for copyright infringement.  The companies said in the joint statement that \u201cwith limited exceptions, no new litigation will be brought over patents or copyrights related to existing products, for five years.\u201d  The settlement does not resolve Cisco\u2019s appeal of the 2016 verdict that Arista was not liable for damages under U.S. copyright law. A federal appeals court heard arguments relating to those claims in June and likely will issue a ruling later this year.","46":"May 10 (Reuters) - Network gear maker Cisco Systems Inc is pulling all online ads from YouTube due to fears of the ads appearing on sensitive content on the platform, Cisco\u2019s chief marketing officer, Karen Walker, said in a blog on Wednesday.

Chief Financial Officer Kelly Kramer said in an interview that Chinese companies were dropping Cisco gear and instead buying hardware from domestic Chinese companies.  \u201cThere\u2019s a certain sense of nationalism,\u201d Kramer said.  Cisco estimated first-quarter revenue growth of 0% to 2%. This implies a range of $13.07 billion to $13.33 billion, while analysts expect $13.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  It estimated adjusted earnings of 80 cents to 82 cents per share in the first quarter of 2020, below analysts\u2019 forecast of 83 cents.  Shares of Cisco, a Dow component, fell 3.4% in the runup to results amid broader declines in the market, and dropped 8% to $46.53 in after-hours trading.  While sales to China fell sharply, they comprised less than 3% of overall sales in Cisco\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter. Slower orders from large businesses, especially in the United Kingdom, also contributed to the below-expectations forecast.  Cisco said U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods would soon hit its products, dragging down margins in its fiscal first quarter. U.S. President Donald Trump said this week he would delay a 10% tariff on some Chinese-made goods until December. But Kramer said most of Cisco\u2019s goods were not part of the temporary reprieve and face tariffs next month.  \u201cNothing got excluded so far,\u201d Kramer said.

Cisco shares tumbled 7.8% after the network gear maker forecast second-quarter revenue and profit below expectations as increasing global economic uncertainties kept clients away from spending more on its routers and switches.  Cisco\u2019s share decline weighed the most on the major indexes and helped drag the technology sector down 0.3%.  In contrast, Walmart raised its annual outlook and the world\u2019s largest retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, comparable sales and e-commerce growth in its largest market during the third quarter.  Walmart shares fell 0.8% after hitting a record high earlier in the session, but the S&P 500 retail and consumer discretionary indexes were higher after company\u2019s report.  \u201cWe have on display this front-end of the economy, the U.S. consumer, that remains resilient and remains in a healthy place in front of a very key holiday spending timeframe for the economy,\u201d said Margaret Reid, senior portfolio manager at The Private Bank at Union Bank in San Francisco.  That compares, Reid said, to \u201cthe back-end of the economy that still seems to be plagued and weighed by U.S.-China trade and global economic and political volatility.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.93 points, or 0.13%, to 27,746.66, the S&P 500 lost 1.41 points, or 0.05%, to 3,092.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.35 points, or 0.15%, to 8,469.76.  Stocks have recently run to all-time highs, with the Dow and the S&P 500 posting record closing levels on Wednesday, helped by the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cuts, third-quarter earnings topping low expectations and signs the economy may be bottoming.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the risk of the U.S. economy facing a dramatic bust is remote, and investors will next be looking to U.S. retail sales data on Friday to gauge the health of the economy.  On Thursday, real estate was the top-performing S&P 500 sector, rising 0.5%, while energy and consumer staples lagged along with tech.  Dillard\u2019s Inc shares jumped 14.8% after the department store chain\u2019s quarterly results.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.  The S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 105 new lows.

FILE PHOTO: The Cisco Systems logo is seen as part of a display at the Microsoft Ignite technology conference in Chicago, Illinois, May 4, 2015. REUTERS\/Jim Young\/File Photo  The settlement and underlying claim were unsealed on Wednesday, eight years after the initial legal complaint. Cisco paid $8.6 million to resolve the case, with most of that going to the federal government and 15 state buyers and more than $1 million going to the whistleblower, James Glenn.  \u201cWe are pleased to have resolved a 2011 dispute involving the architecture of a video security technology product,\u201d said Cisco spokeswoman Robyn Blum. \u201cThere was no allegation or evidence that any unauthorized access to customers\u2019 video occurred as a result of the architecture.\u201d  Glenn attorney Anne Hayes Hartman and other experts believe Cisco\u2019s payout is the first in a false claims cyber case.  Many more whistleblower claims could ensue, experts said. The settlement \u201cclearly provides an opportunity for entrepreneurial plaintiffs or potential plaintiffs to go around looking for more examples like this,\u201d said Georgetown University law professor Gregory Klass.  Hundreds of false-claim suits are filed yearly, in part because of built-in rewards for those who point out improper conduct by government contractors. Under the law, a whistleblower must provide nonpublic information in order to win an award.  With many contracts including pledges that products meet cyber security standards set by the government, experts have long warned that the claims could expand into that area and punish vendors for the vulnerabilities that are present in many systems.  Cisco\u2019s Video Surveillance Manager was used by Los Angeles International Airport, the Washington D.C. police and the New York City public transit system, as well as many schools, said Hartman.  The complaint unsealed Wednesday also names as customers the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.  Glenn was working at a Cisco partner in Denmark called NetDesign, the complaint says, among other things working with Danish police. In 2008, he warned Cisco that a hacker who got into one camera that was part of the system could use flaws in the software to get administrative control of the entire network. The suit says a hacker could then potentially move beyond the video system.  \u201cDue to the vulnerability in Cisco\u2019s surveillance system, any user who has or can gain access to one video camera could potentially gain unauthorized access to the entire network of a federal agency,\u201d the suit says.

The company acknowledged the flaws in 2013 as it released an updated version of the software.  \u201cThere\u2019s this culture that tends to prioritize profit and reputation over doing what\u2019s right,\u201d Glenn said in a written statement. \u201cI hope coming forward with my experience causes others in the tech community to think about their ethical mandate.\u201d","80":"April 17 (Reuters) -  * CHINA UNICOM TEAMS WITH CISCO TO ENABLE CLOUD + NETWORK SYNERGY WITH SEGMENT ROUTING Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","81":"(Reuters) - Network gear maker Cisco Systems Inc said on Tuesday it would buy optical component maker Acacia Communications Inc for $2.84 billion in cash, as it seeks to garner a bigger chunk of 5G spending by telecom companies.

The numbers may not be comparable because the companies may use different methods of counting attendees and do not disclose those methods.  Zoom and Microsoft declined to give updated user numbers.  Webex and Teams were initially focused on business customers, while Zoom cornered the market for everything from virtual classrooms to church services.  Though the meeting participants have increased more than three-fold from last year, a very large percentage of usage still comes from enterprises, Cisco said.  But Cisco is working to change that. Webex has a new product for schools that features the ability to host a large classroom, split the class into small groups, and bring it back together.  \u201cWe are focused on education very aggressively,\u201d Patel said.  Cisco also plans to roll out a feature to filter background noise such as a barking dog or the sound of a passing car from an ongoing meeting following its acquisition of BabbleLabs in August.  \u201cWe will have it available to all WebEx users from Oct. 30 for no additional charge,\u201d Patel said, adding that Cisco remains open to more acquisitions that will add new capabilities to Webex.","83":"Feb 9 (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc on Tuesday beat quarterly revenue estimates, helped by robust demand for its networking and teleconferencing tools due to the pandemic-induced rise in remote working.

Nov 14 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were unchanged on Thursday, but still hovered near record levels as a dour forecast from Cisco offset gains in Walmart after its strong outlook.  Cisco Systems Inc fell 7.6% after the network gear maker said current-quarter revenue would drop 3% to 5% amid declining global spending on its routers and switches, some of which are made in China.  However, Walmart Inc jumped 1.8% as the world\u2019s biggest retailer raised its annual earnings outlook. Its results pointed to strong domestic consumer demand, ahead of a crucial retail sales report on Friday.  Retail stocks rose 0.61% on Walmart\u2019s news.  Eight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the consumer discretionary sector providing the biggest boost. The tech index was 0.20% lower, as Cisco shares weighed.

REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  Shares of the company, which also forecast second-quarter revenue largely above expectations, rose 4 percent in extended trading, putting them on track to add to a near 16 percent gain for the year.

Revenue in its application software businesses rose 18 percent to $1.42 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O has agreed to acquire privately held software maker ThousandEyes Inc, the network gear maker said on Thursday.  The deal is worth nearly $1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier, citing sources.","108":"FILE PHOTO: A man passes under a Cisco logo at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2019. REUTERS\/Sergio Perez  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc said on Monday it is rolling out hardware for the next generation of Wi-Fi standards, giving a core part of its $28.2 billion infrastructure business a refresh and in the process aiming to garner more software revenue.  Cisco announced new access points and switches for businesses for Wi-Fi 6, a new standard expected to roll out by 2022. Phones, laptops and other devices will connect to Cisco\u2019s access points on corporate campuses and carry the traffic to the switches, which connect to a business\u2019s wired network.  Cisco, which controls about 45 percent of the market for corporate Wi-Fi systems according to research firm IDC, is releasing the hardware well before most phones and laptops have a chip to take advantage of Wi-Fi 6.  The new network technology is designed to give a modest speed boost, but also to solve some of the biggest problems facing current Wi-Fi networks. The new standard is designed to avoid bogging down when today\u2019s proliferation of televisions, security cameras, smart speakers, sensors and other gadgets hop on.  One new aspect of the networks that consumers will notice is deeper ties with the 5G wireless networks that will arrive around the same time from mobile carriers. When both new networks are in place, for example, a hotel guest\u2019s phone could shift from 5G to a hotel\u2019s Wi-Fi network after check-in without having to enter a name or password.  \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a much stronger interconnection and relationship and handoff that occurs,\u201d Gordon Thomson, Cisco\u2019s vice president of enterprise networking sales, told Reuters.  Many of those new features will come about because of greater use of software to control the traffic on the wireless networks. To capitalize on that, Cisco is retiring its biggest-selling switch for corporate networks and rolling out a new one that will be able to run more software, which Cisco will sell along with it.  Brandon Butler, a senior research analyst for IDC, said that is part of Cisco\u2019s longer-term strategy in the past several years to derive a greater portion of its network infrastructure sales from software, which can be sold on a subscription basis for steadier revenue than hardware sales.  The new device \u201cbrings that backend switch into line with the company\u2019s broader network software strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been an evolution for the company, from a hardware based-model to a software-based model.\u201d","109":"Jan 11 (Reuters) - Acacia Communications Inc said on Monday it had filed a counterclaim against Cisco Systems Inc , days after the network gear maker sought a court order asking Acacia to close the $2.84 billion deal it had ended.  The optical component maker said it was seeking a declaration that it validly terminated the merger with Cisco, after the deal failed to obtain regulatory approval from China within the originally agreed time frame.
