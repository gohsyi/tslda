REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/Illustration  (Reuters) - Visa Inc V.N topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the world's largest payments network benefited from higher credit- and debit-card spending in a strengthening U.S. economy.  Visa\u2019s total payments volume jumped 11 percent in the quarter ended September, while the number of processed transactions rose 12 percent. Payments volume represents the dollar amount of purchases made with cards carrying Visa\u2019s branding.  Rising wages, job growth and lower taxes have spurred U.S. consumer confidence to its highest in nearly two decades, driving spending on everything from luxury goods to day-to-day essentials.  Visa, its rival Mastercard MA.N and credit-card issuer American Express AXP.N, as a result, are processing more transactions and earning more in fees.  Visa\u2019s net income rose to $2.85 billion in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, from $2.14 billion a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, Visa earned $1.21 per share, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $1.20, according to Refinitiv data. The result represents the ninth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected earnings for Visa.  Net operating revenue climbed 12 percent to $5.43 billion.  Shares of Visa, up about 21 percent this year, rose 1 percent in trading after the bell on Wednesday.","1":"Feb 15 (Reuters) - Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc, the two biggest U.S. card networks, are preparing to increase certain fees levied on U.S. merchants for processing transactions that will kick in this April, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.  Some of the changes relate to so-called interchange fees, the report said. Interchange fees are what merchants pay to banks when consumers use a credit or a debit card to make a purchase from their store. (on.wsj.com\/2TR68v6)  Fees that Mastercard and Visa charge financial institutions, such as banks, for processing card payments on behalf of merchants are also set to increase, the report said.  Visa and Mastercard did not immediately to a request for comment.  Merchants often pass on any increases in processing fees to consumers, in an attempt to protect their own profits. Up to 2.5 percent of prices for goods and services go to cover card fees, the WSJ said.  Card companies have said in the past that their credit and debit cards usually result in more sales for merchants, especially in countries like the U.S. They also say that expenses for ramping up anti-fraud\/theft security measures, to make payment processing safer, need to be covered.  Recently, the two companies along with several U.S. banks, had to pay over $6 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by merchants who accused the credit card companies of violating federal antitrust laws by forcing merchants to pay swipe fees and prohibiting them from directing consumers toward other methods of payment.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  European Union policymakers and central bankers have long sought a \"home grown\" rival to take on Mastercard MA.N and Visa V.N from the United States, and more recently tech giants like Alipay and Google GOOGL.O. But this has not happened even though real-time payments have been possible in the euro zone since 2017.  The European Central Bank on Thursday welcomed the banks\u2019 decision to launch the unified European payment system by 2022, after advocating for years an industry-driven solution to compete with the likes of Mastercard and Visa.  \"It is aimed at strengthening Europe, at making it more independent and robust,\" said Thierry Laborde, deputy chief operating officer of French bank BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, which is part of the project.  \u201cWe will do it collectively, by pooling our resources. As for distribution systems, prices will differ from one bank to another, but the infrastructure will be pan-European.\u201d  The ECB had said last year that dependence on non-European players for two-thirds of non-cash payments created a risk that the payments market would not be fit to support the EU single market and euro.  The so-called European Payments Initiative aims to become a new standard means of payment, offering a card for consumers and retailers across Europe, the statement from the 16 banks said.  It will cover all types of transactions including in-store, online, cash withdrawal and \u2018peer-to-peer\u2019 in addition to existing international payment scheme solutions.  Banks that have already signed up include BBVA BBVA.MC, BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, Commerzbank CBKG.DE, Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, Santander SAN.MC, ING INGA.AS, UniCredit CRDI.MI and Societe Generale SOGN.PA.  In coming weeks the project will set up an interim company in Brussels, with other payment service providers invited to join, the banks said.  The payments system is expected to become operational during 2022.  \u201cEPI\u2019s objective is to offer a digital payment solution that can be used anywhere in Europe and to supersede the fragmented landscape that currently still exists,\u201d the banks\u2019 statement said.  \u201cThe Covid-19 crisis has underlined the need for a unified European digital payment solution.\u201d  During lockdowns, the use of cash has tumbled as shoppers move online or use \u201ccontactless\u201d forms of payments.","4":"(Reuters) - Financial technology company Plaid Inc said on Monday that Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc were strategic investors in a $250 million round of Series C financing raised in December.

Venture capitalist Mary Meeker in December led a Series C fundraise that reportedly valued the company at $2.65 billion, and Plaid says it now has around 400 employees in four cities.  The company gave little detail on how the credit card giants would factor into its business, saying it would \u201cwork with Mastercard and Visa at the intersection of payments and data access.\u201d  Plaid has been \u201cexpanding our data network this year,\u201d and believes the deal will help accelerate those efforts, it said in the statement.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The European Commission, which has waged a decades-long crackdown on payment and credit card fees, says so-called interchange fees in which the merchant\u2019s bank pays a charge to the cardholder\u2019s bank, result in higher prices for consumers.  This is because the fees, which are a lucrative source of revenue for banks, are ultimately borne by the merchant.  Visa, the world\u2019s largest payments network operator, and its closest rival Mastercard have proposed a 0.2 percent fee on non-EU debit card payments carried out in shops and a 0.3 percent fee on credit card payments, the Commission said on Tuesday.  This would bring their fees in line with those charged for EU cards, which were the subject of a long EU investigation after a 1997 complaint by business lobby EuroCommerce.  The group, whose members include Carrefour CARR.PA, Marks & Spencer MKS.L, Lidl and Metro B4B.DE, welcomed the offer but criticized the big difference in online and offline transaction fees.  Under the terms of the offer for online payments, debit card charges would be 1.15 percent and 1.50 percent for credit cards and the commitments would apply for five-and-a-half years.  \u201cNo such distinction is made for cards issued in the EU... We therefore cannot understand why merchants should be charged more for a perceived risk which can only arise by the card issuers\u2019 failure to implement adequate fraud prevention measures,\u201d the lobbying group said.  SAVINGS CALL  European consumer group BEUC urged merchants to pass on the cost savings to consumers.  Third parties have a month to provide feedback before the Commission decides whether to accept the offer, which was revealed by Reuters last month, or demand a bigger reduction.  Mastercard said it expected to incur a $650 million charge in the fourth quarter of this year because of a substantial fine related to a second EU antitrust investigation.  The Commission three years ago charged the company with imposing rules which blocked banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country. Mastercard scrapped this practice in December 2015 after the bloc adopted rules capping such charges.  \u201cThe case is still ongoing and we cannot comment further on it,\u201d Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said.","6":"FACEIT and Visa are launching a new esports program that will distribute $450,000 in the first three months for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2 competitions in Russia, the partners announced Tuesday.

Visa agreed to buy Earthport for about 247 million pounds ($321.45 million), edging out smaller rival Mastercard Inc in a bidding war.  Visa expects the deal to help expand its cross-border network service, a reason also cited by Mastercard for its interest in Earthport.  Earthport offers a lower-cost option to traditional payments systems by allowing banks and money transfer firms to have a single relationship instead of multiple ties with various payments channels around the world.

Analysts at Jefferies attributed the beat to lower-than-expected expenses.  Visa shares traded down nearly 2% after market hours.  The quarter was the first to reflect how spending on Visa transactions was impacted for three straight months by coronavirus-related shutdowns.  Visa said total payments volume decreased 10%, on a constant dollar basis, and the number of process transactions declined 13% from a year earlier.  Cross-border volume fell 37%, reflecting the fall in international travel.  But the company added its business drivers had \u201cimproved each month throughout the quarter.\u201d  Consumer spending has vacillated during the pandemic, thwarted by the lockdowns and boosted by government stimulus checks.  The U.S. government reported earlier this month that retail sales rebounded in May and June from a sharp drop in April, and ended down 8% for the quarter from a year earlier.  The health crisis has triggered a massive shift in consumer spending towards e-commerce and brought a greater share of transactions to payment companies.  Visa\u2019s results marked the first year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue and adjusted net income since the company went public in 2008 and became the world\u2019s largest payment network.

The RBA says debit card payments, Australia\u2019s most frequently used method, processed through Visa or Mastercard cost retailers more than twice as much as using EFTPOS.  The retailers\u2019 association estimates this adds up to extra costs of between A$300 million and A$500 million ($200 million and $340 million) each year.  \u201cWe have made it very clear to the banking industry that we expect them to develop the functionality to allow the merchant to choose which payment rails it goes through, the international schemes or the EFTPOS schemes,\u201d Lowe added.  \u201cIf that process doesn\u2019t work then we would have to consider a regulatory solution.\u201d  Visa and Mastercard were not immediately available for comment.

The RBA is reviewing payments regulations to see what strategic issues need to be tackled, from the impact of new payment technologies and new entrants to regulatory technology and an electronic form of banknotes.  \u201cOne of the possible reasons for the major banks dragging their feet on least-cost routing is that they each have very extensive relationships with the large international schemes \u2013 we will be exploring this in the review,\u201d Tony Richards, the head of payments policy at the RBA, was quoted as saying in the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Maxim Zmeyev\/Illustration  Soaring stock prices are propelling credit and debit card companies Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc up the market value charts, where they currently rank 7th and 11th among companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock prices of both Visa and Mastercard have gained roughly 50% in the past year.  While the stocks may not keep up that torrid pace, Visa and Mastercard would each be worth over $1 trillion by 2023 if their average annual gains of the past three years were to continue, surging past the likes of Facebook Inc and Berkshire Hathaway Inc, if they also maintain their recent pace.  Fueling their rise is a shift toward cashless financial transactions spurred by a rise in online shopping.  \u201cEverything travels on their rails,\u201d said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, which holds Visa shares. \u201cThey literally sit in the middle of the banks, consumers and merchants and that has been a really enviable place to be.\u201d  Visa had a market value of $449 billion and Mastercard\u2019s stood at about $324 billion as of Thursday\u2019s close.

Amazon.com\u2019s market value jumped back above $1 trillion on Friday morning as the stock soared on the heels of its earnings report on Thursday.  (GRAPHIC: Top U.S. market cap companies - )  Revenue for both Visa and Mastercard nearly doubled over their past five fiscal years, to nearly $23 billion for Visa, and about $17 billion for Mastercard, according to Refinitiv data.  Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period.  Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates.  About 43% of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28% in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cGlobally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,\u201d Ellis said.  Visa holds a 60% share of the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30%, according to Ellis, with American Express far behind at 8.5%.  Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are categorized as part of the S&P 500\u2019s information technology sector. While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies such as Intel Corp often garner the lion\u2019s share of attention, Visa and Mastercard have been key contributors to the rally in technology shares.  Their valuations have expanded to their most expensive in at least a decade.  Visa trades at nearly 32 times forward 12 months\u2019 earnings estimates, while Mastercard trades at 35 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Both stocks are trading at a higher premium to the market than they have on average over the past five years.  (Graphic: Top U.S. market cap companies - )  The big run for Visa and Mastercard shares has also come during an more than 10-year U.S. bull market, and gains could be more muted in any downturn. Stocks started 2020 strong but have pulled back amid concerns over the spread of a virus from China.  Risks to the companies, Ellis said, include greater competition in the payment sector from big tech companies, as well as tougher regulations from governments around the world that might hinder access.  The companies are not sitting still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy privately held Plaid Inc in a $5.3 billion deal to boost access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard agreed to buy a majority of the corporate services businesses of Scandinavian payments group Nets for about $3.19 billion.

REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  Some of the changes relate to so-called interchange fees, the report said. Interchange fees are what merchants pay to banks when consumers use a credit or a debit card to make a purchase from their store.  Fees that Mastercard and Visa charge financial institutions, such as banks, for processing card payments on behalf of merchants, are also set to go up, the report said.  A Visa spokesperson confirmed that the fee hikes would go into effect in April, 2019, but only for merchant banks, and not merchants.  Merchant banks are financial institutions that maintain accounts for sellers such as Amazon and Costco. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America are some of the top merchant banks in the country.  However, it is up to merchant banks if they want to pass on the fee hike to sellers, or absorb it themselves. Similarly, it is sellers\u2019 discretion to pass on the hike to consumers or not.  Up to 2.5 percent of prices for goods and services go to cover card fees, the WSJ said.  Card companies have said in the past that their credit and debit cards usually result in more sales for merchants, especially in countries like the United States. They also say that expenses for ramping up anti-fraud\/theft security measures, to make payment processing safer, need to be covered.  Mastercard did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment on the story.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Visa said inflation-adjusted consumer spending in the three month to the end of March was 1.4 percent lower than a year earlier - the biggest fall since the fourth quarter of 2012 - after a 1.3 percent fall in the fourth quarter of 2017.  Spending in March alone fell by the most since October, down 2.1 percent on the year after a 1.0 percent fall in February.  Visa said the weakness in consumer spending reflected a dip in confidence among many households as well as unusually snowy weather.  \u201cThat said, it is too early to read a great deal into this year-on-year decline, which should be viewed in the context of high growth rates in early 2017,\u201d Mark Antipof, chief commercial officer at Visa, said.  Online sales fell for the first time in 10 months. Last month online supermarket Ocado OCDO.L reported that its sales suffered after snow storms disrupted its deliveries.  Britain\u2019s overall economy appears to have slowed in early 2018 as the snow added to uncertainty about the country\u2019s departure from the European Union next year.  Visa said only spending on food and in hotels, restaurants and bars rose in March, probably due in part to the early Easter holiday weekend.  Official retail sales figures, due on Thursday, are also expected to show a fall in spending in March.  Figures published by the British Retail Consortium on Monday showed a 6 percent fall in the number of people visiting retailers, the biggest annual drop since the end of 2010, reflecting the bad weather.  For more than a year, British consumers have been hit by a double-whammy of slow wage growth and a jump in inflation caused largely by the pound\u2019s plunge after the 2016 Brexit vote. But there are signs that the worst of the squeeze has passed.  Official figures due this week are expected to show the strongest wage growth in nearly two-and-a-half years at 3.0 percent in the three months to February, while inflation is forecast to have held at 2.7 percent, according to a Reuters poll of economists.  That would represent the first time that wages have grown more strongly than inflation since March of last year.  The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates next month for only the second time since the start of the global financial crisis more than 10 years ago, due in large part to signs that wage growth is picking up.  Visa\u2019s data is based on spending on its debit, credit and prepaid cards, which account for about a third of consumer spending. The growth rates are adjusted for inflation, seasonal effects and differences between typical card and cash spending.","39":"(Reuters) - UK\u2019s competition watchdog said on Thursday it was considering assessing Visa Inc\u2019s planned takeover of payments firm Earthport Plc to see if the deal would result in less competition.

The deal with Visa expands an existing agreement between the two firms and will see Revolut expand from its current markets of Europe and Australia to open in the United States and Singapore by the end of this year, with Canada and Japan to follow, Revolut said.  Revolut will then launch in other Latin American and Asian markets but does not have a fixed timeline, its chief executive and founder Nikolay Storonsky told Reuters.  \u201cWe are around 1500 people now and by summer next year we plan to be around 5000,\u201d he said.  The expansion into new markets will be subject to Revolut getting the necessary regulatory approvals.  The deal is not exclusive but will see at least 75% of all Revolut cards carry Visa branding rather than that of rivals such as Mastercard Inc.  The global push could see Revolut double or triple its customers in the next year, Storonsky said.  He told Reuters that Revolut\u2019s average customer holds around 1000 euros in their account, giving a total deposit balance of around 8 billion euros ($8.74 billion) currently, a minnow compared to global banking giants like HSBC and JPMorgan with trillion-dollar-plus deposit totals.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move, which has not been finalized, would represent another step in tightening the financial noose on the government of President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters.  The sanctions would be targeted at the elite and groups loyal to Maduro, including members of the military, armed gangs and Cubans operating in Venezuela, while aiming to spare ordinary Venezuelans.  \u201cThe purpose of these sanctions is to continue to deprive the illegitimate Maduro regime of access to funds and deny their ability to continue stealing from the Venezuelan people,\u201d the official said.  Venezuela\u2019s information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has hit Maduro\u2019s government, his political allies and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company PDVSA with a series of sanctions since recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s interim president at the end of January.  It has threatened further measures.  The potential financial sanctions are modeled after similar ones imposed by the Trump\u2019s administration on Iran, North Korea, Syria and, to a lesser extent, Russia, the official said.  The sanctions would aim broadly to block state-owned financial institutions\u2019 access to the international financial system, including credit card providers as well as SWIFT, the Belgium-based financial messaging service.  Specific financial institutions considered to be complicit in propping up Maduro or the whole financial sector in Venezuela could be targeted in the sanctions.  The United States would use its authorities to exempt everyday Venezuelans from making transactions to buy food and medicine.  The sweeping financial sanctions against PDVSA, aimed at curbing crude exports to the United States and driving Maduro from power, were the strongest measures yet against Venezuela\u2019s vital oil sector. U.S. companies doing oil business with Venezuela have been ordered to divert payments to special blocked accounts.  Senior Trump administration officials have warned in recent weeks that Venezuelan banks or international financial institutions could face U.S. sanctions for helping Maduro to steal or hide Venezuelan state assets.  The U.S. Treasury Department earlier this week imposed sanctions on Moscow-based Evrofinance Mosnarbank, jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state companies, accusing it of helping PDVSA evade U.S. financial restrictions.  More than 50 other countries have joined the United States in recognizing Guaido.

Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side.

The company and its rival Mastercard had recently come under fire for charging high fees on tourist cards in the European Union.  The payment processors have now offered to cap the fees to stave off regulatory fines and end an EU antitrust investigation into their practices.  Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, growth in cross-border volume shrank to 4 percent from 11 percent a year earlier.  Total transaction volumes in Europe fell to $536 billion in the reported quarter from $558 billion a year earlier.  The company also spent more on rewards and incentives such as airport lounge access, roadside assistance programs and travel insurance, which pushed up operating expenses by 7 percent.  However, overall revenue rose 8 percent to $5.49 billion, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.47 billion, largely helped by higher transaction volume in the United States, its largest market.  Growth in the United States for the world\u2019s biggest payment processor was spurred by higher wages, which led more consumers to swipe their credit- and debit-cards on the company\u2019s extensive network.

In July 2015, the Commission accused MasterCard of levying excessive fees on non-EU issued cards used in the bloc. It also charged that MasterCard rules prevented banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country where interchange fees may be higher.  To end another EU investigation, Visa and MasterCard have capped cross-border fees within Europe - that is, fees on transactions in one EU country charged for transactions in another EU country.

As part of the deal, Flutterwave will become the African payment provider for Worldpay\u2019s clients worldwide, making the company the latest African fintech firm to attract global cash and big-name partnerships. While the agreement is not exclusive, it is WorldPay\u2019s only partner on the continent.  Visa\u2019s investment is its first buy in to Flutterwave, with which it joined last year on a consumer payment platform now called Barter by Flutterwave, which allows individuals to make payments to one another across borders.

Interswitch, founded in 2002 and also expanding across Africa, is the main platform for Nigeria\u2019s business-to-business transactions, whereas Flutterwave\u2019s main focus is on individual payments -- making it more akin to an African Venmo, where people pay each other back or transfer cash to family.  \u201cWe have built a technology infrastructure that is steadily being recognized as the bridge to connect the payment system,\u201d Agboola said in a statement.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Even after the cut, the fees paid by merchants when they accept card payments, a lucrative source of revenue for banks, will still likely be higher than those for EU cards, they said.  The European Commission has battled for more than a decade to reduce so-called interchange costs and encourage cross-border trade and online commerce. U.S. regulators have also frowned on such practices.  Retailers say interchange fees count as a hidden cost and the card companies have paid billions of dollars to settle class action lawsuits.  Visa, the world\u2019s largest payments network operator found itself in the Commission\u2019s crosshairs in August 2017, charged with subjecting the cards of foreign tourists to excessive fees when they were used in the EU.  The case originally concerned Visa Europe which was acquired by Visa Inc in June 2016. The EU said that fees charged to retailers when they accept Visa cards issued outside the EU could raise prices of goods and services for all consumers.  The EU competition enforcer\u2019s charge against Mastercard dated from July 2015. The company is also accused of having rules which blocked banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country.  The Commission and Visa declined to comment. Mastercard said: \u201cAt this time, we have no information to share on our ongoing engagement with the European Commission.\u201d  Mastercard has warned it might be fined more than $1 billion if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules, but this might be less if there was a negotiated resolution.  The Commission can hand down fines as much as 10 percent of a company\u2019s global turnover for infringing EU antitrust rules.  But under EU settlement rules for antitrust cases, companies do not get fines nor are required to admit wrongdoing.  The Commission is expected to seek feedback from retailers and consumer groups before deciding whether to accept the offer from Visa and Mastercard. Negative comments could lead it to demand a bigger fee cut.  Business lobbying group EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered the EU investigations, and Visa declined to comment.  Visa and MasterCard capped cross-border fees within Europe - that is, fees on transactions in one EU country charged for transactions in another EU country - in 2014 and 2009 respectively, to end another EU investigation.","91":"Nov 16 (Reuters) - Payments processor Visa Inc said on Friday it is taking a minority stake in Indian payment gateway BillDesk to expand its footprint in the south Asian country.

Soaring stock prices are propelling credit and debit card companies Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc up the market value charts, where they currently rank 7th and 11th among companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock prices of both Visa and Mastercard have gained roughly 50% in the past year.  While the stocks may not keep up that torrid pace, Visa and Mastercard would each be worth over $1 trillion by 2023 if their average annual gains of the past three years were to continue, surging past the likes of Facebook Inc and Berkshire Hathaway Inc, if they also maintain their recent pace.  Fueling their rise is a shift toward cashless financial transactions spurred by a rise in online shopping.  \u201cEverything travels on their rails,\u201d said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund, which holds Visa shares. \u201cThey literally sit in the middle of the banks, consumers and merchants and that has been a really enviable place to be.\u201d  Visa had a market value of $449 billion and Mastercard\u2019s stood at about $324 billion as of Thursday\u2019s close. The $1 trillion club currently includes Apple Inc, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet.  Amazon.com stood at $927 billion, though the e-commerce leader\u2019s shares jumped on the heels of its earnings report on Thursday after the bell, putting it in position to crack $1 trillion, as it did briefly in September 2018.  Revenue for both Visa and Mastercard nearly doubled over their past five fiscal years, to nearly $23 billion for Visa, and about $17 billion for Mastercard, according to Refinitiv data. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled for both companies over that period.  Visa reported quarterly revenue late on Thursday that slightly missed analyst estimates, a day after Mastercard beat quarterly profit estimates.  About 43% of consumer purchases around the world excluding China are made using a digital form of payment, up from 28% in 2010, according to Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson.  \u201cGlobally, we still have five to 10 years, at least, to go of penetration,\u201d Ellis said.  Visa holds a 60% share of the credit and debit card market, followed by Mastercard with 30%, according to Ellis, with American Express far behind at 8.5%.  Despite their importance in finance, Visa and Mastercard are categorized as part of the S&P 500\u2019s information technology sector. While Apple, Microsoft and chip companies such as Intel Corp often garner the lion\u2019s share of attention, Visa and Mastercard have been key contributors to the rally in technology shares.  Their valuations have expanded to their most expensive in at least a decade. Visa trades at about 31 times forward 12 months\u2019 earnings estimates, while Mastercard trades at 35 times, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Both stocks are trading at a higher premium to the market than they have on average over the past five years.  The big run for Visa and Mastercard shares has also come during an more than 10-year U.S. bull market, and gains could be more muted in any downturn. Stocks started 2020 strong but have pulled back amid concerns over the spread of a virus from China.  Risks to the companies, Ellis said, include greater competition in the payment sector from big tech companies, as well as tougher regulations from governments around the world that might hinder access.  The companies are not sitting still. Earlier this month, Visa agreed to buy privately held Plaid Inc in a $5.3 billion deal to boost access to financial technology, and in August Mastercard agreed to buy a majority of the corporate services businesses of Scandinavian payments group Nets for about $3.19 billion.","97":"(Reuters) - The Justice Department filed a fascinating petition Tuesday night in Boston federal court, asking for a court order to compel the consulting firm to turn over about 2,000 documents related to Bain\u2019s work on a confidential project for Visa. DOJ said its antitrust lawyers need to see the Bain materials as part of their investigation of Visa\u2019s planned $5.3 billion acquisition of the fintech startup Plaid, arguing that Bain\u2019s \u201cbusiness strategic consulting work\u201d on the confidential project could affect DOJ\u2019s analysis of the impact of the Plaid acquisition on the market for debit services. The government sent Bain a demand for the documents in June, but, according to DOJ\u2019s petition, the consulting firm has claimed that its communications with Visa are protected by attorney-client privilege.  Wait, what?  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  To be clear, Bain isn\u2019t saying that it provided legal services to Visa, according to the DOJ\u2019s petition. But it contends that its work on the Visa project was within the scope of its consulting engagement for Visa on an antitrust case in the U.K., Sainsbury\u2019s Supermarkets v. Visa Europe Services. Bain \u201ctakes the untenable position,\u201d DOJ said, that this relationship gives Visa a privilege over all of Bain\u2019s \u2026 work product. Similarly, Visa\u2019s counsel has asserted that the privilege applies to all aspects\u201d of Bain\u2019s consulting on the confidential project. (The name of the project and all identifying specifics about it are redacted from the petition.)  \u201cDespite any tangential relationship to the Sainsbury\u2019s case,\u201d the DOJ petition said, \u201cthe underlying purpose of (the confidential project) was to communicate business ideas, not to render legal advice regarding the litigation. As such, the \u2026 documents are not privileged.\u201d  Bain lawyer Matthew Knowles of McDermott Will & Emery and Visa counsel Julia York of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom did not respond to my detailed email query on the DOJ petition. DOJ antitrust lawyer Lara Trager said in an accompanying declaration that when she met by phone with Knowles and York on Oct. 20, Knowles said that unless Visa instructed Bain to do so, the consulting firm would not comply with DOJ\u2019s document demand without a court order.  Interestingly, the Justice Department said Bain\u2019s allegedly unfounded claim of privilege is part of a larger pattern among consultants, accountants and investment banks. But courts have refused to allow privilege assertions to shield business advisory documents, the DOJ petition said. The government cited a 2006 ruling, De Beers LV v. De Beers Diamond Syndicate, in which U.S. District Judge Denise Cote of Manhattan said documents reflecting Bain\u2019s business advice were not privileged; and a 2010 decision, Dahl v. Bain Capital, in which Boston federal judge Edward Harrington ordered JPMorgan Chase to turn over communications with an M&A client, even though the communications included the client\u2019s lawyer.  Visa\u2019s own CEO, according to DOJ, as much as admitted in deposition testimony that Bain was hired to provide strategic advice, not to help with the Sainsbury\u2019s antitrust case. The CEO, who is not named in the DOJ filing, was asked flat-out if Visa hired Bain in \u201can effort to try and resolve any litigation that Visa faces.\u201d His answer: No.  Visa\u2019s CEO testified, in fact, that the company retained Bain through a contract with its outside law firm with the intention of keeping Bain\u2019s advice under wraps. \u201cThis was done under privilege because I don\u2019t want these kinds of things in a record anywhere,\u201d the CEO testified, according to DOJ\u2019s petition. \u201cThat could be extraordinarily harmful.\u201d DOJ described Visa\u2019s contract with Bain as an attempt \u201cto give Bain\u2019s work a false aura of privilege.\u201d  And to demonstrate the alleged speciousness of the consultant\u2019s assertion of privilege, the DOJ petition described a January 2020 email from a Bain partner to a Visa executive vice-president. Both Bain and Visa produced the email in response to DOJ\u2019s document demand. In the version turned over by Bain, the petition said, nearly every line of the email was blacked out \u2013 even though no lawyers were involved in the communication. Visa\u2019s version of the email, according to DOJ, had no redactions.  \u201cThe unredacted version shows that none of the text Bain redacted contains any legal communication or work product, nor that any of the work was done for purposes of the Sainsbury\u2019s litigation,\u201d DOJ said. \u201cInstead of litigation strategy, Bain\u2019s work concerned only Visa\u2019s business strategy.\u201d  In what the government describes as an eleventh-hour attempt to avoid DOJ\u2019s demand, Bain informed DOJ that it had transferred all of the confidential project documents to Visa so it was no longer a party to the civil investigative demand. The government isn\u2019t buying that. Bain has retained the original version of the disputed documents on its lawyer\u2019s server, the DOJ petition said. So the consulting firm is still subject to the civil investigative demand.  To find otherwise, the government told the court, \u201cwould set a dangerous precedent\u201d and would interfere with DOJ\u2019s ability to conduct antitrust investigations of proposed mergers.  As I mentioned, neither Bain nor Visa lawyers responded to my query about the DOJ petition. I\u2019m eager to see how Bain explains the privilege assertion.","98":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's highest court on Wednesday upheld an earlier Court of Appeal ruling that credit card companies Visa V.N and Mastercard MA.N restricted competition in the way they set fees for retailers, opening the way for them to seek compensation.

The UK Supreme Court upheld the finding of the Court of Appeal in July 2018 that the MIFs charged within the Visa and MasterCard payment card schemes was an unlawful restriction of both European Union and UK competition law.

FILE PHOTO: A Gulfstream 650ER business jet is displayed at the Gulfstream booth at the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) exhibition in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. October 21, 2019. REUTERS\/David Becker\/File Photo  For the S&P 500 companies that pay for their CEOs to use corporate jets for private trips, the estimated median value of that flying climbed 11 percent last year to $107,286 from $96,532 in 2017, according to the latest available figures from compensation research firm Equilar Inc. That is up 27 percent from $84,636 in 2007, the year before the financial crisis.  This is taxable income for executives. The estimates are often based on what a first-class seat would have cost on a commercial flight rather than on the true, much higher cost of using a corporate jet.  But not only are companies left to pay the full cost of those flights, which can be for anything from family vacations to trips to major sports events or a commute from a distant family home, but they can also find that their tax bills can be significantly higher because of lost deductions.  That is because the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has limited a company\u2019s deductions on personal aircraft use to the estimated valuation of the executives\u2019 flights.  As a result, companies forfeit a long list of tax deductions for the time the jets are used for personal trips, including pilots\u2019 salaries, maintenance costs, insurance, aircraft depreciation and finance charges. Companies usually can deduct the full cost of these expenses when planes are used for business flights.  Exacerbating the issue, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated deductions on two kinds of flights, said Ruth Wimer, a tax expert and partner at law firm Winston & Strawn LLP in Washington. They are for trips taken purely for business entertainment - such as a CEO taking clients to a golf tournament - and an executive\u2019s use of a corporate jet to commute to work from his home, she said.  However, given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not require disclosure of such lost deductions, investors are none the wiser.  U.S. business jet operations are on track to top 4.5 million arrivals and departures in 2019, the highest since 2007, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data, though only a small percentage are by major company executives.  Popular perceptions of U.S. corporate jet use hit a nadir in 2008 as the financial crisis was worsening. That was when members of Congress blasted the CEOs of the three big U.S. automakers for flying to Washington on corporate jets to ask for financial help.  The fallout was so bad that in the terms of its bailout General Motors Co GM.N was initially barred from corporate jet use.  \u201cBut since then, the whole economy has turned around. The stock market is setting records and jet use has rebounded along with it,\u201d said Nick Copley, president of SherpaReport.com, which analyzes private aviation trends.  GM is back to operating its own corporate aircraft, according to its disclosures.  \u2018HIDDEN ELEMENT OF EXECUTIVE PAY\u2019  The true cost of corporate jets are a mystery for investors in many companies, though.  A Reuters analysis of proxy filings by companies in the S&P 500 found that only a handful detailed the value of lost deductions in their public filings.  Among the few to disclose was payments system and credit card company Visa Inc V.N.. Its lost deductions from the personal use of company jets by executives and their guests have more than quadrupled between 2016 and 2018, and totaled $4.8 million in its fiscal year to September 2018, according to the company\u2019s last proxy statement.  Visa did not reply to messages seeking comment.  Another exception is cable and broadcast TV group Comcast Corp CMCSA.O, which reported $8.8 million in disallowed deductions in 2018 on flights taken by its executives and guests.  Comcast declined to comment.  This is a hidden element of executive pay, said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of CtW Investment Group, which represents union-sponsored pension funds with nearly 5 million members.  \u201cHaving a better sense of how expensive the C-suite is for the company is a very relevant number,\u201d Waizenegger said. \u201cIf they aren\u2019t disclosed, investors won\u2019t know about these lost deductions.\u201d  While the costs for Visa and Comcast, both with annual net earnings of more than $10 billion, may be a drop in the bucket, lost deductions for smaller companies can have a much bigger impact.  Earlier this year, San Francisco-based hedge fund Voce Capital Management LLC targeted disallowed tax deductions in its campaign to gain board seats at insurer Argo Group International Holdings Ltd ARGO.N.  The hedge fund argued the Bermuda-based insurance company, which had net income of $63.6 million in 2018, was hurting investors by racking up disallowed tax deductions from corporate jets \u201ccrisscrossing the globe at a dizzying pace.\u201d  Argo declined to comment for this story. It has said previously that when its executives use corporate aircraft for personal trips they do so at their own expense. However, it does not disclose how that is calculated or detail any lost tax deductions as a result of personal travel.  Voce has not provided any estimates for lost tax deductions. It did not reply to messages seeking comment.  However, it did outline in a statement earlier this year what it said \u201cmost ordinary people would consider the trip of a lifetime,\u201d by then Argo CEO Mark Watson and his family on an Argo Gulfstream jet during the 2017 Christmas holidays.  The trip began in San Antonio, Texas, with stops in Bermuda, New York, Copenhagen and the Malabar Coast of India, Jaipur in northern India, Amsterdam, and then back to Texas over a three-week period.  The company said in October the SEC was investigating Argo\u2019s disclosures about executive compensation. Within a few weeks, the company announced Watson\u2019s departure.","102":"(Reuters) - Visa Inc, Mastercard Inc, and a number of U.S. banks on Tuesday agreed to pay $6.2 billion to settle a long-running lawsuit brought by merchants over the fees they pay when they accept card payments.  Visa and Mastercard previously reached a $7.25 billion settlement with the merchants in the case, but that deal was thrown out by a federal appeals court in 2016 and the U.S. Supreme Court last year refused to revive it.  The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers opted out.  The card issuers named in the class-action lawsuit include JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup and Bank of America.  The lawsuit, brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers and dating back more than a decade, accuses the credit card companies of violating federal antitrust laws by forcing merchants to pay swipe fees and prohibiting them from directing consumers toward other methods of payment.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  In rejecting the earlier settlement, which was opposed by retailers including Amazon.com Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Walmart Inc, a federal appeals court found that the accord was unfair because some retailers would receive little or no benefit.  The card companies have already paid $5.3 billion and will now pay an additional $900 million.  Mastercard will pay an additional $108 million from funds set aside in the second quarter, the company said reut.rs\/2OA2V0i.  Visa\u2019s share represents around $4.1 billion, which the company expects to pay using funds previously deposited with the court, and from a litigation escrow it set up on June 28.

The Visa B2B Connect network launch covers 30 trade corridors globally and is expected to expand to 90 markets by year-end, Visa said.  The network seeks to simplify international payments by enabling transactions by businesses directly from their bank to the beneficiary bank, Visa said.  It provides an alternative to the correspondent banking network, where an intermediary bank will often be used by smaller banks to make a payment. This can result in slower transactions and more complexity.  The move is part of Visa\u2019s push to expand its reach beyond credit card payments, where it is one of the dominant players worldwide.  \u201cBy creating a solution that facilitates direct, bank to bank transactions, we are eliminating friction associated with key industry pain points,\u201d Kevin Phalen, SVP, global head of Visa Business Solutions, said in a statement.  The new network contains elements of distributed ledger technology, the software which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrencies, Visa said.  While the network is not a distributed ledger itself, some aspects of the nascent technology were used because it can help transfer more information on a payment than existing systems, Phalen said in an interview.  Visa was initially working with blockchain startup Chain to build the new platform, but ultimately opted to use aspects of of Hyperledger Fabric, the open source distributed ledger developed by a group led by the Linux Foundation.  The network was built in partnership with Bottomline, FIS and IBM, Visa said.

A Visa credit card is seen on a computer keyboard in this picture illustration taken September 6, 2017. REUTERS\/Philippe Wojazer\/Illustration  Companies underpinning online shopping and mobile payments, such as Visa Inc V.N, Mastercard Inc MA.N and PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O, offer above-average growth at a more reasonable valuation than FANGs and held onto more gains during recent market volatility, fund managers said.  Visa, for instance, is down 2.9 percent over the last 3 months, compared with a 30 percent plunge in Facebook and Alphabet\u2019s 13.5 percent decline. The broad S&P 500 has fallen approximately 4.8 percent over the same time.  \u201cRight now we\u2019re certainly looking at a test of the past (market) leadership and some of these FANG stocks have gotten ahead of themselves,\u201d said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager of the Plumb Equity fund, who recently added a position in Square Inc SQ.N.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking with companies that have high recurring revenue and high growth, and not a lot of companies are in a better spot than the payments space.\u201d  Fund managers from firms including Villere & Co, Plumb Funds, and Ave Maria Mutual Funds said they have moved out of the FANG group of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Alphabet that had led the market this year during the recent volatility because valuations did not appear sustainable.  The fund managers said they see the payments sector as a way to tap into growth in e-commerce and mobile computing at a more attractive multiple than FANGs.  Amazon trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 160.6, for example, while Visa trades at a P\/E of 38.3.  \u201cYou're getting a lot of the same disruption but at a fraction of the price,\u201d said Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at New Orleans-based Villere & Co, who has positions in Visa and transaction processing company Euronet Worldwide Inc EEFT.O. Euronet shares are up 33.9 percent for the year.  Visa and MasterCard in particular are a way to tap into the growth of e-commerce without directly owning online sellers like Amazon, said Brian Milligan, portfolio manager of the Ave Maria Growth fund.  Online sales are expected to make up 17 percent of all U.S. retail sales by 2022, up from 12.7 percent in 2017, according to Forrester Research.  \u201cThey are benefiting from the same secular growth as Amazon, but they are a duopoly,\u201d Milligan said.  Investors have also been moving into payment-focused exchange-traded funds.  The ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF IPAY.P, a $491 million exchange-traded fund that has PayPal, Visa and American Express Co AXP.N among its largest holdings, has had positive inflows for all but one week since U.S. stock market volatility started rising in early September, according to Lipper data.  The FANG-heavy Investo QQQ ETF, meanwhile, has posted outflows for 4 out of the past 6 weeks, according to Lipper.  But while improving U.S. consumer spending and accelerating inflation have helped Visa and Mastercard domestically, mobile payments companies Paytm and Alipay are picking up customers in developing markets like India and China and bypassing Visa and Mastercard\u2019s networks, said James Friedman, an analyst at Susquehanna.  Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N took a $356 million stake in Paytm in August, while Silicon Valley startup Stripe has signed partnerships with Alipay and WeChat Pay that allows merchants to accept payments from hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.  \u201cThey are more ways to go around the Visa or MasterCard rails in emerging markets, and you have to wonder if their future market share is going to be bigger or smaller,\u201d Freidman said.","110":"MOSCOW, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Russian lender Genbank, which focuses on Crimea, said it will stop providing services to clients who hold Visa and MasterCard cards in August.
