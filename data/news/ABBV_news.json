Drugmaker AbbVie Inc said on Tuesday it would acquire Allergan Plc for about $63 billion, giving AbbVie control over the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and buying time to seek new growth before its blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira loses U.S. patent protection.  AbbVie has long been under pressure to diversify its portfolio and its shares have lost more than a third of their value since January 2018 over concerns about Humira.  The world\u2019s top-selling drug brought in sales of $20 billion last year. But it now faces competition from cheaper versions in Europe and a 2023 expiration of its patents in the United States, by far the most profitable market.  AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said the company was able to buy Allergan because of the massive amount of cash that Humira generates. A U.S. corporate tax overhaul under the Trump administration, which helped companies bring back revenue earned overseas, also helped, he said.  \u201cHumira is buying the assets that replace it over the long term,\u201d said Gonzalez, who plans to lead the combined company and remain chairman and CEO through 2023.  Chief among those assets is Allergan\u2019s Botox, an injection of a purified form of botulinum toxin that paralyzes muscles, smoothing frown lines and wrinkles in the forehead and around the eyes. It is also approved to treat chronic migraine headaches, overactive bladder and other medical uses.  But when used as a cosmetic treatment, patients must pay for Botox out of pocket, buffering it from the pricing pressure that health insurers and government health agencies have put on prescription medicines. Gonzalez said he does not expect a biosimilar version of Botox \u201cfor a long, long time, if ever.\u201d  Botox had 2018 sales of about $3.6 billion, with $1.55 billion coming from cosmetic uses. Both therapeutic and cosmetic Botox are expected to keep growing, with analysts forecasting total 2019 sales of $3.9 billion and reaching nearly $6 billion by 2025, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cWe believe the increasing concern about AbbVie\u2019s growth potential following the U.S. Humira biosimilar competition in 2023 will be partially alleviated with the increased portfolio of assets that Allergan brings,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.  FILE PHOTO: The Allergan logo is seen in this photo illustration in Singapore November 23, 2015. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  The deal, coming months after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co agreed to buy Celgene Corp for $74 billion, also highlights renewed interest in major acquisitions by the pharmaceutical industry.  Shares of other specialty drugmakers and potential targets Mylan NV, Bausch Health Co Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd rose, with Teva up 7.6%.  AbbVie shares were down 15.7% at $66.11, while Allergan shares were up 26.7% at $164.20.  MAJOR ACQUISITION NEEDED  AbbVie\u2019s board decided about a year ago that the company needed a major acquisition ahead of Humira\u2019s U.S. patent expiration, Gonzalez said.  He said he first approached Allergan CEO Brent Saunders six or seven weeks ago. In late April, Saunders traveled to Chicago for a meeting and returned a few weeks later to discuss valuation.  AbbVie was looking for a partner with $10 billion to $15 billion in durable revenue that was not expected to decline. Allergan 2019 sales are forecast to be about $15 billion.  The motivation for this deal differs significantly from AbbVie\u2019s unsuccessful bid in 2014 to buy Irish drugmaker Shire Plc. At that time, AbbVie was looking to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates in Europe, Gonzalez said.  Allergan, formerly based in California, itself was part of a tax \u201cinversion\u201d deal, after European generic drugmaker Actavis bought Allergan for $66 billion in 2015 and adopted the Botox-maker\u2019s name, moving its headquarters to Dublin.  The combined AbbVie and Allergan will be based in AbbVie\u2019s home of North Chicago.  \u201cThe fact that we had tax reform (in the United States) allowed us \u2026 to take the company back to the U.S. It reinforces the benefit of tax reform,\u201d Gonzalez told reporters.  ALLERGAN ISSUES  The deal follows a string of acquisitions for Allergan under Saunders, who will join AbbVie\u2019s board. Over the last decade, Saunders remade Allergan into one of the world\u2019s biggest pharmaceutical companies, but also saddled it with debt, leaving it less able to invest in research and development  His efforts culminated in a proposed $160 billion purchase by Pfizer Inc. But Pfizer walked away from the transaction in 2016 after the Obama administration cracked down on U.S. companies\u2019 ability to rebase in countries with lower tax rates.  Allergan has since struggled to find new growth. Its shares have lost around half their value and shareholders have pressured Saunders to break up or sell the company. Activist investor David Tepper also ran a campaign urging Allergan to hire an independent chairman.  Under terms of the deal, Allergan shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie shares and $120.30 in cash for each share held, for a total of $188.24 per Allergan share, a premium of 45% to the stock\u2019s Monday close. Including debt, the deal values Allergan at $83 billion.  The transaction is expected to add 10% to AbbVie\u2019s adjusted earnings per share over the first full year following the close, the companies said.  AbbVie said it expects annual pretax savings and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in its third year after the deal closes in early 2020. Some cost savings are likely to come cuts to Allergan\u2019s research and development operations.  \u201cThis is yet another transaction driven by diversification, scale and low borrowing costs, rather than portfolio or top line synergies,\u201d SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note.  Morgan Stanley and PJT Partners were financial advisers to AbbVie, while Kirkland & Ellis provided legal advice. JPMorgan Chase & Co was Allergan\u2019s financial adviser, and its legal counsel were Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox.","2":"May 13 (Reuters) - Abbvie Inc:  * ABBVIE ANNOUNCES FINAL RESULTS OF EXCHANGE OFFERS FOR ALLERGAN NOTES  * ABBVIE INC - AS OF EXPIRATION DATE, $13.99 BILLION OF ALLERGAN USD NOTES & EUR 3.06 BILLION OF ALLERGAN EURO NOTES HAD BEEN VALIDLY TENDERED Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","3":"May 5 (Reuters) - Abbvie Inc:  * ABBVIE RECEIVES HEALTH CANADA APPROVAL FOR THE COMBINATION OF VENCLEXTA\u00ae (VENETOCLAX) WITH OBINUTUZUMAB FOR PATIENTS WITH PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","4":"(Corrects damages award to say $448 million, not $488 million)  June 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday found that Abbvie Inc used sham litigation to illegally prevent generic versions of testosterone gel AndroGel from getting to market and ordered the drugmaker and its partner to pay $448 million.

Left initially tweeted the $60-a-share call last Thursday. The shares fell as much as 7 percent that day before closing 4.7 percent lower. AbbVie shares closed up 2.4 percent at $91.54 on Tuesday.  In a research note published on Tuesday afternoon, Left detailed his skepticism about AbbVie\u2019s prospects. \u201cThere finally seems to be changes coming to the system,\u201d he wrote.  AbbVie declined to comment on the report.  Other analysts have said that deals AbbVie has signed with rivals such as Amgen Inc AMGN.O, Biogen Inc BIIB.O and Mylan NV MYL.O to prevent them from launching biosimilar competitors to Humira until 2023 will likely protect the company from any of the moves regulators make in the near-term.  Last week, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb laid out a plan to increase biosimilar competition for biologic drugs. The Trump administration has proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers.  Humira, for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, is the world\u2019s top selling prescription medicine with sales expected to exceed $20 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.","8":"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories and AbbVie Inc will pay a total of $25 million to resolve allegations that Abbott paid kickbacks to doctors in exchange for prescribing the cholesterol drug TriCor and promoted the medication for unapproved purposes.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The U.S. Justice Department on Friday announced the settlement, which resolves claims first raised in a whistleblower lawsuit filed in federal court in Philadelphia in 2009 by a former Abbott sales representative. AbbVie was spun out of Abbott in 2013.  Neither company, both of which are based in Chicago, admitted to wrongdoing as part of the settlement.  AbbVie in a statement said the settlement concerned sales and marketing practices that occurred over a decade ago.  \u201cThe company determined it was in its best interest to resolve these allegations, rather than engage in protracted litigation, and focus on current business priorities,\u201d AbbVie said.  Abbott declined to comment.  The lawsuit alleged that from 2006 to 2008, Abbott, through its sales representatives, provided physicians kickbacks in the form of gift baskets, gift cards and other items in order to encourage them to write prescriptions for TriCor.  The lawsuit claimed that Abbott also retained healthcare providers for consulting services and speaking engagements in order to induce or reward doctors for writing prescriptions for the drug.  Abbott also improperly marketed and promoted TriCor for purposes other than those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including as a treatment to prevent or reduce cardiac health risks in diabetic patients, the lawsuit said.  The lawsuit was filed by Amy Bergman, a former Abbott sales representative, under the False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue companies on the government\u2019s behalf to recover taxpayer money paid out based on fraudulent claims.  The government may intervene in such cases, but chose not to in this case, leaving Bergman to litigate it on her own prior to the settlement\u2019s being announced. As a reward, Bergman will receive $6.5 million as her share of the settlement.  The case is U.S. ex rel. Amy Bergman, et al. v.

The forecast of $9.61 to $9.71 per share in earnings assumes that \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders will be gradually lifted starting this month in Europe and United States, the company said.  The coronavirus outbreak has led to restrictions on non-essential medical procedures as governments and hospitals mobilize staff and resources to support COVID-19 patients.  AbbVie said its total sales for the quarter ended March 31 were also slightly boosted by customers stockpiling its treatments because of the pandemic.  The drugmaker, which is expected to close its $63 billion acquisition of Botox-maker Allergan Plc later this month, has been launching new drugs to offset some of the expected drop in Humira sales, whose U.S. patent is set to expire in 2023.  Sales of Humira, the world\u2019s best selling drug, rose 13.7% in the United States, but fell 14.9% in international markets.  Overall, the drug\u2019s sales rose 5.8% to $4.70 billion, beating estimates of $4.42 billion, according to seven analysts polled by Refinitiv.  Sales of new plaque psoriasis drug, Skyrizi, was $300 million, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $259.7 million.  AbbVie\u2019s total sales rose 10.1% to $8.62 billion in the first quarter, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $8.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

ET ON APRIL 24 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","13":"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc on Thursday said it signed a deal with Samsung Bioepis and its joint venture partner Biogen Inc that would fend off U.S. competition of their biosimilar version to blockbuster drug Humira until 2023.  This is the second deal AbbVie has signed over the past year as it tries to safeguard patents on Humira, which is the world\u2019s top-selling prescription medicine.  The drug, which treats rheumatoid arthritis, raked in $18.43 billion in sales last year and accounted for nearly two-thirds of AbbVie\u2019s net revenue.  While terms of the deal were undisclosed, AbbVie said it will make no payments to Samsung Bioepis and the three companies agreed to dismiss all pending lawsuits.  Even if multiple Humira biosimilars are delayed from market until 2023, this can be \u201cmore than offset\u201d by a steeper sales decline for Humira, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said.  Arfaei noted this is increasingly likely given the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s encouraging stance on the approval of biosimilar drugs and fewer chances of drugmakers negotiating with insurers to gain preferred coverage of their drugs over rivals.  Samsung Bioepis\u2019 license to market its biosimilar will kick off on June 30, 2023, after which Samsung will pay royalties to license Humira patents, AbbVie said in a statement.  Samsung Bioepis is partnered with Biogen to market the drug in Europe and Merck & Co to market it in the United States.  Biogen expects to launch the biosimilar, Imraldi, in Europe in mid-October this year.

The NIH said on Friday it has selected three agents for the study - Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N unit Janssen Research's Remicade, Bristol Myers Squibb's BMY.N Orencia and Abbvie Inc's ABBV.N experimental drug cenicriviroc.  The study will enroll up to 2,100 hospitalized adults with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms in the United States and Latin America.  Immune-modulating therapies are medications that alter the way the immune system works. Severe infections are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system, known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, and drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system can play a role in arresting a rapid escalation of symptoms.  This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure, among other life-threatening complications.  The NIH said its clinical trial - ACTIV-1 Immune Modulators (IM) - will last six months, and the agency will study if the therapeutics can restore balance by modulating that immune response.  All patients will be given Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir - the current standard of care - and also be randomly assigned to receive a placebo or one of the immune modulators as an add-on treatment, the NIH said in a statement.

AbbVie said the FTC\u2019s second request for information was expected.

Rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira is the world\u2019s best-selling prescription medicine and in the six years since AbbVie spun out from device maker Abbott Labs, the drug has remained by far its top-earner, accounting for about 60 percent of net revenue.  AbbVie in November lowered its forecast for overseas sales of Humira, citing stiff competition in Europe from drugmakers including Mylan NV and Biogen Inc. In the United States, Humira is not expected to face biosimilar competition until 2023.  The company said international sales of Humira fell 17.5 percent on a reported basis to $1.30 billion, on the back of \u201cdirect biosimilar competition in certain international markets.\u201d  In the fourth quarter, Humira brought in sales of $4.92 billion, falling short of the $5.02 billion forecast by six analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES.  Cancer drug Imbruvica, which AbbVie has earmarked as key to its plan to rely less on Humira in future, brought in sales of $1.01 billion, in line with analysts\u2019 estimates.  The company has previously talked up its cancer drug portfolio, which it says will buoy revenue as sales of Humira decline in future, but a recent trial setback for Imbruvica and the failure of its expensive cancer drug Rova-T have worried investors.  The drugmaker said it expects 2019 adjusted earnings of between $8.65 and $8.75 per share, largely below the average analyst forecast of $8.74 per share.  AbbVie posted a loss of $1.83 billion, or $1.23 per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $52 million, or 3 cents per share, last year, when it took a tax-related charge.  In the latest quarter, the drugmaker recorded $4.12 billion in impairment charges related to the scrapping of its development program for Rova-T, which AbbVie acquired as part of its $5.8 billion purchase of Stemcentrx in 2016.  Excluding items, AbbVie earned $1.90 per share, falling short of the Wall Street target of $1.94 per share.  Net revenue rose 7.3 percent to $8.31 billion in the quarter, but came below the average analyst estimate of $8.38 billion.

Botox is administered by plastic surgeons and other specialists that have either been shuttered with other non-essential businesses or seen customers avoiding unnecessary contact amid stay-at-home measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  However, AbbVie hopes to see a quick recovery in Allergan\u2019s medical aesthetics business as restrictions are eased across the United States and Europe.  \u201cWe remain confident that the expected near-term impact, while likely substantial, will be transient, with the aesthetics business quickly ramping back to normalized trends,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said on a conference call.  Gonzalez did not comment on Allergan\u2019s financial results as the details were not yet public.  Also on Friday, AbbVie maintained its 2020 profit forecast even after reporting first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates, on the strength of its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, the world\u2019s top-selling medicine.  Humira sales rose 5.8% to $4.70 billion for the quarter despite declines outside the United States, where it has begun facing competition from cheaper biosimilar versions.  Humira is expected to lose patent protection in the United States, its largest market, in 2023, which is part of the reason for the Allergan acquisition.  The company lowered its 2020 forecast for U.S. Humira sales growth to 7% from 9%, as it expects the coronavirus crisis to push more patients to lower-paying government health plans from commercial health insurance.

Sales of AbbVie\u2019s new psoriasis drug, Skyrizi, were $300 million. But the company noted that new patient additions were hurt by people avoiding doctor visits during the pandemic.

According to court filings, the jury on Monday concluded that AbbVie had not falsely marketed the drug and was not strictly liable, but found that the company acted negligently.  It awarded Mitchell $200,000 in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages.  AbbVie and lawyers for Mitchell both did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the verdict.  Mitchell suffered a heart attack in 2012 after almost five years of treatment with AndroGel, but recovered after several months, according to his lawsuit.  In the first AndroGel decision against AbbVie, a jury in October ordered the company to pay more than $140 million to a Tennessee man who claimed the drug caused him to suffer a heart attack. AbbVie has asked Kennelly to throw out that verdict over inconsistencies during trial.  Other pharmaceutical companies are facing similar lawsuits over their testosterone replacement therapies.  But Eli Lilly and Co, Endo International and GlaxoSmithKline have told Kennelly in recent months that they have tentatively agreed to settle hundreds of lawsuits against them. The terms of those settlements were not disclosed.  More than 4,000 cases are still pending against AbbVie.

Along with Bristol Myers\u2019 US$33.5bn bridge loan for Celgene, this is the second mega-bridge loan in the healthcare sector in 2019.  Morgan Stanley and MUFG are leading the deal that will be used in conjunction with AbbVie\u2019s existing cash to fund the cash portion of the acquisition. Morgan Stanley is administrative agent on the bridge loan.  The lead banks are expected to de-risk quickly by tapping AbbVie\u2019s existing bank group, which is typical with such large lending commitments. A few banks will join at a high level, with a retail round expected to follow.  AbbVie has said it intends to refinance the bridge loan through a permanent financing comprising unsecured bonds and a new term loan, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  The take-out strategy of the bridge loan could consist of a term loan or a combination of loans and bonds in the spirit of financing backing Bristol-Myers\u2019 US$74bn purchase of Celgene. That deal also was led by Morgan Stanley and MUFG.  The bridge loan might be swapped by a large-sized term loan A (TLA) component that would come on the heels of the US$8bn in TLAs that partially took out the Bristol-Myers bridge loan, and evidenced the market\u2019s newfound enthusiasm for funded paper.  Bristol-Myers\u2019 purchase of Celgene is the biggest-ever healthcare acquisition.  At current ratings of Baa2\/BBB+, pricing opens at 112.5bp over Libor with a 10bp commitment fee, according to the SEC filing.  READY TO LEND  With most of the investment grade loan volume in the second quarter of 2019 consisting of refinancings of existing credits, the AbbVie loan is expected to be well-received as the market has been awaiting opportunities to put money to work.  Investment grade M&A lending for the first half of the year, excluding AbbVie, totaled US$120.08bn, down 16% compared to US$143bn in the first half of 2018.  It is still unclear whether the new loan will rouse the market enough to bring more new-money business into the US investment grade space.  \u201cIt\u2019s great for the market. It\u2019s certainly great for Morgan Stanley and MUFG,\u201d the senior banker said. \u201cBut these things usually take a really long time to develop. Unless something has been developing over time.\u201d  A deal of this size is also a testament to the health of the market, several bankers said.  \u201cThat it\u2019s getting done is a good sign,\u201d the senior banker said. \u201cBecause if the market weren\u2019t healthy such a deal couldn\u2019t get done.\u201d  Refinancing activity is expected to continue in the third quarter, but AbbVie is already suggesting a potentially busy summer.  \u201cThe third quarter will start off that way. Refinancing activity in July and August, then the summer vacations. Abbvie will help boost volumes,\u201d a second banker said.  AbbVie expects to generate significant annual operating cash flow to support a debt reduction target of between US$15bn to US$18bn before the end of 2021, enabling a continued commitment to a Baa2\/BBB or better credit rating, AbbVie said. The company expects further deleveraging through 2023.  The acquisition is expected to close in early 2020. (Reporting by Michelle Sierra.

Mylan and Fujifilm Kyowa Kirin Biologics said on Thursday they had won a European Commission green light to market their version of the injectable medicine, known as Hulio. They intend to launch it in Europe on or after Oct. 16, when AbbVie\u2019s primary European patent on Humira expires.  The large number of Humira copies reflects intense rivalry for a slice of a huge market as demand for so-called biosimilars takes off in Europe, where adoption of the cut-price products has been much faster than in the United States.  Europe accounted for around $4.4 billion of Humira\u2019s global sales in the 12 months to June 30, 2018, according healthcare data consultancy IQVIA.  Amgen, Novartis\u2019s generics wing Sandoz, South Korea\u2019s Samsung Bioepis and Germany\u2019s Boehringer Ingelheim have already won approval for four other biosimilars to Humira.  Humira is used to treat a range of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis and psoriasis.  Its commercial success and popularity among patients means it has become a major cost for health systems across Europe, and health administrators say they will waste no time in exploiting the arrival of cheaper biosimilars to drive down bills.  Because injectable biologic drugs such as Humira are made in living cells, they cannot be exact replicas of the original medicine, so regulators have come up with the notion of biosimilars - drugs that are similar enough to do the job.  The conventional wisdom has been that biosimilar uptake would be slow and price discounts modest, since these products are expensive to develop and doctors may be wary about using a medicine that isn\u2019t identical to the original.  But Europe\u2019s recent experience with the first wave of biosimilar antibody drugs - the biggest section of the biologic market - has upended expectations, suggesting AbbVie will face fierce competition.  Still, analysts don\u2019t expect global Humira sales to fall off a cliff just yet, since there are delays in the arrival of biosimilars in the all-important U.S. market.  While expiry of the Humira patent opens the door to biosimilars in Europe, such copies are not expected to launch in the United States until 2023.

Still, like its peers, AbbVie faces a changing landscape for healthcare policy, as the Trump Administration looks at ways to lower drug prices, including the introduction of a pricing index that will limit how much federal insurance pays for medicines.  AbbVie on Friday said its exposure to physician-administered drugs covered by Part B of Medicare is about 20% of U.S. sales and that to Part D drugs, which include prescription medicines taken at home, is very small.  Should U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s pricing index proposal go into effect, drugs covered by Part B are likely to face reimbursement cuts.

Humira is the world\u2019s top selling drug and has been boosting AbbVie\u2019s revenue ever since it was approved to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, its sales have suffered since new competition entered Europe.  Overall quarterly sales of Humira rose 4.8% to $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter, just above estimates of $5.1 billion. However, international sales, which excludes the United States, declined 9.4% due to the impact of biosimilars in Europe.  The company forecast 2021 adjusted earnings of between $12.32 to $12.52 per share, ahead of the analyst average estimate of $12.19, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said the company is expecting \u201cimpressive growth again in 2021\u201d based on broad portfolio of diversified growth assets.  In the fourth quarter, psoriasis drug Skyrizi brought in sales of $525 million, topping estimates of $472 million, according to Refinitiv data. Rinvoq, which was approved in August 2019, brought in sales of $281 million.  Overall sales rose 59.2% to $13.9 billion in the quarter, topping estimates of $13.7 billion.  Net income attributable to the company fell to $36 million, or 1 cent per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.8 billion, or $1.88 per share, a year earlier.  The company recorded a $4.7 billion increase in the contingent consideration liability related to Skyrizi.","100":"May 8 (Reuters) - Abbvie Inc:  * ABBVIE INC - ON MAY 8 BORROWED $3.0 BILLION UNDER TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT TO FUND A PORTION OF CASH CONSIDERATION PAID TO ALLERGAN SHAREHOLDERS Source text: (bit.ly\/2Wxozre) Further company coverage:","101":"July 26 (Reuters) - Drugmaker AbbVie Inc on Friday raised its earnings forecast for the year and beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter revenue, as sales of its top-selling drug Humira did not fall as much as analysts had feared.  Last month, AbbVie announced a $63 billion takeover deal for Botox-maker Allergan Plc, which it hopes will cushion the impact of biosimilar competition to Humira that treats rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The drug has been under fire from cheap rivals in Europe and faces patent expiration in the United States, its biggest market, in 2023.  Last year, Humira generated nearly $20 billion in revenue, while the world\u2019s second best-selling drug, Celgene Corp\u2019s Revlimid, brought in roughly half.  (For an interactive graphic on Humira sales, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/2Mi1Mwm)  In the quarter ended June 30, biosimilar competition outside the United States caused overall Humira sales to slip about 6% to $4.87 billion, but it still beat the $4.80 billion forecast by five analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES.  U.S. sales for Humira rose 7.7% to $3.79 billion, but revenue outside the country slumped 35.2% to $1.08 billion.  Cancer drug Imbruvica, AbbVie\u2019s second-bestseller, brought in $1.10 billion, in line with expectations.  For 2019, the company raised it adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $8.82 and $8.92 from a prior range of $8.73 to $8.83.  Net earnings in the reported quarter fell about 63% to $741 million, or 49 cents per share, as AbbVie recorded a $2.28 billion charge related to future payments associated with plaque psoriasis drug Skyrizi.  Skyrizi, on which the company has partnered with German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, won U.S. approval in April and brought in sales of $48 million for AbbVie.

Rivals began launching biosimilar versions of Humira in Europe last month, fuelling investor concerns about the impact of rising competition in the region.  Biosimilar versions of the rheumatoid arthritis medicine are not yet available in the United States. (Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)","103":"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc said on Friday it expects a steeper decline in overseas sales of its top-selling drug, Humira, due to intense competition from cheaper versions in Europe, driving its shares down nearly 7 percent.  Humira is the world\u2019s best-selling prescription medicine and in the six years since AbbVie spun out from device maker Abbott Labs the rheumatoid arthritis drug has remained by far the company\u2019s top earner, accounting for about 60 percent of net revenue.  On Friday, AbbVie, which reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings, said it expects 2019 Humira sales from outside the United States to be down about 30 percent on an operational basis.  In November, the company forecast a 26 to 27 percent decline in 2019 Humira sales outside the United States due to stiff competition in Europe from companies such as Mylan NV and Biogen Inc.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re giving you is our best estimate of what will happen,\u201d Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said on a conference call with analysts.  \u201cObviously, this is driven by not us, it\u2019s driven by competitors and their behavior and so ultimately it\u2019s not like we have a crystal ball that we can predict exactly what they do.\u201d  AbbVie said international sales of Humira fell 17.5 percent on a reported basis to $1.30 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec.31.  Overall, the drug brought in sales of $4.92 billion in the quarter, falling short of the $5.02 billion forecast by six analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES.  \u201cWhen they first started talking about outside U.S. biosimilar competition it was that it would be in the mid-teens over a two-year period,\u201d Piper Jaffray & Co analyst Christopher Raymond told Reuters.  \u201cAnd now they\u2019ve said they\u2019ll be down 30 percent so I think that\u2019s the issue. It\u2019s a concern that if they got it wrong once, how do we know that the current guidance is accurate?\u201d  In the United States, AbbVie\u2019s largest market, Humira is not expected to face biosimilar competition until 2023.  The drugmaker has signed a series of deals with rivals, including Mylan NV and Amgen Inc, which prevent their biosimilars from entering the U.S. market before then.  The company forecast 2019 adjusted earnings of between $8.65 and $8.75 per share, largely below the average analyst forecast of $8.74 per share.  In the fourth quarter, AbbVie\u2019s adjusted earnings were $1.90 per share and revenue $8.31 billion, both missing Wall Street estimates.","104":"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, on higher sales of its rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira and its Hepatitis C drugs, leading the company to raise its full-year earnings forecast.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The company\u2019s shares, which have been under pressure due to setbacks to its drug pipeline, gained about 3.6 percent to $95.22 in late morning trading.  Sales from the company\u2019s Hepatitis C franchise soared to $919 million, easily beating consensus estimate of $572 million, according to brokerage Bernstein.  The revenue rise was fueled by sales of newly approved Mavyret, and comes when the market for Hepatitis C treatments in the United States is steadily shrinking as the impact of the disease lessens. AbbVie said it now expects $3.5 billion in sales from Hepatitis C drugs this year.  The company\u2019s growth in Hepatitis C comes in contrast to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, which also released earnings on Thursday. Bristol\u2019s hepatitis C franchise all but disappeared with sales of just $3 million.  \u201cWe have an asset that will allow us to be able to stay highly competitive and in a leadership position going forward,\u201d AbbVie CEO Rick Gonzalez said about Mavyret on the company\u2019s conference call, playing down concerns about the shrinking market. \u201cWe think we have the right tools to be effective over the long term.\u201d  Still, rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira - the world\u2019s best-selling prescription medicine - brings in nearly two-thirds of AbbVie\u2019s total revenue. Quarterly sales of the drug rose to $4.71 billion, a 20 percent increase from last year.  The company has been aggressively protecting the pricey drug, negotiating with rivals Amgen Inc, Samsung Bioepis and Biogen Inc to fend off U.S. competition from their biosimilars.  AbbVie said it doesn\u2019t expect direct biosimilar competition to Humira in the United States until at least 2022.  Cancer treatment Imbruvica raked in $762 million in sales, just above expectations.  IMPROVED FORECAST  The drugmaker raised 2018 adjusted earnings per share expectation to between $7.66 and $7.76, from between $7.33 and $7.43 previously forecast.  AbbVie said the forecast accounts for an effective tax rate approaching 9 percent this year, following the new U.S. tax law.  On its conference call, AbbVie said that it was going to be investing more aggressively in research and development (R&D) as a result of the tax reform.  But its forecast for 2018 R&D spending as a percentage of its sales is actually down from last year. The company said it expects to spend just over 16 percent of its sales on R&D this year, down from 17.1 percent in 2017.  Net earnings rose to $2.78 billion, or $1.74 per share, in the quarter, from $1.71 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, AbbVie earned $1.87 per share, ahead of analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.79.  AbbVie\u2019s net revenue rose 21.4 percent to $7.93 billion, ahead of average estimate of $7.59 billion.

Its shares rose 5.7% to $92.19, hitting their highest level in a year.  The profit forecast excludes any impact from the pending $63 billion Allergan deal, which is expected to close in the current quarter.  The company is eyeing expanded approvals for its new psoriasis drug Skyrizi and rheumatoid arthritis treatment Rinvoq, both of which AbbVie said have had \u201cstrong\u201d launches.  AbbVie forecast that the two drugs will bring in combined revenue of about $1.70 billion in 2020, still less than 9% of expected Humira sales, as it maintains its position as the world\u2019s top-selling prescription medicine.  Investors have long fretted about the company\u2019s dependence on Humira.  AbbVie is hoping to maintain its leadership position in the $70 billion global immunology market dominated by Humira, which treats both rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, as well as several related autoimmune conditions.  \u201cTogether, we expect Skyrizi and Rinvoq to have full coverage across the major disease areas for which Humira is currently approved, plus new areas, such as atopic dermatitis,\u201d AbbVie President Michael Severino said on a conference call.  AbbVie is also counting on the addition of wrinkle treatment Botox from Allergan, and other products in development to cushion the expected revenue drop after Humira loses U.S. patent protection.  Meanwhile Humira, despite stiff competition, had fourth-quarter sales of $4.92 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations of $4.85 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Skyrizi brought in sales of $216 million, topping estimates of about $142 million. Rinvoq had sales of $33 million in its first full quarter on the market.  \u201cWhile AbbVie is seeking to shine light on its early stage pipeline, we anticipate the performance of the stock will be heavily tied to ongoing Skyrizi and Rinvoq rollouts,\u201d said Citi analyst Andrew Baum.  He also expects investors to focus on delivery of promised savings from the Allergan deal.  Excluding items, AbbVie earned $2.21 per share in the fourth quarter, edging past expectations by 2 cents.

AbbVie has previously said that it would work with the FTC to discuss asset sales, which are sometimes needed to make deals conform with antitrust law.  The organizations urged the FTC to go further than simply identifying where there are product overlaps between the two companies, which is a big part of a traditional antitrust review of a merger of drug companies.

REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The ruling by U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle in Philadelphia came in an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2014 by the Federal Trade Commission against AbbVie and its partner Besins Healthcare Inc.  The decision followed a non-jury trial that tested the ability of the U.S. regulator to fight efforts by major pharmaceutical companies to prevent the sale of cheaper generic versions of their drugs.  \u201cThe FTC has established the actual market reality that defendants possessed monopoly power and illegally and willfully maintained that monopoly power through the filing of sham litigation,\u201d Bartle wrote.  Chicago-based AbbVie did not respond to a request for comment, but it denied the allegations at trial. A lawyer for privately-held Besins had no immediate comment.  The FTC has long fought against so-called \u201cpay for delay\u201d settlements, in which a brand-name drugmaker pays a generic rival to delay releasing a cheaper version of its product in exchange for resolving patent lawsuits.  In its lawsuit, the FTC accused AbbVie and Besins of filing baseless patent infringement lawsuits in 2011 against generic drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Perrigo Company to delay the launch of their generic versions of AndroGel.  The regulator alleged that as part of that effort, AbbVie and Besins entered into a pay-for-delay settlement with Teva, which helped delay generic drug competition.  Bartle in his ruling agreed the lawsuits were baseless and said that absent the litigation and settlement agreements stuck in the cases, Perrigo would have released a generic version of AndroGel in June 2013 rather than December 2014.  The judge ordered the companies to pay $448 million, representing their profits from June 2013 to August 2017.  He apportioned liability between AbbVie and Besins according to their agreed royalty rates. According to the ruling, Besins received 8 percent of U.S. net sales of AndroGel through March 2015, at which point the rate dropped to 5 percent.  The FTC, which had sought $1.35 billion, said the order was the largest award ever in an antitrust case that it litigated in court.  \u201cIt sends a clear signal that pharmaceutical companies can\u2019t use baseless litigation to forestall competition from low-cost generics,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement.","122":"FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the share price for pharmaceutical maker AbbVie on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., July 18, 2014.

Humira is the world\u2019s best-selling prescription medicine and has long buoyed AbbVie\u2019s business, accounting for some two-thirds of overall sales. But as cheaper biosimilar versions come closer to entering the market, North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie could lose share and be forced to slash prices to remain competitive, analysts have said.  AbbVie executives took a barrage of questions from Wall Street analysts on Friday about future strategy in the backdrop of rising competition to Humira as well as looming U.S. policy changes aimed at tackling soaring healthcare costs.  AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez reiterated the company\u2019s current strategy of signing agreements with rival drugmakers to delay the launch of Humira copies, but investors seemed unconvinced.  AbbVie\u2019s stock dipped despite the company\u2019s stronger-than-expected profit for the second quarter of 2018 and a slightly higher annual earnings target.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of skepticism, concerns about rebates and biosimilars. Some of that is quite reasonable,\u201d Gonzalez told analysts on a conference call. \u201c(But) every year since I can remember, there has been fretting about Humira.\u201d  Humira made $5.19 billion in second-quarter sales. Six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S had on average expected $5.18 billion.  Concerns around Humira\u2019s future will only increase through 2018 despite AbbVie\u2019s \u201csolid\u201d overall results, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a report.  To rely less on Humira, AbbVie has tried to grow sales from other medicines including cancer treatment Imbruvica, which it acquired as part of a $21 billion deal in 2015. The drug raked in quarterly sales of $850 million and topped analysts\u2019 estimates.  AbbVie does not have any multi-billion dollar acquisitions on the horizon, Gonzalez said, in response to a question from an analyst.  Still, the company would consider buying smaller assets, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my objective to telegraph to all of our competitors what our defense strategies are.

Brukinsa did not achieve the comparative study\u2019s main goals of showing greater reduction in cancer signs compared with Imbruvica and in reducing at least 90% of production of an antibody that overproduced in patients with WM.  However, it did show greater improvements in safety and tolerability, BeiGene said.  There is sufficient data from the comparative study to have a discussion with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for Brukinsa\u2019s approval in WM, the company said and added that it was too early to talk about regulatory filing.  \u201cIt is unlikely that we would do other trials, I think that there\u2019s potential that with longer follow up this trial in and of itself could suffice,\u201d Eric Hendrick, chief adviser at BeiGene, told Reuters.

Four patients on Brukinsa discontinued the treatment due to adverse events and there was one death, while the group receiving Imbruvica witnessed nine discontinuations from side effects and four deaths, BeiGene said.  Like Imbruvica, Brukinsa belongs to a class of drugs called Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors. It also competes against AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s Calquence, another BTK inhibitor.  BeiGene likely faces an uphill commercial battle versus Imbruvica and Calquence without positive head-to-head data, Guggenheim analyst Michael Schmidt said.

Technology companies led all three major U.S. stock indexes into the red ahead Powell\u2019s speech and the question-and-answer session to follow, which will be scrutinized by market participants for clues as to when and by how much the central bank will cut key interest rates.  \u201cIt\u2019s not an all-red day but it\u2019s pretty much a risk-off day with money moving into defensive names,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.  Despite Tuesday\u2019s sell-off, June is shaping up to be a good month for U.S. equities. The benchmark S&P 500 is still hovering within a percent of its all-time high reached last Thursday.  Still, anxieties stemming from the ongoing U.S.-China trade war found no relief in a White House official\u2019s remarks that President Trump is \u201ccomfortable with any outcome\u201d arising from an expected meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit convening in Japan on Friday.  \u201cThe upcoming meeting between Xi and Trump is being anxiously anticipated,\u201d Ghriskey added. \u201cExpectations for that meeting are low, even pessimistic.\u201d  On the economic front, sales of newly constructed homes and consumer confidence numbers both came in well below economist expectations, according to separate reports from the U.S. Commerce Department and the Conference Board.  Increasing signs of economic softness, especially related to the trade disputes between the United States and its major trading partners, helped prompt the Federal Reserve last week to signal interest rate cuts beginning as early as July.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.64 points, or 0.15%, to 26,687.9, the S&P 500 lost 9.33 points, or 0.32%, to 2,936.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.90 points, or 0.61%, to 7,956.80.  Of the 11 major indexes in the S&P 500, seven were in negative territory, with communications services seeing the biggest percentage drop.  Rate-sensitive bank stocks were down 0.3%, as U.S. benchmark yields fell below the closely watched 2% level.  The healthcare sector edged up 0.2%, boosted by news of a multi-billion dollar deal.  AbbVie Inc said it would buy Allergan Plc for about $63 billion, sending the Botox-maker\u2019s shares up by 26.7%. AbbVie\u2019s stock dropped 15.2% on the news.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

Six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S had on average expected $5.18 billion.  Humira is the world\u2019s best-selling prescription medicine, and AbbVie has aggressively tried to fend off any competition from rival drugmakers looking to make cheaper copies of the drug. The North Chicago, Illinois-based company has signed agreements with drug companies including Mylan to keep them from launching any Humira copies until 2023.  AbbVie\u2019s Imbruvica cancer drug raked in second-quarter sales of $850 million, exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates of $827.2 million.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  AbbVie is swallowing Allergan to give it control of the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and to diversify a portfolio heavily dependent on its $19-billion-per-year arthritis drug Humira, the world\u2019s best-selling medicine that is advancing toward U.S. patent expiration.  Swiss food group Nestle bulked up its medical nutrition business with Allergan\u2019s Zenpep, a product with 2018 sales of $237 million which treats people whose pancreases do not provide enough enzymes to digest fats, proteins and sugars.  Nestle did not give financial details, but analysts from Zuercher Kantonalbank estimated the takeover could have cost the Vevey, Switzerland-based company more than $1 billion.  Meanwhile, AstraZeneca is regaining rights to brazikumab, Allergan\u2019s experimental drug against Crohn\u2019s Disease and ulcerative colitis. The European Commission said this month the immunology medicine must be divested because of the risk its development would be halted after AbbVie\u2019s takeover because of competing medicines.  \u201cThese definitive agreements represent significant progress toward the completion of our acquisition of Allergan,\u201d Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said.  With regulators wary of the deal\u2019s anti-competitive potential, rivals are getting a chance to stock their own product shelves.  Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who also gets Allergan\u2019s Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme product, in Monday\u2019s deal, is bulking up on nutrition products that combine properties of medicine and food as the Swiss company expands in areas where growth may outpace its mainstream food business.  \u201cThis is a significant opportunity for our business in the United States,\u201d Greg Behar, head of Nestle Health Science, said in a statement.  AstraZeneca\u2019s pact for brazikumab marks a return of the inflammation medicine to the British drugmaker\u2019s portfolio. In 2016, Astra had struck a licensing deal with Allergan worth up to $1.5 billion for the medicine.  With its return to AstraZeneca, Allergan has agreed to fund development costs for brazikumab in Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, including the creation of a companion diagnostic, AstraZeneca said in a separate statement.  \u201cThis agreement creates an opportunity for us to complete the full development program and bring this potential new treatment option to patients as quickly as possible,\u201d Mene Pangalos, Astra\u2019s biopharmaceuticals research head.  Even if Allergan must foot the development bill, analysts appeared underwhelmed, in part because AbbVie\u2019s Skyrizi, or risankizumab, a similar medicine, has a head start.  \u201cThis could be another autoimmune product to add to Astra\u2019s portfolio, although it will be somewhat late to the market,\u201d Liberum\u2019s Alistair Campbell wrote in a note to investors.","173":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Drugmaker AbbVie Inc has won U.S. antitrust approval to buy Botox maker Allergan, a blockbuster $63 billion deal when it was announced last year, the companies said on Tuesday.  FILE PHOTO: A trader works by the post that trades AbbVie on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange March 5, 2015.REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  AbbVie, which has been under pressure to diversify its portfolio, said in June 2019 that it would acquire Allergan in a deal that gives AbbVie control over the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and buys time to seek new growth before its arthritis treatment Humira loses U.S. patent protection in 2023.  A four-week supply of Humira, the world\u2019s best-selling medicine, has a list price of about $5,174 or more than $60,000 for a year. Its sales were $4.70 billion for the most recent quarter despite declines outside the United States, where it has begun facing competition from cheaper biosimilar versions.  The combined AbbVie and Allergan will be based in AbbVie\u2019s home of North Chicago.  Allergan, formerly based in California, itself was part of a tax \u201cinversion\u201d deal, after European generic drugmaker Actavis bought it for $66 billion in 2015 and adopted the company\u2019s name, moving its headquarters to Dublin.  To win approval from the Federal Trade Commission, the companies said they agreed to divest brazikumab, a drug in development to treat autoimmune diseases, to AstraZeneca.  In addition, Swiss food giant Nestle agreed to buy Allergan\u2019s Zenpep, a product for people whose pancreases do not provide enough enzymes to properly digest fats, proteins and sugars, often because of cystic fibrosis. Zenpep had sales of $237 million in 2018. Nestle will also buy Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme preparation.  The deal was approved by the European Union in January on condition that brazikumab be sold.  The five-member FTC split on whether to approve the merger, with the three Republicans in favor and two Democrats against.  In their statement, the Republican Chairman Joseph Simons and Commissioners Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson argued that the two companies\u2019 drug portfolios are strong in different areas and, once the divestitures are done, there was no evidence that the deal would lead to higher prices or lost innovation.  Democratic Commissioner Rohit Chopra called the FTC decision to divest drugs to Nestle, a company that sells no medicines, \u201crisky and concerning,\u201d and Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter agreed.  The two also expressed concern about AstraZeneca actually bringing brazikumab to market since the company will not pay for it and will have less incentive to make its money back.","174":"June 12 (Reuters) - Abbvie Inc:  * ABBVIE PRESENTS NEW LATE-BREAKING DATA SHOWING SKYRIZI\u00ae (RISANKIZUMAB-RZAA) ACHIEVES SUPERIOR RATES OF COMPLETE SKIN CLEARANCE VERSUS COSENTYX\u00ae (SECUKINUMAB) AT 52 WEEKS  * ABBVIE INC - NEW HEAD-TO-HEAD DATA FROM IMMERGE PHASE 3B OPEN-LABEL STUDY SHOW SKYRIZI DEMONSTRATED SUPERIORITY TO COSENTYX AT WEEK 52  * ABBVIE INC - NO NEW SAFETY SIGNALS WERE OBSERVED FOR SKYRIZI THROUGH 52 WEEKS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","175":"Dec 18 (Reuters) - Abbvie Inc:  * ABBVIE REACHES AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PAN-CANADIAN PHARMACEUTICAL ALLIANCE (PCPA) FOR THE COMBINATION VENCLEXTA\u00ae WITH RITUXIMAB AS A TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (CLL)  * ABBVIE INC - VENCLEXTA CONTINUES TO BE INVESTIGATED IN CLL AND OTHER HEMATOLOGICAL DISEASES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","176":"(Adds La Poste\u2019s, Woodford, Iren, Magellan Midstream; Updates AbbVie, Bombardier)  June 25 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Tuesday:  ** Drugmaker AbbVie Inc said it would acquire Allergan Plc for about $63 billion, giving AbbVie control over the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and buying time to seek new growth before its blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira loses U.S. patent protection.  ** Woodford Investment Management is close to hiring bankers to sell its stakes in private companies Atom Bank and Oxford Nanopore, part of a rescue bid aimed at raising hundreds of millions of pounds, Sky News reported.  ** France\u2019s market regulator has approved state-owned mail operator La Poste\u2019s takeover of CNP Assurances in a bid to create a state-controlled bank and insurer focused on the country\u2019s rural areas.  ** U.S. pipeline operator Magellan Midstream Partners is exploring the sale of a 35% stake in its Longhorn crude oil pipeline in Texas for as much as $2 billion, four people familiar with the matter said.  ** Bombardier Inc said it will sell its money-losing regional jet business to Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd (MHI) for $550 million in cash, in a deal marking the Canadian plane and train maker\u2019s exit from commercial aviation.  ** Italian utility Iren made a non-binding offer to tie-up with regional peer Compagnia Valdostana delle Acque (CVA) to create one of Italy\u2019s biggest hydroelectric players, a source close to Iren said.  ** Private equity firm Onex Corp said its C$3.5 billion buyout offer for WestJet Airlines Ltd received approval from Canada\u2019s Minister of Transport, clearing the first of several regulatory hurdles.  ** Australian copper miner Sandfire Resources NL sweetened its takeover offer for smaller rival MOD Resources Ltd , valuing it at A$167 million ($116.3 million) and enough to satisfy MOD\u2019s board.  ** South Korea said it would sell its entire stake in Woori Financial Group Inc within three years, in a move to recoup taxpayers\u2019 money spent to bail out the company two decades ago.  ** French fashion group SMCP has agreed to buy men\u2019s luxury clothing company De Fursac, in a deal which it said would boost its earnings and fit in well with its other existing brands such as Sandro.  ** E.ON has offered to sell assets in Hungary, Germany and the Czech Republic to address European Union antitrust concerns over the German energy group\u2019s bid for rival Innogy\u2019s network and retail assets.  ** German lighting group Osram said it had sold its luminaires unit Siteco to the investment arm of strategic consultancy Stern Stewart & Co for an undisclosed sum.  ** Bellevue Group is weighing the sale of its Bank am Bellevue wealth management unit and has held talks with potential buyers, it said, adding that efforts to reposition activities lag internal expectations.  ** Spain\u2019s Allfunds Group is buying Credit Suisse\u2019s business-to-business investment fund platform InvestLab for an undisclosed sum as the investment services industry consolidates to reap the benefits of scale.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle in Philadelphia came in an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2014 by the Federal Trade Commission against AbbVie and its partner Besins Healthcare Inc.  The decision followed a non-jury trial that tested the ability of the U.S. regulator to fight efforts by major pharmaceutical companies to prevent the sale of cheaper generic versions of their drugs.  The FTC had accused Chicago-based AbbVie and Besins of filing baseless patent infringement lawsuits against competitors to delay the launch of their generic products.  The FTC, which had sought $1.35 billion, said the order was the largest monetary award ever in an antitrust case that it litigated in court. Bartle said liability would be apportioned between AbbVie and Besins according their agreed royalty rates.  \u201cIt sends a clear signal that pharmaceutical companies can\u2019t use baseless litigation to forestall competition from low-cost generics,\u201d FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement.

Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths in the uterus that can cause problems such as pain, pressure, heavy periods and infertility in as many as half the women who have them. They are very common, particularly among African American women.  The elagolix treatment, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, could give women a new option for dealing with the bleeding. Current treatment sometimes involves injections given monthly or every three months. Elagolix is a pill whose effects appear and fade much more rapidly and predictably. The new studies did not directly compare the two treatments.  \u201cThis does provide a different approach and many women may prefer that,\u201d lead study author Dr. William Schlaff of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. \u201cWe know it\u2019s effective for at least six months. If that can be prolonged, it could act as a bridge to get to menopause, where hormone levels drop naturally.\u201d  \u201cBut if you\u2019re 32 years old (with a fibroid bleeding problem) this may not be a bridge you want to use for 20 years,\u201d he said. Such women may want to consider a hysterectomy or some other option.  The two new studies - which were identical - followed a total of 790 women with a menstrual blood loss of more than 80 milliliters (about 2.7 ounces) per month.  At the six-month mark, among women getting placebo treatment, 8.7% in one study and 10% in the other saw their monthly blood loss reduced by at least 50%.  When the women were given elagolix alone, the success rates were 84.1% in one study and 77% in the other.  The treatment suppresses ovarian sex hormones, increasing the odds of osteoporosis. So in some women, doctors also gave hormone therapy to compensate.  With that hormonal \u201cadd-back therapy,\u201d monthly flow was still reduced by at least 50% in 68.5% of women in one study and in 76.5% in the other.  Add-back therapy alleviated decreases in bone mineral density caused by elagolix but it also increased the number of hot flushes in both trials, and in one trial, it increased the likelihood of spotting between periods, the researchers found.  Most side effects of the drug \u201cwere considered by the investigators to be mild or moderate in severity,\u201d they reported.  The studies, known as Elaris UF-1 and Elaris UF-2, were financed by AbbVie, which sells the drug under the brand name Orilissa.  The 300-milligram twice-daily elagolix treatment would cost more than $47,000 per year, according to prices on goodrx.com. In contrast, monthly leuprolide injections, which are an established treatment, costs roughly $7,000 per year.  Compared with placebo recipients, elagolix recipients with add-back therapy also had higher levels of the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin in their blood and were more likely to have their periods cease altogether.  They also tended to score higher on quality of life questionnaires.  Schlaff, who chairs the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Thomas Jefferson, predicted that if the drug is approved for fibroid bleeding, it will change the way women are treated.  \u201cA lot of women want to use oral medication\u201d instead of periodic injections, he said. \u201cWomen are going to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to commit to a 1- or 3-month dose.\u2019 Or they may want to start with one and move to another.\u201d  (This story has been refiled to correct brand name of drug in paragraph 12)  SOURCE: bit.ly\/3ayo3zN The New England Journal of Medicine, online January 22, 2020.","183":"Feb 28 (Reuters) - Abbvie Inc:  * ABBVIE PROVIDES UPDATE FROM PHASE 3 STUDY EVALUATING VENCLEXTA\u00ae (VENETOCLAX) IN COMBINATION WITH LOW-DOSE CYTARABINE IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML)  * ABBVIE-PHASE 3 VIALE-A TRIAL EVALUATING VENETOCLAX IN COMBINATION WITH AZACYTIDINE IS ONGOING, AT THIS TIME INDICATIONS FOR VENETOCLAX REMAIN UNCHANGED  * ABBVIE - STUDY EVALUATING VENCLEXTA DID NOT DEMONSTRATE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF OVERALL SURVIVAL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","184":"March 9 (Reuters) - Abbvie Inc:  * ABBVIE ANNOUNCES EXTENSION OF EXPIRATION DATE FOR EXCHANGE OFFERS FOR ALLERGAN NOTES  * ABBVIE INC - ABBVIE EXTENDS EXPIRATION DATE FROM 5:00 P.M., ET ON MARCH 13 TO 5:00 P.M., ET ON MARCH 27, 2020 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","185":"June 25 (Reuters) - Sosei Group Corp:  * SOSEI HEPTARES AND ABBVIE ANNOUNCE NEW DISCOVERY COLLABORATION TARGETING INFLAMMATORY DISEASES  * SOSEI HEPTARES IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE UP TO US$32 MILLION IN UPFRONT AND NEAR-TERM MILESTONE PAYMENTS, AND POTENTIAL OPTION, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL MILESTONES OF UP TO $377 MILLION, PLUS TIERED ROYALTIES ON GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SALES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","186":"WASHINGTON, May 5 (Reuters) - Drugmaker AbbVie has won U.S. antitrust approval to buy Botox-maker Allergan, a blockbuster $63 billion deal when it was announced last year, the companies announced on Tuesday.

The agency requested more time to review additional information regarding the results of liver function tests provided by AbbVie in connection with the application for Elagolix in endometriosis-associated pain, the companies said.  The request comes a month after it extended the time to review rival Allergan Plc\u2019s uterine fibroids drug Esmya.  Four reports of serious liver injury in patients treated with the drug caused European regulators to open a review into Allergan\u2019s rival drug in December.  \u201cThis is just the FDA being consistent in their request for similar indications,\u201d said Baird analyst Brian Skorney, adding that he did not think the issue was specific to Elagolix.

Endometriosis occurs when the lining of the uterus grows outside of the womb, leading to chronic pelvic pain. It is the leading cause of infertility.  Neurocrine and AbbVie are also testing Elagolix for the treatment of uterine fibroids in late-stage clinical studies.  AbbVie said the marketing application for Elagolix was based on data from the largest prospective randomized clinical trials conducted to date for endometriosis, and that it remained confident in its application for the drug.

However, the list price is not necessarily what patients actually pay as \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d costs vary based on the duration of the treatment and individual healthcare plans.  Humira brought in global revenue of $4.87 billion in the second quarter, but sales have been hit by competition from cheaper rivals in Europe, and AbbVie in June announced a deal to buy Botox-maker Allergan Plc for $63 billion to reduce dependence on the drug.  The company has signed deals to prevent cheaper versions of Humira, which also treats psoriasis, from entering the United States, its biggest market, until 2023.  The newly approved treatment, Rinvoq, belongs to a class of medicines known as JAK inhibitors that block inflammation-causing enzymes called Janus kinases and will be available later this month.  The drug, also called upadacitinib, was developed in the same Massachusetts facility where Humira was discovered, as the company sought to develop a treatment that was more effective in rheumatoid arthritis patients, Lisa Olson, who works in AbbVie\u2019s immunology discovery team, told Reuters.  The FDA approval allows Rinvoq\u2019s use in adults with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate - one of the first medicines prescribed to these patients - did not work well or could not be tolerated.  Rinvoq is set to compete with Pfizer Inc\u2019s Xeljanz and Eli Lilly\u2019s Olumiant.  Rinvoq's label has a warning that flags risks of serious infections and lymphoma.

Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis, a chronic skin condition.  The approval of Skyrizi, an injectable drug, is based on results from AbbVie\u2019s global Phase 3 psoriasis program, which assessed the safety and efficacy of the drug in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  AbbVie said it expects Skyrizi to be available in the United States in early May.  Psoriasis causes an overproduction of skin cells, resulting in inflamed, red lesions or plaques, which can be itchy and painful. It affects 7.5 million Americans and is the most prevalent autoimmune disease in the United States, AbbVie said.  Humira is the world\u2019s best-selling prescription medicine and has long buoyed AbbVie\u2019s business, bringing in revenue of $19.94 billion in 2018. But it is set to face biosimilar competition from 2023.

The trial was the first of its kind to test Taltz and the standard-of-care, Humira, head-to-head in patients with active psoriatic arthritis, a form of arthritis that affects some people who have psoriasis.  The study showed Taltz was as effective as Humira in improving the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis, as measured by achieving a reduction in disease activity of at least 50 percent, compared with patients that showed such results on Humira after 24 weeks.  However, the drug was found superior to Humira in clearing skin completely in a greater number of patients and achieving both results simultaneously, Lilly said.  \u201cThis is a very, very high hurdle to meet and gives doctors confidence that they can prescribe Taltz as a treatment for newly diagnosed patients.

The drugmaker expects the two treatments, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, to bring in a combined revenue of about $1.70 billion in 2020.  The profit forecast excludes any impact from its $63 billion deal for Botox-maker Allergan Plc, which it expects to close in the first quarter.  \u201cThe launches of Skyrizi and Rinvoq are going extremely well,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Richard Gonzalez said in a statement.  In the fourth quarter, Skyrizi brought in sales of $216 million, topping estimates of $142 million, according to five analysts polled by Refinitiv. Rinvoq, which was approved in August, brought in sales of $33 million.  AbbVie is betting on new treatments and the addition of Botox to its portfolio as it braces for a revenue hit when it loses patent protection for Humira, the world\u2019s best-selling medicine, in its biggest market, the United States, in 2023.  Humira has been boosting the company\u2019s revenue ever since it was approved to treat psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the drug\u2019s sales have suffered since new competition entered Europe.  Quarterly sales of the blockbuster drug were largely unchanged compared with a year earlier at $4.92 billion.

Mylan NV, Biogen Inc Amgen Inc and Novartis AG have all begun selling biosimilar versions of Humira in Europe, fueling investor concerns as the drugmaker still depends on Humira - the world\u2019s top-selling prescription medicine - for about two-thirds of its revenue.  BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said it was a good quarter that modestly exceeded expectations. \u201cHowever, the fundamental concerns about AbbVie are about long-term growth prospects. The dividend increase will make AbbVie appear more attractive, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Arfaei said in a note.  AbbVie increased its quarterly dividend by about 11 percent.  AbbVie said it expects Humira sales outside the United States to drop around 26 to 27 percent next year, above its previous forecast of 18 to 20 percent. It projected international sales of the drug for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders to approach $6.3 billion in 2018.  Total Humira sales for the quarter rose 9 percent to $5.12 billion. It is not expected to face biosimilar competition in the United States until 2023.  Gonzalez was bullish about AbbVie\u2019s portfolio of cancer treatments and said he was confident of delivering double-digit earnings growth in 2019, despite the Humira biosimilar threat and expected higher spending to launch new drugs.

AbbVie is counting on the Allergan acquisition, expected to close early next year, to help lessen its dependence on Humira, the world\u2019s top selling medicine, and diversify its product portfolio.  Humira, which treats rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, has begun to come under pressure from cheaper rivals in Europe and faces patent expiration in the United States, its biggest market, in 2023.  Third-quarter Humira sales dipped 3.7% to $4.94 billion, a decline primarily due to biosimilar competition in Europe. That still topped Wall Street expectations of $4.89 billion, according Refinitiv.  The deal for Allergan will give AbbVie another multibillion-dollar product with a lucrative aesthetics business that does not depend on insurance reimbursement, as well as several medical uses.

More than 6,000 similar lawsuits have been filed, the bulk of them against AbbVie.  In a separate trial, a federal jury in January found AbbVie not liable in a lawsuit by an Arizona man who claimed he had suffered a pulmonary embolism as a result of using AndroGel.  According to court filings, the jury on Monday concluded that AbbVie had not falsely marketed the drug and was not strictly liable, but found that the company acted negligently.  It awarded Mitchell $200,000 in compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages.  AbbVie in a statement said it was disappointed with the verdict and intends to appeal.  Lawyers for Mitchell did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the verdict.  Mitchell suffered a heart attack in 2012 after almost five years of treatment with AndroGel, but recovered after several months, according to his lawsuit.  In the first AndroGel decision against AbbVie, a jury in October ordered the company to pay more than $140 million to a Tennessee man who claimed the drug caused him to suffer a heart attack. AbbVie has asked Kennelly to throw out that verdict over inconsistencies during the trial.  Other pharmaceutical companies are facing similar lawsuits over their testosterone replacement therapies.  But Eli Lilly and Co, Endo International and GlaxoSmithKline have told Kennelly in recent months that they have tentatively agreed to settle hundreds of lawsuits against them.
