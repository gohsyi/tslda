American International Group Inc and Chubb Ltd said payouts on claims related to the disease accounted for most of their financial hit, which was mostly on property and casualty policies.  Others including Travelers Companies Inc, MetLife Inc and Prudential Financial Inc lost money on their private equity investments due to market declines in the first quarter, which are reported on a three-month lag. Those losses are expected to reverse, since the market has recovered.  Insurers had sounded alarms about potentially crippling payouts if they were required to pay claims related to coronavirus on business-interruption policies.  Those payouts could still happen, depending on the outcome of litigation. Two cases have so far been decided in insurers\u2019 favor.  It may still be too early to say insurers are not at risk of major claims from the coronavirus and a related respiratory disease, COVID-19, said Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome.  \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what the extent of COVID claims will be in the third quarter,\u201d he said.  But insurers now have better predictions about COVID-related mortality and are well-capitalized, said Andrew Kligerman, analyst at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe industry is positioned to see some growth if and when we can pull through COVID,\u201d he said.  Here are details of coronavirus-related impacts on the insurers and their outlooks for the rest of 2020:  CHUBB  Chubb tallied $1.16 billion in after-tax coronavirus-related reported and unreported claims, which contributed to a net loss of $331 million for the quarter. The company is based in Zurich, but has a significant presence in the United States.  Net premiums written fell by $191 million, mainly from workers\u2019 compensation and commercial casualty payments, including refunds on auto policies. Chubb said its investment income also fell by an undisclosed amount.  The company expects full-year premium revenue to increase, Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said on a conference call.  AIG  AIG's general insurance business reported $458 million worth of claims and expected claims related to the pandemic in the second quarter, in line with its expectations. So far this year, its tally here of such costs is $730 million.  AIG did not break out the impact on its life and retirement business, but said losses on private equity investments, yield compression and higher mortality rates drove a decline in adjusted pre-tax profit for that unit during the quarter.  AIG is already seeing signs that the second quarter was a \u201clow watermark\u201d for sales, Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said.  PRUDENTIAL  Prudential did not detail coronavirus effects specifically, but said its group insurance, retirement and individual life businesses were affected in positive and negative ways. Prudential also recorded $2.7 billion in investment losses, but did not say how much related to coronavirus.  The company said it could experience a $70 million earnings decline for every additional 100,000 pandemic fatalities in the United States. Prudential anticipates about $60 million in costs in the second half related to the disease, which will be offset by about $30 million in benefits, such as lower travel and entertainment expenses.  TRAVELERS  The pandemic and its effect on the economy resulted in $114 million in direct losses, with the largest impact in workers\u2019 compensation coverage, Travelers said. Its portfolio of non-fixed income investments lost $234 million before tax due to the market decline in the first quarter, the results of which are reported a quarter later, the insurer said.  \u201cWe expect to experience the impacts of economic disruption\u201d on revenue in coming quarters, Chief Financial Officer Dan Frey said on a conference call, though the duration and intensity of the impact remain unclear. On investments, while markets have recovered, fund managers may \u201cnot be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down,\u201d he added.  METLIFE  MetLife lost $555 million on its private-equity investments because of first-quarter value declines. But its core businesses experienced few effects from the pandemic, with gains on some areas being offset by others, Chief Financial Officer John McCallion told Reuters.  He predicted a \u201cstrong recovery\u201d in investment income this quarter, and a mid-single-digit return on its private equity portfolio, which was valued at $7.2 billion on June 30.

Chubb will also stop underwriting the construction of new coal-fired power plants. The company said for existing coal plants, insurance coverage for risks that exceed the 30% threshold will be phased out by 2022, and for utilities beginning in 2022.  Additionally, it will also not invest in companies that generate more than 30% of revenue from thermal coal mining or energy production from coal.  Chubb's move follows similar decisions by some of Europe's biggest insurers and financial institutions - including Allianz Finance Corp [ALVGLZ.UL], AXA [AXAFD.UL], Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L and Zurich Insurance Group AG ZURN.S - which have placed restrictions on coal underwriting as part of an effort to combat climate change.  \u201cMaking this transition necessarily involves planning and action by businesses, policymakers, investors and citizens,\u201d the company said in a statement, adding the policy is expected to have minimal impact on premium revenue and no impact on investment performance.  Chubb\u2019s decision comes amid growing pressure by activist investors and environmentalists for U.S. insurers and banks to pull back from polluting industries like coal production and oil sands production.  The company and its subsidiaries invest around $2.9 billion in fossil fuel companies, according to the California Department of Insurance\u2019s Climate Risk Carbon Initiative database.  Chubb said the exceptions to the new policy will be considered until 2022, taking into account an insured company\u2019s commitment to reduce coal dependence and also regions that do not have practical near term alternative energy sources.  The Insure Our Future campaign, a consortium of activist groups, has pressured Chubb to pull back from exposure to coal and oil sands companies for nine months.  \u201cA major U.S. insurer like Chubb restricting insurance for coal projects and companies is a game-changer,\u201d said Ross Hammond, senior strategist for the Insure Our Future campaign, but added the company should also stop underwriting new mines.  Chubb could not immediately be reached for further comment.  Activists are also targeting other U.S. insurers, including Liberty Mutual [LBRTLI.UL] and American International Group Inc AIG.N.  At least 34 coal divestment or restriction policy announcements have been made by financial institutions since the start of 2018, according to a February report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.","3":"(Reuters) - Global insurers are well capitalized to absorb the hit from rising claims and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, ratings agency AM Best said on Monday, citing a stress test it conducted to gauge the immediate impact of outbreak on insurers\u2019 financial strength.  FILE PHOTO: A woman wearing a protective face mask walks past Lloyd's building in London, following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), London, Britain, May 6, 2020. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls\/File Photo  AM Best said most rated insurers and reinsurers performed well in its stress test and their capital levels provided an adequate buffer against a potential shock to their balance sheets.  Sensitivity to the COVID-19 pandemic was greater for life and health insurers with high asset and mortality risks, insurers with material exposures to mortgage loans, carriers operating in domiciles in higher country-risk tiers and companies with smaller capital bases.  Property and casualty insurers in the United States and Canada performed relatively well in the stress test, compared with life, annuity and health insurers.  Most companies in the Asia-Pacific market generally performed well, as did those in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, the test showed.  \u201cInsurers are likely to see a significant hit to earnings in 2020, rather than a material decline in risk-adjusted capitalization,\u201d said Mahesh Mistry, senior director, AM Best Rating Services.  \u201cReputational risk in certain markets may also be a problem, as any legal disputes become more visible to consumers, policyholders, regulators and legislators,\u201d he added.  Unlike other disasters, the pandemic has been hitting businesses, individuals and markets throughout the world, all at once. Customers are filing claims across numerous policy types, for workers\u2019 compensation to events cancellation to broader commercial liabilities.  The disputes over claims continue just as the United States is about to enter what meteorologists predict will be above-average Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, which could spur similar claims for insurers.  Executives, lawyers and analysts say the cost is sure to be in multiples of prior catastrophes including Hurricane Katrina, the T\u014dhoku tsunami or the 9\/11 attacks. That could be tens of billions to half a trillion dollars or more, depending on how long the pandemic lasts and other variables. [nL1N2CM238]  The stress test analysis covered about 1,400 rating units worldwide, and focused on the impact of COVID-19 on underwriting and assets. The procedure for the test included gathering information from companies through a questionnaire.  Questions ranged from the impact of the disease outbreak on operations and financial position, previous pandemic risk stress test scenarios a company may have previously modeled and any adjustments to 2020 financial expectations.","4":"ZURICH\/BERLIN, April 14(Reuters) - The Swiss blue-chip SMI was seen opening 0.6% higher at 9,505 points on Tuesday, according to premarket indications from bank Julius Baer .

Slideshow ( 2 images )  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was honored at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Oxon Hill, Maryland, by the NRA with the \u201cCharlton Heston Courage Under Fire Award,\u201d an honor named for the late actor who was an NRA president.  The award is a Kentucky long rifle that will stay at the NRA\u2019s museum in Fairfax, Virginia. The NRA was not allowed to bring the weapon on stage, said Carolyn Meadows, an NRA official.  It was not immediately clear why the NRA was not able to present the long gun to the FCC chairman. The FCC, CPAC and the NRA did not immediately respond to questions.  A Reuters reporter at the event said there were no visible prohibitions against weapons at the event but metal detectors were present before President Donald Trump\u2019s address earlier on Friday.  At the event, Pai defended his aggressive approach to undoing numerous telecommunications regulations put in place under former President Barack Obama.  \u201cSome people urged me to go for sacrifice bunts and singles and try to nibble around the edges \u2014 make some minor changes,\u201d Pai said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t play small ball.\u201d  Pai canceled his appearance in January at a large consumer electronics event in Las Vegas after receiving deaths threats, sources told Reuters.  The repeal of the net neutrality rules was a victory for internet service providers like AT&T Inc T.N, Comcast Corp CMCSA.O and Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N, conferring power over what content consumers can access and allowing them to offer paid fast lanes for certain content.  On the other side, technology companies including Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Facebook Inc FB.O have thrown their weight behind the congressional bid to reverse the net neutrality repeal.  On Thursday, 22 state attorneys general filed sued to block the repeal.  Fight for the Future, a group that backs net neutrality, said in a tweet the NRA gave Pai an award that will \u201callow Internet service providers (ISPs) to censor websites and information about guns.\u201d  Several corporations have cut ties with the NRA after the group launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun ownership laws after a gunman killed 17 people at a Florida high-school.  Insurer Chubb Ltd CB.N said on Friday that it would stop underwriting an NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Insurance company MetLife Inc MET.N ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members, while several rental car companies announced they were ending discount programs for NRA members.  (This version of the story corrects \u201cOxon Hills\u201d to Oxon Hill.)","6":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The fallout over last week\u2019s shooting rampage at a Florida high school started to take its toll on the National Rifle Association\u2019s roster of corporate partners on Friday as a half dozen companies severed marketing ties with the gun advocacy organization.  The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, occurred after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun ownership laws.  At the same time, gun control activists are stepping up pressure on Amazon.com Inc and other online streaming platforms to drop the online video channel NRATV, featuring gun-friendly programming produced by the NRA.  Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, founded after 20 first-graders were shot and killed at a Connecticut school in 2012, sent letters to Apple Inc, AT&T Inc, Amazon, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Roku Inc on Friday, asking them to drop NRATV from their platforms.  \u201cWe have been just disgusted by NRATV since its beginning,\u201d Shannon Watts, founder of the Moms Demand Action group, told Reuters. \u201cIt tries to pit Americans against one another, all in an attempt to further their agenda of selling guns.\u201d  AT&T said it does not carry NRATV. None of the other companies immediately responded to requests for comment.  The issue of gun control, and the NRA\u2019s role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate on Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.  The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights. The group has not commented on companies cutting ties.  Angry student survivors of the shooting have confronted politicians from state lawmakers to U.S. President Donald Trump himself, demanding stricter gun control laws.  In response, the NRA and Trump have suggested arming teachers who have received training to deter attackers, a proposal that has been met with skepticism by teachers unions and gun violence experts.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Drake  TRENDING ON TWITTER  Before the corporate defections, nearly two dozen companies nationwide had offered incentives to NRA members, according to ThinkProgress.com, a news site owned by the Center for American Progress Action Fund.  The attrition started late Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA\u2019s contract to issue a co-branded Visa card.  By Friday, the list of defectors expanded to include Symantec Corp, which ended an discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs.  Chubb Ltd said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc, also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA.  David Hogg, one of the student survivors of last week\u2019s attack who launched the #NeverAgain anti-gun violence movement, said the students would target any company with ties to the NRA, in addition to lawmakers who accept donations.  About a dozen other companies with marketing ties to the NRA, including FedEx Corp and Hertz, which offer discount programs, did not respond to requests for comment.  SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS  Activists have also called on public pension funds to divest from gun maker stocks, which were broadly lower on Friday.  Meanwhile, an online campaign using the Twitter hashtag #StopNRAmazon picked up steam, putting pressure on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to drop the channel. Many of those tweeting are in the entertainment industry.  \u201cIronic how the @NRA likes to point a finger at what kids watch on TV ... while they spew vile rhetoric on NRAtv, streamed on @Amazon and aimed solely at boosting gun sales,\u201d wrote screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer.  Moms Demand Action, which sent the letters to the streaming platform, also posted an online petition using the hashtag #DumpNRATV.  \u201cTo be affiliated with them, whether you are a company or a lawmaker, it is not going to pay off in the long run,\u201d said Watts, the group\u2019s founder, signaling the start of a broader campaign. \u201cDoing business with the NRA is clearly bad business.\u201d  The target of its ire is NRATV, which describes itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth.\u201d The channel features programming that leans heavily on speeches by NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and spokeswoman Dana Loesch.  Yet another campaign, using the hashtag #BoycottNRA, was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday morning.  The push is the latest effort by social activists to use social media to apply economic pressure to force change.  Last April, Fox News parted ways with television host Bill O\u2019Reilly when sponsors started to drop his show in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him.  Similarly the National Football League announced a tougher policy on handling domestic violence accusations against players when its marketing partners applied pressure for changes.

A man types on a computer keyboard in Warsaw in this February 28, 2013 illustration file picture. REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel\/Files  What makes Jerry Hourihan lose sleep is that everyone\u2019s information already is likely compromised. Hourihan is head of the U.S. private client group for insurer AIG Inc, which last year launched a Family CyberEdge policy, offering coverage for advanced cyber threats.  When AIG was developing the project, Hourihan said a senior executive volunteered to see what security consultants could dig up about him on the dark web. Within minutes, they purchased his Social Security number for a few dollars.  \u201cEveryone\u2019s information is out there, and the task is to minimize your risk,\u201d said Hourihan.  It requires a lot more than just a monthly $9.99 identity theft monitoring service or fraud alerts on your credit card to deal with ransomware, cyberbullying, network infiltration and a whole host of other scary threats.  If you do not have a corporate-level IT department to call in a pinch, you can now buy that kind of protection. Prices vary based on the coverage, but they are intended for high net-worth families, so expect sticker shock. Along with AIG\u2019s CyberEdge, Chubb Ltd just launched a cyber protection extension to its Masterpiece homeowner policy.  These policies cover for losses up to $250,0000, if, for instance, you need to replace the entire smart lighting system in your house because it has been hacked. The policies also offer ongoing white-glove consulting services to shore up cyber-defenses and also clean up after any incidents.  If these policies work for upper-income families, lower-priced coverage will follow, says independent security expert Robert Siciliano.  \u201cThey\u2019re testing the waters, and they\u2019ll see if it\u2019ll be worth it to them to provide it to the masses,\u201d said Siciliano, chief executive of IDTheftSecurity.com.  So far, most of AIG\u2019s CyberEdge clients are asking questions about best safety practices.  \u201cThe goal is to provide a lot of consultation up front, and then avoid most of the issues,\u201d said Hourihan.  Chubb\u2019s Masterpiece is front-loading its policies with a lot of prevention, including a special wi-fi router from cyber-security firm Symantec Corp\u2019s Norton, said Mike Tanenbaum, executive vice-president of Chubb\u2019s North American cyber practice.  HOME REMEDIES  Without getting an expensive insurance policy, there are steps you can take to limit risk.  Change the locks, so to speak, said Mary Qualls of Florida-based Vault Insurance, catering to high net-worth homeowners. That can involve restarting your router to break any ongoing connection a hacker has into your network and also changing all your passwords.  Siciliano does not understand why everyone does not use a password management program.  \u201cThat is pure laziness,\u201d Siciliano said.  With no universal reporting, it is hard to get a good grasp on cyber security problems and figure out a way to solve them. Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center (idtheftcenter.org), said that if more people reported hacking incidents it would help.  Recent data from the Federal Trade Commission found that millennials are reporting fraud a lot more often than other groups, with an average loss around $200, Velasquez said. Seniors reported less, but their average loss is $1,200.  \u201cAs you have more resources, your trigger of \u2018is that painful enough to report?\u2019 changes. The thieves know that,\u201d said Velasquez.  The result: Hackers keep thefts low enough to fly under the radar and continue to operate with impunity.  Velasquez, whose organization offers free services for victims of identify theft, said that insurance could be worth it for individuals if they do a cost-benefit analysis.  \u201cDo your homework, make sure it is legit, and know what\u2019s covered,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cIf it brings you peace of mind, that can be of value. At the same time, just because you have insurance, you can\u2019t abdicate responsibility.\u201d","9":"July 1 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB ANNOUNCES NEW POLICY ON COAL UNDERWRITING AND INVESTMENT  * CHUBB-TO STOP UNDERWRITING CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION OF NEW COAL-FIRED PLANTS\/NEW RISKS FOR COS WITH OVER 30% REVENUE FROM COAL MINING\/ENERGY PRODUCTION FROM COAL  * CHUBB - INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR EXISTING COAL-PLANT RISKS EXCEEDING 30% THRESHOLD TO BE PHASED OUT BY 2022, AND FOR UTILITIES BEGINNING IN 2022  * CHUBB - TO NOT MAKE NEW DEBT\/EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN COS THAT GENERATE OVER 30% OF REVENUE FROM THERMAL COAL MINING OR ENERGY PRODUCTION FROM COAL  * CHUBB LTD - COAL POLICY IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A DE MINIMIS IMPACT ON PREMIUM REVENUES AND NO IMPACT ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","10":"(Reuters) - Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp on Saturday said it was hit by a \u201cMaze\u201d ransomware cyber attack, resulting in service disruptions for some of its clients.

That culminated Wall Street\u2019s biggest sell-off in eight months on Wednesday.  On Thursday, a smaller-than-anticipated rise in consumer prices eased some fears of inflation pressures rising, but did little to change expectations of the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in December.  The indexes fell below key technical levels, the S&P and the Nasdaq dropped below their 200-day moving average prices and the Dow slipped below its 100-day moving average, before the slide eased.

REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  PG&E Corp PCG.N, which operates in the northern part of California, dropped 16 percent, bringing its loss over two sessions to 29 percent, equivalent to $8 billion. Edison International EIX.N, the owner of Southern California Edison Company, slumped 11 percent, leaving its stock market value $5 billion lower since Thursday when the fires broke out.  PG&E was deemed responsible for wildfires in 2017 that ravaged wine country north of the San Francisco Bay area and killed 46 people, and this week\u2019s fires create new uncertainties for investors in California\u2019s utilities.  The so-called Camp Fire in northern California, the state\u2019s most destructive blaze on record, had left at least 228 people missing as of early Monday after burning down more than 6,700 homes and businesses in the town of Paradise.  In southern California, the Woolsey Fire had forced authorities to issue evacuation orders for a quarter million people in Ventura and Los Angeles counties and beachside communities including the Malibu beach colony.  Both utilities reported to regulators in recent days that they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas where fires were reported, just before or close to the time they started.  SunTrust analyst Ali Agha in a note to clients said the sell-off in Edison International was likely overdone because total acres and property burned so far in its territory were smaller than in fires last year. He noted that new legislation could help reduce the potential costs related to possible liability.  The fire in northern California has probably caused between $2 billion and $4 billion in insured property damage, Morgan Stanley estimated in a report on Monday. Shares of insurance companies covering homes and businesses in California also fell, with Allstate ALL.N, Travelers Companies TRV.N, Chubb Ltd CB.N and Hartford Financial HIG.N each down more than 1 percent.  PG&E recorded a $2.5 billion in pre-tax expense for the second quarter related to last year\u2019s fires after a report said some of them were sparked by trees toppling into PG&E power lines.  Both utilities said the causes of the current fires have not been determined. PG&E said that as of Saturday, 25,000 customers were without electricity and that it had turned off gas for another 12,000 customers.  Southern California Edison said 9,500 of its customers were without power due to the Woolsey fire in southern California.  In September, the state passed a bill allowing utilities to pass on to customers some of the costs incurred from liabilities related to wildfires.","15":"People sign up at the booth for the National Rifle Association (NRA) at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 23, 2018.

The inspection was the latest headwind to hit the insurer, which earlier this year replaced both its chief executive and chief financial officer after false reports that Berkshire Hathaway Inc's BRKa.N had acquired a stake.  IRB shares have lost about 80% this year but the sources said it has maintained a cash position of around 4 billion reais, including liquid assets.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, began after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun laws.  The NRA responded by saying its members were being punished, but would not be intimidated, by what it called \u201ca shameful display of political and civic cowardice\u201d from some corporations.  In tweets on Saturday, Delta DAL.N and United [UALCO.UL]said they were no longer offering NRA members discounted rates and they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website.  The issue of gun control, and the NRA\u2019s role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate after a former student killed 17 people on Feb. 14 at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.  NRA spokespeople have lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites are politicizing the deadly rampage in Florida to erode gun owners\u2019 rights.  In a statement on Saturday, the NRA said its more than five million law-abiding members had nothing to do with the failures of school security, the mental health system, or both local and federal law enforcement that it said had caused the tragedy.  \u201cDespite that, some corporations have decided to punish NRA membership in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve.\u201d  The attrition of NRA corporate partners began on Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA\u2019s contract to issue a co-branded Visa card.  By Friday, the list of defectors grew to include Symantec Corp SYMC.O, which ended a discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs.  Chubb Ltd CB.N said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc MET.N, also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its affiliate relationship with the NRA.  The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights.","18":"FILE PHOTO: Smoke from the Camp Fire blankets Highway 99 in Chico, California, U.S., November 18, 2018. REUTERS\/Terray Sylvester  (Reuters) - Losses from the ongoing California wildfires will likely hurt fourth-quarter earnings of insurers, but are expected to remain within anticipated levels, ratings agency Fitch said on Tuesday.  Camp Fire is the deadliest wildfire in California\u2019s history, incinerating some 12,000 homes along the way, while the Woolsey Fire in the foothills above Malibu has threatened thousands of homes.  Catastrophe risk modeler Risk Management Solutions has estimated insured losses from the Camp and Woolsey fires to range from $9 billion to $13 billion.  Personal lines insurance, which includes property and casualty insurance, is expected to take the biggest hit, Fitch said, adding the losses could also extend to automobile insurance.  Commercial property and business interruption claims could also be significant, the ratings agency said.  Industry analysts, however, broadly expect the wildfire-related catastrophe losses to be manageable for insurers and reinsurers.  The insurance companies affected by the wildfires are generally the larger national carriers that have large capital bases, Fitch noted.  As a result, the ratings agency does not expect a major deterioration in financial strength if these companies incur losses roughly in proportion to their market share.  Shares of large-cap property and casualty insurers such as American International Group AIG.N, Traveler TRV.N and Chubb Ltd CB.N were down nearly a percent each on Tuesday, in line with broader U.S. market weakness.","19":"LONDON (Reuters) - Insurance premiums to protect shops and offices in Chile from damage caused by protests have at least doubled, industry sources say, as insurers scramble to cover losses following last year\u2019s riots.  FILE PHOTO: A demonstrator kicks back a tear gas canister as he clashes with riot police during anti-government protests in Santiago, Chile January 24, 2020. REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido\/File Photo  At least 27 people were killed during protests that began in October over a rise in transport fares and spiraled out of control.  The government estimated weeks of strikes, marches and damage to property and public transport cost the economy $3 billion, while the local subsidiary of Walmart WMT.N said 128 of its approximately 400 stores had been looted.  International insurers that focus on cover against attacks on property were surprised by the length of the protests in a country previously regarded as low risk.  Tim Davies, head of crisis management at Lloyd\u2019s of London insurer Canopius, said the firm had a strong presence in political violence insurance in Chile.  \u201cUntil eight or nine months ago, we would have bitten your hand off to write more.\u201d  Insurers are now less enthusiastic, and sources, who asked not to be named, said some had withdrawn from the market.  Spanish insurer Mapfre MAP.MC said last month the riots, together with typhoons in Japan, would knock between 130 million and 140 million euros ($144-$155 million) from its results.  KBW analysts said the protests in Chile were likely to impact international insurers\u2019 fourth-quarter earnings.  The losses and reduction in providers have driven up rates.  Chris Kirby, head of political violence and terrorism at London insurer Optio, said even for businesses that had not made a claim and were not in the middle of a big city, \u201crates will typically double\u201d.  A London broker said rates had trebled, while Allianz ALVG.DE and Munich Re MUVGn.DE also said rates had risen significantly.  Insurers remain cautious ahead of a referendum on a new constitution in April, which they said could trigger more protests.  Physical damage because of political protests is typically covered by terrorism or political violence insurance policies that companies buy in addition to property policies. These are often insured or reinsured by Lloyd\u2019s of London and other London-based insurers.  Competition has lowered property rates globally in recent years and encouraged property insurers to offer protection against \u201cstrikes, riots and civil commotion\u201d for no extra cost, particularly in countries regarded as stable.  That trend is reversing, with property insurers starting to exclude these events from their policies in Chile, as well in other countries where there have been protests, such as Colombia, insurers say.

FILE PHOTO: A sign referring to the hacked computer system of Baltimore City is taped to a door near Baltimore City Hall in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S. May 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Stephanie Keith\/File Photo  The changes follow a challenging year of hackers using malicious programs, known as ransomware, to take down systems that control everything from hospital billing to manufacturing. They stop only after receiving increasingly hefty payments.  The attacks happened less frequently in 2019, but the problem remains significant, cybersecurity experts said.  \u201cRansomware is more sophisticated and dangerous than we saw in the past,\u201d said Adam Kujawa, director of Malwarebytes Labs.  There were 6% fewer ransomware incidents in 2019 versus the prior year, according to Malwarebytes. However, attacks are now designed to spur deeper and more lasting technological problems, with hackers demanding bigger sums.  The average ransom of $41,198 during the 2019 third quarter more than tripled from the first quarter, according to Coveware, which helps negotiate and facilitate the payments.  Ransoms are becoming disproportionate to the size of targets, said Kelly Castriotta, Allianz SE ALVG.DE North American head of product development for financial lines. Hackers frequently pursue mid-size companies and other organizations that are less technologically adept, but also have less revenue to cover big ransoms.  \u201cYou\u2019d expect a ransomware demand that you can pay,\u201d Castriotta said.  The U.S. rate increases underscore broader global ransomware problems from which no company is immune.  Ransomware recently crippled foreign-exchange firm Travelex Ltd\u2019s [TRVLXP.UL] systems for weeks, leaving staff to serve customers with pens and paper. Hackers demanded $6 million, the BBC reported. Travelex declined to comment.  Another attack in December paralyzed the Albany County Airport Authority's administrative computers. It had to pay $98,705.96 in Bitcoin to get the system unlocked, a spokesman told Reuters. Its insurer, Chubb Ltd CB.BN, covered the ransom, he said. Chubb declined to comment.  Cyber-insurance premiums started rising 5% to 25% late last year, said Robert Parisi, U.S. cyber product leader at Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc MMC.N.  He called the increases \u201cdramatic\u201d but said insurers have not scaled back coverage.  Cyber policies often cover not just ransom, but data recovery, legal liabilities and negotiators fluent in hackers\u2019 native languages. Some insurers are considering changes, given the rising costs.  Allianz is looking into price adjustments and whether ransomware should be a separate product from general cyber coverage, Castriotta said.  Zurich Insurance Group AG ZURN.S is more likely to underwrite firms that have added network features to prevent attacks from spreading through systems, said its chief risk officer, Peter Giger.  Sompo International 8630.T is reviewing criteria for businesses that have been most vulnerable to ransomware, said Brad Gow, global cyber product leader.  Insurers including Sompo may also lower amounts they pay for ransomware attacks against higher-risk companies or shift to coinsurance, in which policyholders would pay 20% to 30% of ransomware claims, Gow said. They might also require those policyholders to have data-backup procedures.  Gow compared potential changes to requiring airbags or sprinkler systems.  \u201cWe can drive a win-win by helping our clients become better protected,\u201d he said.  GRAPHIC - Global threat from ransomware:","21":"(Reuters) - Last March, a 103-year-old resident of a Sunrise Senior Living facility in Willowbrook, Illinois, went on a field trip to the movies. Ruth Smith, who used a walker, fell down two concrete steps in the theater and died about six weeks later. Now Smith\u2019s estate is suing Sunrise, saying that aides did not properly watch her.  FILE PHOTO: A senior citizen, walks down the hallway with the aide of her walker to visit a neighbor at her independent living complex in Silver Spring, Maryland April 11, 2012. REUTERS\/Gary Cameron\/File Photo  As the U.S. society ages, senior living communities are on the rise. So are claims and lawsuits against them. And when they lose, it is usually down to insurers to pay up.  \"It's a tremendous opportunity that has pretty specific challenges,\" said Brendan Gallagher, who heads the senior care business at insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. AJG.N  Some senior living facilities could see insurance rate hikes in 2019 as high as 30 percent, according to insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. WLTW.O  Fewer insurers are offering coverage today than they were five years ago and some Lloyd\u2019s of London members stopped writing the coverage during the past year, said John Atkinson, managing partner at Willis.  Some insurers are dropping coverage of those communities entirely while others are avoiding litigious locations such as Kentucky, Illinois and Florida, said insurers and brokers.  While the pullback threatens to raise costs for families, other insurers are expanding, betting on the industry\u2019s strong growth prospects.  The number of people living in U.S. residential care facilities has grown by over 10 percent to 812,000 between 2010 and 2016, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  As the industry gears up for the arrival of the greying 74-million baby boom generation, senior living facilities have grown even faster. The number of rooms in those centers has risen up by a fifth since 2013, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care (NIC), which collects data for the 99 largest U.S. metro areas.  While aging is a global phenomenon and the U.S. society is relatively younger than those in Europe and north Asia, its greater dependence on senior centers confronts it with challenges other nations may yet have to grapple with.  More so than previous U.S. generations, today\u2019s elderly often live far away from their children. In Europe, seniors tend to live much closer to their relatives or in communities that provide generous government services for the elderly. In many Asian and African communities, multiple generations commonly live together.  Not only do more people move into retirement communities, but they tend to do it later than they used to, resulting in more frequent and severe injuries, insurance professionals say.  \"People are living longer and they are more frail,\" said Gloria Holland, vice president of finance at Capital Senior Living Corp CSU.N, a Dallas-based company that runs 129 communities across the country.  A spokeswoman for Sunrise Assisted Living, where Smith lived, said the company had policies and procedures in place to help promote resident safety. \u201cAnytime we lose a member of our community we are deeply saddened,\u201d she said.  Falls are the biggest risk. Allegations of falls account for nearly half of all assisted living claims that insurer CNA Financial Group CNA.N closed in 2016 and 2017, the company said. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2GzYrHM)  Another source of insurance claims are \u201cmemory care\u201d centers, which cater to people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other types of memory problems.  The nascent sector has grown 52 percent since 2013, according to NIC. A big issue there: residents who wander away.  Last year, the body of 77-year-old Audrey Penn was found in a ditch after she left a senior living community in Allentown, Pennsylvania. A lawsuit filed by her family settled for an undisclosed amount.  A CHANGING AMERICA  Capital Senior Living\u2019s Holland said the average age of residents who moved to its facilities was between 78 and 80 when she joined the company in 2004 and has risen to between 82 to 84 by now. That makes individual claims more expensive to settle. The company anticipates a 5 percent rate increase when it renews its insurance in 2019, Holland said.  Higher rates and deductibles are more likely to affect smaller facilities, which may lack robust compliance programs for preventing accidents and other problems, insurers and brokers say. Smaller centers often \"struggle to keep up with changing regulations,\" said Caroline Clouser, who heads the healthcare industry practice at insurer Chubb Ltd. CB.N  Insurance premiums for senior facilities vary by state. Premiums for each assisted living apartment range from $150 to $600 annually, insurers and brokers say.  Insurance for those facilities makes up less than 1 percent of the $558 billion property and casualty insurers collected in net written premiums in 2017. Yet it is likely to grow as aging boomers fill up senior communities, industry insiders say.  Nationwide is among the companies that have been growing their senior living insurance business while being selective, said Jeremy Moore, senior living underwriting manager.  \u201cYou have to understand what the exposures are and the controls in place,\u201d he said.  Nationwide has a team of former senior living executives and administrators who visit communities and look at everything from building maintenance to evacuation procedures, Moore said.  Wisconsin-based Church Mutual Insurance Company, which writes coverage for the industry in 49 states, is planning to expand into Florida, the remaining state, in 2019, according to Jim Ketterson, who heads the insurer\u2019s senior living practice.  Brokers are also working to help senior living communities better manage their risk. Willis recently launched a program to help facilities learn how to more safely lift residents.  Willis also runs a webinar on active shooter events, including tips such using beds to block doors that do not lock, a common feature in memory care facilities.  Senior living companies also keep reviewing their facilities and procedures, they say. For example, Capital Senior Living is gradually replacing carpet flooring with laminate, which is less of a trip hazard, Holland said. It is also considering a technology that can help track residents\u2019 movements to determine if they are at risk of a fall.","22":"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian insurer Suncorp Group Ltd said on Friday it was no longer underwriting insurance for new thermal coal mines or power plants and it will phase out all exposure by 2025 as part of its responsible investment policy.

This was echoed by David Briggs, managing director, life sciences practice at Gallagher, who said every trial was rated on its methods and the kinds of patients involved.  Gallagher said premiums in Britain, for example, started at about 5,000 pounds ($6,500) per trial.  Total claims limits in policies were typically set at roughly $6-12 million, depending on the country\u2019s rules, according to several insurance companies interviewed by Reuters.  In Britain, for instance, claim limits were usually set at no lower than 5 million pounds, while in Germany the figure was around 10 million euros ($11.8 million).  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u2018LOSS EXPERIENCE NOT DRAMATIC\u2019  However part of the reason why premiums have not risen as sharply as some people might have expected is that claims from trial are generally uncommon, according to executives. This is because patients have often signed so-called informed consent agreements, they said.  Jim Walters, managing director of Life Sciences & Chemical Group at broker Aon AON.N, said such agreements outlined the risks that patients were taking by participating in the trial.  \u201cSo, you know, everything from you could have a sore spot on your arm. To you could potentially die. And you know, they would literally go that far in some of these protocols,\u201d he added.  \u201cThose generally tend to hold up in courts and in legal systems around the world. That means that the loss experience coming out of clinical trials is not very dramatic.\u201d  Claims are often limited to circumstances linked to the improper conduct of trials or any wrongdoing, rather than side-effects of the treatment, executives said.  Such have been the worries about the vaccine race among some members of the public, who fear safety standards could slip, that nine developers issued a joint pledge last month to \u201cuphold the integrity of the scientific process\u201d.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  ASTRAZENECA TRIAL SUSPENSION  AstraZeneca AZN.L and Oxford University's suspension of global Phase III trials of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine early last month due to a participant's illness brought the risk of side effects in clinical trials to the public fore.  But the insurers said such delays were not unexpected, and could even reflect the extra caution of vaccine developers given the lack of data about COVID-19.  \"Side effects always happen with clinical trials, but these are typically mild and expected. It is not very common to delay or suspend trials, it does happen though,\" said Piazzi at AGCS, whose main peers in underwriting trials include Chubb CB.BN, HDI TLXGn.DE and Fairfax's FFH.TO Newline.  \u201cPharma companies and insurers alike are even more careful than usual with COVID-19 trials because there is so much at stake, particularly for the patients\u2019 safety.\u201d  All trials of the vaccine candidate have resumed, with the exception of the U.S. study.  There have been examples in recent memory of drug trials going catastrophically wrong, though.  In 2016, for instance, one participant died and five were hospitalised in a Phase I trial run by French company Biotrial in the city of Rennes, testing an experimental mood brightener made by Portuguese drugmaker Bial.  In 2006, six patients required intensive care after receiving a potential treatment against leukaemia and auto-immune disease in London. One was described as looking like \u201cthe elephant man\u201d after his head swelled. Another lost fingertips and toes. Germany\u2019s TeGenero, the initial developer of the medicine, folded.  But insurance executives stress such disasters are rare, given the thousands of clinical drug trials being carried out every year.  Walters of Aon, speaking about the 2016 trial, said it was \u201cobviously a horrible situation\u201d.  \u201cBut that\u2019s one of very few incidents of really bad loss experience that the industry has faced. So, clinical trial insurance is not hugely expensive. Let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d","24":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday ramped up pressure on banks and insurers to revisit whether their ties to the National Rifle Association and other gun rights groups harm their reputations and the public interest.  New York Gov.

REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz  Cuomo, a Democrat, noted that some well-known companies, including the insurer MetLife Inc, have ended some business relationships with the NRA after a gunman killed 17 people at a Parkland, Florida, high school on Valentine\u2019s Day.  The governor directed New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services to urge state-chartered banks and the more than 1,400 insurers it regulates to review whether their ties to the NRA and similar groups sends the \u201cwrong message\u201d to clients and communities.  \u201cThis is not just a matter of reputation, it is a matter of public safety,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement.  The financial services superintendent, Maria Vullo, told banks and insurers in separate letters that \u201cprompt actions\u201d may be needed to manage reputational risks and promote public safety, at a time society \u201cis no longer willing to stand by and wait and witness more tragedies caused by gun violence.\u201d  William Brewer, a lawyer for the NRA, in a statement accused Cuomo and Vullo of abusing the public\u2019s trust by \u201cmounting a blacklisting campaign that seeks to deprive Second Amendment advocates of banking services and insurance coverage in the State of New York.\u201d  In February, MetLife ended a program for NRA members to obtain insurance discounts for boats, motorcycles and recreational vehicles, while Chubb Ltd decided to stop underwriting an NRA-branded insurance program for gun owners.  Some companies in other sectors have also shed NRA ties.  Cuomo is running for a third term as governor.  In a recent Siena College poll, he held a 58 percent to 27 percent lead among registered Democrats over the activist and actress Cynthia Nixon, who is trying to appeal to more liberal voters. The poll surveyed 692 registered voters, and had a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points.","25":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of 32 environmental and indigenous groups on Thursday urged insurers to stop underwriting the Trans Mountain pipeline to pressure Canada to cancel its plan to expand the project, which carries crude from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to British Columbia\u2019s Pacific coast.

The groups said they would ramp up pressure on Zurich, which told the campaigners in a letter last week it would continue insuring the Trans Mountain Pipeline while it discusses with the Canadian government how to meet its Paris climate agreement targets with the pipeline in place.  In June, Zurich had pledged to begin to divest from the oil sands industry, starting with dialogue about transition plans with their customers that have over 30% exposure to thermal coal, oil sands and oil shales.  \u201cBy renewing coverage of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, Zurich betrays its own commitments,\u201d Lucie Pinson, of the Unfriend Coal campaign, said in a statement on Thursday.  Pavel Osipyants, a spokesman for Zurich, said insuring the pipeline does not betray its pledge because Zurich \u201cwill either facilitate a transition to an alternative insurer (stop insuring them) or continue to provide insurance coverage\u201d for the pipeline company depending what it learns about its strategy and position on climate change risk after their dialogue.","26":"WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - A coalition of 32 environmental and indigenous groups on Thursday urged insurers to stop underwriting the Trans Mountain pipeline to pressure Canada to cancel its plan to expand the project which carries crude from Alberta\u2019s oil sands to British Columbia\u2019s Pacific coast.

(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Editing by Richard Chang)","27":"(Reuters) - Chubb Ltd CB.BN said on Wednesday it is lobbying the U.S. government to insure businesses for losses in future pandemics, while giving the insurance industry a small portion of the business, jumping into a debate over how to insure such disasters.  The U.S. insurance industry has been largely denying claims for losses caused by coronavirus-driven lockdowns from businesses-interruption policies, saying that pandemics are excluded.  The denials have led to lawsuits, political pressure and criticism from customers, prompting the industry to start lobbying the government for a plan to cover future pandemics.  As one of the largest U.S. providers of business interruption insurance, Chubb\u2019s views are likely to significantly influence ongoing debate over policy.  Unlike some in the industry that want the risk to be borne entirely by the government, Chubb wants the industry to play a role in any government-backed insurance plan, Chief Executive Evan Greenberg told Reuters.  \u201cWe believe the industry does have wherewithal to take risk here,\u201d Greenberg said. He said Chubb is talking to lawmakers, brokers and other insurers about its plan.  Under Chubb\u2019s plan, the government would offer up to $750 billion in coverage for small businesses with up to 500 employees. Of that, the industry would pay for 6% of claims, or up to $15 billion, during the program\u2019s first year, growing annually to 12% by year 20. COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, would be excluded.  Small businesses would receive a pre-determined payment based on payroll expenses, which the policy would cover for up to three months.  Chubb\u2019s small-business proposal would require all business insurers to participate. Businesses would pay premiums only for the insurers\u2019 share of coverage, not the government\u2019s, making premiums \u201cvery affordable,\u201d Greenberg said.  The proposal also includes a program for businesses with more than 500 employees, which would be voluntary for insurers and provide a total of up to $400 billion in coverage through a government reinsurance entity.  Insurers would share up to $15 billion during the program\u2019s first year, rising to $40 billion during its 10th. Payouts to businesses would be limited to $50 million per policy.","28":"ZURICH\/BERLIN, April 23 (Reuters) - The Swiss blue-chip SMI was seen opening 0.1% higher at 9,640 points on Thursday, according to premarket indications by bank Julius Baer .

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  A rise in securities class-action cases involving initial public offerings is spurring IPO insurers to double and triple prices for directors and officers coverage, or \u201cD&O\u201d coverage, insurers and brokers told Reuters.  A $5 million policy that cost $200,000 in 2016 can now easily cost $500,000 to $600,000, said Paul Schiavone, head of North American Financial Lines for Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty, an Allianz SE unit.  \u201cYou want to be part of the market, but there are also lots of risks in IPOs,\u201d said Schiavone. \u201cIf things don\u2019t go well in a year, you have the investors saying, \u2018I want my money back.\u2019\u201d  The tightening insurance market follows a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows some securities lawsuits to proceed in state court in addition to federal court.  \u201cSince then, the market has gotten absolutely more challenging,\u201d said Jennifer Sharkey, President of the Northeast Management Liability Practice for insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.  Investors who used to wait months to see how a new stock would perform now waste little time to see if promises made in offering documents come to fruition - and are swift to accuse the executives of misleading investors if they do not.  \u201cYou have a lot more aggressive lawyers and investors out there who are looking where the cash is,\u201d said Jeff Lubitz, who heads Securities Class Action Services for Institutional Shareholder Services. \u201cAnd now, it looks like they will have multiple choices on how to jump on this.\u201d  The changes come amid a spate of mega-IPOs, including recent offerings by ride-sharing rivals Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc. There were 205 IPOs in 2018, up 14% from 2017, according to accounting and consulting firm EY.  Many larger companies have ample funds to pay the premiums, but smaller companies that need the insurance in order to attract reputable board members may feel the strain, insurance brokers said.  There have been 25 lawsuits related to IPOs so far this year, against 19 companies. Six companies that launched IPOs face suits in both state and federal court, including Lyft, BrightView Holdings Inc, and US Xpress Enterprises.  Shareholders slapped Lyft with a lawsuit about three weeks after its stock began trading on March 28 and quickly tanked more than 20%. The suit alleges that Lyft misled investors by overstating its market share. A Lyft spokeswoman declined to comment.  As the pace quickens and litigation picks up in two court systems, insurers are on the line to pay tens of millions of dollars in defense costs and substantial settlements.  IPO-related settlements have totaled $929 million since 2017, including a $250 million settlement by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in April, after an earlier $75 million state court settlement. Last year, LendingClub Corp settled a suit for $125 million, according to ISS.  About 25 insurers sell D&O coverage to companies going public, including American International Group Inc, Chubb Ltd, AXA XL, Beazley PLC, and Allianz SE. The insurers, collectively, can offer about $150 million coverage, according to broker Aon Plc.  Insurers are chopping coverage limits and requiring IPO clients to pick up more costs before a policy kicks in. And they are requiring companies to pay a percentage of the eventual loss, said Rachel Turk, D&O team leader for Beazley.","31":"(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic will likely spur the largest single loss in insurance industry history, said Evan Greenberg, chief executive officer of Chubb Ltd, during a call with analysts on Wednesday.

Greenberg\u2019s remarks come as U.S. insurers are starting to take stock of the potential impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their businesses, largely in the second quarter.  U.S. commercial insurers are also facing mounting political pressure to cover claims from businesses that are losing revenue because of coronavirus-led shutdowns ordered by state and local governments. Insurers say pandemics and viruses are largely excluded from coverage.  \u201cIt would damage or destroy the insurance industry in a terrible way, Greenberg said. \u201cIt would simply take money from one to give to another.\u201d  Greenberg said he expects coronavirus-related claims for insurance covering travel, accidents and health, trade credit, and possibly political risk.

The order also includes other insurance lines facing the risk of loss as a result of the pandemic.

Units of the insurer have together issued 80 policies to Weinstein and his family between 1994 and 2018, including coverage for personal liability, according to Chubb. That would normally cover legal costs to defend against claims of damage or injury caused accidentally, but the insurer said Weinstein\u2019s conduct was intentional.  The co-founder of the Miramax studio and The Weinstein Company was one of Hollywood\u2019s most influential men before more than 70 women accused him of sexual misconduct, including assault. He denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.  He faces many legal cases, including one brought by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accusing him of civil and human rights violations.  Chubb Indemnity Insurance Co and several other Chubb units asked New York State Supreme Court to issue a judgment declaring that the policies\u2019 terms exclude defending charges in the lawsuits, specifically sexual assault, discrimination and intentional acts.

Thousands of shoots around the world shut down abruptly in March as the novel coronavirus spread and governments imposed lockdowns.  Now as filmmakers try to get back to work they are finding insurers have largely stopped providing the COVID-19 coverage they need to secure financing.  Some insurers are even adding exclusions for COVID-19 or communicable diseases to existing policies when cast members get medical exams, insurance lawyer Kirk Pasich told Reuters.  Without coverage, many producers cannot get the completion bond, or guarantee, that banks require to lend to productions.  Until crews can work safely again and insurance covers COVID-related costs, \u201cthere will be less content of the caliber that we\u2019re used to,\u201d independent film producer Robert Salerno told Reuters.  Insurers, already reeling from other pandemic claims, say they cannot offer the coverage because it is unclear how the pandemic will play out.  Although some countries have controlled or eliminated the virus, cases have resurged elsewhere, including the United States. (GRAPHIC: here)  \u201cIt is not a risk you can even price,\u201d a senior insurance executive, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told Reuters.  Only a handful of insurers offer film and TV policies worldwide. Chubb Ltd and Allianz SE, two major insurers no longer providing such coverage, declined to comment.  Media Guarantors Insurance Solutions, which provides bonding, has seen business fall 80% during the pandemic, said Chief Executive Fred Milstein. Producers are watching the new rise in U.S. COVID-19 cases closely as they consider rescheduling.  \u201cEverybody\u2019s taking a beat to see if the rates go down again,\u201d he said.  While big studios can self-insure, independent producers, who turn out 70% of new films and numerous TV shows in the U.S. each year, are looking for alternatives, said Jean Prewitt, chief executive of the Independent Film & Television Alliance.  Budgets are up 10% to 30% as producers add safety measures on set and rewrite scripts to reduce infection risk, Prewitt said.  Nicolas Chartier, producer of the Academy Award-winning film The Hurt Locker, is feeling the effects. His Voltage Pictures production company planned to film sequels to the romantic drama \u201cAfter\u201d in September. Both are on hold because insurance is unavailable, he told Reuters.  \u201cYou cannot get a completion bond because right now insurance doesn\u2019t cover COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is worried about the movie being abandoned.\u201d  Projects costing $1 million or less can be financed with cash, but still face health risks, especially for plots with romance or fight scenes.  \u201cSo you need to shoot two people in a room, two people talking outside on a bench,\u201d Chartier said. \u201cNot exactly the most exciting movie.\u201d  Independent producers are also looking for private investors to provide insurance, or moving to countries that have government backing for pandemic risk, said Brian O\u2019Shea, chief executive of The Exchange, a movie sales, financing and production company.

REUTERS\/Carlos Osorio\/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) -Lloyd\u2019s of London and insurtech firm Parsyl have launched a development finance-backed programme to insure the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in emerging markets as a global vaccination programme to halt the deadly virus gathers pace.  COVID-19 vaccine distribution is a headache for insurers, who are concerned about the extra-cold temperatures required to transport vaccines such as the one developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, the first Western vaccine off the drawing board. Theft or cyber attacks on the supply chain are an added worry.  Governors in more than two dozen U.S. States and territories are planning on using the National Guard in some capacity for COVID-19 vaccine distribution at this point, the Guard said on Monday.  The Global Health Risk Facility (GHRF), made up of 14 insurers and reinsurers, has been set up to address the challenges of transporting temperature-sensitive vaccines, and will be supported by $26.7 million in funding from the U.S International Development Finance Corporation, the companies said on Tuesday.  The DFC loan will be used to capitalize a new public-private Lloyd\u2019s syndicate and allow the GHRF to offer cost-effective insurance policies for shipments of vaccines and medical products to developing countries.  The facility will begin underwriting in January.

Axis has withdrawn its quotes for insurance of the mine\u2019s railway, the source told Reuters.  The insurer will publish a formal policy to cut its exposure to coal more broadly in the weeks ahead, the source added.  Axis joins a growing list of global insurers to refuse to insure the project, which received the green light from Canberra in June despite fierce opposition from environmental groups.  The Queensland-based Carmichael mine is expected to chalk up annual production of 8 million to 10 million tonnes of thermal coal, responsible for a large slice of the world\u2019s carbon emissions.  As a result, 14 large insurers including AXA SA, Allianz, Liberty Mutual Insurance Co [LBRTLI.UL], Munich Re, Swiss Re and local market leader QBE Insurance Group Ltd have already confirmed they will not insure Carmichael, according to lobby group Market Forces.  Sixteen insurers including Chubb Ltd, Australia\u2019s QBE and Suncorp Group Ltd and European insurers Allianz and Zurich Insurance Group AG have already adopted policies to cut their exposure to coal projects, according to lobby group Unfriend Coal.","47":"March 26 (Reuters) - Insurer Chubb Ltd on Thursday said the company is investigating a computer security incident that may involve unauthorized access to data held by an outside service provider.

The Trans Mountain pipeline, which ships types of crude oil and refined products to British Columbia from Canada\u2019s main oil-producing province of Alberta, is owned by the Canadian government and has become a focus for environmental and indigenous groups who want a planned expansion of the pipeline stopped.  The government bought the pipeline from Kinder Morgan Canada in August 2018 for C$4.5 billion ($3.37 billion). Activists say expanding it will hamper Canada\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate agreement.  Insurers like other financial services companies are under pressure from environmental campaigners to cut back on providing insurance cover to companies or projects that are connected to fossil fuel industries.  As with the coal industry, the degree of insurance underwriting offered to the tar sands industry by insurance companies is in the spotlight for its higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions than crude oil.  While Lloyd\u2019s of London syndicates remain the biggest insurer to the project, Chubb and Zurich are the biggest listed insurers providing coverage.  The Trans Mountain pipeline\u2019s annual liability insurance contract, dated August 2019 but filed with the Canadian energy regulator on April 30, 2020, shows Zurich was the lead insurer for the pipeline.  The insurance, which provides $508 million of cover, runs to August 2020, the filing showed.  Zurich is the sole insurer for the first $8 million of potential insurance payouts and the company provided a total of $300 million in cover with other insurers, the 2019\/20 energy regulatory filing showed.  The filing did not provide a breakdown of Zurich\u2019s contribution.  In 2018\/19, the cover with other insurers was $150 million, the regulatory filing for that year showed.  A Zurich spokesman said it had slightly increased its cover, but had restructured its participation in the programme by moving its capacity to provide cover for higher payout levels, which are less likely to be triggered.  Big insurance contracts are typically covered across multiple providers in layers, with payouts triggered depending on the size of the claim.  Zurich is talking to customers and investee companies with more than 30% exposure to thermal coal, oil sands and oil shales, with the aim to \u201cdrive a deeper conversation regarding their credible mid to long-term transition plans\u201d, the Zurich spokesman said.  \u201cShould their plans fall short of our commitment to combating global climate change, Zurich intends to disengage and\/or divest from the companies,\u201d the spokesman said in an email, adding the engagement would not exceed a two-year period.  Chubb also increased the cover it provides alongside other insurers to a total of $200 million in 2019\/2020, from $15 million of sole exposure the previous year, the two regulatory filings showed.  Chubb did not provide a comment.  Chubb has a policy on coal underwriting which prevents the company from taking on new coal clients, its website said.  Lloyd\u2019s of London is the sole insurer for $50 million of potential insurance payouts in 2019\/2020, higher than $25 million the previous year, the regulatory filings showed. Lloyd\u2019s has reduced the cover it provides with other insurers to $410 million for 2019\/2020 from $450 million in 2018\/19, the regulatory filings also showed.  A Lloyd\u2019s spokesman declined to comment, saying underwriting decisions were made by the market\u2019s syndicate members.  The Lloyd\u2019s insurance market has said it does not have a policy on underwriting carbon-intensive fuels, leaving underwriting decisions to its members.  LOBBY GROUP PRESSURE  The Trans Mountain project highlights tensions in the financial services sector as it seeks to respond to policymaker calls to aid the globally agreed transition to a low-carbon economy while needing to protect their businesses from the potential hit to profits caused by COVID-19.  Lobby groups such as Unfriend Coal have put pressure on insurers to stop underwriting carbon-intensive fuels like coal and oil sands.  \u201cAny company that claims to care about the climate and human rights cannot insure Trans Mountain while it presses ahead with plans to enable a huge expansion of some of the world\u2019s dirtiest oil,\u201d said Elana Sulakshana, Energy Finance Campaigner at Rainforest Action Network.  Other insurers which have provided cover for the Trans Mountain project this year include AIG, Liberty Mutual and Munich Re unit Temple.  Liberty Mutual declined to comment on the project but said it had a policy on coal underwriting.  \u201cWe\u2019re taking many steps that demonstrate our commitment to the shift toward clean energy, and we will continue to improve and build on the progress we\u2019ve made,\u201d a Liberty Mutual spokeswoman said.  AIG said it did not comment on underwriting decisions related to specific projects.  Munich Re declined to comment. (Additional reporting by Jeff Lewis in Toronto.

Now he fears for the future as he battles for the compensation.  Daniel Duckett, one of thousands of store owners whose livelihood has been hurt by a government mandated shutdown to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, poses at his Lazy Claire Patisserie in Belfast, Northern Ireland April 13, 2020. Daniel Duckett\/Handout via REUTERS  Duckett is one of thousands who have called their insurers to claim on business disruption policies as the spread of the new coronavirus forces large parts of the global economy to shut down, with the answer for most a straight \u201cno\u201d.  As the industry increasingly comes under fire, critics ranging from U.S. President Donald Trump to groups of celebrity chefs have joined the call for payouts to be made.  But insurers, already facing huge payouts on travel and trade credit insurance and the cancellation of sporting events such as the Wimbledon tennis championship, say clauses allowing claims due to government closures or communicable diseases often do not apply to the widespread lockdowns in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus.  Meanwhile, market volatility has also slashed normally comfortable investment income and if insurers were forced to make payouts on policies that do not cover the pandemic, \u201cit would damage or destroy the insurance industry in a terrible way,\u201d Evan Greenberg, CEO of Chubb, one of the world\u2019s largest insurers, said this week.  Greenberg said the pandemic would in any case likely spur the largest single loss in insurance history.  UBS estimates industry insured losses for non-U.S. business interruption total $7-22 billion.  In the U.S., monthly small business losses are seen at between $255 billion and $431 billion, according to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, dwarfing the roughly $6 billion a month in premiums the local industry receives for key property insurance lines. It is unclear how much of their losses are insured for the pandemic.  A payout can\u2019t come soon enough for Larry Brehm, owner of a Play It Again Sports store in Torrance, California, who has been told by insurer Nova Casualty Company, a unit of The Hanover Insurance Group that he is not eligible to make a claim as his policy does not cover the virus.  \u201cIf I don\u2019t get some kind of help, either from the government or from the...loss of business insurance, then I might have to close. It\u2019s the only way that I feed my family and it\u2019s very sad to think about.\u201d  Hanover said it could not comment on the particular case, but was \u201ccommitted to delivering on our promises to our customers\u201d.  Lazy Claire\u2019s Duckett is in one of at least three groups of small businesses in Britain squaring up to Lloyd\u2019s of London insurer Hiscox.  Lawyers at Fieldfisher and DMH Stallard also said they had clients seeking payouts from Hiscox and other UK-based insurers.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Hiscox said this week it would work with the industry, regulators and customers to \u201cseek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available\u201d.  RESTAURANTS IN CRISIS  Trump weighed in on the issue during an April 10 briefing, saying he had spoken to restaurateurs who had been paying for business interruption cover for 35 years.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been paying a lot of money for a lot of years...And then when they finally need it, the insurance company says, \u2018we\u2019re not going to give it\u2019,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d  A group of famed U.S. restaurateurs, including Wolfgang Puck and Thomas Keller, owner of the upmarket French Laundry in California\u2019s Napa Valley, last month banded together with Louisiana lawyer John W. Houghtaling to form the \u201cBusiness Interruption Group,\u201d or BIG, a non-profit organisation launched to push for payouts.  \u201cIf insurers do not start paying...we will bring BIG legal action in every state,\u201d the group said.  In Britain, celebrity chef Raymond Blanc, who runs 36 restaurants through his Brasserie Barco group, has hired law firm Legal Risk.  \u201cWe think our policy is bullet-proof,\u201d Brasserie Barco Chairman Mark Derry said.  ALL IN THE WORDING  Analysts say it is hard to strip out business interruption from other commercial property policies, though McKinsey estimates the specific cover earns $40 billion in annual premiums globally.  One issue is whether a virus can be described as causing physical damage, often a pre-requisite to trigger payments.  Epidemics are generally excluded although businesses can buy additional cover. But that extra policy might specify the diseases it covers - meaning the new coronavirus that only appeared in recent months would not be included.  Some businesses buy extra coverage for a government-mandated shutdown, but again, this may not apply to a pandemic.  Whether businesses will be covered depends on the wording of individual policies, said Ling Ong, vice president of the London Forum of Insurance Lawyers.  Travelers Companies Inc has pushed back against a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by celebrity criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos, who said his business had been hurt by shut-down orders.  \u201cInsurers don\u2019t collect premiums to cover losses that policies weren\u2019t written to cover,\u201d said Travelers chief executive officer Alan Schnitzer on Tuesday in an earnings call. Travelers\u2019 standard coverage excludes viruses.  Chubb and Lloyd\u2019s of London are among other insurers facing U.S. class action suits. The insurers declined to comment.  However, some businesses have found they are covered - the British Columbia Dental Association\u2019s members can claim under Aviva\u2019s pandemic policy, it said this week.  GOVERNMENT PRESSURE  Insurers\u2019 protests may be futile. Eight U.S. states have introduced legislation which would require insurers to pay claims, mainly to small businesses, despite exclusions. Many of the bills would let insurers seek reimbursement from the states.  Pennsylvania State Senator Vincent Hughes, a Democrat, said he introduced the bill after many small businesses told him that insurers wouldn\u2019t pay their claims and government aid programs had ran out of money.  Insurers say such laws make retroactive changes to contracts, with global trade body the Institute of International Finance saying earlier this month in a letter to regulators that this could lead to \u201cdecreased availability of insurance, the withdrawal of insurers from certain markets and overall increases in the price of available coverage\u201d.  In France, President Emmanuel Macron said last week that insurers \u201cmust be there\u201d to help stabilise the economy.  French insurers have said they would put 3.2 billion euros ($3.47 billion) on the table including a 1.5 billion investment programme and donations to the government\u2019s aid fund.","51":"April 8 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB SELECTED FOR LICENSE TO OPERATE WHOLLY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN MYANMAR  * CHUBB LTD - IS ONE OF 5 COS AWARDED RIGHT TO OPERATE WHOLLY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN MYANMAR Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","52":"Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB APPOINTS JONATHAN KENNETT AS HEAD OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR UK AND IRELAND AND CHUBB GLOBAL MARKETS  * CHUBB LTD - JONATHAN KENNETT APPOINTMENT IS WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","53":"(Adds Societe Generale, Flag Group, Swiss National Bank, Moelis, BNY Mellon Asset Management, Standard Chartered, Cougar Global Investments, Prudential Funds)  March 5 (Reuters) - The following financial services industry appointments were announced on Monday.

These hackers use malicious programs known as ransomware to take down systems controlling everything from supply chains to payments to manufacturing. The hackers have grown more sophisticated during the past year, cybersecurity experts say, shifting from individuals and mom-and-pop operations to larger companies that can afford bigger ransoms.  The effort, known in the cybersecurity industry as \u201cbig game hunting,\u201d has been paying off for hackers. It has also been hurting insurers that provide cyber coverage for victims, which are often mid-sized companies desperate to get their systems restored and running quickly.  \u201cThey\u2019re large enough to be worth extorting but not large enough to have sufficient network protections to defeat the ransomware,\u201d said Brad Gow, global cyber product leader for insurer Sompo International 8630.T.  Sompo has been fielding a spate of claims related to a ransomware strain known as \u201cRyuk,\u201d Gow said. He described the victims as companies with annual revenue between $500 million and $1 billion.  The number of attacks and size of ransom demands have been soaring.  Businesses detected 365% more ransomware attacks in the second quarter than they did a year earlier, according to Malwarebytes, which sells cybersecurity software. The average ransom nearly tripled, to $36,295, from $12,762 between the first and second quarters of this year, according to Coveware, a firm that helps negotiate and facilitate cyber-ransom payments.  Criminals who dispatched the Ryuk strain have demanded as much as $5 million in bitcoin, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in May.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an unprecedented amount of ransomware attacks in 2019,\u201d said Eireann Leverett, a senior risk researcher at the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. The size of losses for those attacks poses a serious risk to the business, Leverett said.  FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in Warsaw in this February 28, 2013 illustration file picture. Kacper Pempel\/File Photo  Companies that have cyber insurance are often covered for a variety of expenses. They include: data recovery, legal liabilities for exposing sensitive customer information, negotiators fluent in hackers\u2019 native languages and the ultimate ransom payments.  Cyber experts say the criminals launching ransomware against companies are organized gangs in Russia and eastern Europe, or hackers sponsored by foreign governments. Insurers sometimes have restrictions in their policies to avoid covering attacks by nations, but it can be difficult to know for sure what type of criminal is launching an attack.  Insurers interviewed by Reuters said ransomware attacks are accelerating but declined to say how much they have paid in total claims.  Lloyd\u2019s of London insurer Beazley BEZG.L expects to handle double-to-triple the number of ransomware incidents in 2019 as it did last year, including at least another 800 claims by year-end, according to Katherine Keefe, Beazley's global head of breach response services.  Ransomware incidents during the third quarter increased 37% over the prior year quarter, Beazley said.  Similarly, Chubb Ltd CB.BN had already responded to the same number of ransomware events by June of this year as it did for all of 2018, said Michael Tanenbaum, its head of cyber for North America.  The average Ryuk ransomware attack claim from large companies is roughly $2 million, said Wade Chmielinski, a cyber consultant for commercial property insurer FM Global. Claims from smaller companies are typically between $150,000 and $250,000. FM Global does not pay for ransoms, he said.  One prominent attack in March against Norwegian aluminum maker Norsk Hydro NHY.OL turned out to be a lot more expensive.  Norsk Hydro is among the few public examples available of ransomware striking a business, because publicizing such events can invite more attacks, experts said.  After its systems were paralyzed by the LockerGoga strain of ransomware, Hydro experienced $60.1 million to $71.1 million (550 million to 650 million Norwegian crowns) in related losses during the first half of 2019, the company said in a filing on Wednesday.  In March, Norsk Hydro identified American International Group Inc AIG.N as its lead cyber insurer. An AIG spokesman declined comment.  Norsk received a $3.6 million (33 million Norwegian crowns) insurance payout during the quarter and will report additional payouts when \u201cdeemed virtually certain,\u201d the company said on Wednesday.  Global insurers collected $7 billion to $8 billion in cyber-insurance premiums during 2018, up about 13% from 2017, according to ratings agency AM Best.  But insurers are grappling with pricing as ransomware attacks become more common. Many of those attacks occur in the dark, making their frequency hard to know or how severe losses are. Although a simple ransom payment is often the cheapest, easiest solution, it also emboldens hackers, said Robert Hudock, a lawyer in Washington who advises clients on dealing with cyber attacks.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hard problem to solve,\u201d he said, \u201cif people keep paying the ransoms and the systems keep getting compromised.\u201d  GRAPHIC: Common industries targeted by ransomware -","56":"May 16 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB SHAREHOLDERS APPROVE 26TH CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASE; BOARD DECLARES RECORD DATE FOR FIRST DIVIDEND INSTALLMENT; ALL OTHER SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS APPROVED  * CHUBB LTD - SHAREHOLDERS HAVE APPROVED ALL MATTERS SUBMITTED TO CHUBB LIMITED 2019 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING  * CHUBB LTD - SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A 3% INCREASE IN COMPANY\u2019S DIVIDEND TO $3.00 PER SHARE ANNUALLY ($0.75 PER SHARE, PER QUARTER Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","57":"(Reuters) - Wall Street is trying to figure out whether the U.S. insurance industry will bear any costs from a record $4.69 billion judgment against Johnson & Johnson awarded to customers and their families who claimed that asbestos-contaminated talc caused ovarian cancer.  FILE PHOTO: Bottles of Johnson & Johnson baby powder line a drugstore shelf in New York October 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson\/File Photo  Analysts have flagged talc litigation as a financial risk for insurers, including Travelers Companies Inc, Chubb Ltd and The Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.  On company earnings calls in recent days, they peppered executives with questions about where exposure might lie. Many of the policies were written decades ago, and some liability may have been offloaded to reinsurers, making it hard to tell who might be on the hook for payments.  \u201cI wanted to get a sense as to whether this is going to turn into a bigger deal and catch us by surprise,\u201d said Buckingham Research Group analyst Amit Kumar, who asked about the issue during W.R. Berkley Corp\u2019s call last week. \u201cThe J&J news prompted us to revisit this topic.\u201d  J&J has repeatedly denied that its talc products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos or cause cancer.  Insurance executives have not given definitive answers, citing uncertainty about how litigation will play out or what role reinsurance might play. Policies that may cover asbestos liability were underwritten at least as far back as the 1970s.  \u201cIn J&J\u2019s case, we would not be surprised if the plaintiffs\u2019 bar found a way to trigger coverage under its old liability policies, which we think could lead to additional exposure for insurers,\u201d Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote in a research note on Tuesday.  Travelers, Chubb and The Hartford may have exposure, Gelb said.  Representatives for Chubb, Travelers, the Hartford and W.R. Berkely declined to provide additional comments beyond their executives\u2019 remarks during the calls.  Asked whether the J&J judgment is launching a new era of risk for insurers, Chubb Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said he is not concerned. He noted that asbestos litigation against different industries crops up every few years.  \u201cIt could have been Congoleum manufacturers who made floor tiles,\u201d Greenberg said last week. \u201cThis gets a headline because it\u2019s baby powder.\u201d  The $4.69 billion verdict by a Missouri on July 12 is the largest judgment against J&J to date over decades-long allegations that its talc-based products cause cancer. [L1N1U81WS]  The New Jersey-based healthcare conglomerate has said it believes the verdict will not stand on appeal.  \u201cWe are confident that there are multiple grounds for reversal of this jury verdict and that, ultimately, the case will be reversed,\u201d J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this month.  The company has had previous success overturning large verdicts in cases alleging harm from its products.  J&J, which faces 9,000 cases nationwide over talc, stopped buying product liability coverage in 2005 because it was expensive and not widely available, according to a regulatory filing. Instead, it has a self-insurance program through a subsidiary, Middlesex Assurance Company Ltd, according to a filing and court documents.  J&J spokesman Ernie Knewitz did not respond to requests for comment on its insurance coverage.  It is unclear how much of a role reinsurance will play for insurers or J&J.  The Hartford entered a reinsurance pact with Berkshire Hathaway Inc\u2019s National Indemnity Company in 2016 for asbestos and environmental claims. But the terms excluded coverage for \u201calleged connections between talc and ovarian cancer,\u201d Hartford Chief Financial Officer Beth Bombara said during a conference call on Friday.  The Hartford spokesman Matthew Sturdevant declined further comment. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s vice chairman for insurance operations, Ajit Jain, declined to comment.  Other insurance executives said they have been monitoring talc litigation for years and will continue to do so.  \u201cThe general theme is to let the process play out,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan said in an interview.

Grab already offers services ranging from payments to rewards and loyalty services.  Grab operates in eight countries in Southeast Asia and says its app has been downloaded on over 86 million mobile devices. It offers ride-hailing, on-demand food and delivery services through its 2.6 million drivers.

But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.  FILE PHOTO: Bruce Gendelman stands on the roof of his Aspen, Colorado home in next to a lightning repellant system recommended by an American International Group Inc (AIG) risk specialist in this 2019 photo obtained by Reuters August 15, 2019. Bruce Gendelman\/Handout via REUTERS  So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc AIG.N offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very high-end home and we\u2019re dealing with very good contractors,\u201d Gendelman said. \u201cBut (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.\u201d  Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of Verisk Analytics Inc VRSK.O, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.  Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.  \"People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,\" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd CB.BN. \"But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.\"  Chubb\u2019s risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department\u2019s resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.  The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.  AIG started marketing its service as \u201cSmart Build\u201d in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.  AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.  Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.  FINE ART PROTECTION  The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.  Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk.  \u201cA perfect example of \u2018bad piece of property, nice view,\u2019\u201d he said.  Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.  Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.  Risk specialists\u2019 suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.  Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.  Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault\u2019s chief risk services officer.  Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.  \u201cProviding this service free is smart for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThey help me with ideas and they get a loyal client.\u201d","64":"March 19 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB SAYS CEO EVAN GREENBERG\u2019S TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR 2017 WAS $19.1 MILLION VERSUS $24.4 MILLION IN 2016 - SEC FILING  * CHUBB CFO PHILIP BANCROFT'S 2017 TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $5.1 MILLION VERSUS $6.2 MILLION LAST YEAR Source text: [bit.ly\/2FWceU0] Further company coverage:","65":"SINGAPORE, March 13 (Reuters) - Southeast Asia\u2019s Grab has formed a venture with Japanese credit card company Credit Saison Co Ltd to provide loans and lending services in the region, marking the ride-hailing firm\u2019s biggest expansion into financial services.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks during a news conference in New York, U.S., September 14, 2018. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  On Aug. 14, the Child Victims Act takes effect, giving people one year to sue over allegations of sexual abuse, regardless of when they said it occurred.  Under the law signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo in February, New York has gone from one of the toughest states to bring a case because of its strict statute of limitations to one of the easiest, potentially unleashing decades of unresolved claims.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tidal wave of litigation,\u201d said lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, best known for representing victims of child abuse by Roman Catholic priests in the Archdiocese of Boston.  Cases will cut across society, illustrating the systemic nature of the abuse, victims\u2019 lawyers said, although they expect many of the lawsuits to be against Catholic organizations and the Boy Scouts of America.  Both the scouts and the church said they were cooperative with people making allegations of abuse against their organizations.  \u201cWe believe victims, we support them, we pay for counseling by a provider of their choice, and we encourage them to come forward,\u201d the Boy Scouts of America said in a statement.  New York State Catholic Conference spokesman Dennis Poust said that Catholic leaders dropped opposition to the new law once it was broadened to include public institutions.  \u201cAll survivors deserve to be heard,\u201d Poust said.  The Child Victims Act arrives as victims have been empowered by the #MeToo movement and a steady stream of scandals, exposing a range of abusers from public figures to the team doctor of USA Gymnastics.  Lawyers for victims said they were teaming up to maximize resources and reconnecting with old clients whose cases were barred by the statute of limitations.  Jeff Anderson, who specializes in clergy sex abuse cases, said his law firm has dedicated almost 100 people to New York cases.  \u2018COME FORWARD\u2019  After several states made it easier to sue, TV ads soliciting child sex abuse lawsuits spiked to more than 1,700 in both March and April, up from just 46 in January, according to X Ante, a consulting firm that tracks lawyer ad spending.  \u201cIf you were abused in a scouting program you are not alone,\u201d said an ad by San Diego, California-based AVA Law Group, which X Ante said was one of the most frequently broadcast. \u201cCome forward. New laws may allow you a path to significant financial compensation.\u201d  However, victims and advocates often say the money is secondary, and many sue to expose perpetrators, hold organizations accountable and to further the healing process.  Some organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America, are acknowledging abuse, apologizing and reporting the accused to law enforcement authorities.  Others have offered compensation. The Archdiocese of New York has paid $65 million to 325 people since 2017. Only one person rejected an offer, according to the archdiocese.  Those who accept an offer give up their right to sue. Some victim advocates said compensation programs kept stories of abuse secret.  \u201cI think the potential is huge for all kinds of things coming to the surface like we\u2019re seeing with Epstein,\u201d said victims\u2019 attorney James Marsh, referring to the criminal sex trafficking charges against the once politically connected American financier Jeffrey Epstein. He pleaded not guilty and is jailed pending trial.  Victims\u2019 lawyers said insurance policies will provide a significant amount of money.

The first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season, Subtropical Storm Alberto, is projected to make landfall on Monday. Alberto forced the evacuation of oil workers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Friday.  In 2017, the hurricane season, which typically runs from June to November, caused more than $250 billion worth of damage in the United States. Hurricane Harvey struck the Houston area in August and Hurricane Irma hit Florida in September.  Also in September, Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, where thousands of residents still lack electricity.  But car rental, hotel and home improvement companies benefited from an influx of customers seeking emergency resources in the wake of the storms. Freight companies commanded higher prices as capacity tightened due to increased demand for supplies in areas struck by the hurricanes.  Not all industries fared as well. Several oil companies saw their operations disrupted by Hurricane Harvey. Insurance companies faced mounting catastrophe losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters.  Here are how shares of companies in these industries performed during last year\u2019s hurricane season.  CAR RENTAL  Shares of Hertz Global Holdings Inc HTZ.N and Avis Budget Group Inc CAR.O surged during much of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season on investors' anticipation of increased demand. Hertz shares climbed 156.2 percent between June and early November, while Avis shares rose 80.1 percent during the same time period.  Both companies\u2019 shares fell sharply after Nov. 6, when Avis lowered its full-year earnings forecast in part due to damage from hurricanes. Still, Avis shares ended the year 93.2 percent above their June low, and Hertz shares climbed 133 percent in the same time period.  FREIGHT  Between June 1 and Dec. 1, shares of USA Truck Inc USAK.O soared 172.9 percent, while shares of XPO Logistics Inc XPO.N and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc ODFL.O climbed more than 40 percent. J B Hunt Transport Services JBHT.O shares rose 26.7 percent over the same period.  HOME IMPROVEMENT  Home Depot Inc HD.N shares rose 16.3 percent during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. In November, the home improvement retailer raised its 2017 profit and sales forecasts in response to increased demand for emergency and rebuilding supplies.  HOTELS  For several hotel operators, the increased demand from guests displaced by hurricanes outweighed the damage the storms wrought on their properties in affected areas.  From June 1 to Dec. 1, shares of Hyatt Hotels Corp H.N jumped 25.8 percent, while La Quinta Holdings Inc LQ.N climbed 24.5 percent. Shares of Marriott International Inc MAR.O, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N and Choice Hotels International Inc CHH.N rose between 15.9 percent and 18.9 percent.  OIL  During the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, shares of Kinder Morgan Inc KMI.N, which shut down several of its pipelines and gas facilities as Hurricane Harvey approached, fell 8.3 percent.  Shares of oilfield services companies also slumped. Shares of Baker Hughes BHGE.N, owned by General Electric Co GE.N, dropped 20.6 percent between June 1 and December 1. Halliburton Co HAL.N shares fell 5.3 percent, and Schlumberger NV SLB.N shares declined 7.2 percent.  INSURANCE  Florida home insurers' shares slumped on Sept. 7 as investors anticipated heavy losses from Hurricane Irma. Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc HRTG.N, HCI Group Inc HCI.N, Universal Insurance Holdings Inc UVE.N, United Insurance Holdings Corp UIHC.O and Federated National Holding Co FNHC.O all tumbled between 5.4 and 15.7 percent that day.","69":"April 2 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB LTD SAYS CEO EVAN GREENBERG'S FY 2018 TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $20.4 MILLION VERSUS $19.1 MILLION IN FY 2017 - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2I7IrvE) Further company coverage:","70":"June 17 (Reuters) - Companies going public in the United States face insurance costs that have increased as much as 200% in the last three years to cover their executives against lawsuits alleging they misled investors.  A rise in securities class-action cases involving initial public offerings is spurring IPO insurers to double and triple prices for directors and officers coverage, or \u201cD&O\u201d coverage, insurers and brokers told Reuters.  A $5 million policy that cost $200,000 in 2016 can now easily cost $500,000 to $600,000, said Paul Schiavone, head of North American Financial Lines for Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty, an Allianz SE unit.  \u201cYou want to be part of the market, but there are also lots of risks in IPOs,\u201d said Schiavone. \u201cIf things don\u2019t go well in a year, you have the investors saying, \u2018I want my money back.\u2019\u201d  The tightening insurance market follows a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows some securities lawsuits to proceed in state court in addition to federal court.  \u201cSince then, the market has gotten absolutely more challenging,\u201d said Jennifer Sharkey, President of the Northeast Management Liability Practice for insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.  Investors who used to wait months to see how a new stock would perform now waste little time to see if promises made in offering documents come to fruition - and are swift to accuse the executives of misleading investors if they do not.  \u201cYou have a lot more aggressive lawyers and investors out there who are looking where the cash is,\u201d said Jeff Lubitz, who heads Securities Class Action Services for Institutional Shareholder Services. \u201cAnd now, it looks like they will have multiple choices on how to jump on this.\u201d  The changes come amid a spate of mega-IPOs, including recent offerings by ride-sharing rivals Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc. There were 205 IPOs in 2018, up 14% from 2017, according to accounting and consulting firm EY.  Many larger companies have ample funds to pay the premiums, but smaller companies that need the insurance in order to attract reputable board members may feel the strain, insurance brokers said.  There have been 25 lawsuits related to IPOs so far this year, against 19 companies. Six companies that launched IPOs face suits in both state and federal court, including Lyft, BrightView Holdings Inc, and US Xpress Enterprises .  Shareholders slapped Lyft with a lawsuit about three weeks after its stock began trading on March 28 and quickly tanked more than 20%. The suit alleges that Lyft misled investors by overstating its market share. A Lyft spokeswoman declined to comment.  As the pace quickens and litigation picks up in two court systems, insurers are on the line to pay tens of millions of dollars in defense costs and substantial settlements.  IPO-related settlements have totaled $929 million since 2017, including a $250 million settlement by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in April, after an earlier $75 million state court settlement. Last year, LendingClub Corp settled a suit for $125 million, according to ISS.  About 25 insurers sell D&O coverage to companies going public, including American International Group Inc, Chubb Ltd, AXA XL, Beazley PLC, and Allianz SE. The insurers, collectively, can offer about $150 million coverage, according to broker Aon Plc.  Insurers are chopping coverage limits and requiring IPO clients to pick up more costs before a policy kicks in. And they are requiring companies to pay a percentage of the eventual loss, said Rachel Turk, D&O team leader for Beazley.

A protester is framed by signs calling for more gun control three days after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, at a rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, U.S., February 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Jonathan Drake  Many successful civil-rights movements have adopted some type of economic protest. Consider Gandhi\u2019s 24-day march from an ashram near Ahmedabad to the coastal town of Dandi to harvest sea salt in an act of nonviolent resistance against the salt monopoly imposed by India\u2019s British colonizers. Striking female garment workers \u2013 and the wealthy women who refused in solidarity to purchase the clothing of their overlords - furthered the suffragette movement.  Abolitionist Quakers refused to trade in products made with slave labor. A global divestment drive helped topple South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime in 1991 after companies including International Business Machines and General Motors pulled out from the region.  And so it is with America\u2019s idiosyncratic epidemic of gun violence. The nation\u2019s assault-weapons complex is facing a blowback following the horrific massacre of 17 students and their teachers at a Florida high school. As politicians fail to enact gun-safety laws, the acute target of consumers is the gun industry\u2019s powerful lobbying organization, the National Rifle Association, and the providers of products and services that do business with the group led by Wayne LaPierre.  Companies with national household brands severed ties with the NRA: rental-car outfits Hertz Global and Enterprise Holdings, parent of the Alamo and National brands; and Best Western and Wyndham Worldwide stopped offering discounts to NRA members. The software firm Symantec will no longer give NRA members a bargain on its LifeLock identity theft protection services.  Insurers also backed away from the NRA, including MetLife and Chubb. The First National Bank of Omaha, which had issued a co-branded NRA credit card, tweeted, \u201cCustomer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA.\u201d Though the furor has lasted just a few days, the speed with which it has taken flight is astounding. The #BoycottNRA hashtag led Twitter throughout Friday.  And there is more to come. As I wrote last week, financial backers of companies that produce the preferred weapons of mass murderers in schools, the AR-15 and its variants, may be next. As Americans are increasingly frustrated by the failure of Congress and state legislators to regulate weapons developed for military deployment, they may resort to using their pocketbooks and investment portfolios to force change.  Chief executives could be next, and any corporate boss not assessing his or her company\u2019s ties to guns, especially semi-automatic assault-style rifles, is putting shareholders at risk. BlackRock, the Vanguard Group and Fidelity are among the biggest investors in publicly traded AR-15 producers Vista Outdoor, American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger.  Though BlackRock owns the shares as part of its so-called index funds business, the $6 trillion fund manager led by Larry Fink, in a statement to Reuters, said that it \u201cwill be engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors to understand their response to recent events.\u201d  Some institutional investors have already taken matters into their own hands. The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a group of faith-based investor groups, on Friday said its members filed two shareholder resolutions at Sturm and American Outdoor asking them to report on activities related to gun safety measures and the mitigation of harm associated with guns.  Judy Byron, of the Sisters of the Holy Names, the lead filer of the resolution at American Outdoor, said it chose to hold shares in the two firms so that \u201cwe could engage them in dialogue on the critical role they can play in addressing the epidemic of gun violence in our country, and sadly in our schools. We are eager to hear what these companies are doing to ensure the safety of children and communities whose lives may be at risk as a result of their products.\u201d  For a nun, those are fighting words \u2013 they too have dug in their proverbial heels during times of protest, like at the civil rights marches in Selma, Alabama. The tens of millions of American consumers and investors seeking change that their elected officials and President Donald Trump seem incapable of delivering won\u2019t be so kind.","72":"May 7 (Reuters) - New York Department Of Financial Services:  * DFS FINES CHUBB SUBSIDIARY ILLINOIS UNION INSURANCE COMPANY $1.3 MILLION FOR UNDERWRITING NRA-BRANDED \u201cCARRY GUARD\u201d INSURANCE PROGRAM IN VIOLATION OF NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW  * INVESTIGATION FOUND NRA CARRY GUARD INSURANCE PROGRAM UNLAWFULLY PROVIDED LIABILITY INSURANCE TO GUN OWNERS WHO MAY BE CHARGED WITH CRIME INVOLVING LEGALLY-POSSESSED FIREARMS  * CHUBB UNIT WILL NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN \u201cCARRY GUARD\u201d OR ANY SIMILAR PROGRAM IN NEW YORK Source text (on.ny.gov\/2jE8M7b) Further company coverage:","73":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lloyd\u2019s of London Ltd is meeting with major U.S. insurers about driving more business through its global insurance market, Chief Executive Officer John Neal said on Wednesday.  Lloyd\u2019s of London chief executive officer, John Neal, poses for a portrait at the Roger New York hotel in New York City, U.S., June 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Suzanne Barlyn  The 330-year-old insurance market, which launched its most recent modernization effort in May, will meet with American International Group Inc on Thursday, and later with Chubb Ltd about potential opportunities for selling more of their insurance products through Lloyd\u2019s, Neal told Reuters.  Neal, who took charge of Lloyd\u2019s in late 2018, is trying to drag Lloyd\u2019s into the 21st century, following combined losses of $3.9 billion over the last two years. Lloyd\u2019s insures everything from hurricane damage to soccer stars\u2019 legs, but high levels of insured losses from natural catastrophes triggered the two years of poor results.  While Lloyd\u2019s outlined plans last month to set up electronic platforms as soon as next year, its intricate structure involving 99 underwriting syndicate members and hundreds of brokers makes change difficult.  Neal said his strategy includes shifting Lloyd\u2019s geographic focus, including concentrating on developed markets with strong growth potential such as the United States. The United States and Canada accounted for 51% of Lloyd\u2019s business last year.  Lloyd\u2019s kicked off its U.S. strategy during a dinner on Tuesday for top insurance and brokerage executives in New York\u2019s new World Trade Center building, a site that following the destruction of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was rebuilt partly with $8 billion in claims payments from the Lloyd\u2019s marketplace, its chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, said.  \u201cWe are talking to all of the big insurers here...to say, How do you feel about the marketplace and what opportunities can we help you realize in the Lloyd\u2019s marketplace?\u201d Neal said, adding that both AIG and Chubb are interested in the conversation.  Lloyd\u2019s has already been talking to AIG, including CEO Brian Duperreault and Peter Zaffino, CEO of AIG\u2019s General Insurance business, about the possibility of selling more products through the marketplace, Neal said.  AIG acquired Bermuda reinsurer Validus in 2018, partly because of its Talbot unit, a Lloyd\u2019s of London syndicate, Duperreault said at the time.  \u201cOur impression from any conversations with (Duperreault) and Zaffino is that they\u2019d love to grow their business at Lloyd\u2019s,\u201d Neal said.  Neal said his London-based colleagues were surprised when he proposed the United States as a priority because they believed emerging economies had more growth potential.  He sees growth potential in several U.S. areas, including specialty insurance, which covers unique risks such as damage to a company\u2019s reputation, or liability for a merger deal that goes sour. \u201cProfessional lines\u201d insurance, which includes liability coverage for corporate directors and officers, is another possible growth area, Neal said.  The global commercial, corporate, specialty insurance and reinsurance business is worth $750 billion, and half of those premiums are in the United States, Neal said.  \u201cSo literally, one dollar in two of everything that would interest Lloyd\u2019s underwriters is here,\u201d he said.","74":"FILE PHOTO: The Lloyd's of London building is lit by winter sun in the City of London financial district in London, Britain, February 1, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, kicks off the Film Finance Circle conference with an informal discussion at the inaugural Middle East International Film Festival in Abu Dhabi, October 15, 2007. REUTERS\/Steve Crisp\/File Photo  Lawyers for Weinstein, in a countersuit against Chubb, which is refusing to pay for Weinstein\u2019s defense against the cases, said that Weinstein has paid a group of Chubb insurers more than $1 million dollars in premiums for coverage designed to protect against \u201ca wide variety of liability claims,\u201d according to the document.  \u201cMoreover, they promised to perform their defense obligations even if allegations against Mr. Weinstein proved to be groundless, false or fraudulent,\u201d the Weinstein lawyers said in the document.  In February, Chubb Indemnity Insurance Co and several other Chubb units sued Weinstein and asked New York State Supreme Court to issue a judgment declaring that the policies\u2019 terms exclude defending charges in the lawsuits, specifically sexual assault, discrimination and intentional acts.  The co-founder of the Miramax studio and The Weinstein Company was one of Hollywood\u2019s most influential men before more than 70 women accused him of sexual misconduct, including assault. He denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.  On Tuesday, an affiliate of Lantern Capital is expected to received approval from a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Tuesday to buy the assets of The Weinstein Co for $310 million.  Units of Chubb have together issued 80 policies to Weinstein and his family between 1994 and 2018, including coverage for personal liability, Chubb said in its February suit.  That would normally cover legal costs to defend against claims of damage or injury caused accidentally, but the insurer said Weinstein\u2019s conduct was intentional.  The policies include millions of dollars in \u201cbroad liability coverage,\u201d $300,000 of \u201ccrisis assistance\u201d coverage, and unlimited coverage for Weinstein\u2019s legal defense, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers said in the countersuit, filed late on Monday.  \u201cAlmost overnight, Mr. Weinstein became a pariah,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis denials of liability because background noise, lost in the international uproar that followed.\u201d  A Chubb spokesman declined to comment.","76":"May 11 (Reuters) - The National Rifle Association on Friday sued New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the state\u2019s financial regulator for engaging in what it said was a \u201cblacklisting campaign\u201d aimed at swaying banks and insurers to stop doing business with the gun advocacy group, according to a complaint.  Cuomo and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) aimed to deprive the NRA of its right to \u201cspeak freely about gun-related issues and defend the Second Amendment,\u201d the group said in the suit, referring to part of the U.S. Constitution that protects the right of Americans to bear arms.  An spokeswoman for Cuomo could not be immediately reached for comment. An NYDFS spokeswoman declined to comment.  The NRA\u2019s lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, follows a $7 million fine on May 2 imposed by NYDFS against insurance broker Lockton Cos LLC, which administered an NRA-branded insurance program known as \u201cCarry Guard.\u201d  On May 7, NYDFS fined insurer Chubb Ltd and its Illinois Union Insurance Company unit $1.3 million for having \u201cunlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for acts of intentional wrongdoing,\u201d the regulator said.  The fines were part of settlements between the companies and the regulator, outcomes that are the \u201cculmination of years of political activism by Cuomo against the NRA and gun rights organizations,\u201d an NRA lawyer said in a statement.  National debate has heated up over the issue of gun control, and the NRA\u2019s role in opposing it, since Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.  Cuomo, NYDFS and its chief, Maria Vullo, whom the NRA also named as a defendant, engaged in a \u201ccampaign of selective prosecution, backroom exhortations, and public threats\u201d to coerce banks and insurance companies to withhold services from the NRA, the group said in the suit.  The suit also cites an April letter issued by NYDFS to heads of banks and insurance companies doing business in New York encouraging them to manage \u201creputational risk\u201d posed by dealings with \u201cgun promotion organizations.\u201d  Vullo, in a press release issued by Cuomo the same day, urged \u201call insurance companies and banks doing business in New York to join the companies that have already discontinued their arrangements with the NRA.\u201d  The NRA has suffered tens of millions of dollars in damages as a result, it said.

Hurricane Florence, on track to become the first Category 4 storm to make a direct hit on North Carolina in six decades, howled closer to shore on Wednesday, as schools and factories were being shuttered and authorities ordered more than 1 million people in the region to evacuate.  Losses from Florence could be on par with those from two previous storms: Hurricane Hazel, which ravaged North Carolina in 1954, causing $15 billion in losses, and Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which caused $20 billion, according to a report from risk modeling firm RMS on Tuesday.  \u201cAs we look back at previous events, although hurricanes making landfall in the Carolinas are rare, the losses through this triple-threat of storm surge, wind and inland flood, could also be significant,\u201d RMS said in the report.

The slow-moving storm could dump between 20 and 30 inches of rain in the Carolinas after making landfall, according to a report on Wednesday by risk modeler AIR Worldwide. More than 758,000 homes in the Carolinas and Virginia are at risk, according to risk assessment service CoreLogic.

Other top commercial property insurers in the region include The Travelers Companies, Chubb Ltd. and a U.S. subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group , Moody\u2019s said.  The S&P Composite 1500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index fell 0.5 percent on Wednesday, with shares of insurers including Travelers Companies Inc, Allstate Corp, American International Group Inc and Chubb Ltd trading down less than one percent.  \u201cStocks tend to fall in front of a storm because of uncertainty,\u201d said Sandler O\u2019Neill analyst Paul Newsome.

FILE PHOTO: People stand next to St Martin's Theatre at London's West End, amid the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in London, Britain, August 13, 2020. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls\/File Photo  While venues for indoor live performances are not yet open in all of Britain, theatres and concert halls in England have in theory been open to socially-distanced audiences since mid-August.  But only a handful have opened, citing insurance as one of the many barriers, as underwriters have been excluding COVID-19 from the cover they provide.  That means a theatre has no protection against cancellation or legal action from anyone in the audience or cast who falls ill or from a lockdown due to COVID-19.  Some small theatres are carrying on regardless and hoping for the best, but for tours, festivals and big names, it\u2019s a deal breaker and has hit live performance across the globe, including on Broadway.  \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a sponsor, full-house ticket sales, finance, TV licensing or big stars unless they are guaranteed,\u201d said James Davies, a director at insurance broker EC3.  A survey by the Society of London Theatres in May showed only 12% of organisations thought they would get the insurance they needed to reopen.  \u201cThe one thing no one can get insurance for at the moment is COVID,\u201d said Phil Bowdery, chair of the Concert Promoters\u2019 Association, one of several trade bodies pushing for government help.  \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of all the normal insurance - we are asking for the government to be a partner.\u201d  PLAN TO HELP FILM INDUSTRY  Organisers of live performances in Britain are seeking a scheme like the 500 million pound ($661 million) deal announced by the British government for the film and TV industry in July.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The scheme will insure productions for 70% of their losses if they have to abandon production due to the pandemic, up to a maximum of five million pounds.  \u201cWe are working to get the scheme (for the film and TV industry) open for applications as soon as possible and we have committed to cover eligible losses from the date the scheme was announced,\u201d the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in an emailed statement on Monday.  The entertainment industry is one of the hardest hit by months of lockdown and ongoing social distancing requirements.  In the first 12 weeks of lockdown, which started in late March, more than 15,000 theatrical performances were cancelled with a loss of more than 303 million pounds in box office revenue, according to a parliamentary committee report in July.  \u201cGovernment must address the urgent need for the UK\u2019s cultural industries to be covered by adequate insurance,\u201d the report said.  Other countries such as France and Australia have also introduced backstops for the film industry, but sources say there are no similar schemes for live events.  \u201cWe are ... hearing from our insurers that no tour insurance is available which will cover for COVID-19,\u201d said a source involved in orchestra tours.  Venues and shows will struggle to survive with social distancing in place because they need at least 70% capacity to break even, and a government-backed insurance scheme would help them get going, said Tim Thornhill, sales director, entertainment and sport, at insurance broker Tysers.  Both Tysers and EC3 are working on proposals, but the prospects of affordable COVID-19 insurance being offered by the industry may be remote. The British government film fund has no insurance partnership as insurers were reluctant to provide cover, sources said.  \u201cIt is difficult for underwriters to justify to capital providers why they should risk more throwing good money after bad,\u201d said one insurer.  Allianz ALVG.DE, Hiscox HSX.L and Chubb CB.BN are among other major providers of entertainment liability insurance.  Allianz was no longer providing this insurance for cancellation or illness due to COVID-19, a spokesman confirmed.  Hiscox declined to comment. Chubb did not respond.","88":"NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines and United Airlines on Saturday became the latest major corporations to sever marketing ties with the National Rifle Association as the fallout from last week\u2019s massacre at a Florida high school took its toll on the gun advocacy group.  The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, began after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun laws.  In tweets on Saturday, Delta and United said they were no longer offering NRA members discounted rates and that they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website.  NRA officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In recent days, NRA spokespeople have lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites are politicizing the deadly rampage in Florida to erode gun owners\u2019 rights.  The issue of gun control, and the NRA\u2019s role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate after a former student killed 17 people on Feb. 14 at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.  The attrition of NRA corporate partners began on Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA\u2019s contract to issue a co-branded Visa card.  By Friday, the list of defectors grew to include Symantec Corp, which ended a discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs.  Chubb Ltd said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc , also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA.  The U.S. Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights.","89":"May 4 (Reuters) - Insurers are normally great with numbers. But the coronavirus pandemic has them struggling to estimate how many billions of dollars in losses they face, and what the fallout will be for their massive investment portfolios.  Executives, lawyers and analysts say the cost is sure to be multiples of prior catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina, the T\u014dhoku tsunami or the 9\/11 terrorist attacks. That could be tens of billions to half a trillion dollars or more, depending on how long the pandemic lasts and other variables.  \u201cThis has the potential to be the largest insurance loss of all time,\u201d Alan Lyons, a partner and chair of the insurance practice at Herrick Feinstein in New York, said in an interview.  Unlike other disasters, the pandemic has been hitting businesses, individuals and markets throughout the world, all at once. Customers are filing claims across numerous policy types, from workers compensation to events cancellation to broader commercial liabilities.  Many claims for business interruption likely will not be paid this year since lawsuits will take a year or more to resolve, Lyons said, and cost insurers millions of dollars to defend.  Insured losses in the United States and U.K. alone could be anywhere from $11 billion to $140 billion, insurance broker Willis Towers Watson PLC said on Friday. Its estimates include varying durations of social distancing measures, several projections for how many people die, and what those assumptions mean for different insurance lines. Tracking U.S. coronavirus cases graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2WqHyUl  Some experts warn of even more costly outcomes. Losses could exceed $500 billion if state lawmakers require insurers to cover business-interruption claims for pandemic losses, former CNA Financial Corp Chief Executive Dennis Chookaszian told Reuters. Most policies exclude that risk, but insurers are facing lawsuits over it and eight U.S. states are considering laws to retroactively make insurers pay such claims.  \u201cIf they pass this law in New York and eventually other states, every business with the coverage will file a claim and it will force those insurers into bankruptcy,\u201d Chookaszian said.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates insurers, said on Friday it will seek clarity in court on whether business-interruption policies cover pandemics.  MARKET EXPOSURE  Meanwhile, insurers are facing a second blow from the trillions of dollars they have invested in global markets.  Although stocks have partly recovered from their plunge in late February, low interest rates are biting into bond income, with credit and liquidity issues across more obscure parts of the market.  Insurers that have reported first-quarter results - including Chubb Ltd, Travelers Companies Inc, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc, Markel Corp. and Swiss Re AG - have drawn a mixed picture of the damage so far, but predicted things will get worse.  Swiss Re and Markel faced big hits from the cancellation of major global events like the Olympics and Wimbledon.  Executives expect the pandemic to remain an earnings issue, rather than a question of viability, but warned that problems are sure to crop up in businesses that have not yet experienced elevated claims or lawsuits.  For instance, some experts have suggested the coronavirus could create workers compensation claims similar to the decades-long battle over asbestos. The insurance covers salaries and medical expenses of workers who are injured at work.  New revenue has also become more difficult to generate. The Hartford expects a 15% decrease in new business premiums during the second quarter.  \u201cWe are in the middle of a slow-moving storm,\u201d said Swiss Re Chief Financial Officer John Dacey.  Insurance stocks are reflecting the mixed outlook. The S&P 500 index has risen 29% since its low in March but the S&P Life and Health Insurance index is up 49%, buoyed by health insurers.  Investors may get some more insight as other major insurers report results through the rest of May.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which has large insurance units, reported a record quarterly loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and said performance is suffering in several major operating businesses. An accounting rule requires Berkshire, which has sold its airline holdings, to report unrealized stock losses and gains with results, causing huge swings.  American International Group Inc reports on Monday. Lloyd\u2019s of London Ltd. plans to reveal its pandemic exposure in \u201cearly May.\u201d  Germany\u2019s Allianz SE withdrew its 2020 profit targets on Thursday ahead of scheduled results on May 12, citing uncertainties caused by the pandemic.","90":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Insurers have largely stopped covering independent film and television productions against the risk of COVID-19 illness, a shift that threatens the supply of new entertainment in 2021, Hollywood producers, insurers and industry experts said.  Thousands of shoots around the world shut down abruptly in March as the novel coronavirus spread and governments imposed lockdowns.  Now as filmmakers try to get back to work they are finding insurers have largely stopped providing the COVID-19 coverage they need to secure financing.  Some insurers are even adding exclusions for COVID-19 or communicable diseases to existing policies when cast members get medical exams, insurance lawyer Kirk Pasich told Reuters.  Without coverage, many producers cannot get the completion bond, or guarantee, that banks require to lend to productions.  Until crews can work safely again and insurance covers COVID-related costs, \u201cthere will be less content of the caliber that we\u2019re used to,\u201d independent film producer Robert Salerno told Reuters.  Insurers, already reeling from other pandemic claims, say they cannot offer the coverage because it is unclear how the pandemic will play out.  Although some countries have controlled or eliminated the virus, cases have resurged elsewhere, including the United States.  (GRAPHIC: here)  \u201cIt is not a risk you can even price,\u201d a senior insurance executive, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told Reuters.  Only a handful of insurers offer film and TV policies worldwide. Chubb Ltd and Allianz SE, two major insurers no longer providing such coverage, declined to comment.

Producers are watching the new rise in U.S. COVID-19 cases closely as they consider rescheduling.  \u201cEverybody\u2019s taking a beat to see if the rates go down again,\u201d he said.  While big studios can self-insure, independent producers, who turn out 70% of new films and numerous TV shows in the U.S. each year, are looking for alternatives, said Jean Prewitt, chief executive of the Independent Film & Television Alliance.  Budgets are up 10% to 30% as producers add safety measures on set and rewrite scripts to reduce infection risk, Prewitt said.  Nicolas Chartier, producer of the Academy Award-winning film The Hurt Locker, is feeling the effects. His Voltage Pictures production company planned to film sequels to the romantic drama \u201cAfter\u201d in September. Both are on hold because insurance is unavailable, he told Reuters.  \u201cYou cannot get a completion bond because right now insurance doesn\u2019t cover COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody is worried about the movie being abandoned.\u201d  Projects costing $1 million or less can be financed with cash, but still face health risks, especially for plots with romance or fight scenes.  \u201cSo you need to shoot two people in a room, two people talking outside on a bench,\u201d Chartier said. \u201cNot exactly the most exciting movie.\u201d  Independent producers are also looking for private investors to provide insurance, or moving to countries that have government backing for pandemic risk, said Brian O\u2019Shea, chief executive of The Exchange, a movie sales, financing and production company. He hopes the U.S. will provide similar support.  O\u2019Shea sold two movies - one starring Bruce Willis and the other Olivia Munn - last month at \u201cvirtual Cannes,\u201d an online version of the famous C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur film festival.  With $10 million in financial commitments for each film, he wants to shoot this year, and says government backing would help.  \u201cNow I need to find a bond company and insurance or an equity investor that will guarantee the delivery of the picture given the risks caused by COVID,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure it out.\u201d","91":"(Reuters) - Travelers Companies Inc has set aside a \u201cmodest\u201d amount of additional money to cover its possible exposure to child sex-abuse claims, the insurer\u2019s finance chief, Daniel Frey, told analysts during an earnings call on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company Travelers Companies Inc (TRV) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Two analysts asked about Travelers\u2019 exposure to child sex-abuse lawsuits, as Wall Street tries to figure out how much decades-old policies for churches, non-profits and other organizations may cost the insurance industry.  The amount that Travelers set aside was not large enough to detail under disclosure rules, he added.  Travelers beat analysts\u2019 estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by a rise in premiums and strong underwriting. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.32 per share, beating estimates of $3.29 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue rose 3.4% to $8.06 billion.  The sex-abuse claims are being spurred by lawsuits filed in response new statues in a number of U.S. states that waive or eliminate time limits for plaintiffs to sue their alleged abusers and institutions where they worked.  A New York law that went into effect last August giving victims a year to sue, regardless of when the abuse occurred, has already prompted hundreds of lawsuits. Similar laws have since became effective in New Jersey and California.  Insurers are a footnote to the broader scandal (reut.rs\/2GlCZmA) that has swept the Catholic church, as well as universities and groups like the Boy Scouts of America.  As claims against such institutions have piled up, defendants have been leaning on insurance policies they bought as far back as the 1940s to offset mounting costs.  In general, those policies covered injuries that might occur at a physical location, without excluding sexual abuse, and did not place limits on when customers could seek reimbursement, lawyers said.  Travelers first acknowledged possible exposure in April 2019, increasing reserves by between $50 million and $100 million after the New York legislation was signed.  Chubb Ltd and Selective Insurance Group Inc have made similar disclosures.  But Travelers has seen activity \u201cpretty steadily\u201d throughout the year, Frey said on Thursday.  Insurers were not thinking about child sex abuse as an \u201cinjury\u201d when they wrote the coverage long ago, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University School of Law professor who has performed research on the topic.  \u201cThey were thinking about slip and fall, church fires, and grandma falling down cathedral steps,\u201d he said.","92":"Nov 21 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB LIMITED BOARD DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND AUTHORIZES SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  * CHUBB LTD - ANNOUNCED AUTHORIZATION OF A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO $1.5 BILLION THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","93":"PARIS (Reuters) - France will pare back financial regulations to EU minimums and introduce new tax incentives to make Paris a more attractive finance hub, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Suzanne Barlyn  American International Group Inc AIG.N and Chubb Ltd CB.BN said payouts on claims related to the disease accounted for most of their financial hit, which was mostly on property and casualty policies.  Others including Travelers Companies Inc TRV.N, MetLife Inc MET.N and Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N lost money on their private equity investments due to market declines in the first quarter, which are reported on a three-month lag. Those losses are expected to reverse, since the market has recovered.  Insurers had sounded alarms about potentially crippling payouts if they were required to pay claims related to coronavirus on business-interruption policies.  Those payouts could still happen, depending on the outcome of litigation. Two cases have so far been decided in insurers\u2019 favor.  It may still be too early to say insurers are not at risk of major claims from the coronavirus and a related respiratory disease, COVID-19, said Piper Sandler analyst Paul Newsome.  \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what the extent of COVID claims will be in the third quarter,\u201d he said.  But insurers now have better predictions about COVID-related mortality and are well-capitalized, said Andrew Kligerman, analyst at Credit Suisse. \u201cThe industry is positioned to see some growth if and when we can pull through COVID,\u201d he said.  Here are details of coronavirus-related impacts on the insurers and their outlooks for the rest of 2020:  CHUBB  Chubb tallied $1.16 billion in after-tax coronavirus-related reported and unreported claims, which contributed to a net loss of $331 million for the quarter. The company is based in Zurich, but has a significant presence in the United States.  Net premiums written fell by $191 million, mainly from workers\u2019 compensation and commercial casualty payments, including refunds on auto policies. Chubb said its investment income also fell by an undisclosed amount.  The company expects full-year premium revenue to increase, Chief Executive Evan Greenberg said on a conference call.  AIG  AIG's general insurance business reported $458 million worth of claims and expected claims related to the pandemic in the second quarter, in line with its expectations. So far this year, its tally here of such costs is $730 million.  AIG did not break out the impact on its life and retirement business, but said losses on private equity investments, yield compression and higher mortality rates drove a decline in adjusted pre-tax profit for that unit during the quarter.  AIG is already seeing signs that the second quarter was a \u201clow watermark\u201d for sales, Chief Executive Brian Duperreault said.  PRUDENTIAL  Prudential did not detail coronavirus effects specifically, but said its group insurance, retirement and individual life businesses were affected in positive and negative ways. Prudential also recorded $2.7 billion in investment losses, but did not say how much related to coronavirus.  The company said it could experience a $70 million earnings decline for every additional 100,000 pandemic fatalities in the United States. Prudential anticipates about $60 million in costs in the second half related to the disease, which will be offset by about $30 million in benefits, such as lower travel and entertainment expenses.  TRAVELERS  The pandemic and its effect on the economy resulted in $114 million in direct losses, with the largest impact in workers\u2019 compensation coverage, Travelers said. Its portfolio of non-fixed income investments lost $234 million before tax due to the market decline in the first quarter, the results of which are reported a quarter later, the insurer said.  \u201cWe expect to experience the impacts of economic disruption\u201d on revenue in coming quarters, Chief Financial Officer Dan Frey said on a conference call, though the duration and intensity of the impact remain unclear. On investments, while markets have recovered, fund managers may \u201cnot be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down,\u201d he added.  METLIFE  MetLife lost $555 million on its private-equity investments because of first-quarter value declines. But its core businesses experienced few effects from the pandemic, with gains on some areas being offset by others, Chief Financial Officer John McCallion told Reuters.  He predicted a \u201cstrong recovery\u201d in investment income this quarter, and a mid-single-digit return on its private equity portfolio, which was valued at $7.2 billion on June 30.","102":"(Reuters) - Insurer Chubb Ltd and a unit have agreed to pay a total of $1.3 million to New York State\u2019s insurance regulator over their role in a National Rifle Association (NRA) insurance program, the regulator said on Monday.  The settlement follows an investigation by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which found that the NRA\u2019s \u201cCarry Guard\u201d insurance program \u201cunlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for acts of intentional wrongdoing,\u201d the regulator said in a statement.  The insurance, underwritten by Chubb unit Illinois Union Insurance Company, also \u201cimproperly provided\u201d legal services for policyholders who faced criminal charges after using their guns in self defense, the regulator said.  \u201cChubb recognizes its responsibility to ensure that its policies comply with New York law,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cChubb at all times intended and believed its coverage to be in full compliance with New York law.\u201d  The NRA, a gun advocacy group, \u201cacted appropriately at all times,\u201d said William A. Brewer III, a Dallas-based lawyer who represents the group.  The settlement follows decisions by numerous companies to sever corporate partnerships the NRA.  National debate has heated up over the issue of gun control, and the NRA\u2019s role in opposing it, since Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.  In addition to the fine, Illinois Union agreed not to participate in the Carry Guard insurance program, or any similar program in New York, nor to provide Carry Guard or similar policies to New York residents, regardless of where they are written, the DFS said.  Illinois Union is also not allowed to issue policies for New York residents that provide legal services coverage in a civil or criminal proceeding.  On May 2, the New York regulator fined insurance broker Lockton Cos LLC $7 million for serving as the \u201cCarry Guard\u201d program administrator.  In February, Chubb Ltd said it had given notice to the NRA late last year of its plan stop underwriting the \u201cCarry Guard\u201d program.  Lockton said in February it would no longer sell NRA-endorsed products.  The NRA, on Monday, sued Lockton in a U.S. trial court in Alexandria, Virginia, saying it had breached its contract with the group.  A Lockton spokesman declined to comment.","103":"May 1 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB APPOINTS ANNMARIE HAGAN CHIEF ACCOUNTING OFFICER; PAUL MEDINI TO RETIRE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","104":"April 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. insurance industry is promoting the idea of an insurance plan backed by the federal government that would help businesses that in the future suffer losses from a pandemic, people familiar with the effort told Reuters.  The campaign involves discussions with lawmakers and regulators, public statements and coordination with a broad coalition of non-insurance companies including retailers, hoteliers and booksellers, sources said.  Insurers are doing this after facing multiple lawsuits, fierce political pressure and criticism from customers with business interruption policies over not covering their recent financial hardships due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.  About 40% of small businesses have business interruption coverage, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group.  While these policies may cover revenue losses from hurricane damage, lightning strikes or cars crashing into buildings, they either exclude or do not specifically cover a global pandemic, however much it may interrupt business.  U.S. insurers say they would not have the financial means to help every insured business affected by coronavirus, even if required to.  \u201cThe industry doesn\u2019t have as much money available for new claims as people would tend to think,\u201d said Steven Weisbart, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute.  Insurers have a lot more money for potential claims than regulators require, but they need the funds for other types of claims, such as hurricanes and wildfires, he said. Eight U.S. states have introduced legislation that would require insurers to pay claims, mainly to small businesses, despite exclusions, efforts that could more than deplete the industry surplus if enacted.  The U.S. industry has about $750 billion to $800 billion in gross surplus, compared with the $400 billion required by regulators, he said. The industry spent $622 billion last year on claims and related expenses, Weisbart said.  \u201cIf we ever had a bad hurricane season or bad anything else, we wouldn\u2019t have enough money,\u201d he said.  Insurers want the pandemic policies to be backed by the U.S. government, similar the government-supported commercial terrorism products after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  Chubb Ltd Chief Executive Officer Evan Greenberg called for that kind of public-private partnership on April 22. John Doyle, chief executive of insurance broker Marsh LLC, a Marsh & McLennan Companies unit, also offered \u201cassistance\u201d in crafting such an idea in a March 30 letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow.  Two non-insurance trade groups also sent pleas for such a policy to U.S. lawmakers and officials on April 20: RIMS, which represents risk managers at major businesses and the National Retail Federation, which partnered with 16 other business groups.  The idea has gotten some uptake in Washington.  Lawmakers including Democrats Carolyn Maloney and Lacy Clay, senior members of the House Financial Services Committee, are circulating draft bills for creating a government-backed pandemic insurance policy, suggesting it would help small businesses, while Republican Representative Brian Fitzpatrick has introduced a similar measure.  A group of state lawmakers also held a joint webinar with industry representatives earlier this month, in part to talk about the need for a government-backed pandemic product.  There is scant chance that any new insurance policy will help business owners whose revenue has already been hit.  Proposals in Congress would require time and studies before being put in place, experts and lawyers said.  In the meantime, one product that does exist, pandemic business-interruption insurance launched by Marsh in 2018, is not writing coverage for coronavirus. The policy did not initially sell well although demand has since spiked, said Christian Ryan, the company\u2019s hospitality, sports and gaming practice leader.  \u201cThe industry has a finite balance sheet that can\u2019t take infinite risk,\u201d Chubb\u2019s Greenberg said.

Insurers highlighted in the letter include American International Group Inc, Liberty Mutual, Chubb Ltd, Axis Capital and Hartford Financial Services .  According to the letter, Chubb, Axis Capital, Hartford, and Liberty Mutual have policies to scale back but not halt underwriting of fossil fuels.  In recent years, environmental activists have pressured banks to drop financing for fossil-fuel companies, and called on the finance industry to stop investing in them.  Lobby groups such as Unfriend Coal have also put pressure on insurers to stop underwriting carbon-intensive fuels like coal and oil sands.  Insurance companies can accelerate a transition to a low-carbon economy because having insurance is typically a condition for loans and investment.  The first 10 insurers to exit the coal sector were European, but since March 2019, two U.S. insurers - Chubb and Axis Capital - and two Australian coal insurers have also adopted coal exit policies, according to Unfriend Coal.  Swiss Re AG and Zurich Insurance are the leaders in ending coal insurance, the lobby group said.

PG&E Corp, which operates in the northern part of California, dropped 16 percent, bringing its loss over two sessions to 29 percent, equivalent to $8 billion. Edison International, the owner of Southern California Edison Company, slumped 11 percent, leaving its stock market value $5 billion lower since Thursday when the fires broke out.  PG&E was deemed responsible for wildfires in 2017 that ravaged wine country north of the San Francisco Bay area and killed 46 people, and this week\u2019s fires create new uncertainties for investors in California\u2019s utilities.  The so-called Camp Fire in northern California, the state\u2019s most destructive blaze on record, had left at least 228 people missing as of early Monday after burning down more than 6,700 homes and businesses in the town of Paradise.  In southern California, the Woolsey Fire had forced authorities to issue evacuation orders for a quarter million people in Ventura and Los Angeles counties and beachside communities including the Malibu beach colony.  Both utilities reported to regulators in recent days that they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas where fires were reported, just before or close to the time they started.  SunTrust analyst Ali Agha in a note to clients said the sell-off in Edison International was likely overdone because total acres and property burned so far in its territory were smaller than in fires last year. He noted that new legislation could help reduce the potential costs related to possible liability.  The fire in northern California has probably caused between $2 billion and $4 billion in insured property damage, Morgan Stanley estimated in a report on Monday. Shares of insurance companies covering homes and businesses in California also fell, with Allstate, Travelers Companies, Chubb Ltd and Hartford Financial each down more than 1 percent.  PG&E recorded a $2.5 billion in pre-tax expense for the second quarter related to last year\u2019s fires after a report said some of them were sparked by trees toppling into PG&E power lines.  Both utilities said the causes of the current fires have not been determined. PG&E said that as of Saturday, 25,000 customers were without electricity and that it had turned off gas for another 12,000 customers.  Southern California Edison said 9,500 of its customers were without power due to the Woolsey fire in southern California.  In September, the state passed a bill allowing utilities to pass on to customers some of the costs incurred from liabilities related to wildfires.

A report by the broker showed early estimates for U.S. and UK business interruption, contingency, U.S. Directors & Officers, U.S. employment practices, liability, U.S. general liability, U.S. mortgage, trade credit and surety and U.S. workers\u2019 compensation.  An \u201coptimistic\u201d scenario or a return to a pre-COVID-19 state following 3 months of social distancing, would mean $11 billion of insured losses, while a \u201cmoderate\u201d scenario, a gradual return following 6 months of social distancing, would mean a bill of $32 billion to insurers.  Social distancing for a year under a \u201csevere\u201d scenario - a health impact approaching the scale of the 1918 flu pandemic - will mean $80 billion in COVID-19 insured losses, Willis said.  Willis also said it has modeled an extreme pandemic scenario, which could result in $140 billion of losses.  \u201cBeyond its devastating human cost, the COVID-19 pandemic has swiftly upended economic activity around the world,\u201d said Alice Underwood, global leader, insurance consulting and technology, at Willis.  \u201cAt this point, it appears that the industrywide level of general insurance loss could exceed that resulting from the 2001 World Trade Centre event.\u201d  Given the potential scale and systemic nature of pandemic loss, talks about the need for some sort of government backstop to address future pandemic risks have already begun, Underwood said.","113":"(Reuters) - Insurers are normally great with numbers. But the coronavirus pandemic has them struggling to estimate how many billions of dollars in losses they face, and what the fallout will be for their massive investment portfolios.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  Executives, lawyers and analysts say the cost is sure to be multiples of prior catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina, the T\u014dhoku tsunami or the 9\/11 attacks. That could be tens of billions to half a trillion dollars or more, depending on how long the pandemic lasts and other variables.  \u201cThis has the potential to be the largest insurance loss of all time,\u201d Alan Lyons, a partner and chair of the insurance practice at Herrick Feinstein in New York, said in an interview.  Unlike other disasters, the pandemic has been hitting businesses, individuals and markets throughout the world, all at once. Customers are filing claims across numerous policy types, from workers compensation to events cancellation to broader commercial liabilities.  Many claims for business interruption likely will not be paid this year since lawsuits will take a year or more to resolve, Lyons said, and cost insurers millions of dollars to defend.  Insured losses in the United States and UK alone could be anywhere from $11 billion to $140 billion, insurance broker Willis Towers Watson PLC WLTW.O said on Friday. Its estimates include varying durations of social distancing measures, several projections for how many people die, and what those assumptions mean for different insurance lines.  (Tracking U.S. coronavirus cases graphic: here)  Some experts warn of even more costly outcomes. Losses could exceed $500 billion if state lawmakers require insurers to cover business-interruption claims for pandemic losses, former CNA Financial Corp CNA.N Chief Executive Dennis Chookaszian told Reuters. Most policies exclude that risk, but insurers are facing lawsuits over it and eight U.S. states are considering laws to retroactively make insurers pay such claims.  \u201cIf they pass this law in New York and eventually other states, every business with the coverage will file a claim and it will force those insurers into bankruptcy,\u201d Chookaszian said.  Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates insurers, said on Friday it will seek clarity in court on whether business-interruption policies cover pandemics.  MARKET EXPOSURE  Meanwhile, insurers are facing a second blow from the trillions of dollars they have invested in global markets.  Although stocks have partly recovered from their plunge in late February, low interest rates are biting into bond income, with credit and liquidity issues across more obscure parts of the market.  Insurers that have reported first-quarter results - including Chubb Ltd CB.BN, Travelers Companies Inc TRV.N, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc HIG.N, Markel Corp. MKL.N and Swiss Re AG SRENH.S - have drawn a mixed picture of the damage so far, but predicted things will get worse.  Swiss Re and Markel faced big hits from the cancellation of major global events like the Olympics and Wimbledon.  Executives expect the pandemic to remain an earnings issue, rather than a question of viability, but warned that problems are sure to crop up in businesses that have not yet experienced elevated claims or lawsuits.  For instance, some experts have suggested the coronavirus could create workers compensation claims similar to the decades-long battle over asbestos. The insurance covers salaries and medical expenses of workers who are injured at work.  New revenue has also become more difficult to generate. The Hartford expects a 15% decrease in new business premiums during the second quarter.  \u201cWe are in the middle of a slow-moving storm,\u201d said Swiss Re Chief Financial Officer John Dacey.  Insurance stocks are reflecting the mixed outlook. The S&P 500 index has risen 29% since its low in March but the S&P Life and Health Insurance index is up 49%, buoyed by health insurers.  Investors may get some more insight as other major insurers report results through the rest of May.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, which has large insurance units, reported a record quarterly loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and said performance is suffering in several major operating businesses. An accounting rule requires Berkshire, which has sold its airline holdings, to report unrealized stock losses and gains with results, causing huge swings.  American International Group Inc AIG.N on Monday posted a 93% drop in quarterly adjusted profit compared with the prior year quarter.  AIG set aside $419 million in catastrophe losses in its general insurance unit, including $272 million of estimated COVID-19-related losses.

Much like refunds on auto insurance policies prompted by lower driving risk under coronavirus lockdowns, California\u2019s emergency regulation reflects the reduced risk of on-the-job injury at the office or factory, the state said.  The regulation, effective July 1 and applicable to all employers in the state, is retroactive to the state\u2019s March 19 stay-at-home order and expires 60 days after the order is lifted, Michael Soller, a deputy insurance commissioner for northern California, told Reuters.  \u201cWorkers\u2019 compensation premiums should reflect that many employees are performing less risky duties,\u201d state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement.  Employers also can reclassify employees to clerical roles if their jobs have changed and involve lower risk, the state Department of Insurance said in a news release.  No other states have enacted a similar regulation, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  The amount of refund has not been calculated, Soller said. Insurers collected $11.4 billion in premiums in California last year.  Lara in April and May directed insurers to refund premiums for March, April and May, though he provided leeway for insurers on whether to issue refunds or reduce future premiums.  The new order will reduce both the premium owed for past months and the future, Soller said.  The regulation affects 50 insurers offering such policies in California. These include units of: Travelers Companies Inc , Berkshire Hathaway Inc, American International Group, Chubb Ltd, Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd , Everest Re Group Ltd, Employers Holdings Inc , James River Group Holdings Ltd, Old Republic International Corp, W.

FILE PHOTO: Residents in a senior living facility look out from their apartment amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Revere, Massachusetts, U.S., April 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  Residential care communities like nursing homes and assisted-living facilities had already faced escalating prices and a dearth of insurance providers for years. Outbreaks of the novel coronavirus and a related respiratory disease called COVID-19 in such centers only exacerbated the problem.  \"It was already on an upward trajectory but COVID accelerated it,\" Deepa Desai, who heads insurance broker Aon Plc's AON.N healthcare practice, said about rates.  Senior care facilities need general and professional liability insurance, which protect against everything from slip-and-fall incidents to staff-member mistakes that harm patients.  Senior-care providers with expiring policies have struggled to find insurers that will offer coverage in recent months, as some imposed moratoriums on new business deals and others jacked up prices to unaffordable levels, brokers said.  For instance, insurance company Chubb Ltd CB.BN imposed a moratorium on new senior-community clients in March, two sources familiar with the matter said. Chubb recently ended the moratorium but is being highly selective about terms and clients it accepts, they said. A Chubb spokesman declined to comment.  Senior-care communities who can renew policies are paying far more for less coverage, industry sources said. Some insurers are adding exclusions not just for the novel coronavirus, but for communicable diseases at large. Exclusions for costs related to class-action lawsuits are also cropping up.  On June 19, families of three patients who died from COVID-19 at Summit Manor sued the Columbia, Kentucky-based nursing home, saying it failed to protect residents. A spokeswoman for Signature HealthCare, which owns the facility, declined comment.  To mitigate those risks, insurers are requiring customers to answer \"COVID-19 questionnaires\" that ask about previous outbreaks, visitation procedures and preparations for a second wave, said Joanne Wankmiller, national senior care practice leader for Marsh, insurance brokerage unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc MMC.N.  Church Mutual Insurance Co\u2019s five-page questionnaire asks about personal protective gear supplies.  \u201cWe have concerns about new shortages being able to emerge again,\u201d said Jim Ketterson, the company\u2019s senior living director.  It is not yet clear how higher insurance rates are impacting the U.S. senior care industry, but pandemic-related expenses have already pushed some entities into the red.  Hallworth House, a Providence, Rhode Island-based nursing home, said last month that it would close in August after losing more than $1.3 million during the past two years. The pandemic sickened more than half of its 51 residents and 20 staff members in recent months, and 12 residents died.  The industry is also experiencing lower revenue, as the pandemic keeps prospective customers away.  Nursing home occupancy fell nearly 6 percentage points to 79% in April from 85% in February, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care. That is partly because of state and local lockdowns and fewer referrals for care by some insurance plans due to federal restrictions.  The senior-care industry is lobbying for broad federal immunity from lawsuits and also pinning its hopes on efforts in at least 21 states to grant various forms of immunity, including to nursing homes and health care providers.  In the meantime, some senior care companies are thinking about creating insurance cooperatives to offset surging rates, said Barbara Duffy, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises senior communities on insurance.  \u201cThese staggering bills could bring the profession to a breaking point,\u201d Duffy said.","117":"April 24 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB REPORTS FIRST QUARTER PER SHARE NET INCOME AND CORE OPERATING INCOME OF $2.30 AND $2.34, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING CATASTROPHE LOSSES OF $0.64 PER SHARE VERSUS $0.35 PRIOR YEAR; NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN UP 5.9%  * Q1 CORE OPERATING EARNINGS PER SHARE $2.34  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE $2.30  * Q1 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $2.26 -- THOMSON REUTERS I\/B\/E\/S  * QTRLY P&C NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN WERE $6.5 BILLION, UP 5.8%  * QTRLY P&C COMBINED RATIO WAS 90.1% COMPARED WITH 87.5% PRIOR YEAR  * AT MARCH 31 2018, BOOK VALUE\/SHARE, TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE\/SHARE DECREASED 0.2% AND 0.3%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2017  * AT QUARTER-END FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENT FAVORABLY IMPACTED BOOK VALUE BY $310 MILLION AFTER-TAX AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE BY $136 MILLION AFTER-TAX Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","118":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration held \u201cfrank and constructive\u201d talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s top economic adviser, Liu He, on Thursday, a White House official said, the same day U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum in a veiled threat to China.  \u201cWe underscored the importance of achieving balance and reciprocity in the economic relationship,\u201d the official said of the meeting between Liu He and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. \u201cWe discussed ways to ensure fair and reciprocal trade.\u201d  On Wednesday, Liu He met with top U.S. business executives from companies including Boeing, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and Chubb as part of his trip to the United States for trade talks.

REUTERS\/Robert Galbraith  Following is a list of companies that have offered to return premiums:  ALLSTATE CORP ALL.N  Allstate, one of the largest U.S. auto insurers, said it would return more than $1 billion in premiums to customers. Most customers will receive a \u201cpayback\u201d of 15% of their monthly premium for April, May and June, the company said.  AMERICAN FAMILY INSURANCE  The auto insurer said it will return additional money to customers, taking the total to $425 million, through a 10% credit on personal auto policies in force from July to December end, and expanded discounts.  The company had begun the exercise in mid-April, when it said customers will receive $50 per vehicle covered by their policies, the company said.  AVIVA CANADA  Aviva Canada said it was offering $100 million in additional immediate relief measures to drivers, including options that would reduce insurance premiums. Customers who have stopped driving entirely could reduce their auto insurance premiums by up to 75%.  CHUBB CB.BN  The world\u2019s largest-listed property and casualty insurance company said it will give personal auto insurance clients in the United States credit on annual renewal premiums, reflecting a 35% cut for the months of April and May.  ERIE INSURANCE ERIE.O  The insurer said it would provide $200 million in dividends to personal and auto insurance customers in 12 states and the District of Columbia. This is in addition to the $200 million in rate reductions announced previously, bringing the total announced relief to $400 million.  FARMERS INSURANCE  Farmers and 21st Century-branded auto customers will receive a 25% reduction in their April premium.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  An Ethiopian Airlines passenger jet bound for Nairobi crashed minutes after take-off on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board, raising questions about the safety of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, a new model that also crashed in Indonesia in October.  While the initial insurance payments will be made by Ethiopian Airlines\u2019 insurers, they may look to recoup their money from Boeing\u2019s insurers if they can prove that the aircraft was faulty, the sources said.  Initial payments to the passengers\u2019 families are bound by the Warsaw and Montreal conventions, but those payouts could be much higher if families pursue legal claims, particularly through U.S. courts, said Clive Garner, head of law firm Irwin Mitchell\u2019s travel litigation group in London.  \u201cIf there were to be anything defective in terms of the plane or any of its components, then it would be possible to bring a claim against the manufacturer as well as the airline,\u201d he added.  Insurers typically form a consortium to share the risks of large claims, with the lead insurer taking a larger proportion of the risk. The insured value of the plane itself was likely around $50 million, according to industry sources.  Willis Towers Watson was the insurance broker for Ethiopian Airlines, while Chubb was the lead insurer, a Willis spokeswoman said on Monday. A Chubb spokesman declined to comment.  Britain\u2019s Global Aerospace was the lead insurer for Boeing and also for Lion Air, which operated the plane that crashed in October, said Global Aerospace Chief Executive Nick Brown.  Marsh was Boeing\u2019s insurance broker, two sources told Reuters. None of the sources gave financial details of the policies.  Boeing shares fell 5.6 percent on Monday.  U.S. LAWSUITS POSSIBLE  Boeing self-insures an initial layer of coverage before the Global Aerospace coverage kicks in, said Justin Green, a New York-based aviation lawyer who has represented families in cases against Boeing. Boeing declined comment on its insurance cover.  It is not uncommon for the planemaker, which is headquartered in Chicago, to face lawsuits in the United States, where legal compensation payments for the crash victims could run around $2 million to $3 million per person, depending on the law applied, compared to about $200,000 in Ethiopia, said Green.  U.S. courts often throw out such lawsuits, given the difficulty of finding witnesses overseas, but the fact that eight U.S. citizens were killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash increases the likelihood that litigation on behalf of all victims\u2019 families could be heard by a U.S. court, Green said.  Initial compensation costs for all 157 passengers who died on the flight could be around $25 million, according to Reuters calculations based on the terms of the Montreal convention.  The Montreal convention provides for a maximum of 113,100 special drawing rights, currently worth $1.39, for death or injury of each passenger, although not all countries are joined up to the convention.","123":"July 23 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB REPORTS SECOND QUARTER PER SHARE NET INCOME AND CORE OPERATING INCOME OF $2.50 AND $2.60, RESPECTIVELY; CONSOLIDATED NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN OF $8.3 BILLION, UP 4.1%, OR 5.9% IN CONSTANT DOLLARS  * Q2 CORE OPERATING EARNINGS PER SHARE $2.60  * Q2 EARNINGS PER SHARE $2.50  * QTRLY P&C NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN WERE $7.8 BILLION, UP 4.2%, OR 6.0% IN CONSTANT DOLLARS  * QTRLY P&C COMBINED RATIO WAS 90.1% COMPARED WITH 88.4% PRIOR YEAR  * QTRLY BOOK AND TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WERE UP 3.2% AND 4.7%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM PRIOR QUARTER  * Q2 EARNINGS PER SHARE VIEW $2.56 -- REFINITIV IBES DATA Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","124":"Nov 25 (Reuters) - Chubb Ltd:  * CHUBB ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL 15.3% OF HUATAI INSURANCE GROUP; OWNERSHIP POSITION TO INCREASE TO 46.2%  * CHUBB LTD SAYS CHUBB WILL PURCHASE SHARES FROM INNER MONGOLIA JUNZHENG ENERGY AND CHEMICAL GROUP CO., LTD.

FILE PHOTO: A cap and shirt are displayed at the booth for the National Rifle Association (NRA) at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 23, 2018. REUTERS\/Joshua Roberts  Cuomo and the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) aimed to deprive the NRA of its right to \u201cspeak freely about gun-related issues and defend the Second Amendment,\u201d the group said in the suit, referring to part of the U.S. Constitution that protects the right of Americans to bear arms.  \u201cThe NRA\u2019s lawsuit is a futile and desperate attempt to advance its dangerous agenda to sell more guns,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement, calling the suit \u201cfrivolous.\u201d  The NRA\u2019s lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, follows a $7 million fine on May 2 imposed by NYDFS against insurance broker Lockton Cos LLC, which administered an NRA-branded insurance program known as \u201cCarry Guard.\u201d  On May 7, NYDFS fined insurer Chubb Ltd and its Illinois Union Insurance Company unit $1.3 million for having \u201cunlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for acts of intentional wrongdoing,\u201d the regulator said.  The fines were part of settlements between the companies and the regulator, outcomes that are the \u201cculmination of years of political activism by Cuomo against the NRA and gun rights organizations,\u201d an NRA lawyer said in a statement.  National debate has heated up over the issue of gun control, and the NRA\u2019s role in opposing it, since Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.  Cuomo, NYDFS and its superintendent, Maria Vullo, whom the NRA also named as a defendant, engaged in a \u201ccampaign of selective prosecution, backroom exhortations, and public threats\u201d to coerce banks and insurance companies to withhold services from the NRA, the group said in the suit.  The suit also cites an April letter issued by NYDFS to heads of banks and insurance companies doing business in New York encouraging them to manage \u201creputational risk\u201d posed by dealings with \u201cgun promotion organizations.\u201d  NYDFS has an obligation to \u201csupervise and guide regulated entities to mitigate the risks to their safety and soundness that may derive from a variety of sources, including reputational risk,\u201d said Vullo.  NYDFS must also enforce New York law, Vullo said. The Lockton and Chubb settlements addressed unlicensed and unlawful activity connected with \u201cCarry Guard.\u201d  The NRA has suffered tens of millions of dollars in damages, the group said.","126":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global money managers and companies are rushing to meet a deadline to report on their carbon footprint, but the lack of a standard metric raises concerns their efforts could just be a box-ticking exercise in the transition from brown to green.  FILE PHOTO: Power-generating windmill turbines are pictured during sunset at a wind park in Campeneac, France, September 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Gonzalo Fuentes  From 2020, firms with some $118 trillion of funds under management - among 800 signatories to a United Nations pact - will make climate-risk related disclosures as an early step towards making the world a better place by 2030.  The problem with assessing carbon footprints is that there are no universal criteria for benchmarking environmental, social and governance (ESG) - the key factors in measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment.  \u201cThe way you quantify climate impact and consider transition risks could differ from company to company,\u201d said Stephane Andre, a Sydney-based portfolio manager at Alphinity Investments which has A$8.2 billion ($5.65 billion) in assets under management.  \u201cThere is no prescriptive way to look at it,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat it means is in the short term there might be limited value in it.\u201d  That hasn\u2019t stopped stakeholders such as Andre from piling pressure on companies to tackle the 17 United Nations \u2018sustainable development goals\u2019 such as zero hunger, gender equality and clean energy.  Mining titan BHP Billiton BHP.AX surprised markets this year when it announced plans to cut carbon emissions not just at its own facilities but for its customers as well. It exited some coal projects, on the heels of rival Rio Tinto RIO.L.  Large banks have begun disclosing their carbon exposures while setting targets for clean lending, while insurers including Chubb CB.BNCB.N and Suncorp SUN.AX, have moved away from coverage for new coal projects.  Top U.S. retailer Walmart WMT.N said this month it would stop selling ammunition for handguns in all its stores across the country and Australia's Woolworths WOW.AX became the first supermarket chain in the world to issue a certified climate bond this year.  Despite a blitz of such corporate announcements, fund managers are constantly trying to differentiate between genuine ESG and spin by looking for deeper disclosures from the companies they screen, in areas such as gender pay gap and relationship with employees and suppliers.  But not all companies publish data on ESG impact yet, and analyzing data from those that do is also challenging. \u201cData isn\u2019t always readily available, and not all investors have access to advanced analytical tools or various ESG data sets,\u201d said Jessica Huang, head of Americas and APAC platform for Blackrock Sustainable Investing. \u201cInvestors often rely too much on historical data, which may not provide an accurate prediction of future trends.\u201d  ESG SCORE  Some investment managers use so-called ESG ratings provided by firms such as Fitch Ratings.  One MSCI study found that companies with higher average ESG ratings had lower risks, greater profitability and higher dividend yields. Yet, those ESG scores are based on the levels of disclosure by a company, not an actual assessment of practices.  Worryingly, a comparison of FTSE and MSCI ESG scores has hardly any correlation, said Mike Lubrano, managing director for corporate governance & sustainability at Cartica Management.  Variations in the components and weightings of the underlying metrics used by different index providers also generate widely divergent scores, he noted.  Despite the challenges of measuring ESG performance, investments in the stream are rising. Investors believe that if companies do well on ESG metrics, such focus will make their businesses more sustainable in the long term.  Indeed, an analysis of the top 500 companies in Asia, based on ESG metrics, shows their average returns outperformed the broader MSCI Asia Pacific index .MIAPJ0000PUS each time in the last 10 years.  (GRAPHIC: Asian ESG leaders' price performance - tmsnrt.rs\/2Adko9m)  Data from Lipper showed assets under management of ethical, water and alternative energy funds in Asia climbed 16% to $28.5 billion in the first half of 2019 from a year ago.  In debt markets, climate bond issuances surpassed $150 billion this year though still a far cry from the $1 trillion goal for 2020, according to Climate Bonds Initiative.  The increased momentum has meant that banks are engaging more actively with their corporate clients while shareholders are rallying behind green groups demanding companies cut emissions, lift governance and improve social responsibilities.  So called responsible investors also shun industries that negatively affect society, including companies that produce or invest in alcohol, tobacco, gambling and guns.  Such activism prompted Australian supermarket giant Woolworths WOW.AX to finally agree, after years of engagement with investors, to offload its profitable pub and liquor business in July.  \u201cPoker machines are horrible things but they are very profitable,\u201d said Bruce Smith, another portfolio manager at Alphinity. \u201cOnce they get rid of that business, Woolworths will become a possible investment for us.\u201d  Woolworths did not specifically comment on its decision, saying only that the move would help it simplify its structure and focus on the retail business.","127":"FILE PHOTO: A sign for BlackRock Inc hangs above its building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  BEIJING (Reuters) - China has approved a wealth management joint venture between U.S. asset manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp (CCB) 0939.HK, as China gradually opens up its financial sector to international firms.  The announcement, which confirms what people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in December, was announced on the website of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) on Saturday.  The article gave no further details about the venture or what services it would be offering.  The deal comes as China\u2019s government looks to open up its financial market to foreign firms, offering potentially rich rewards for international fund managers and others in the broader financial sector.  Top global financial players have long sought to increase their presence in the relatively fast-growing Chinese economy, and in October last year China scrapped some restrictions on foreign banks\u2019 operations in the country.  Two months later France-based Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, and Bank of China Wealth Management won approval from Chinese regulators to set up a joint venture, while banks including UBS UBSG.S and JPMorgan Chase JPM.N have won approval to set up majority-owned China ventures.  But the Chinese industry remains dominated by domestic state firms and China has yet to open up some more sensitive areas of its financial industry.  A spokesperson for the CBIRC also said in an interview published on the watchdog\u2019s website on Saturday that American insurer Chubb had been allowed to increase its stake in Huatai Insurance Group Co Ltd to 46.2%, becoming the biggest shareholder of the Chinese firm.","128":""}}
