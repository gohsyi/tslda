It will also debut a \"McPlant\" line of plant-based menu items, though it declined to say which suppliers it would use for faux burger, faux chicken and breakfast items. It previously tested a vegan \"P.L.T.\" burger by Beyond Meat Inc BYND.O in Canada.  The world\u2019s biggest burger chain beat revenue and profit estimates for the third quarter on Monday as customers in the United States ordered more hamburgers and fries in drive-through outlets and on delivery apps to avoid dining out during the pandemic.  Overall, global sales fell 2.2% in the quarter, an improvement over the previous quarter\u2019s drop, as McDonald\u2019s had already announced in an October update.  The company\u2019s limited-time promotional deal with rapper Travis Scott, which caused shortages of some ingredients, and other marketing investments also helped sales bounce back from pandemic lows.  Through 2022, the chain plans to spend about $2.3 billion on capital expenditure, about half of which will build new stores, with some of the rest used for remodels stalled by the pandemic.  It expects systemwide sales to be in the mid-single digits in 2021, compared to 2019.  Next year, McDonald's will focus on core products such as burgers, coffee and chicken, including a new Crispy Chicken Sandwich - something some franchisees have long sought in order to compete with the success of similar products at Popeyes, a unit of Restaurant Brands International Inc QSR.TO, and Chick-fil-A.  It will also redesign its packaging globally. And soon, it will launch another growth driver that other chains have long had -- a loyalty program.  \u201cMyMcDonald\u2019s\u201d digital program will allow customers who sign up to get tailored offers, the company said. A loyalty rewards program using the MyMcDonald\u2019s program will start as a pilot in coming weeks in Phoenix and next year across the United States.  Finally, it will build some locations without any dining rooms to focus on carryout, drive-through and delivery only.  Despite some sales recovery and better-than-forecast margins, the company is still pressured in key markets outside the United States, including France, Germany and Britain by new lockdown restrictions due to a spike in coronavirus cases.  McDonald\u2019s total revenue fell about 2% to $5.42 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, largely recovering from the over 30% plunge posted in the second quarter.  Analysts on average had estimated revenue of $5.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income surged 10% to $1.76 billion, helped by gains from the sale of a part of McDonald\u2019s stake in its Japanese affiliate.  Excluding those gains, the company earned $2.22 per share, beating estimates of $1.90.","1":"FILE PHOTO: Signs of McDonald's fast food restaurant are pictured in Tokyo, Japan, September 26, 2017. REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon  TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in the Japanese affiliate of McDonald's Corp briefly fell as much as 10% on Wednesday after the U.S. fast-food giant MCD.N said it would cut its stake in its only publicly listed overseas unit to bolster finances hit by the coronavirus.  Shares in McDonald's Holding Company Japan 2702.T were down 8% at 5,230 yen by midday in Tokyo, after the U.S. company said overnight it would cut its stake in the Japanese unit to 35% from nearly 50%.  The sale comes as the Japanese affiliate has proven more resilient than other fast-food restaurants in the country thanks to its popular take-out and delivery service, even as it has also been hit by the coronavirus pandemic.  The Japanese business has a market capitalization of roughly $7 billion and expects to post a full-year net profit of around 18.2 billion yen ($173 million), up 7.8 percent from last year.  McDonald\u2019s Corp on Tuesday also announced a drop in global same-store sales and weaker-than-expected earnings.  The U.S. company had briefly considered cutting its stake in the Japanese business a few years ago after a series of food scandals, but later shelved the plans.  McDonald\u2019s Holding Company Japan said it did not expect a major impact on its business from the sale.  \u201cEven after selling part of their stake, they will continue to support us ... as shareholders with a stake of over 35%,\u201d it said in a statement.","2":"FILE PHOTO: A McDonald's logo is pictured at a branch that is being used as a Test Centre to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Leicester, Britain, April 25, 2020.

McDonald\u2019s did not specify how many new restaurants would open in the region, but said the first phase would create around 300 jobs.  \u201cThe development of a network of branches in Russia is one of the company\u2019s top priorities. In 2020, the network is continuing to actively invest in Russia\u2019s economy and widen its presence on the market,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in a statement.  \u201cBy the end of the year, we plan to open the 800th branch in the country.\u201d  McDonald\u2019s has over 750 restaurants in Russia, across 60 of the countries more than 80 regions.

FILE PHOTO: An electronic advertisement for a McDonalds food is seen at a bus stop on Oxford Street in London, Britain, May 11, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  The move by the world\u2019s biggest fast-food chain addresses concerns that the overuse of antibiotics vital to fighting human infections in farm animals may diminish the drugs\u2019 effectiveness in people.  McDonald\u2019s becomes the biggest beef buyer to tackle the issue in cattle, potentially creating a new standard for livestock producers and threatening sales by drug companies such as Merck & Co and Elanco Animal Health.  \u201cMcDonald\u2019s iconic position and the fact that they\u2019re the largest single global purchaser of beef make it hugely important,\u201d said David Wallinga, a senior health adviser for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council.  McDonald\u2019s said it will measure the use of antibiotics in its 10 biggest markets, including the United States, and set targets to curb their use by the end of 2020. The markets cover 85 percent of the company\u2019s global beef supply chain.  Under the McDonald\u2019s policy, medically important antibiotics cannot be used to routinely prevent disease in food animals in the supply chain.  The company does not expect the policy to raise hamburger prices, although franchisees set their own menu prices, spokeswoman Lauren Altmin said.  Franchisees operate about 90 percent of McDonald\u2019s restaurants.  The Animal Health Institute, which represents pharmaceutical companies, said it supported \u201cjudicious\u201d use of antibiotics and that drug makers are developing alternatives.  Merck did not respond to a request for comment.  Elanco said a small portion of its portfolio includes medically important feed-grade antibiotics. The drugs are used to treat conditions such as liver abscesses and respiratory diseases, for which there are not effective alternatives, spokeswoman Colleen Parr Dekker said  \u201cIt is important to ensure that policies do not move faster than science,\u201d she said.  Bob Smith, an Oklahoma-based cattle veterinarian for Veterinary Research and Consulting Services, said farmers have worked to cut back on antibiotic use while keeping cattle healthy. The lack of alternatives limits their options, however, when animals fall ill, he said.  \u201cWe will need those medically important antibiotics in meat production for a long, long time,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe want to use those wisely.\u201d  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year said sales and distribution of medically important antibiotics for food production fell 14 percent from 2015 to 2016, the first decline in year-to-year sales since the agency began collecting the data in 2009. Chicken accounted for 6 percent of the sales, while swine and cattle came in at 37 percent and 43 percent, respectively.  Many restaurants and meat companies have moved away from using antibiotics in chicken production in recent years, in part because McDonald\u2019s did so. The Chicago-based chain has an outsize influence on farm practices due to its size.  Removing antibiotics from cattle is more difficult, experts said, because the animals live longer than chickens and have more chances to fall ill.  Hamburger chain Wendy\u2019s Co a year ago said it would buy about 15 percent of its beef beginning in 2018 from producers that have pledged to reduce by 20 percent their use of an antibiotic.  \u201cWhat McDonald\u2019s is doing will hopefully start to shift the industry all together from over-using antibiotics,\u201d said Matt Wellington, antibiotics program director for advocacy group U.S. PIRG.","5":"HONG KONG\/BEIJING\/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - CITIC Ltd 0267.HK, the main listed arm of Chinese state-owned conglomerate CITIC Group, plans to sell a 22% stake in McDonald's Corp's MCD.N mainland China and Hong Kong business, which is likely to be bought by the group's private equity arm.  FILE PHOTO: Customers eat dinner at a McDonald's store in Beijing, China January 9, 2017. REUTERS\/Jason Lee  The Hong Kong-listed company aims to raise at least 2.17 billion yuan ($312 million) through the sale, according to a company filing to the China Beijing Equity Exchange on Wednesday.  CITIC Capital, the group\u2019s flagship alternative investment arm which manages over $26 billion in assets, would likely become the buyer, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The sale is set to be finalised by early February, said one of the people who declined to be named as the information was private.  CITIC Ltd said the transaction is purely a \u201ccommercial decision\u201d and it will continue to work for the development of McDonald\u2019s business in China along with its partners. CITIC Capital said it is \u201cactively participating\u201d in the bidding process.  McDonald\u2019s said the transaction would not affect its business strategy and daily operations in mainland China and Hong Kong.  The deal comes months after CITIC Capital raised $2.8 billion in its fourth China buyout fund, the firm\u2019s biggest private equity fund to date, bolstering its ability to cut deals in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  CITIC Ltd is selling the 22% stake via Fast Food Holdings Ltd, a holding firm that it set up with CITIC Capital for the combined controlling stake of 52% in McDonald\u2019s China and Hong Kong business.  McDonald's Corp in early 2017 agreed to sell 80% of such business to CITIC Ltd 0267.HK, CITIC Capital and Carlyle Group LP CG.O for $2.08 billion, saying at the time that they hoped tying up with local partners could speed up growth in China.  CITIC Ltd held 32% of the business, with CITIC Capital and Carlyle holding 20% and 28%, respectively. McDonald\u2019s retained the remaining 20%, the companies said in a statement at the time.  After the stake sale, CITIC Ltd will retain 10% of the business.  In late 2017, the U.S. fast food giant changed its registered business name reut.rs\/37VX7rB to \"Golden Arches (China) Co Ltd\" in China and planned to nearly double the number of its outlets in mainland China to 4,500 by 2022.","6":"May 27 (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp:  * MCDONALD\u2019S UK SAYS ALL DRIVE-THRUS TO REOPEN BY 4TH JUNE - TWEET  * MCDONALD'S UK-924 DRIVE-THRU RESTAURANTS WILL REOPEN BETWEEN 2ND AND 4TH JUNE;ALSO ADDS 75 RESTAURANTS TO MCDELIVERY VIA EITHER UBER EATS OR JUST EAT Source text: bit.ly\/3euC1DX Further company coverage:","7":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Directors of U.S. companies are increasingly showing zero tolerance for executives' sexual relationships with employees, even consensual ones, an attitude shift evident in McDonald's Corp's MCD.N dismissal of CEO Steve Easterbrook this week.  FILE PHOTO: McDonald's employees take orders at the Union Square fast-food chain McDonald's in New York, U.S., October 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  Boards of directors in a different era turned a blind eye to executives\u2019 so-called \u201cskirt-chasing,\u201d corporate governance experts said. But now boards focus on the risks to the company from relationships between supervisors and employees, a view shaped in part by the fallout from sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, former CEO of The Weinstein Company, in 2017 that fueled the #MeToo movement.  \u201cThings people denied or swept under the carpet before, they no longer do,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a dean of leadership programs at the Yale School of Management. \u201cIt\u2019s being reported more, and boards of directors are acting on the reports.\u201d  Easterbrook, who reported to McDonald's board, had a recent consensual relationship with an employee of the burger chain, violating company policy. Last year, Brian Krzanich resigned as chief executive of technology company Intel Corp INTC.O after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee, breaking company rules.  Companies see relationships between supervisors and their reports as problematic because workers often feel they cannot turn down sexual advances from superiors without negative repercussions, corporate governance experts said.  \u201cIt\u2019s an imbalance in the power situation,\u201d said Mark Spund, head of the employment law practice at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP. \u201cFor most companies, it\u2019s a violation of their regulations, and most of the time it will lead to a termination of an executive.\u201d  More CEOs are being pushed out of their jobs for ethical lapses ranging from sexual indiscretions to fraud than in the past. Of those forced out of their jobs in 2018, 39% exited for ethical reasons, a greater number than for financial performance or board struggles, according to a study from a division of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.  In 2017, 26% of CEO exits were for ethical lapses, according to the study, while a decade prior it was 8%.  Earlier examples of corporate bosses leaving under ethical pressure include former Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N CEO Brian Dunn who resigned in 2012 following allegations of personal misconduct relating to a relationship with a female staffer, and Mark Hurd, who left HP Inc HPQ.N in 2010 amid sexual harassment allegations, though an internal probe later cleared him of the charges.  Corporate boards of directors are also more frequently discussing company-wide policies including rules that prohibit fraternization among employees, said Gillian Emmett Moldowan, an attorney at Shearman & Sterling LLP. In the past, boards were less likely to review broad-based policies implemented by human resources, she said.  Emmett Moldowan added that boards\u2019 compensation committees often look at these issues, but because of the reputation risks some pose to the company, the whole board will take them up.  \u2018TOXIC CULTURE\u2019  Some companies\u2019 policies will allow relationships between peers in different departments, Sonnenfeld said. But every other worker at the company would be off limits to Easterbrook as McDonald\u2019s CEO and the fast food chain\u2019s top employee, corporate governance experts said.  One unanswered question is whether Easterbrook\u2019s firing and the naming of Chris Kempczinski to replace him will impact low-level workers at the company\u2019s restaurants who have claimed they regularly face groping, lewd comments and sexual propositions.  Fight for $15, a group campaigning for higher minimum wages, said that more than 50 sexual harassment complaints have been made against McDonald\u2019s.  \u201cMcDonald\u2019s culture is toxic \u2013 all the way from top where CEO Steve Easterbrook had an inappropriate relationship with one of his staff, down to the bottom where managers mock, fire, or retaliate against victims of sexual harassment,\u201d the group said.  \u201cWith a new CEO, McDonald\u2019s has an opportunity to change their culture.\u201d","8":"June 7 (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp is planning a new round of layoffs to further shrink its corporate structure, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday citing an email the company sent to all its U.S. employees, suppliers and franchisees.

The exact terms of the settlement were not immediately clear.

Union-backed worker advocacy group Fight for $15 filed dozens of legal claims on behalf of McDonald\u2019s workers beginning in 2012. The group said workers across the United States were fired for taking part in protests calling for higher wages.  The judge had agreed in January to pause the trial against McDonald\u2019s that began in 2015 so that Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company.  Fight for $15 lawyer Micah Wissinger said the group would object to the proposed settlement.  \u201cIn a real settlement, McDonald\u2019s would take responsibility for illegally firing and harassing workers fighting to get off food stamps and out of poverty,\u201d he said.  The case was seen as an important test of how a 2015 NLRB decision that had rankled business groups by making it easier to prove that a company is a joint employer would apply to franchisees.  In December, a new Republican majority on the board overturned the 2015 decision and said only companies with direct control over workers may be considered joint employers.  Last month, the board said its December ruling was invalid because NLRB member William Emanuel, a Trump appointee, had a conflict of interest. Emanuel\u2019s former law firm represented a staffing agency involved in the 2015 NLRB case.","10":"(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp MCD.N said here on Thursday it would hire about 260,000 restaurant staff in the United States this summer, as stores reopen for diners after serving them through delivery, drive-thru and takeaway for weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Earlier this week, the burger chain said its U.S. sales fell in April and May due to the health crisis, but signaled a recovery in demand as it restarts dine-in.  Several U.S. states have lifted restrictions that were imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, drawing long queues outside stores.

MCD.N has filed a trademark infringement notice in Australia after the local unit of Burger King created a similar product called the \"Big Jack,\" according to a local newspaper report on Thursday.  Australian franchise Hungry Jack\u2019s released a double layer hamburger in July, similar in construction and appearance to the Big Mac, McDonald\u2019s alleges in documents filed with the Federal Court on Aug. 28, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported.

Hungry Jacks markets the burger online as comprising \u201ctwo flame-grilled 100% Aussie beef patties, topped with melted cheese, special sauce, fresh lettuce, pickles and onions on a toasted sesame seed bun\u201d.  The apparent similarities were picked up by plenty of social media users including one Twitter user named Gino, who tweeted \u201cBig Jack = Big Mac!

McDonald\u2019s is also seeking damages, interest and costs, as well as an order that Hungry Jack\u2019s destroy all \u201cpromotional materials,\u201d which include physical and electronic advertising, the paper reported.

The proposed class action led by James and Darrell Byrd, who are brothers with four McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Tennessee, was filed by the same law firm representing 52 Black former franchisees who filed a similar lawsuit on Aug. 31.  McDonald\u2019s was accused of placing Black franchisees in undesirable inner-city locations with high security and insurance costs and below-average sales, and driving many away by failing to support them as debts rise and profits fall short.  Jim Ferraro, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, estimated that McDonald\u2019s has 186 Black franchisees in the United States, down from a peak of 377 in 1998, who own \u201c700-plus\u201d stores.  The lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court seeks damages of $4 million to $5 million per store, potentially totaling more than $3 billion overall.  Chicago-based McDonald\u2019s has taken steps this year to address concerns about its workplace culture and treatment of franchisees, including by updating its corporate values for the first time since 2008.  It has denied treating Black franchisees differently and said it wants them to succeed, while acknowledging that it wants its franchisee ranks to become more diverse.  McDonald\u2019s has also denied racial discrimination claims in a separate lawsuit filed in January by two Black executives.  \u201cThey\u2019ve been on a massive PR campaign to clean up their image,\u201d Ferraro told reporters on a conference call. \u201cThis is actually a good thing, at some level, but not a good enough thing.\u201d  McDonald\u2019s sought last week to dismiss the lawsuit by the former franchisees, saying it disclosed the risks of owning stores and did not set anyone up for failure.

Chris Kempczinski, who was in charge of McDonald\u2019s operations in the United States, took over from Easterbrook on Sunday, following his dismissal over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which McDonald\u2019s board determined violated company policy.  Piper Jaffray & Co on Monday downgraded the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d, citing the likely disruption from a sudden change of this magnitude.  \u201cOur experience leads us to take a more cautionary view noting the potential lack of momentum and time involved in formalizing a new team,\u201d analyst Miller Regan said.  Kempczinski has inherited the top spot at the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain when its struggling to bring in more customers at its restaurants amid a shift to healthier food choices and delivery apps available at their finger tips.  McDonald\u2019s has spent billions to modernize stores, add digital kiosks and automate parts of the ordering process as part of its turnaround plan under Easterbrook, who took over as the CEO in 2015.  He was credited with franchising 95% of McDonald\u2019s U.S. fleet, launching the popular all-day breakfast, revamping restaurants to add digital ordering kiosks and making tech acquisitions to remodel stores.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The restaurant on Moscow\u2019 central Pushkin Square, was due on Friday to sell the Big Mac for just three roubles ($0.0474) instead of its usual price of 135 roubles, and expected to draw tens of thousands of people. But on Thursday it ditched the plan after Moscow authorities issued a city-wide warning against mass public events.  \"Yesterday the Moscow government announced precautionary measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus,\" McDonald's MCD.N said in a statement.  \u201c(It) recommended refraining from holding public events in the near future in places where citizens gather en masse in order to minimize risks of infection.\u201d  There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Russia.

Dollar Menu advertisements are seen outside a McDonald\u00d5s restaurant in Venice, California, April 29, 2018. REUTERS\/Lisa Baertlein  So-called \"value\" offers have been part of the U.S. fast-food landscape since 2002, when McDonald's Corp MCD.N debuted its popular Dollar Menu and gave the industry a reliable recipe for driving traffic.  McDonald's and other major chains deemphasized such deals in recent years, choosing instead to invest in food quality improvements to bolster competitiveness with more upscale brands like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N and Chick-fil-A.  Dollar deals roared back in the first three months of this year, when economists estimate consumer spending growth braked to below a 1.5 percent rate. That would be the slowest pace in nearly five years and follows the prior quarter\u2019s robust 4 percent growth rate.  Value menu traffic was up 10 percent for the first three months of 2018, while value menu sales chalked up a 13 percent gain, NPD Group analyst Bonnie Riggs told Reuters.  The results lifted value menu traffic 1 percent for the fiscal year ended March 2018, reversing three consecutive years of declines, according to NPD.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear that major restaurant chain operators are pulling out all of the stops to get consumers to visit this year,\u201d said Riggs, author of a new report titled \u201cValue Wars 2.0: The Value Menu Strikes Back.\u201d  Restaurants across the spectrum have been battling for a bigger slice of a pie that is not growing. Total U.S. restaurant traffic was flat in calendar 2017.  Yum Brand Inc's YUM.N Taco Bell, known for its low-priced food and \"Dollar Cravings\" value menu, appears to have an edge in the latest price war.  It sold a record 53 million orders of its new $1 Nacho Fries in five weeks during the first quarter, contributing to outsized value menu sales gains, NPD said.  Taco Bell declined comment, citing the quiet period ahead of Yum Brands\u2019 financial report on Wednesday.  McDonald\u2019s, seeking to win back customers lost after it abandoned its popular but profit-squeezing Dollar Menu in 2013, in January jumped back in with the launch of a $1, $2, $3 value menu.  That menu includes $1 any size soft drinks and cheeseburgers, $2 small espresso drinks and Bacon McDouble hamburgers, and $3 Happy Meals and classic chicken sandwiches.  Consumer response was initially muted, prompting some McDonald\u2019s restaurants to offer a 2 for $4 \u201cmix & match\u201d deal on breakfast sandwiches such as the sausage McMuffin with egg.  McDonald\u2019s, scheduled to report quarterly results on Monday, declined to comment.  Meanwhile, some McDonald\u2019s restaurant operators worry about getting lost in a blizzard of competing deals.  \u201cIn 2002 we were one of the few chains discounting ... Today we are just part of the discounting noise,\u201d one McDonald\u2019s restaurant operator was quoted as saying in the latest McDonald\u2019s Franchisee Survey from Kalinowski Equity Research.  The fast-food value wars are contributing to an increasingly challenging operating environment, Dunkin' Brands Group Inc DNKN.O CEO Nigel Travis told investors last week.  Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisees, who were slow to warm to value deals, this month are responding with offers for $2 egg and cheese Wake-up Wraps, $3 egg and cheese English muffin breakfast sandwiches and $5 egg, cheese and bacon breakfast croissants.  Some investors worry that the dollar deals - including the $1 any size drinks and $2 small McCafe drinks from McDonald's - are siphoning business from Starbucks Corp SBUX.O, which last week posted its second consecutive quarter with no U.S. traffic growth.

Companies selling burgers, chicken and milk products are trailing behind other high-emitting industries, like carmakers, in setting targets to clean up their supply chains and help meet the Paris Agreement to limit global warming, campaigners say.  More than 80 investors - members of Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR), a network educating investors - wrote to the fast food giants calling on them to publicly set and monitor targets on GHG emissions and freshwater impacts.  \u201cFast-food giants deliver speedy meals, but they have been super slow in responding to their out-sized environmental footprints,\u201d said Mindy Lubber, head of Ceres, which lobbies for greener business practices and is backing the initiative.

Yum Brands Inc - the owners of KFC - and Restaurant Brands International Inc - the owners of Burger King - did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The world\u2019s biggest burger chain confirmed to Reuters it plans to launch its crispy chicken sandwich in \u201cclassic\u201d, \u201cdeluxe\u201d and \u201cspicy\u201d versions on Feb. 24. All will contain a new crispy white meat chicken fillet served with crinkle-cut pickles on a toasted, buttered potato roll.  The new McDonald\u2019s strategy is founded in part on the long-term popularity of Chicken McNuggets, which it has sold since the 1980s, and 2020\u2019s limited time Spicy Chicken McNuggets, which contributed to September U.S. comparative sales that were the highest in nearly a decade.  \u201cAs commonplace as chicken is, it\u2019s a growth area. You want to participate in that growth,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski, an independent restaurant equities analyst.  But to really ruffle feathers in the market, McDonald\u2019s needs to overcome operational and structural hurdles, including a lack of pressure fryers, and prove wrong skeptics who doubt it can match sandwiches offered by pure poultry purveyors.  \u201cI would bet big time that McDonald\u2019s never competes in the chicken business,\u201d restaurant marketing consultant Chas Hermann said of the menu additions.  A social-media-fueled war between privately-owned Chick-fil-A and Popeyes raised the game for the fast-food industry after Popeyes launched its first-ever chicken sandwich in August 2019.  The Popeyes sandwich quickly sold out and drove sustained spikes in its comparable sales growth beginning that quarter, prompting other companies to try to follow its lead.  Chick-fil-A\u2019s growth in the South also pressured McDonald\u2019s franchisees there, who pushed for the new sandwiches.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThey\u2019ll definitely improve their chicken sandwich. It won\u2019t win awards. They will have some of the very best marketing around it,\u201d Hermann added of the McDonald\u2019s move.  At least two dozen restaurant chains launched new or improved chicken sandwiches in 2020 even as the coronavirus pandemic disrupted supplies, workers and operations, trade publication Nation\u2019s Restaurant News said.  If McDonald\u2019s crispy chicken is successful, an average location could sell as many as 150 sandwiches per day, said Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman.  By comparison, for a typical Burger King restaurant that 40 units of a new sandwich per day would be considered very successful, she said.  McDonald\u2019s also needs to keep costs low to appeal to existing customers and compete with $4 sandwiches from rivals.  CHICKEN PLATFORM  At its Investor Day on Nov. 9, McDonald\u2019s USA President Joe Erlinger said the sandwich was a \u201cjumping off point\u201d for an even broader \u201cchicken platform\u201d.  \u201cOur chicken-only competitors here and abroad have strong brand equity and credibility. Developing a reputation for great chicken represents one of our highest aspirations,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The existing McChicken sandwich could also see new flavors, marketing and promotions, Erlinger said.  McDonald\u2019s McNuggets, which are processed, battered, partly pre-cooked and frozen before shipping, are one thing. A fresh-tasting fillet to beat chains at their own game is another.  \u201cTrying to ensure large, thick pre-breaded chicken to 14,000 stores can be difficult,\u201d said former franchisee Jim Lewis.  McDonald\u2019s also lacks equipment used by poultry specialists - pressure cookers and hand-breading stations inside stores.  It is \u201cvery hard to do something with the equipment that they have and the complexity you have in the kitchen, it\u2019s very hard to manage that,\u201d Restaurant Brands\u2019 Chief Marketing Officer Fernando Machado said of McDonald\u2019s.  Popeyes\u2019 chicken is also marinated for 24 hours in the restaurant, he added.  \u201cIf it were easy to do, we could do it at Burger King,\u201d he said of Restaurant Brands\u2019 burger chain.  But McDonald\u2019s huge scale could help it.  There about 13,846 McDonald\u2019s restaurants in the United States \u2013 about as many as all the Chick-fil-A, Popeyes, Yum-owned KFC, Church\u2019s, Wingstop, Zaxby\u2019s, Bojangles and El Pollo Loco locations combined.  \u201cCustomers have to drive past two or three McDonald\u2019s to get to a (Chick-fil-A) or a Popeyes,\u201d said Richard Adams, a consultant to franchisees. \u201cThat\u2019s an opportunity to pull in those customers with a comparable product.\u201d","25":"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Struggling to curb the spread of the coronavirus while the rest of Australia has begun relaxing a two-month lockdown, Victoria state on Saturday reported 11 new cases, including some linked to known clusters at a meat factory and a McDonald\u2019s restaurant.

The changes announced Thursday come as the world\u2019s biggest fast-food chain for the first time established global limits for calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugar in Happy Meals, which consultants and franchisees say account for roughly 15 percent of sales in the United States.  By 2022, McDonald\u2019s aims to have at least half of the Happy Meals listed on its drive-thru, restaurant and digital menus around the world contain 600 calories or less, 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, 650 mg of sodium, and 10 percent of calories from added sugar.  The chain\u2019s U.S. restaurants will continue to offer Happy Meal cheeseburgers on request, which nudges diners to change behavior. When it did the same thing with Happy Meal sodas in 2013, some customers switched to water, milk or juice.  McDonald\u2019s said it will reduce calories and sodium from its six-piece chicken McNugget Mighty meal for older children by halving the french fry portion size.  The company also is adding bottled water to Happy Meal menu boards and offering chocolate milk on request as it is reformulated to reduce added sugars.  Currently, 28 percent of Happy Meal combinations offered on menu boards in 20 of McDonald\u2019s major markets meet the new criteria. In June 2018, McDonald\u2019s USA will hit the new calorie, sugar and fat goals and be 78 percent compliant on sodium.  As part of its continued partnership with the non-profit Alliance for Healthier Generation, McDonald\u2019s also is working on plans to incorporate more healthy Happy Meal options for entrees as well as fruit and vegetable sides. Among other things, restaurants in Italy offer a Happy Meal grilled chicken sandwich; pineapple spears are on the menu in Spain; and cooked corn is a vegetable option in China, Japan and Taiwan.  The company, which in the past has taken heat for using toys to promote its Happy Meals, plans to offer books as a year-round replacement option in 100 markets by the end of 2019 - up from 20 today.  McDonald\u2019s does not break out Happy Meal sales but said that family trips represent 30 percent of all visits to McDonald\u2019s around the world.","28":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is seen at a McDonald's restaurant in Queens, New York, U.S., March 17, 2020.

Starbucks for the first time in 2017 had more U.S. outlets than McDonald's Corp MCD.N.

McDonald\u2019s was accused of placing Black franchisees in undesirable inner-city locations with high security and insurance costs and below-average sales, and driving many away by failing to support them as debts rise and profits fall short.  Jim Ferraro, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, estimated that McDonald\u2019s has 186 Black franchisees in the United States, down from a peak of 377 in 1998, who own \u201c700-plus\u201d stores.  The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, where McDonald\u2019s is headquartered, seeks damages of $4 million to $5 million per store, potentially totaling more than $3 billion.

But till now it had relied on frozen French fries from the Netherlands and Poland as Russian spuds weren\u2019t quite right.  \u201cThere was no potato which would suit us in terms of quality - color, taste, size \u2013 these are all the details that are important for us,\u201d Khamzat Khasbulatov, chairman of McDonald\u2019s Russia, told Reuters.  The firm had worked on a project to use local potatoes in 2011 but the plan fell through when European financing was frozen in a row over Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The rouble has gyrated since then with oil price swings and due to Western sanctions.  \u201cThe ruble\u2019s volatility was one of the major components of our interest in localization,\u201d Khasbulatov said.  Now a new plant near Lipetsk, a city 450 km (280 miles) south of Moscow, using potatoes grown on local farms will supply frozen fries to the chain of 651 outlets across Russia under a long-term contract, raising the share of the chain\u2019s locally sourced products to 98 percent.

The factory has capacity to process 200,000 tonnes of potatoes a year, washing, cutting and freezing the vegetables.  The rouble has recovered some ground as the price of oil, a major revenue earner for Russia, has risen from a low in 2016.  Russia\u2019s response to Western sanctions included a 2014 ban on a range of Western food imports.  \u201cSanctions as well as counter sanctions not only affect our company but the whole industry and the economy,\u201d said Khasbulatov, whose firm has 50,000 Russian employees and more than 160 domestic suppliers.  \u201cBut in any case we continue our development, continue to build new restaurants and modernize existing ones,\u201d he said, adding that firm opened 41 restaurants in Russia in 2017.","43":"(Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp laid out new diversity initiatives for corporate leadership, franchisees and suppliers at its global convention on Wednesday.

The Chicago-based burger chain\u2019s biennial worldwide meeting was held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.  The revised values - which pertain to serving, inclusion, integrity, community and family - come after former Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook was ousted over an improper relationship. McDonald\u2019s values were last reworked in 2008, when James Skinner was chief executive.  A few months after Easterbrook\u2019s departure, the coronavirus pandemic broke out and McDonald\u2019s restaurants scrambled to secure supply chains and protective gear and shift operations to drive-thru and delivery.  McDonald\u2019s U.S. franchisees felt they were not getting enough financial support, and the feud broke out publicly.  Employees walked off the job over what they said was a lack of proper protection and adequate pay. Black franchisees were leaving because of a growing financial disparity between their stores and those of white owners, Business Insider reported.  Organizations large and small have been addressing racism internally after nationwide protests over the May killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police.

The pandemic prompted widespread changes in how restaurants conduct business, with many relying more on drive-thru, carry-out and delivery.

The guidelines here released by the world's biggest restaurant chain - which is also one of the biggest buyers of beef in the world - requires suppliers to begin phasing out the use of antibiotics defined by the World Health Organization as \"highest priority critically important antimicrobials\" (HPCIA) to human medicine.  It also urged suppliers to adopt a tiered approach to the use of antibiotics, encouraging them to use HPCIA drugs as the last resort.  McDonald\u2019s move to curb the use of antibiotics in beef could push other restaurant chains to follow suit.  Restaurant chains including Wendy\u2019s Co reduced the use of antibiotics in their chicken supply after McDonald\u2019s introduced similar policies last year.  McDonald\u2019s said on Tuesday it would work with producers in Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, UK, Canada, Brazil and the United States to establish pilot tests in order to begin the implementation of this new policy.

Sales at U.S. restaurants open for at least 13 months rose 4.8% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, below the 5.17% growth expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Globally, McDonald\u2019s reported better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 5.9%, driven by strong growth in markets such as the UK and France.  The company earned $2.11 per share. Analysts were expecting profit of $2.21.  Total revenue, including both U.S. and overseas operations, rose to $5.43 billion, slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations of $5.49 billion.","49":"(Adds details on Beyond Meat share rise)  SAN FRANCISCO\/NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a coveted deal to supply McDonald\u2019s Corp with plant-based burgers, telling Reuters it cannot produce enough of its imitation meat to partner with the world\u2019s No. 1 fast-food chain.  Its strategic reversal marks a new twist in the battle among imitation-meat makers, which hope to convince more restaurants to offer their patties. It is unclear how far the talks between Impossible Foods and McDonald\u2019s had progressed or why they fell apart. McDonald\u2019s declined to comment on the discussions.  Shares of Impossible rival Beyond Meat surged on Tuesday, closing 12.5% higher, after Reuters reported that Impossible was no longer in talks with McDonald\u2019s.  The stock had risen earlier in the day on Impossible\u2019s unveiling of its plant-based pork products at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday, spurring further optimism about the sector.  Referring to McDonald\u2019s, Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown told Reuters in an interview that \u201cit would be stupid for us to be vying for them right now ... Having more big customers right now doesn\u2019t do us any good until we scale up production.\u201d  Impossible Foods and its rivals are duking it out over partnerships with fast-food chains to cash in on the roughly $3,500 per person average that Americans spend each year on food away from home.  The privately held, Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods teamed up with Burger King last year to launch its soy-based Impossible Whopper in the United States. Impossible Foods is now working to more than double production instead of trying to win a deal the size of McDonald\u2019s, Brown said.  \u201cI wish we had vastly more capacity than we do right now because the demand is high,\u201d he said. Impossible Foods said it had previously met with McDonald\u2019s but declined to disclose details about when it decided it would be unable to support a potential deal.  In late September, McDonald\u2019s launched a 12-week test of a P.L.T. burger in Canada, using patties made by Beyond Meat. But McDonald\u2019s has yet to offer a plant-based burger as a regular feature on its menu at any of its roughly 14,000 U.S. outlets.  \u201cThe P.L.T. is a craveable plant-based burger with a patty recipe that is made by McDonald\u2019s, for McDonald\u2019s,\u201d the fast-food chain said in a statement. It declined to provide any specifics on the results of the Canada test.  Beyond Meat told Reuters that talks with McDonald\u2019s are going \u201cvery well\u201d and that its new and upcoming facilities around the world are guaranteed to help it keep up with demand - not just in the United States, but globally.  \u201cWe would have to work with them (McDonald\u2019s) on timing but, yes, we would be able to meet their demand globally,\u201d Beyond Meat\u2019s chief growth officer, Chuck Muth, said last month in an interview at the Los Angeles-based company\u2019s office.  CAPACITY ISSUES  Beyond Meat, which is valued at about $5 billion after its IPO in May, weathered supply issues in 2017 and 2018, when hamburger chain A&W Canada ran out of Beyond Burgers soon after launching nationwide. But Muth said recently announced facilities in Canada and the Netherlands would prevent future snafus.  Beyond Meat, whose products are made with pea protein, told Reuters in November that it aims to have production up and running in Asia by the end of next year.  \u201cBeyond Meat doesn\u2019t want to drop the ball while there is amazing awareness building in the market, and they need to balance that with not over-committing themselves,\u201d said Dan Altschuler Malek, managing partner at Beyond Meat investor Unovis Partners. \u201cThe industry will continue to talk about pressure on supply for years \u2013 not because output hasn\u2019t increased but because consumer demand continues to exceed expectations.\u201d  McDonald\u2019s typically works with multiple suppliers to provide components for major menu items like burgers and French fries. Other fast-food companies - including Yum! Brands\u2019 KFC and Dunkin Brands \u2013 have tested and rolled out plant-based versions of items on their menus, made by dominant suppliers Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods.  Impossible Foods declined to comment on when it believes it might have enough supply or manufacturing capacity to partner with McDonald\u2019s.  \u201cWhen we are ready to do it, we would certainly like them to be a customer,\u201d Impossible\u2019s CEO, Brown, said. \u201cRight now, if McDonald\u2019s said they wanted us to be in all the restaurants, we\u2019d have to say \u2018Sorry, we can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d  Impossible Foods has had capacity issues that have hurt customers in the past.

The company said that leadership of McDonald\u2019s franchisees, who own the vast majority of U.S. restaurants, backed the guidance and that a majority likely would adopt the plan.  Starbucks, the world\u2019s largest coffee chain, which owns almost all U.S. stores, said on Sunday it would also close outlets for at least two weeks in communities with high numbers of coronavirus cases, as well as malls and university campuses, and change to a \u201cto go\u201d model in the United States and Canada stores.

The decision by the European Commission came after a three-year long investigation, part of its crackdown on illegal sweetheart deals between EU governments and multinationals that has resulted in Apple AAPL.O, Starbucks SBUX.O and Fiat FCHA.MI paying billions of euros in back taxes.  The Commission said McDonald\u2019s tax deal was in line with national tax laws and the Luxembourg-U.S. double taxation treaty.  \u201cOur in-depth investigation has shown that the reason for double non-taxation in this case is a mismatch between Luxembourg and U.S. tax laws, and not a special treatment by Luxembourg. Therefore, Luxembourg did not break EU state aid rules,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said.  \u201cOf course, the fact remains that McDonald\u2019s did not pay any taxes on these profits \u2013 and this is not how it should be from a tax fairness point of view,\u201d she said.  The investigation had focused on McDonald\u2019s Luxembourg-based subsidiary Europe Franchising which receives royalties from franchisees in Europe, Ukraine and Russia.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Luxembourg in a 2009 tax ruling said the company did not have to pay corporate taxes as its profits would be taxed in the United States. In a second tax ruling, the Grand Duchy said that the company was no longer required to prove that its royalty income was subject to U.S. taxation.  \u201cHAPPY MEAL\u201d  The Commission said 70 companies benefited from the bilateral tax treaty but were not being investigated. In June this year, Luxembourg presented draft legislation to avoid double non-taxation.  Luxembourg said in a statement that it welcomed the Commission's recognition of the steps it had taken to avoid similar cases in future. It had been ordered to claw back millions from Engie ENGIE.PA, Amazon AMZN.O and Fiat FCHA.MI in the last three years.  \u201cWe pay the taxes that are owed and, from 2013-2017, McDonald\u2019s companies paid more than $3 billion just in corporate income taxes in the European Union with an average tax rate approaching 29 percent,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said. \u201cWe will continue to invest in Europe and expect to create 50,000 new jobs over the next four years.\u201d  Sven Giegold, a Greens lawmaker at the European Parliament who has been pushing for more action to tackle tax loopholes, criticized the EU decision.  \u201cLuxembourg and other EU countries are serving McDonald\u00b4s a happy meal with tax loopholes, and taxpayers must pay the bill,\u201d said Giegold.  The ruling is a recognition by enforcers that they cannot make unlimited use of their state aid powers on taxation issues, said Natura Gracia, a partner at law firm Linklaters.  \u201cThis is a welcome development given the wider context of other state aid investigations into tax rulings and will give some comfort to companies which have obtained similar tax rulings in Luxembourg or elsewhere in the EU,\u201d she said.","54":"Sept 26 (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp will test a new plant-based burger using Beyond Meat\u2019s patties in 28 restaurants in Southwestern Ontario starting Monday, it said on Thursday, ending speculation about which plant-based burger company the U.S. chain would partner with.

The company said in a statement that it takes the accusations seriously and that the franchisees who operate some 90 percent its roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants \u201cwill do the same.\u201d  Fight for $15 and TIME\u2019S UP are pressing the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain to establish and train employees on a zero-tolerance sexual harassment policy and to create a safe and effective process for receiving and responding to complaints.  If an EEOC review of the cases finds they have merit, the agency would call on the company to engage in informal settlement talks. If that failed, EEOC could sue the company or issue the workers \u201cright to sue\u201d letters.  The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld employers\u2019 ability to block workers who signed arbitration agreements from filing class-action lawsuits. Sexual harassment cases are usually not class actions because of the unique facts in each case. If the workers signed arbitration agreements, that could keep individual claims out of court.  Attorneys told reporters on the conference call that they were investigating whether the women had signed arbitration agreements. They said workers in prior cases had not.  The women could find it difficult to hold McDonald\u2019s responsible for the actions of its franchisees.  In two earlier labor law cases, federal judges in California have said that McDonald\u2019s does not exercise enough control over franchise workers to be considered a joint employer.  Also, McDonald\u2019s in April proposed settling a National Labor Relations Board case that allows it to avoid a joint employer ruling without paying any money to franchise workers who claimed they were fired, suspended or had their hours cut for participating in Fight for $15 protests calling for higher wages.","64":"(Reuters) - Beyond Meat BYND.O posted a surprise quarterly loss and lower-than-expected sales on Monday, hurt by weaker demand for its plant-based meat at restaurants and retail stores after a surge at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Shares slumped 29% as sales grew at its slowest pace since the company went public in May 2019. They had closed down 4%, partly due to McDonald's Corp's MCD.N decision to launch a new line of plant-based meat option called \"McPlant\", which was seen as the chain developing its own line of faux meat.  Several reports called the move by the world\u2019s biggest burger chain earlier in the day as the end to Beyond Meat\u2019s partnership with the company, but Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown said that was \u201cgreatly exaggerated\u201d.  \u201cOur relationship with McDonald\u2019s is good. It\u2019s really strong. Our work there on behalf of what they\u2019re doing continues,\u201d he said. McDonald\u2019s, however, declined to comment on its suppliers.  Beyond Meat also said it had co-created the plant-based patty for McPlant after working to develop a so-called \u201cPLT\u201d burger, which was tested in Canada earlier this year.  Brown said Beyond Meat would sell its burgers at 7,000 locations of pharmacy healthcare company CVS Health Corp CVS.N in the United States as more people buy groceries there. The company will also sell its Beyond Meatballs at 5,000 CVS pharmacy stores.  SLOWEST QUARTER  After a nearly 200% rise in retail sales in the last quarter, growth eased to 40.5% in the third quarter, as consumers who had stocked up their freezers with Beyond Meats sausages, burgers and meatballs at the start of the pandemic, slowed purchases.  The company was also hit by a sharp drop in sales at locations such as academic institutions and offices due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as delays in launches with some of its quick service restaurant partners.  U.S. restaurant sales fell 11.1% in the quarter, while Beyond spent more than expected to deal with the fallout of weak demand from restaurants.  Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 28 cents per share compared with analysts\u2019 expectations of a 5 cent profit.  Net sales rose 2.7% to $94.4 million (\u00a371.83 million), but widely missed the $132.81 million estimate.  The company decided to keep its outlook suspended, saying it was unable to predict the impact of COVID-19 on its business for the rest of the year.","65":"(Adds context on labor law case)  March 19 (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp on Monday said it had agreed to settle a U.S. labor board case on whether the company is accountable for its franchisees\u2019 alleged labor law violations, according to a source involved in the case.  The settlement, which must be approved by a National Labor Relations Board judge, would allow McDonald\u2019s to avoid a ruling that it is a so-called \u201cjoint employer\u201d of workers at McDonald\u2019s franchises and can be held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law.  The terms of the proposed settlement were not immediately available.  McDonald\u2019s could not immediately be reached for comment on the proposed settlement.  Business groups have said that a ruling against McDonald\u2019s could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers.  Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s and the office of NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb presented the settlement to an administrative judge at a hearing in New York City, according to the source who was briefed on the hearing and spoke on condition of anonymity.  Union-backed worker advocacy group Fight for $15 said McDonald\u2019s workers across the United States were fired for taking part in protests calling for higher wages.  The judge in January had agreed to pause the trial against McDonald\u2019s that began in 2015 so Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company.

The judgment, provided to Reuters by Supermac\u2019s, revoked McDonald\u2019s registration of the trademark, saying that the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain had not proven genuine use of it over the five years prior to the case being lodged in 2017.  The Spain-based EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) did not respond to phone calls and emails requesting comment.  McDonald\u2019s was not immediately available to comment on the decision, which the company can still appeal.  The ruling allows other companies as well as McDonald\u2019s to use the \u201cBig Mac\u201d name in the EU.  Supermac\u2019s said it can now expand in the United Kingdom and Europe. It said it had never had a product called \u201cBig Mac\u201d but that McDonald\u2019s had used the similarity of the two names to block the Irish chain\u2019s expansion.  \u201cSupermac\u2019s are delighted with their victory in the trademark application and in revoking the Big Mac trademark which had been in existence since 1996,\u201d founder Pat McDonagh told Reuters in an email.

The EUIPO said the affidavits from McDonald\u2019s needed to be supported by other types of evidence, and that the websites and other promotional materials did not provide that support.

It is the latest twist in the battle of imitation-meat makers hoping to convince more restaurants to offer their patties. But it was unclear how far talks had progressed with McDonald\u2019s, which declined to comment on the discussions.  Shares of Impossible rival Beyond Meat BYND.O surged on Tuesday, closing 12.5% higher, after Reuters reported that Impossible was no longer in talks with McDonald's.  The stock had risen earlier in the day on Impossible\u2019s unveiling of its plant-based pork products at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday, spurring further optimism about the sector.  Referring to McDonald\u2019s, Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown told Reuters in an interview that \u201cit would be stupid for us to be vying for them right now ... Having more big customers right now doesn\u2019t do us any good until we scale up production.\u201d  Impossible Foods and its rivals are duking it out over partnerships with fast-food chains to cash in on the roughly $3,500 per person average that Americans spend each year on food away from home.  The privately held, Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods teamed up with Burger King last year to launch its soy-based Impossible Whopper in the United States. Impossible Foods is now working to more than double production instead of trying to win a deal the size of McDonald\u2019s, Brown said.  \u201cI wish we had vastly more capacity than we do right now because the demand is high,\u201d he said. Impossible Foods said it had previously met with McDonald\u2019s but declined to disclose details about when it decided it would be unable to support a potential deal.  In late September, McDonald\u2019s launched a 12-week test of a P.L.T. burger in Canada, using patties made by Beyond Meat. But McDonald\u2019s has yet to offer a plant-based burger as a regular feature on its menu at any of its roughly 14,000 U.S. outlets.  \u201cThe P.L.T. is a craveable plant-based burger with a patty recipe that is made by McDonald\u2019s, for McDonald\u2019s,\u201d the fast-food chain said in a statement. It declined to provide any specifics on the results of the Canada test.  Beyond Meat told Reuters that talks with McDonald\u2019s are going \u201cvery well\u201d and that its new and upcoming facilities around the world are guaranteed to help it keep up with demand - not just in the United States, but globally.  \u201cWe would have to work with them (McDonald\u2019s) on timing but, yes, we would be able to meet their demand globally,\u201d Beyond Meat\u2019s chief growth officer, Chuck Muth, said last month in an interview at the Los Angeles-based company\u2019s office.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  CAPACITY ISSUES  Beyond Meat, which is valued at about $5 billion after its IPO in May, weathered supply issues in 2017 and 2018, when hamburger chain A&W Canada ran out of Beyond Burgers soon after launching nationwide. But Muth said recently announced facilities in Canada and the Netherlands would prevent future snafus.  Beyond Meat, whose products are made with pea protein, told Reuters in November that it aims to have production up and running in Asia by the end of next year.  \u201cBeyond Meat doesn\u2019t want to drop the ball while there is amazing awareness building in the market, and they need to balance that with not over-committing themselves,\u201d said Dan Altschuler Malek, managing partner at Beyond Meat investor Unovis Partners. \u201cThe industry will continue to talk about pressure on supply for years \u2013 not because output hasn\u2019t increased but because consumer demand continues to exceed expectations.\u201d  Slideshow ( 7 images )  McDonald's typically works with multiple suppliers to provide components for major menu items like burgers and French fries. Other fast-food companies - including Yum! Brands\u2019 YUM.N KFC and Dunkin Brands \u2013 have tested and rolled out plant-based versions of items on their menus, made by dominant suppliers Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods.  Impossible Foods declined to comment on when it believes it might have enough supply or manufacturing capacity to partner with McDonald\u2019s.  \u201cWhen we are ready to do it, we would certainly like them to be a customer,\u201d Impossible\u2019s CEO, Brown, said. \u201cRight now, if McDonald\u2019s said they wanted us to be in all the restaurants, we\u2019d have to say \u2018Sorry, we can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d  Impossible Foods has had capacity issues that have hurt customers in the past. In June, hamburger chain White Castle suffered a month-long shortage of Impossible Slider patties, for instance.","71":"(Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp is selling only 20-30 plant-based Beyond Meat burgers per day in Canadian restaurant testing, although sales are reaching 100 burgers a day in more densely populated areas in the country, industry checks by UBS showed.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of a McDonald's Corp restaurant is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 24, 2017. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  In its detailed checks on the tests, which are the first to be made public, the Swiss investment bank said the numbers implied the world\u2019s biggest fast-food chain could eventually sell more than 250 million P.L.T. burgers annually if it rolled out the product across its nearly 14,000 U.S. outlets.  That would add up to $325 million in sales annually for Beyond Meat from the partnership, UBS said, although it cautioned that McDonald\u2019s traditionally sources each of its burger patties from more than one supplier.  \u201cWe believe Beyond Meat has a first-mover advantage - for now - but it appears a door remains open for McDonald\u2019s to refine its P.L.T. offering before introducing a plant based patty in the United States,\u201d analyst Steven Strycula wrote.  \u201cFurther, we do not know whether MCD plans to single-source or multi-source a U.S. menu item.\u201d  McDonald\u2019s in September became one of the last big fast-food chains to begin tryouts of a plant-based sandwich, launching tests at 28 restaurants in southwestern Ontario.  Analysts and industry consultants, however, have raised questions as to whether the popularity of the plant-based meat burgers is sustainable and whether sales will reach commercially viable levels needed to stay on the menu.  Some estimate a McDonald\u2019s franchise would need to sell 300-400 of the burgers a week for it to be viable. The company has given no indication of its attitude to a national launch or how the tests are going.  Separate checks by UBS with Burger King restaurant owners in 350 locations showed the rival chain is selling about 40 Impossible Whoppers, made by Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods, daily, or about 107 million a year if replicated by its whole U.S. network.  UBS said the same Burger King restaurants were selling about 230 of the chain\u2019s signature beef Whopper burgers a day and that those sales had not fallen as a result of the introduction of the plant-based meat alternative.  For Impossible Foods, the Burger King tie-up could fetch about $135 million in annual sales, the bank calculated.","72":"(Reuters) - Slumping sales at big fast food chains could get a boost as hungry and restless customers spend stimulus checks after long lockdowns, analysts and some operators said ahead of quarterly earnings that will show the extent of damage from the coronavirus slowdown.

Tired of eating at home for weeks, consumers may also seek someone else\u2019s cooking, and restaurants are trying new ways of operating including continued use of masks and social distancing alongside plexiglass dividers at checkout.  \u201cSales trends have appeared to bottom, with restaurants suggesting benefits from a reduction in pantry loading, stimulus checks and home cooking fatigue have supported improving trends throughout April,\u201d wrote Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman in a note.  Stay-at-home orders from local governments and mandated closures have hurt big chains, though not as much as independently owned sit-down restaurants without drive-thrus or take-away.

Broadly, breakfast and late night sales suffered, said Peter Saleh, restaurants analyst at BTIG.  Nobody knows how many consumers will return and how quickly, he said.  Brands with widely used, easy to operate apps - including the ability to order and pay in advance for pick up - may fare better, as results for Chipotle Mexican Grill and Domino\u2019s Pizza showed last week.  \u201cThat is critical.

Euribor, the euro interbank offered rate, and Libor, the London interbank offered rate, determine the rates on around $450 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide.  Rates such as Euribor are submitted by major banks each day and were designed to reflect their estimated cost of borrowing in different currencies over various time frames.

Breakfast has been an important sales driver for fast-food chains and as more rivals like Wendy's WEN.O and Dunkin' DNKN.O move into the space with new products, the pressure to retain customers has become more intense.  Earlier this month, McDonald's expanded its Beyond Meat BYND.O vegan burger trials in Canada, catering to the growing demand for plant-based proteins in fast-food restaurants.

FILE PHOTO: The McDonald's company logo stands on a sign outside a restaurant in Bretigny-sur-Orge, near Paris, France, July 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier  McDonald\u2019s three new sandwiches \u2013 all with a larger fillet and new potato bun \u2013 will start at $3.49 and top out at roughly $4.69, depending on the region, according to a U.S. franchisee who spoke on the condition of anonymity and a Credit Suisse analyst.  Soon to disappear from the menu: the more expensive Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which usually costs around $5.  McDonald\u2019s menu swap follows several years of declining customer traffic at its U.S. locations. The last year in which guest visits rose was 2017, when they increased by 1%, according to annual financial filings.  The pricing strategies illustrate how the world\u2019s biggest restaurant brand stands to make more money selling higher quantities of a cheaper product than lower quantities of a more expensive one.  That scheme has long helped McDonald\u2019s beat competitors and is especially relevant as millions of Americans remain out of work because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Amid a consumer frenzy for chicken, McDonald\u2019s forthcoming sandwiches represent one of its most significant menu changes since it switched the Quarter Pounder to fresh beef in 2018.  The company has said the sandwiches are precursors to even more new chicken items as McDonald\u2019s looks to regain customers who flipped to Popeyes, a unit of Restaurant Brands International Inc , and Chick-fil-A. Both rivals charge about $3.99 for their fried chicken sandwiches.  Kentucky Fried Chicken will switch to a new chicken sandwich nationally by the end of February.  McDonald\u2019s suggested price is a \u201cvery solid defensive play,\u201d especially for a low-priced brand, said restaurant marketing consultant Chas Hermann.  McDonald\u2019s \u201ccan\u2019t go out at $3.99 and think they\u2019re going to move anybody back\u201d to their restaurants, he said.  If successful, the new sandwiches could help boost sales at an average location by as much as 4.2%, according to Credit Suisse analyst Lauren Silberman.  An average McDonald\u2019s location is currently selling about 50 Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwiches per day, she said.  But McDonald\u2019s stores are expected to sell between 100 and 150 of the new sandwiches daily, or even more, according to Silberman and the franchisee.  The company said pricing will differ by region and location and is influenced by various market conditions.  Many McDonald\u2019s franchisees turn to consulting firm Deloitte for advice on how to set optimal pricing.  For example, the franchisee told Reuters that Deloitte recommended a price of $3.69 for the spicy and crispy versions and $4.29 for the deluxe. But the person, who declined to be named, said they will mark up the menu price because of higher minimum wages in the area, and that they plan to charge $3.99 and $4.69 instead.  As prices rise, customer visits sometimes fall.  Customer checks at fast-food restaurants rose more than 3% year over year in 2018 and 2019, then shot up 10.5% in 2020, in part because the pandemic prompted people to place larger family-sized orders. The data, from Black Box Intelligence, does not show how much of the increase is from larger order sizes versus higher prices.","79":"(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp MCD.N global comparable sales tumbled 22.2% in March and the burger chain pulled its full-year forecast as coronavirus-related lockdowns forced it to shutter stores and stick to delivery or take-out.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  The company, one of the first major quick-service chains to provide a glimpse into the economic impact of the health crisis, said on Wednesday it had raised $6.5 billion in the quarter and suspended share buybacks to bolster its cash reserves.  It provided the update, including quarterly sales results, ahead of its planned earnings announcement on April 30.  In March in the United States, when COVID-19 cases began to skyrocket, McDonald\u2019s sales fell 13.4% as authorities asked people to stay home and required dining rooms to shutter to curtail the spread of the virus.  It has now infected more than 1.3 million and killed over 81,000 globally.  About 75% of McDonald\u2019s 38,000 restaurants around the world were operational during the quarter, the majority of which adapted to focus on drive-thru, delivery or take-away, Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said.  \u201cThis unprecedented situation is changing the world we live in, and we will need to adapt to a new reality in its aftermath,\u201d Kempczinski said in a statement.  The steep drop in March led to a 3.4% fall in comparable sales for the three months ended March 31 globally, compared with the 0.91% drop analysts on average had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  However, a few of the brokers surveyed by Refinitiv had not updated their estimates to include the impact of the coronavirus in the consensus.  Still, Wall Street analysts said strong sales at the start of the quarter, when global same-store sales rose 7.2%, could mean the company may soon recover.  \u201cThe business update implies McDonald\u2019s is well-positioned for an eventual recovery following Jan\/Feb momentum,\u201d said BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik.  McDonald\u2019s said it would defer rent and royalties for its franchisees, who are already facing difficulties due to the outbreak and are burdened with other expenses like restaurant renovations as a part of the company\u2019s push to modernize stores.  The company said it expects to reduce capital expenditures by about $1 billion for 2020 due to fewer store renovations in the United States and fewer restaurant openings around the world.  McDonald\u2019s said the cancellation of its Worldwide Owner\/Operator Convention due to the health crisis could cost about $40 million due to refunds.  The Chicago-based company\u2019s shares closed nearly 2% higher amid a bounce in the broader market.","80":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a part of a push to increase the minimum wage for American workers, Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator and Democratic presidential candidate, on Thursday waded into a dispute between McDonald\u2019s Corp and its employees.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Sanders, one of the two dozen Democrats running for the Democratic presidential nomination, held a virtual town hall, taking questions from McDonald\u2019s workers in Dallas who protested the company\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.  \u201cYou guys are being exploited,\u201d Sanders, speaking from Washington, told the workers.  McDonald\u2019s is under fire from activist groups for failing to protect workers from sexual harassment and violence. Employees at the company are also demanding higher pay, and are backed by a labor organizing group, Fight for $15, which is pushing 2020 presidential candidates to support a $15 national minimum wage and advocate for union rights.  As of Thursday morning, hundreds of McDonalds workers had walked off the job, according to the group.  Other 2020 Democrats have gotten involved. On Thursday, Julian Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, appeared with striking McDonald\u2019s workers in North Carolina.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Washington state Governor Jay Inslee were scheduled to stand with workers later in the day in Des Moines and Chicago, respectively.  Sanders has made workers\u2019 rights and raising the minimum wage centerpieces of his presidential campaign.  \u201cIf elected president, trust me, every worker in this country will make at least $15 an hour, and people will have the right to join unions,\u201d said Sanders. He added that he would be part of an effort to pressure the fast-food industry to raise wages.  The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.  Chicago-based McDonald\u2019s said it has more than 14,000 locations in the United States with some 850,000 workers.  Since more than 90 percent of its restaurants are franchised, the company has maintained, it cannot set wage rates, bargain collectively with unions or be responsible for the behavior of employees in its franchises.  On Tuesday, more than two dozen McDonald\u2019s workers across the country represented by Fight for $15 filed complaints of sexually harassment by coworkers or managers. Five of the workers filed lawsuits and the others lodged complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or with state agencies.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the candidates\u2019 actions or the labor protests generally.","81":"March 19 (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp on Monday said it had agreed to settle a U.S. labor board case on whether the company is accountable for its franchisees\u2019 alleged labor law violations, according to a source involved in the case.  The settlement, which must be approved by a National Labor Relations Board judge, would allow McDonald\u2019s to avoid a ruling that it is a so-called \u201cjoint employer\u201d of workers at McDonald\u2019s franchises and can be held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law.  The terms of the proposed settlement were not immediately available.  McDonald\u2019s could not immediately be reached for comment on the proposed settlement. The company has maintained that it is not a joint employer of franchise workers.  Business groups have said that a ruling against McDonald\u2019s could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers.  Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s and the office of NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb presented the settlement to an administrative judge at a hearing in New York City, according to the source who was briefed on the hearing and spoke on condition of anonymity.  Union-backed worker advocacy group Fight for $15 filed dozens of legal claims on behalf of McDonald\u2019s workers beginning in 2012. The group said workers across the United States were fired for taking part in protests calling for higher wages.  The judge in January had agreed to pause the trial against McDonald\u2019s that began in 2015 so Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company.  Fight for $15 lawyer Micah Wissinger said the group would object to the proposed settlement. He said Robb\u2019s office in recent weeks had improperly reached out to individual workers to discuss settlements instead of involving lawyers at Fight for $15 who are representing them.  The case was seen as an important test of how a 2015 NLRB decision that had rankled business groups by making it easier to prove that a company is a joint employer would apply to franchisees.  In December, a new Republican majority on the board overturned the 2015 decision and said only companies with direct control over workers may be considered joint employers.  Last month, the board said its December ruling was invalid because NLRB Member William Emanuel, a Trump appointee, had a conflict of interest. Emanuel\u2019s former law firm represented a staffing agency involved in the 2015 NLRB case.

FILE PHOTO: The McDonald's logo is seen outside the fast-food chain McDonald's in New York, U.S., October 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  The lawsuit, filed on Friday in federal court in Chicago, says the company fostered a climate of \u201csevere or pervasive sexual harassment and a hostile work environment, including groping, physical assaults, and sexually-charged verbal comments.\u201d  McDonald\u2019s said in a statement that it was committed to ensuring workers were not subject to sexual harassment.  \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of harassment and retaliation were investigated as soon as they were brought to our attention, and we will likewise investigate the new allegations that they have raised in their complaint,\u201d it said.  The plaintiffs, McDonald\u2019s employee Jamelia Fairley and former employee Ashley Reddick, are seeking to represent a class of female employees of Florida\u2019s more than 100 corporate-owned, non-franchise McDonald\u2019s locations. They are asking for $500 million in compensatory damages and additional punitive damages.  Fairley and Reddick said in their complaint that McDonald\u2019s failed to provide training to prevent sexual harassment and shuffled serial harassers from one location to another without consequence.  \u201cMcDonald\u2019s strategy in Florida appears to be: deny, ignore, and punish anyone who complains too loudly, and at times, move harassers from one restaurant to another restaurant, where they have access to and can further harass more women,\u201d they said.  Reddick worked at a Sanford, Florida, McDonald\u2019s restaurant from 2015 until 2018, when she was fired for reporting unwanted sexual comments and touching by a male coworker, the complaint said. Fairley was harassed by two male coworkers while working at the same store, beginning in 2018, according to the complaint.  Management knew of the harassment of both women but failed to take appropriate action, the lawsuit said.  Sexual harassment allegations have plagued McDonald\u2019s since 2016, when it first faced a wave of complaints filed with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission.  McDonald\u2019s also faces another class action in Michigan, as well as individual lawsuits.  About 95% of McDonald\u2019s U.S. restaurants are run by franchisees rather than by McDonald\u2019s itself. The company has argued that it cannot be held responsible for harassment in its franchise restaurants, and a federal appeals court in California agreed with that view last year.  Friday\u2019s lawsuit, however, concerns only corporate-owned stores.  Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook was fired last November for having an improper consensual relationship with an employee, though he was not accused of harassment.","83":"FILE PHOTO: Steve Easterbrook, CEO of McDonald's Corp., attends the annual Allen and Co.

Analysts, rival fast food companies and plant-based protein producers have been closely watching McDonald\u2019s plans as it is one of the few national chains yet to sell plant-based meat burgers on a permanent basis.  While other chains have started offering plant-based meat options, including Restaurant Brands International Inc\u2019s Burger King, White Castle and Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc , a McDonald\u2019s contract could be the biggest and would put the plant-based meat movement front and center in mainstream America.

The burger chain has not trained or given any guidelines on the epidemic, McDonald's cooks and cashiers associated with labor group Fight for $15 and a Union said in an email statement here.  Maurilia Arellanes, a McDonald\u2019s worker in California, said on a media call organized by the labor group that she cannot afford to take a day off if she is sick.  \u201cMcDonald\u2019s needs to step up and do everything it can to make sure workers like me are safe and that if we do get sick, we can take time off to get better without falling behind on our bills,\u201d she said.  The labor group asked the company to pay workers for any missed shifts if a McDonald\u2019s restaurant shuts down due to the spread of COVID-19.  McDonald\u2019s hourly worker wage varies from $7.25 to $15 based on the state. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Restaurant workers have for long complained about poor pay and working conditions, drawing support from politicians and Fight for $15, which has regularly targeted McDonald\u2019s calling for higher pay and union rights for workers.  Their demands come close on the heels of Darden Restaurants , the owner of Olive Garden and Bahama Breeze chains, saying it would provide its hourly workers paid sick leaves starting Tuesday.

Shares of the Chicago-based burger chain sank more than 2.5%.  Global same-store sales fell 23.9% in the second quarter, dragged down by big international markets including the United Kingdom, France and Latin America.  Analysts had forecast a 23.24% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  In the United States, where the company operates more than a third of its restaurants, same-restaurant sales fell 8.7% but were better than the anticipated 9.97% fall, as most locations were able to stay open with drive-thru and delivery options.  On a conference call with investors, executives struck a cautious tone but noted that U.S. July sales have improved and should end \u201cslightly positive\u201d for the full month.  The second quarter \u201crepresents the trough in our performance as McDonald\u2019s has learned to adjust our operations to this new environment,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said.  FILE PHOTO: A sign is seen at a McDonald's restaurant in Queens, New York, U.S., March 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly  Restaurants struggled to cope with the changing dynamics and consumer behaviors around the health crisis, forcing them to simplify menus and shift largely to online and mobile orders for pickup, delivery and drive-thru.  As lockdowns eased, sales improved and losses were not as bad, providing some optimism for a measured rebound.  About 96% of McDonald\u2019s locations are operating with drive-thru, delivery or reduced seating capacity.  The company plans an advertising push in the second half of the year, having \u201camassed a sizeable marketing war chest,\u201d Kempczinski said.  The burger chain had cut 70% spending on U.S. marketing in the second quarter to \u201cconserve resources\u201d but will now reinvest that money.  Most of that will promote core menu items and digital ordering, though some menu innovation is planned.  The company also expects to collect during the second half of the year the majority of rent it had deferred from franchisees.  McDonald\u2019s also sees a chance to grow in Europe, where \u201csome independent restaurant units ... are having some bigger challenges, which may present some further opportunities for us.\u201d  In Japan, the firm said it planned to gradually reduce its stake in McDonald\u2019s Holding Company Japan from around 49% now, retaining at least 35%.  Revenue fell 30.5% to $3.76 billion, but beat the estimate of $3.68 billion.  Net income slumped 68% to $483.8 million. Excluding one-time items, McDonald\u2019s earned 66 cents per share, 8 cents below expectations.","99":"(Adds company\u2019s suggestion that franchisees provide \u201chero pay\u201d and temperature scans, and response)  NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp rejected a request from its U.S. franchisees to delay collecting some March rent and royalty payments, prompting claims that the world\u2019s largest fast-food company is not providing enough support during the coronavirus crisis, according to several letters seen by Reuters.  Franchisees that lead negotiations with the company asked McDonald\u2019s for a blanket 14-day reprieve in their March rent during weeks of negotiations over financial help. But on April 3, that request was denied, according to a letter from the franchisee leadership.  The correspondence provides a snapshot of growing internal tensions between McDonald\u2019s executives and franchisee organizations amid an unprecedented global health crisis.  \u201cBecause so many owners are alarmed over their financial viability and have been waiting for clarity on a positive, tangible company decision, many believe the trust in the relationship has plummeted,\u201d the National Owners Association of franchisees wrote to McDonald\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and McDonald\u2019s USA head Joe Erlinger, on April 7.  Franchisees\u2019 faith in management \u201cseems predicated on unlimited financial support,\u201d Erlinger wrote back two days later. \u201cIf that\u2019s how the NOA seeks to define its relationship with McDonald\u2019s, then in reality, we don\u2019t have a relationship, and I am extremely disappointed and disheartened by this.\u201d  The National Owners Association represents at least 75% of McDonald\u2019s more than 1,600 franchisees, which own and operate 95% of the fast-food chain\u2019s nearly 14,000 U.S. restaurants. While a few franchisees own scores of stores, many have only a few.  A separate group of franchisees works officially with the company to negotiate over these and other issues, while the NOA is an independent advocacy organization.  McDonald\u2019s is the landlord for most of its franchisees, who pay a flat base rent on the first day of each month and another rent and service fee payment on the 10th, based on the previous month\u2019s sales.  Franchisees are \u201cdeeply passionate about the McDonald\u2019s brand, and this is their livelihood, and we understand that this is certainly a stressful time,\u201d David Tovar, McDonald\u2019s vice president of U.S. communications, told Reuters. \u201cThe company has provided unprecedented levels of financial support to U.S. operators to inject liquidity into the system during this crisis.\u201d  Some franchisees now fear they could go out of businesses because most locations have had to switch operations to drive-through, delivery and carry-out only as states have imposed strict measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  McDonald\u2019s reported last week that its sales plunged 13.4% in the United States in March.  U.S. fast-food sales are down 30-40% in recent weeks, with sales at full-service chains dropping as much as 80%, according to Credit Suisse estimates on Monday.  To be sure, franchisees affiliated with big brands get more support than independent restaurants, and most franchisors have offered some relief.  Subway restaurants, which has about 19,700 U.S. locations, cut royalty payments in half, suspended advertising funds for four weeks and is canceling or reducing some rent payments.  Darden Restaurants Inc, which owns the Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and a half dozen other full-service restaurant brands, is among publicly traded companies hurt by the pandemic that have suspended dividends to shareholders.  While McDonald\u2019s suspended share buybacks, it has been criticized for paying its annual dividend as it reduces employee hours during the crisis.  In his letter, Erlinger suggested franchisees could offer a 10% \u201chero pay\u201d bonus for workers over 60 days and scan employees\u2019 temperatures when they start their shifts - proposals the franchisee source said amounted to \u201cgrandstanding\u201d considering how few stores the company operates itself.  TIMELINE OF TENSION  In mid-March, the group of franchisees who officially negotiate with the company in the United States proposed a 10-point economic relief plan, asking McDonald\u2019s executives to cancel rent payments for April and May - not just defer them, according to a copy of their proposal seen by Reuters.  For about two-thirds of franchisees - those whose sales fell by more than 25% during the last two weeks of March - their March rent and service fees were not collected on April 10, for a total of about $180 million in payments deferred for four months, the company said.  Tovar said in \u201cseveral\u201d cases, individual owners were on the cusp of the 25% sales loss for the end of March, but McDonald\u2019s agreed to defer those payments anyway to help the franchisee.  March, April and May base rent payments have been deferred for four months for all operators.  The company also reduced national advertising fees by 0.5%. It is halting store renovations and some new openings, which will save $1 billion in 2020 capital expenditures, it said in regulatory filings. The cuts will save franchisees some money.  \u201cWe reserve the right to make additional changes down the road,\u201d Tovar said. (Reporting by Hilary Russ Editing by Leslie Adler)","100":"(Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp dismissed Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy, the fast-food giant said on Sunday.  The board found that Easterbrook, 52, who had led McDonald\u2019s since 2015, had \u201cdemonstrated poor judgment\u201d involving the relationship, McDonald\u2019s said in a news release. Easterbrook relinquished his seat on the company\u2019s board as well.  \u201cThis was a mistake,\u201d Easterbrook said of the relationship in an email to employees on Sunday released by the company. \u201cGiven the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on.\u201d  His departure was among the most significant in corporate America in the past several years over relationships deemed inappropriate.  Scrutiny of executives and their treatment of employees has intensified amid the #MeToo social media movement, which highlighted instances of sexual harassment in the workplace. In June 2018, Intel Corp CEO Brian Krzanich resigned after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee that breached company policy.  Chris Kempczinski, 51, most recently president of McDonald\u2019s USA, was named the company\u2019s new CEO, effective immediately. He also joined the McDonald\u2019s board.  In his own message to employees, Kempczinski thanked Easterbrook for recruiting him to McDonald\u2019s and said he expected the company to continue its customer-focused growth plan. McDonald\u2019s Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. called Kempczinski \u201cinstrumental\u201d in developing the company\u2019s strategic plan.  Chicago-based McDonald\u2019s, one of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands, recently celebrated the 40th anniversary of its Happy Meal for children and is known for its family-friendly reputation.  The company did not provide further details on the circumstances surrounding Easterbrook\u2019s departure. McDonald\u2019s is expected to disclose financial information related to Easterbrook\u2019s dismissal in a securities filing as soon as Monday, the company said.  FILE PHOTO: McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook speaks during an interview on CNBC at the New York Stock Exchange, November 11, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The company named Joe Erlinger, who has been president of international operated markets, as president of McDonald\u2019s USA, succeeding Kempczinski.  \u201cWhile clearly a loss, McDonald\u2019s maintains one of the deepest and longest-tenured management teams, which should help provide some stability through this unexpected transition,\u201d Raymond James analyst Brian Vaccaro said in a research note about Easterbrook\u2019s exit.  RIVALS CHALLENGE DOMINANCE  McDonald\u2019s shares roughly doubled during Easterbrook\u2019s tenure. But the chain in October missed Wall Street profit estimates for the first time in two years as it spent money remodeling U.S. restaurants and speeding up service to address declining customer visits.  Rival fast-food chains in the United States have challenged McDonald\u2019s dominance with value meals and new menu items, including plant-based burgers and meat substitutes launched by rivals including Restaurant Brands International Inc\u2019s Burger King and Yum Brands Inc\u2019s KFC. McDonald\u2019s is seen late in reintroducing chicken sandwiches and rival Wendys Co has started serving breakfast.  The remodeling of the company\u2019s 14,000 U.S. restaurants includes introducing digital ordering kiosks, mobile ordering and pay-and-pickup services, while partnering with app-based delivery services GrubHub Inc, Uber Eats and DoorDash.  Easterbrook turned around McDonald\u2019s operations in the UK, where he was born, by refocusing on burgers and burnishing the brand with an ad campaign that sought to debunk unflattering rumors about its food.  A cricket enthusiast who earned a reputation among former UK colleagues for being funny, fair and a lover of simplicity, Easterbrook was also the rare McDonald\u2019s CEO with experience running other restaurant chains.  HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS  Following the disclosure of Easterbrook\u2019s ouster, a labor movement advocating for a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights on behalf of fast-food workers, alleged McDonald\u2019s had failed to address a sexual harassment problem at the company.  \u201cMcDonald\u2019s needs to sit down with worker-survivors and put them at the center of any solution,\u201d the group, the Fight for $15 and a Union, said in a statement. \u201cAnd the company needs to be completely transparent about Easterbrook\u2019s firing and any other executive departures related to these issues.\u201d  McDonald\u2019s had no immediate comment on the group\u2019s statement.  McDonald\u2019s has faced allegations in the past year of condoning sexual harassment in the workplace and retaliating against employees who spoke up about it.  In September, scores of local government officials from 31 U.S. states pressured McDonald\u2019s to do a better job of protecting workers from groping, obscene comments and other forms of sexual harassment, adding their voices to an employee-led campaign that has seen walkouts at several stores.  McDonald\u2019s pointed then to an August announcement of a new training program for safe workplaces supported by more than 2,000 franchisees. Kempczinski said at the time the company and franchisees \u201chave a responsibility to take action on this issue and are committed to promoting positive change.\u201d","101":"(Reuters) - The Iowa and Illinois health departments said on Thursday that they were investigating cyclospora infections linked to salads at McDonald Corp's MCD.N restaurants.  McDonald\u2019s shares fell 1.4 percent after-hours on Thursday.  The Illinois Department of Public Health said it had seen about 90 cases, and the Iowa Department of Public Health said it had recorded 15 cases.  In about one-fourth of the Illinois cases people reported eating salads from McDonald\u2019s in the days before they became ill.  McDonald\u2019s, the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain, said in a statement that it had been in contact with public health authorities in both states.  It said that it had voluntarily stopped selling salads at the approximately 3,000 affected U.S. restaurants until it could switch to another lettuce blend supplier.  \u201cWe are closely monitoring this situation and cooperating with state and federal public health authorities as they further investigate,\u201d the company said.  The parasite, cyclospora cayetanensis, infects the small intestine, typically causing watery diarrhea and frequent, sometimes explosive bowel movements. It is spread by ingesting food or water contaminated with feces and not directly from one person to another.  Several outbreaks have occurred in the United States in the past several years, especially during the summer months, that had been linked to imported fresh produce including raspberries, basil, snow peas, and lettuce.","102":"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - McDonald\u2019s on Wednesday became the latest big company in Britain to say it was the last straw for plastic - with plans to start using drinking straws made from paper.  The move comes after estimates that 8.5 billion straws are used in Britain every year \u2013 or more than 23 million a day \u2013 which is contributing to the death of marine animals, according to the Marine Conservation Society.  The fast-food giant joins a list of nightclubs and restaurant venues - including Pizza Express, pub chain Wetherspoons, and supermarket Waitrose - which have pledged to dump plastic straws for bio-degradable alternatives.  \u201cThe reduction and use of plastics is an hugely important issue \u2013 for our business, for the sector and for society,\u201d Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald\u2019s UK, said in a statement.  He said McDonald\u2019s only currently used recyclable straws but would pilot paper straws in some restaurants from May and keep them behind the counter, giving customers the choice of whether or not to have a straw.  The widening ban on plastic straws comes as United Nations figures show eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - enter the ocean each year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain.  Scientists have urged tougher restrictions on plastic waste. In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning it could outweigh fish by 2030.  The Marine Conservation Society said about 70 percent of litter on beaches was made of plastic with items such as straws, cups and stirrers making up over 20 percent of the litter.  \u201cWe really want to see all plastic straws being removed from all the fast food chains ... customers clearly do not choose to recycle convenience packaging,\u201d Emma Cunningham, a campaign officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said in a statement.  As well as changes to packaging, the British government unveiled plans this week to introduce a deposit return scheme later this year by which people get a 10 pence refund for plastic and glass bottles and aluminum cans.","103":"March 19 (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp on Monday said it had agreed to settle a U.S. labor board case on whether the company is accountable for its franchisees\u2019 alleged labor law violations, according to a source involved in the case.

Fleetcor paid $1.12 billion in March 2016 to acquire Sem Parar, Brazil\u2019s largest electronic toll road payment provider.  To use the system at McDonald\u2019s drive-thrus, consumers must tell clerks that they want to use Sem Parar.

Analysts, rival fast food companies and plant-based protein producers are watching McDonald\u2019s to see whether the P.L.T. is popular enough to justify wider distribution, particularly in the United States, its biggest market.  While other chains have already started selling plant-based meat - including Restaurant Brands International Inc's QSR.TO Burger King, White Castle and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc DNKN.O - a McDonald's contract would likely be the biggest and put the plant-based meat movement front and center in mainstream America.  Reuters reported on Tuesday that Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a deal with McDonald\u2019s because it does not currently have the capacity to supply the fast food giant.  Beyond Meat shares, which closed up 12.5% on Tuesday after the news, were down 1.4 percent on Wednesday.

The International Franchise Association praised Thursday\u2019s decision, saying it brings an end to years of uncertainty for franchise businesses.

The complaints, filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), are the latest effort by the union-backed Fight for $15 to have McDonald\u2019s designated a \u201cjoint employer\u201d of workers at McDonald\u2019s franchises and thereby liable when its franchisees violate labor laws.  The claimants, including a 15-year-old from St. Louis, said in a conference call with journalists that they were ignored, mocked or terminated for reporting the behavior. The accusations included claims that co-workers or supervisors sexually propositioned, groped or exposed themselves to the women.  \u201cI felt I had no choice but to tolerate it,\u201d Kimberley Lawson, 25, who makes $8.75 per hour at a McDonald\u2019s in Kansas City, Missouri, said on a conference call with reporters.  The restaurant industry, which employs half of American women at some point in their lives, has one of the country\u2019s largest sexual harassment problems because its low-wage and largely female workforce is vulnerable to mistreatment from customers and colleagues.  The complaints against McDonald\u2019s Corp and the franchisee operators of the restaurants where the women work are similar to sexual harassment accusations also filed with the EEOC two years ago and land ahead of the company\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday.  The TIME\u2019S UP Legal Defense Fund, established earlier this year by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, is covering legal fees for the women.  The company said in a statement that it takes the accusations seriously and that the franchisees who operate some 90 percent its roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants \u201cwill do the same.\u201d  McDonald\u2019s spokeswoman Terri Hickey did not immediately comment on the company\u2019s sexual harassment policy or what, if any actions, were taken after the 2016 accusations.  Fight for $15 and TIME\u2019S UP are pressing the world\u2019s largest restaurant chain to establish and train employees on a zero-tolerance sexual harassment policy and to create a safe and effective process for receiving and responding to complaints.  If an EEOC review of the cases finds they have merit, the agency would call on the company to engage in informal settlement talks. If that failed, EEOC could sue the company or issue the workers \u201cright to sue\u201d letters.  The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld employers\u2019 ability to block workers who signed arbitration agreements from filing class-action lawsuits. Sexual harassment cases are usually not class actions because of the unique facts in each case. If the workers signed arbitration agreements, that could keep individual claims out of court.  Attorneys told reporters on the conference call that they were investigating whether the women had signed arbitration agreements. They said workers in prior cases had not.  The women could find it difficult to hold McDonald\u2019s responsible for the actions of its franchisees.  In two earlier labor law cases, federal judges in California have said that McDonald\u2019s does not exercise enough control over franchise workers to be considered a joint employer.  Also, McDonald\u2019s in April proposed settling a National Labor Relations Board case that allows it to avoid a joint employer ruling without paying any money to franchise workers who claimed they were fired, suspended or had their hours cut for participating in Fight for $15 protests calling for higher wages.","137":"July 28 (Reuters) - Mcdonald\u2019s Corp:  * MCDONALD\u2019S CFO- IN JULY, COMP SALES IN THE IOM SEGMENT HAVE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE, ALTHOUGH THEY REMAIN NEGATIVE IN THE HIGH SINGLE DIGITS- CONF CALL  * MCDONALD\u2019S CFO- IN THE U.S. BREAKFAST CONTINUES TO BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY DISRUPTIONS TO COMMUTING ROUTINES  * MCDONALD\u2019S CFO- U.S. HAS CONTINUED TO SEE IMPROVING COMP SALES THROUGH JULY, WITH COMPS TURNING SLIGHTLY POSITIVE DURING THE MONTH  * MCDONALD\u2019S CFO- IN CHINA, RECOVERY HAS BEEN UNEVEN AS CONSUMERS REMAIN CAUTIOUS ON RESUMING PRE-COVID ROUTINES, ESPECIALLY ON RESURGENCE CONCERNS  * MCDONALD\u2019S CFO- DRIVE-THRU ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY 90% OF U.S. SALES AGAIN THIS QUARTER  * MCDONALD\u2019S CEO- SEES SIZABLE INCREASE IN MARKETING SPEND FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR Further company coverage:","138":"ISTANBUL, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Turkey\u2019s Anadolu Group Holding said on Thursday that all shares of Anadolu Restaurant, which includes the Turkish franchise of McDonald\u2019s, will be sold to Birlesik Holding Limited.

Jos\u00e9 Andrade, general manager of Arcos Dorados Peru , which has the McDonald\u2019s franchise, said that the managers of the restaurant where the deaths occurred did not report the fault to the company\u00b4s maintenance department.  \u201cThe information, unfortunately, that the machine was not working and giving people shocks was only known within the local managers and was not escalated so that immediate action could be taken,\u201d he told the Peruvian television station Canal N on Friday night.  The employees, Alexandra Porras, 18, and Carlos Campo, 19, were electrocuted on Sunday in Pueblo Libre, a district of the capital, while cleaning the kitchen, police said.  Arcos Dorados, which owns and operates McDonald\u2019s Corp restaurants throughout Latin America, said on Wednesday it had shut all 29 of the McDonald\u2019s Peru restaurants it operates to conduct safety inspections following a two-day mourning period.  \u201cBased on our internal investigations, what we have been able to determine is that at least 24 hours before this happened, it was known that the machine was presenting problems,\u201d said Andrade.  \u201cAt the restaurant level, what they ought to have done is to stop using the machine, and even disconnect it,\u201d said Andrade.  Relatives of the victims have called for a citizen protest against McDonald\u2019s on Saturday afternoon.  Prosecutors are already investigating the deaths, while criticisms of fast food chains and the debate about working conditions in the country are growing on social media and in protests. The two victims were a couple and had worked in the restaurant for several months, according to their families.  \u201cThis has hit us all very hard and what we are doing at the moment is working hard to review all our processes, all our protocols to ensure that such a thing does not happen again,\u201d said Andrade.

REUTERS\/Yves Herman  The world\u2019s biggest fast-food chain is still struggling in its home market, where it is battling a barrage of promotions from rival chains with offers ranging from $1 coffees to Uber Eats deliveries.  That is being countered by the strength of a global operation which the company has modernized faster and that generated same-store sales growth of 4.4 percent in the fourth-quarter, above expectations of 3.9 percent - and almost twice the figure of its 14,000 U.S. outlets.  \u201cThe persistent strength of non-U.S. markets is especially impressive in-light of slowing growth in China and economic softness in Europe, particularly in the UK where MCD\u2019s business appears nearly unstoppable,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore.  Shares of the company, however, pulled back from initial gains after executives hinted of more trouble ahead in a post-earnings conference call. They were down 0.5 percent at $181.09 in afternoon trading.  Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said he expected commodity prices to rise by 1 to 2 percent in the United States and about 2 percent in key international markets, while currency fluctuations would knock 8 to 10 cents per share off earnings in the first quarter and from 13 to 15 cents in the full year.  \u201cWe recognized there are significant challenges,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Stephen Easterbrook told analysts.  FRESH MEAT  Worried by drops in customer traffic, the burger chain is remodeling U.S. outlets to introduce digital ordering kiosks, new mobile ordering, pay and pickup services - looking to replicate the success of these moves overseas.  It has removed artificial preservatives from classic burgers, switched to fresh rather than frozen beef for its Quarter Pounders and added cheap dollar menus to draw in customers and fend off competition at breakfast time.  A partnership with Uber Eats has begun to improve delivery and overall service times and the company said deliveries were now a $3-billion business for its franchise and fully-owned stores globally.  Same-store sales in the United States, however, are still lagging. They rose just 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace in nearly two years and missed Wall Street estimates for the third straight quarter.  Total revenue fell 3 percent to $5.16 billion in the quarter, which was in line with estimates, but dipped largely due to the company selling restaurants to franchisees.  \u201cThe industry throughout the year certainly was competitive, both from a price and value perspective,\u201d Easterbrook said.","145":"(Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp on Tuesday announced an approved, science based target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and battle climate change, saying it is the first restaurant company to do so.

REUTERS\/Yves Herman  Under a plan several years in the making, the fast-food company - along with its franchisees and suppliers - aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by roughly one third, preventing 150 million tonnes of them from being released into the atmosphere by 2030.  \u201cTo meet this goal, we will source our food responsibly, promote renewable energy and use it efficiently, and reduce waste and increase recycling,\u201d McDonald\u2019s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said.  The commitment comes as President Donald Trump works to weaken Obama-era efforts to combat climate change. Trump decided last year to pull the United States out of the Paris climate pact.  Meat processor Tyson Foods Inc, one of McDonald\u2019s suppliers, is among the hundreds of companies that already have committed to fight climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.  McDonald\u2019s said it would put the greatest emphasis on the largest contributors to its carbon footprint: beef production, restaurant energy usage and sourcing, packaging and waste. Those segments combined account for approximately 64 percent of McDonald\u2019s global emissions, the company said.  Among other things, it will support sustainable agricultural practices and packaging. It also plans to install energy-efficient lighting and kitchen equipment, and to encourage recycling in its restaurants.  Between 2015 and 2030, McDonald\u2019s and its partners intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to its restaurants and offices by 36 percent. The company also aims to reduce emissions intensity per tonne of food and packaging by 31 percent during that time frame.  McDonald\u2019s program was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, a collaboration between the World Resources Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the United Nations Global Compact, which help companies address climate change.  \u201cWe are about halfway there already on (total) packaging and waste,\u201d Francesca DeBiase, McDonald\u2019s chief supply chain and sustainability officer.  The planned reductions are the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year or planting 3.8 billion trees and growing them for 10 years.  CEO Easterbrook, who also has committed to reducing antibiotic use in chicken and cutting artificial ingredients, said the costs would not be disruptive.  \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any substantial shift in business financials either at the corporate or restaurant level,\u201d Easterbrook said.","146":"OAK BROOK, Ill. (Reuters) - McDonald\u2019s Corp said on Tuesday that it had begun serving fresh beef Quarter Pounders and other premium burgers at about 3,500 restaurants in the United States, and most of its other U.S. locations will follow suit by May.  The fresh beef expansion comes as McDonald\u2019s is improving food quality and increasing menu variety to counter competition from older rivals such as Wendy\u2019s Co as well as more premium chains like Chick-fil-A, In-N-Out and Shake Shack Inc.  One year ago, McDonald\u2019s announced plans to sell some of its burgers made with fresh - rather than frozen - beef in the majority of its roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants by mid-2018 to produce juicier burgers.  McDonald\u2019s U.S President Chris Kempczinski called the switch to fresh beef Quarter Pounders the most significant change to restaurant operations since the company began offering all-day breakfast in 2015.  The project has required changes by kitchen crews and suppliers.  \u201cOur suppliers have invested about $60 million updating their supply chain to be able to make this conversion from frozen to fresh,\u201d Kempczinski told reporters. Franchisees were initially concerned about what cooking made-to-order burgers would do to service time, he later told Reuters.  \u201cIf it slows down the drive-through, that\u2019s the critical part of our business. And so we just had to spend a lot of time really making sure that as we were cooking only when someone ordered, we\u2019d figured out a way to do it that wasn\u2019t going to slow down service time,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Fresh beef Quarter Pounders and premium \u201csignature crafted\u201d burgers are now available in restaurants in Miami, Orlando and Nashville.

In October, executives said more than 9,000 stores had completed remodeling - about two-thirds of all U.S. locations - with more in development before year\u2019s end, and that the modernized stores had improved overall sales.  But the suit claims that the new design features split and lowered counters, creating easy access for customers seeking to harm employees on the other side.  Filed in conjunction with the Fight for $15 and a Union, the complaint alleges a nationwide epidemic of in-store violence, including an armed robbery at a McDonald\u2019s in Orlando, Florida when workers were held at gunpoint in a walk-in freezer.  In the Chicago area, there are more than 20 calls every day to emergency services from McDonald\u2019s stores, the suit said.  Plaintiffs claim that McDonald\u2019s ignores best practices that could make stores safer, especially at locations open overnight.  Those measures include drive-thru windows that block customers from entering the store, windows free of advertising materials that otherwise obstruct lines of vision and bathrooms that lock when workers need to clean them alone late at night.","148":"Union-backed organizing group Fight for $15 on Monday asked the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s general counsel to suspend settlement talks with McDonald\u2019s Corp in a major case claiming the company is liable for labor law violations by franchisees.

Roughly 95% of McDonald\u2019s U.S. restaurants are franchised, and the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said the Chicago-based company does not push hard enough to improve training at the franchised restaurants.  Workers have filed more than 50 similar complaints against McDonald\u2019s and its franchisees in the United States over the last three years.  Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit was among the first brought as a class action, representatives of the plaintiff Jenna Ries said.  Ries, 32, worked for 1-1\/2 years at a franchised McDonald\u2019s in Mason, Michigan, near the state capital of Lansing.  She said a restaurant manager there subjected her to repeated sexual epithets and contact, including by pinning her against a wall in a walk-in freezer.  \u201cI constantly lived in fear of losing my job,\u201d Ries told reporters on a conference call. \u201cI needed the money.\u201d  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of women who worked at the Mason restaurant in the last three years.

In a filing in the federal court in Chicago, McDonald\u2019s said its franchise agreements made clear the obligations and risks of owning restaurants, which was \u201cfatal\u201d to the claim it defrauded the 52 plaintiffs, who operated more than 200 stores and have been seeking as much as $1 billion in damages.  McDonald\u2019s, which is based in Chicago, also said many of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were too old, and that there was no proof it made or broke promises that would support their \u201cexpansive\u201d claim of longstanding, companywide discrimination.  \u201cOn its face, this claim is illogical as it suggests the company somehow has an interest in undermining its franchisees and seeing them fail,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said. \u201cSuccess is promised to no one, and plaintiffs\u2019 struggles - while regrettable - are simply not a basis for a claim against McDonald\u2019s.\u201d  Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In a complaint seeking up to $1 billion of damages, the plaintiffs said McDonald\u2019s has not offered profitable restaurant locations and growth opportunities to Black franchisees on the same terms as white franchisees, belying its public commitment to diversity and Black entrepreneurship.  The plaintiffs said McDonald\u2019s saddled them under its standard 20-year franchise agreements with stores requiring high security and insurance costs, and whose $2 million average annual sales from 2011 to 2016 were $700,000 below the nationwide norm. Bankruptcy often resulted, they said.  \u201cIt\u2019s systematic placement in substandard locations, because they\u2019re Black,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Jim Ferraro said in a phone interview. \u201cRevenue at McDonald\u2019s is governed by one thing only: location.\u201d  The lawsuit was filed in the federal court in Chicago, where McDonald\u2019s is based.  McDonald\u2019s denied treating Black franchisees differently, or that they were unable to succeed because of discrimination.  It also said that while it may recommend store locations, franchisees make the decisions.  \u201cMcDonald\u2019s stands for diversity, equity and inclusion,\u201d Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in a video to employees. \u201cOur franchisee ranks should and must more closely reflect the increasingly diverse composition of this country and the world.\u201d  The plaintiffs sued five weeks after McDonald\u2019s updated its corporate values, pledging a greater focus on diversity.  More than 90% of McDonald\u2019s 14,400 U.S. restaurants were recently operated by about 1,600 franchisees.  Ferraro, however, said the number of Black franchisees had fallen to 186 from 377 since 1998.  McDonald\u2019s has denied claims in a separate discrimination lawsuit filed by two Black executives in January, also in Chicago.  Their allegations included that McDonald\u2019s used harsh grading of stores and other \u201cstrong-arm\u201d tactics that drove a disproportionate number of Black franchisees out of its system.","157":"(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp MCD.N blew past analysts' forecasts for profit and revenue on Monday, helped by higher sales in overseas markets and as U.S. customers spent more at its outlets.  Shares of the world's biggest fast food chain by revenue rose more than 5 percent as global same-restaurant sales topped Wall Street forecasts, driven by the strength in mature markets especially the United Kingdom and Germany. The stock was also the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI.  The results underscore the success of Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook\u2019s multi-year turnaround plan launched in 2015 to refresh McDonald\u2019s menus, add more technology to stores and make outlets more welcoming for customers.  New changes also included adding more high-margin \u201cgourmet\u201d burgers, which use fresher and more expensive ingredients and cost $6 or $7, and new $1 to $3 value options.  Same-restaurant sales in its most profitable market, the United States, rose 2.9 percent and topped analysts\u2019 expectations on higher average check tallies that was propelled by consumers opting for $1-$3 value menu items, while also adding more expensive burgers.  \u201cThe value price menu does bring people in, but people tend to spend more ... people still want a number of key McDonald\u2019s items like the Quarter Pounder and the Big Mac,\u201d Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.  McDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains have been concentrating on drawing customers with cheap options as they battle for a bigger share of a pie that is not growing.  But a weak initial consumer response to the company\u2019s $1-$3 menu prompted McDonald\u2019s to offer a 2 for $4 \u201cmix & match\u201d deal on breakfast sandwiches to thwart intense competition in the all-day breakfast category, Easterbrook said on a post-earnings analyst call.  Customer visits in the U.S. declined, but rose notably in Japan, France, Australia and Canada leading to an overall traffic rise of 0.8 percent.  Global sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 5.5 percent, easily topping an average estimate of 3.94 percent.  \u201c(This) shows the power of the brand ... globally the numbers were outstanding,\u201d Peter Saleh, an analyst with brokerage BTIG, said. \u201cThe results were very impressive, actually more impressive than we initially had anticipated.\u201d  Excluding items, McDonald\u2019s earned $1.79 per share, beating the estimate of $1.67. Revenue fell 9 percent compared to a year ago, as it sold more McDonald\u2019s-owned outlets to franchises to cut costs, but beat estimates.","158":"(Reuters) - Fast food is canceled in Britain.

The letter said McDonald\u2019s employees have filed more than 50 sexual harassment complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Reuters could not verify this because EEOC complaints are not public.  When asked to comment on the letter, McDonald\u2019s referred Reuters to its Aug. 28 statement announcing a new training program for safe workplaces, which has support from more than 2,000 franchisees.  \u201cTogether with our franchisees, we have a responsibility to take action on this issue and are committed to promoting positive change,\u201d said Chris Kempczinski, McDonald\u2019s USA president. \u201cThese actions are one more step we are taking to raise awareness at all levels of McDonald\u2019s that will transfer both inside and outside the workplace.\u201d  Workers and those organizing them are trying to pressure McDonald\u2019s, the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales, to boost wages and address violence and harassment problems at its roughly 14,000 U.S. locations, most of them independently owned.

Shares of Beyond Meat jumped 16 percent immediately after the announcement and later pared gains to trade 9 percent higher. The shares have roughly tripled in value since the company\u2019s listing on the stock market in May.  McDonald\u2019s stock was up marginally. The world\u2019s largest burger chain joins Tim Hortons, KFC and Dunkin\u2019 Brands in adding products made with Beyond Meat patties to their menus.  As consumers grow more concerned about health and the impact of industrial animal farming on climate change, the plant-based market is expected to explode to an estimated $140 billion over the next decade, according to Barclays. Beyond Meat, a pioneer of plant-based meat substitutes, is competing with Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods for dominance of the market.  McDonald\u2019s rival Burger King and Impossible Foods teamed up in April for the U.S. rollout of a plant-based Whopper. The Impossible Burger is also sold at fast food chain White Castle and at Disney theme parks.  \u201cWe wish McDonald\u2019s similar success in its 28-unit test in Canada,\u201d Impossible Foods said in an emailed statement. Spokeswoman Jessica Appelgren told Reuters the Impossible Burger has not yet been approved for sale in Canada.  COMPETITION HEATS UP  McDonald\u2019s has not yet indicated if it will launch a U.S. plant-based burger, but there has been intense market speculation on which meatless burger maker McDonald\u2019s could pick.  \u201c(The) Beyond Meat selection is a good way to offset the parity of just going to Burger King for the same patty,\u201d said Tim Powell, a restaurants expert at consulting firm Foodservice IP. \u201cWe all have been pushing McDonald\u2019s to make this move...It opens the door to a whole host of new customers.\u201d  Powell warned that setting prices could be a challenge for McDonald\u2019s. Plant-based burgers typically cost $1-$1.50 more than meat patties - a price gap that Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are investing in closing as soon as possible.  The Incredible Whopper costs $5.59 versus $4.19 for a beef Whopper. McDonald\u2019s said its PLT sandwich - a play on the traditional bacon-filled BLT - would cost C$6.49 plus tax and will be sold in 28 restaurants in southwestern Ontario, Canada starting Monday. This compares to a C$5.69 Quarter Pounder. Burger prices may vary in different stores.  McDonald's has bucked this trend in Germany, where it sells Nestle's NESN.S Incredible Burger - marketed as the Big Vegan - in 1,500 stores for a lower price than it charges for its Hamburger Royal, which is comparable to a U.S. Quarter Pounder. In June, McDonald's began selling the Big Vegan in several Israeli stores.  McDonald\u2019s announcement on Thursday coincided with the highly anticipated launch of Nestle\u2019s plant-based burger in the United States.  \u201cA lot of people have been asking McDonald\u2019s if they are going to do this. I do think to offer the consumer another option is nice, but again, it remains to be seen on what the uptake is,\u201d said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones.  Yarbrough pointed to Tim Horton\u2019s, owned by Canada\u2019s Restaurant Brands International <QSR.TO, which recently pulled back its own Beyond Meat plant-based burger offering this month, citing the better demand for real beef burgers.  McDonald\u2019s said the 12-week test would allow it learn more about real-world implications of serving the PLT, including customer demand and impact on restaurant operations.","176":"SYDNEY, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Fast food giant McDonald\u2019s Corp said it fired the manager of two restaurants in rural Australia after a video circulated on social media showing people identified as him and his female partner using racist language in an argument with an Aboriginal person.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  The Chicago-based hamburger chain missed Wall Street estimates for profit and revenue in the fourth quarter, with comparable sales in its international operated markets falling 7.4%, largely due to weakness in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, where the coronavirus crisis has been intense.  Several European countries imposed tough restrictions when the pandemic surged again late last year, compounding the difficulties faced by a restaurant industry already reeling from the impact of COVID-19 for much of 2020.  Those markets are not expected to see margins return to pre-COVID levels in 2021, Kevin Ozan, Chief Financial Officer, said in a call with investors, although McDonald\u2019s still expects to open 1,300 new restaurants around the world this year.  Shares in McDonald\u2019s rose about 1% after it said global comparable sales fell 1.3% for the quarter ended Dec. 31, better than an anticipated 1.46% drop and an improvement over the previous quarter, when they fell 2.2% year-on-year.  Total revenue fell 2.1% to $5.31 billion, missing the $5.37 billion estimate. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share were $1.70, missing the average analyst estimate by 8 cents.  Comparable sales in the United States, however, rose 5.5%, beating an estimated 5.15% increase.  To drive its U.S. business, the restaurant chain has leaned on its U.S. drive-thrus, limited offers like the McRib sandwich, and celebrity collaborations such as the Travis Scott Meal.  In January, U.S. comparable sales are expected to be in the high single digits, with spending assisted by government stimulus checks, Ozan said.  The prospect of raising the U.S. federal minimum wage to $15, a measure introduced in Congress on Tuesday and supported by President Joe Biden, could be managed through \u201cjudicious\u201d menu pricing and productivity savings, Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said during the call.  \u201cSo long as it\u2019s done... in a staged way and in a way that is equitable for everybody, McDonald\u2019s will do just fine,\u201d Kempczinski added.  He also acknowledged tension with U.S. franchisees over costs and other issues.  \u201cWe always find our way to work through these,\u201d he said.","180":"(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp MCD.N missed Wall Street estimates for profit for the first time in two years on Tuesday as more investment to spruce up U.S. restaurants and speed up service weighed on the world's biggest fast food chain, sending its shares down 4%.  Rival fast-food chains in the United States have challenged its dominance with value meals and new menu items, including plant-based burgers and meat substitutes launched by rivals including Restaurant Brands International Inc's QSR.TO Burger King and Yum Brands Inc's YUM.N KFC. McDonald's is seen late in reintroducing chicken sandwiches and rival Wendys Co WEN.O has started serving breakfast.  In the face of declining customer traffic, McDonald's has been remodeling its 14,000 U.S. restaurants to include digital ordering kiosks, mobile ordering as well as pay-and-pickup services, while partnering with app-based delivery services GrubHub Inc GRUB.N, Uber Eats UBER.N and DoorDash.  Those investment led to a 2% rise in operating costs to about $3 billion, leading McDonald\u2019s to post a smaller-than-expected profit of $2.11 per share versus an average estimate of $2.21, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cThe world is different than it was in 1955,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said during a call with investors.  \u201cWe\u2019re keenly aware we have to be ahead of these changes, investing, executing and growing with a deep sense of urgency and purpose,\u201d he said.  U.S. traffic was negative - an industry-wide trend expected to continue through the end of the year, especially due to weakening economic conditions, according to TDn2K research.  Sales at U.S. restaurants open for at least 13 months rose 4.8% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, below the 5.17% growth expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.  \u201cOur gut tells us that McDonald\u2019s was outcompeted in the third quarter by Wendy\u2019s and Burger King,\u201d Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a note.

Globally, the company reported better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 5.9% on strong performance in markets such as the UK and France.  Interest in plant-based burgers has jumped in North America, and consumers have been waiting to see if McDonald's will expand its test of a Beyond Meat Inc BYND.O burger in Ontario, Canada, to the United States and other markets.  Easterbook gave no clues other than saying they were interested in such products and wanted to get the flavor and marketing right.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re interested in is really how best to position this, get a sense of the flexitarian customer,\u201d he said, referring to people who eat mostly, but not entirely, vegetarian diets.  Net income fell 2% to $1.61 billion in the quarter from $1.64 billion a year earlier.  Total revenue, including both U.S. and overseas operations, rose to $5.43 billion, slightly below analysts\u2019 expectations of $5.49 billion.  The company also expects selling, general and administrative expenses for 2019 to rise between 1% to 2% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations.  McDonald\u2019s expects delivery to drive $4 billion, or roughly 4%, of global sales.  The service is now available from about 23,000 McDonald\u2019s restaurants in over 80 countries. On average, guests spend twice as much on delivery orders as they do on in-store checks, Easterbrook said.  \u201cDelivery remains a big frontier for our business, and we still have a long way to go,\u201d he said.","181":"(Reuters) - A judge with a U.S. labor agency on Tuesday rejected McDonald's Corp's MCD.N proposed settlement of a major case on whether the fast-food company is accountable for alleged labor law violations by franchisees across the country.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The settlement proposed in March lacked important details and would probably not bring an end to the sprawling case that began in 2012, National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Administrative Law Judge Lauren Esposito in New York said in a written opinion.  The settlement would have allowed McDonald\u2019s to avoid a ruling that it is a \u201cjoint employer\u201d of workers at McDonald\u2019s franchises and can be held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law and made to bargain with unions.  Illinois-based McDonald\u2019s said in a statement that it was disappointed with the decision and was considering appealing it to the five-member NLRB.  The company said the proposed settlement \u201cis fair, reasonable, and provides the opportunity now for full and complete relief to all current and former franchisee employees affected by the litigation.\u201d  The company had agreed to pay between $20 and $50,000 to individual workers who claimed they were fired for taking part in nationwide protests calling for higher wages.  Fight for $15, a union-backed worker advocacy group that organized the protests, had asked Esposito to reject the settlement.  The group\u2019s lawyer, Mary Joyce Carlson, in a statement on Tuesday said McDonald\u2019s and the government agreed to the \u201csham\u201d settlement \u201cto hand the company a get-out-of-jail-free card for illegally harassing, surveilling and firing minimum-wage workers who joined together and spoke out for a better life.\u201d  Business groups have said that a ruling against McDonald\u2019s could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers.  The case is seen as an important test of how a 2015 NLRB decision that made it easier to prove that a company is liable for labor law violations by contractors would apply to franchisees.  Fight for $15 filed dozens of legal claims on behalf of McDonald\u2019s workers beginning in 2012.  A trial began in 2015. Esposito in January agreed to pause it so that NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company.","182":"A person exits from a McDonald's as all the restaurant and bar are closed except fast food, following an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Brussels, Belgium, 14 March 2020.

These premium beef, grilled or crispy chicken burgers came with condiments like pico guacamole, sweet BBQ bacon or maple bacon dijon, compared with the Quarter Pounders, which are beef patties served with ketchup, pickles and onions.  The company said its new deluxe and bacon Quarter Pounders received good feedback and it would continue to focus on such items.  \u201cIt (the removal) probably has more to do about the process of cooking the burger in McDonald\u2019s than it does what the consumer is saying about the food,\u201d said Howard Penney, a managing director at Hedgeye Risk Management.

The lawsuit, filed Friday in federal court in Chicago, says the company fostered a climate of \u201csevere or pervasive sexual harassment and a hostile work environment, including groping, physical assaults, and sexually-charged verbal comments.\u201d  The plaintiffs, current McDonald\u2019s employee Jamelia Fairley and former employee Ashley Reddick, are seeking to represent a class of female employees of Florida\u2019s more than 100 corporate-owned, non-franchise McDonald\u2019s locations. They are asking for $500 million in compensatory damages and an order requiring the company to adopt policies against harassment.  McDonald\u2019s already faces a similar class action in Michigan, as well as numerous individual lawsuits and complaints with the federal Equal Opportunity Employment Commission from employees who say they were harassed on the job.

Reddick worked at a Sanford, Florida, McDonald\u2019s restaurant from 2015 until 2018, when she was fired for reporting unwanted sexual comments and touching by a male coworker, the complaint said. Fairley experienced similar harassment from a coworker while working at the same store, beginning in 2018, according to the complaint.  Management knew of the harassment in both cases but failed to take appropriate action, the lawsuit said.  Sexual harassment allegations have plagued McDonald\u2019s since last year.

The cases announced by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the labor group Fight for $15, and the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund cover alleged misconduct at McDonald\u2019s locations in 20 U.S. cities, including groping, indecent exposure, propositions for sex, and lewd comments.  McDonald\u2019s is one of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands, and the cases make the fast-food chain a primary target of a campaign to extend the #MeToo movement, which sprung from sexual harassment cases in Hollywood, to the workplace.  The Chicago-based company said it has more than 14,000 locations in the United States with some 850,000 workers.  More than 90 percent of the locations are franchised, and McDonald\u2019s has long maintained it should not be liable for how employees in franchised restaurants behave.  Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said his company has improved and more clearly defined its harassment policies, has trained most franchise owners, and will be training front-line employees and setting up a complaint hotline.  \u201cMcDonald\u2019s is sending a clear message that we are committed to creating and sustaining a culture of trust where employees feel safe, valued and respected,\u201d Easterbrook wrote in letters this week to Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth and \u201cTop Chef\u201d host Padma Lakshmi, who supports the workers\u2019 cause.

McDonald\u2019s has faced more than 50 such charges and lawsuits in the last three years, the ACLU said. Last September, McDonald\u2019s workers in 10 cities staged a one-day strike to protest alleged sexual harassment.  Jamelia Fairley, a single mother who makes $9.60 an hour at a corporate-owned McDonald\u2019s in Sanford, Florida, told reporters she went to the EEOC after a co-worker began groping her, rubbing against her and saying he could \u201cgive me a ride.\u201d  She said that after she reported the harassment, McDonald\u2019s transferred but did not fire her harasser, while her boss cut her weekly hours to seven from 25,  \u201cTrying to raise a 2-year old on $67 a week is, well, I can\u2019t do it,\u201d Fairley said.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is seen at a McDonald's restaurant in Queens, New York, U.S., March 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  Franchisees that lead negotiations with the company asked McDonald\u2019s for a blanket 14-day reprieve in their March rent during weeks of negotiations over financial help. But on April 3, that request was denied, according to a letter from the franchisee leadership. The correspondence provides a snapshot of growing internal tensions between McDonald\u2019s executives and franchisee organizations amid an unprecedented global health crisis.  \u201cBecause so many owners are alarmed over their financial viability and have been waiting for clarity on a positive, tangible company decision, many believe the trust in the relationship has plummeted,\u201d the National Owners Association of franchisees wrote to McDonald\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski and McDonald\u2019s USA head Joe Erlinger, on April 7.  Franchisees\u2019 faith in management \u201cseems predicated on unlimited financial support,\u201d Erlinger wrote back two days later. \u201cIf that\u2019s how the NOA seeks to define its relationship with McDonald\u2019s, then in reality, we don\u2019t have a relationship, and I am extremely disappointed and disheartened by this.\u201d  The National Owners Association represents at least 75% of McDonald\u2019s more than 1,600 franchisees, which own and operate 95% of the fast-food chain\u2019s nearly 14,000 U.S. restaurants. While a few franchisees own scores of stores, many have only a few.  A separate group of franchisees works officially with the company to negotiate over these and other issues, while the NOA is an independent advocacy organization.  McDonald\u2019s is the landlord for most of its franchisees, who pay a flat base rent on the first day of each month and another rent and service fee payment on the 10th, based on the previous month\u2019s sales.  Franchisees are \u201cdeeply passionate about the McDonald\u2019s brand, and this is their livelihood, and we understand that this is certainly a stressful time,\u201d David Tovar, McDonald\u2019s vice president of U.S. communications, told Reuters. \u201cThe company has provided unprecedented levels of financial support to U.S. operators to inject liquidity into the system during this crisis.\u201d  Some franchisees now fear they could go out of businesses because most locations have had to switch operations to drive-through, delivery and carry-out only as states have imposed strict measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus.  McDonald\u2019s reported last week that its sales plunged 13.4% in the United States in March.  U.S. fast-food sales are down 30-40% in recent weeks, with sales at full-service chains dropping as much as 80%, according to Credit Suisse estimates on Monday.  To be sure, franchisees affiliated with big brands get more support than independent restaurants, and most franchisors have offered some relief.  Subway restaurants, which has about 19,700 U.S. locations, cut royalty payments in half, suspended advertising funds for four weeks and is canceling or reducing some rent payments.  Darden Restaurants Inc DRI.N, which owns the Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and a half dozen other full-service restaurant brands, is among publicly traded companies hurt by the pandemic that have suspended dividends to shareholders.  While McDonald\u2019s suspended share buybacks, it has been criticized for paying its annual dividend as it reduces employee hours during the crisis.  In his letter, Erlinger suggested franchisees could offer a 10% \u201chero pay\u201d bonus for workers over 60 days and scan employees\u2019 temperatures when they start their shifts - proposals the franchisee source said amounted to \u201cgrandstanding\u201d considering how few stores the company operates itself.  TIMELINE OF TENSION In mid-March, the group of franchisees who officially negotiate with the company in the United States proposed a 10-point economic relief plan, asking McDonald\u2019s executives to cancel rent payments for April and May - not just defer them, according to a copy of their proposal seen by Reuters.  For about two-thirds of franchisees - those whose sales fell by more than 25% during the last two weeks of March - their March rent and service fees were not collected on April 10, for a total of about $180 million in payments deferred for four months, the company said.  Tovar said in \u201cseveral\u201d cases, individual owners were on the cusp of the 25% sales loss for the end of March, but McDonald\u2019s agreed to defer those payments anyway to help the franchisee.  March, April and May base rent payments have been deferred for four months for all operators.  The company also reduced national advertising fees by 0.5%. It is halting store renovations and some new openings, which will save $1 billion in 2020 capital expenditures, it said in regulatory filings. The cuts will save franchisees some money.  \u201cWe reserve the right to make additional changes down the road,\u201d Tovar said.","214":"(Reuters) - A Delaware judge on Tuesday rejected former McDonald\u2019s Corp Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook\u2019s bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the fast-food chain seeking to recoup millions of dollars in severance pay because he allegedly covered up improper sexual relationships with employees.

Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of the Court of Chancery inDelaware, however, said McDonald\u2019s was justified in relying onEasterbrook\u2019s statements that he had only a single inappropriaterelationship when the Chicago-based company ousted him.  A lawyer for Easterbrook did not immediately respond torequests for comment.  McDonald\u2019s said it looked forward to proving Easterbrook\u2019smisconduct.  \u201cHe violated the company\u2019s policies, disrespected itsvalues and abused the trust of his co-workers, the board, ourfranchisees and our shareholders,\u201d it said in a statement.  McDonald\u2019s sued Easterbrook in August, nine months afterreaching the severance package, claiming he never gave directorsa complete picture of his relationships with employees.  It said that after Easterbrook\u2019s ouster, an anonymous tipled to the discovery of dozens of nude or sexually explicitphotos of women, including three employees, that Easterbrooksent to his personal email account from his company account.  McDonald\u2019s said Easterbrook deleted the emails shortlybefore his ouster, but they remained on a company server.  \u201cThis active concealment makes it at least reasonablyconceivable the company had no way of knowing the full extent ofEasterbrook\u2019s misconduct,\u201d Slights wrote.","215":"(Reuters) - As U.S. businesses reopen, worried workers and their advocates are borrowing a legal strategy commonly used to shut down rowdy topless bars to try and force employers to strengthen protection against further spread of the coronavirus.  Workers and their families at McDonald\u2019s Corp\u2019s Chicago restaurants have filed a class-action lawsuit against the fast-food chain that does not seek money for sick staff, but compliance with health guidance such as providing clean face masks.  The strategy was unsuccessful against a meatpacking plant but experts said it could work against McDonald\u2019s and other companies, and a business group warned about a flood of cases.  \u201cThe damage done by inadequate safety practices is not confined to the walls of a restaurant but instead has broader public health consequences,\u201d Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit said.  Like an April lawsuit against a meatpacking plant, the case targets McDonald\u2019s as a public nuisance, a legal strategy previously used to shutter strip clubs and the famed Limelight nightclub in Manhattan.  Typically, workplace safety is a matter for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which has the authority to inspect businesses and issue citations. By focusing on community health, the lawsuit attempts to move outside OSHA\u2019s jurisdiction and into the courts.  McDonald\u2019s workers around the country have protested and demanded safety gear.  In Chicago, workers filed at least four complaints with OSHA, but the agency declined to inspect work sites, according to the lawsuit.  OSHA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Unions have criticized the agency for lax enforcement and failing to issue mandatory standards for businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have an assertive OSHA you get these creative approaches,\u201d said Michael Duff, a professor at the University of Wyoming College of Law.  McDonald\u2019s called the allegations inaccurate. The company criticized the SEIU service union that is supporting the plaintiffs and said the chain has issued a 59-page guide its restaurants must follow to protect staff and customers.  The Fight for $15 group, which campaigns to raise the U.S. minimum wage to $15 an hour, is also helping the workers.  OSHA has said it is investigating thousands of complaints nationwide and that flexible guidance is better than rigid standards.  The public nuisance doctrine stems from medieval England, where it was used to promote safer roads and to fight infectious diseases.  To prevail, plaintiffs must prove a defendant interfered with a public good, like the community\u2019s health. Unlike a typical lawsuit, it does not generally require proof that the defendant directly injured someone.  Rather than prove someone was infected with the coronavirus at McDonald\u2019s, the workers must instead show the company created an unsafe workplace that posed an imminent threat of contributing to its spread.  A similar public nuisance lawsuit filed in April against a Smithfield Foods Inc meat processing plant in Missouri was dismissed because the judge said workplace safety was a matter for OSHA.  But Smithfield was already being investigated by OSHA and unlike McDonald\u2019s, there were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Missouri plant.  The Institute for Legal Reform, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, has warned the pandemic could prompt a flood of \u201cabusive\u201d lawsuits, and cited the McDonald\u2019s public nuisance case in a call with reporters this week.  \u201cThe danger is one case survives and like moths to light you\u2019ll see cases all over the place,\u201d said Michelle Richards, a law professor at the University of Detroit Mercy.  Richard Ausness, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, downplayed the risk of a flood of cases, but said the mere filing of such a lawsuit could push a business to help its workers.  \u201cWho wants to be accused of maintaining a public nuisance? It just sounds awful,\u201d he said.","216":"A McDonald's restaurant sign is seen, as the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in Milton Keynes, Britain, March 23, 2020. REUTERS\/Andrew Boyers  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp MCD.N said on Wednesday it would temporarily remove some items from its U.S. menu as it focuses on simplifying operations in the face of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.  Restaurants in the United States have been forced to either shut doors or limit service to delivery and takeaway, pressuring operators that are struggling with staffing and plunging traffic, among other issues.  \u201cTo simplify operations in our kitchens and for our crew ... we are working with our franchisees and local restaurants to focus on serving our most popular choices and will begin temporarily removing some items from the menu over the next few weeks,\u201d said Bill Garrett, senior vice president of operations for McDonald\u2019s USA in a statement to Reuters.  The world\u2019s largest burger chain, McDonald\u2019s, was also considering deferring rent and service fees for its franchisees, who operate a majority of the company\u2019s restaurants in the United States.  The U.S. restaurant industry is likely to be among the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, as scared customers cook at home instead of dining out and governments force restaurants to shut dining rooms and switch to drive-thru, delivery and take-out only.  McDonald\u2019s, along with peers Yum! Brands Inc\u2019s KFC fried chicken chain and Subway sandwich shops, has also closed all locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland to contain the virus\u2019 spread.  In the past, McDonald\u2019s has discontinued a line of crafted burgers that came with unique ingredients to speed up service at the chain\u2019s drive-thru windows.  It has also routinely cut fees during major business disruptions, like a natural disaster or highway construction outside a restaurant."}}
