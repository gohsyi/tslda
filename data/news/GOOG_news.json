Last year, Uber said it could have to pay the entire judgment as part of indemnification pacts with the two workers.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Google, which spun off Waymo in 2016, alleged that year that engineer Anthony Levandowski and business leader Lior Ron breached various contracts as they brought Waymo employees and technology to Uber.  Waymo won an interim judgment last March, with Levandowski liable for $127 million, while he and Ron were together on the hook for a further $1 million, according to previous disclosures.  The company last month was then awarded the legal fees, attorneys\u2019 fees and prejudgment interest, but the amounts were redacted in state court papers filed on Thursday in San Francisco.  Waymo said it was seeking court approval to publish the figures.  Ron remains at Uber. The company fired Levandowski in 2017 and said last year it would pursue reimbursement from him. Attorneys for Levandowski did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Waymo settled a related lawsuit against Uber by securing a 0.34% stake in the company and an agreement that Uber would stop freely using Waymo technology.  Levandowski is separately fighting a federal indictment on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google\u2019s self-driving car efforts.","2":"SAN FRANCISCO, March 16 (Reuters) - YouTube could see a jump in videos erroneously taken down for content policy violations as the company relies more on automated software during the novel coronavirus pandemic, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google warned on Monday.  Google said in a blog post that to reduce the need for people to come into its offices, YouTube and other business divisions are temporarily relying more on artificial intelligence and automated tools to identify problematic content. Such software is not always as accurate as humans, which lead to errors, the company said.  And \u201cturnaround times for appeals against these decisions may be slower,\u201d the blog post added.  Google, like many companies across the world, has asked employees and contractors to work from home if possible, aiming to slow the spread of coronavirus. Mass gatherings such as sports, cultural and religious events have been canceled across the world to combat the fast-spreading respiratory disease.  Google said human review of automated policy decisions also would be slower for other products and indicated that phone support would be limited. Content rules cover submissions such as ad campaigns running on the Google ad network, apps uploaded to the Google Play store and business reviews posted to Google Maps. \u201cSome users, advertisers, developers and publishers may experience delays in some support response times for non-critical services, which will now be supported primarily through our chat, email, and self-service channels,\u201d Google said.

In addition, the company said public health authorities in 16 countries and regions outside the United States had launched apps using the Apple-Google tool, up from 12 previously. They include Austria, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Gibraltar, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Uruguay.  The technology enables app users to track encounters with other people through Bluetooth signals and anonymously notify contacts if they later become infected with the virus.  Google had previously said in May that three states - Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina - would be launching apps using the exposure notification tool. But South Carolina lawmakers halted the release of the state\u2019s app last month, while Alabama officials are still weighing the launch of their completed app. North Dakota\u2019s app has yet to launch.  On Friday, Google said the first of the U.S. apps would be released in the \u201ccoming weeks,\u201d but declined to name the states.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of laptop and mobile device users are seen next to a screen projection of Google logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The European Commission\u2019s decision, delayed by a week by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s visit to a NATO summit in Brussels last week, is expected on Wednesday.  It comes just over a year after the Commission slapped a landmark 2.4-billion-euro ($2.8 billion) penalty on Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, for favoring its shopping service over those of competitors.  The EU penalty is likely to exceed the 2017 fine because of the broader scope of the Android case, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.  The EU sanction comes in the midst of a trade conflict between the United States and the EU, which has hit back against U.S. tariffs on European steel and aluminum by targeting $3.2 billion in American exports with higher duties.  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will meet Trump in Washington D.C. on the trade issue next week.  The Android decision is the most important of a trio of antitrust cases against Google. With the company able to make its ads show up in more smartphone apps than any other tech rival, Google\u2019s app network has quietly become a huge growth engine.  The company\u2019s high payouts to app developers, coupled with its entrenched relationship with millions of advertisers, has turned Google into the main revenue source for many apps. Its Play Store accounts for more than 90 percent of apps downloaded on Android devices in Europe.  Its popularity in turn could mean an uphill battle for EU antitrust regulators seeking to level the playing field for Google\u2019s rivals by ensuring that users can download from competing app stores and that smartphone makers are free to choose pre-installed apps.  Regulators say Google has tilted the field in its favor by forcing smartphone makers to pre-install Google Search together with its Play Store and Chrome browser, sign agreements not to sell devices on rival Android systems and also pay smartphone makers to only pre-install Google Search on devices.  Google has denied the charges, saying that bundling search with its Google Play allows it to offer the entire package for free, and that smartphone makers and users have a wide choice.  Regulatory action is probably too late because of Google\u2019s entrenched position, said analyst Richard Windsor at research company Radio Free Mobile.  \u201cUsers in the EU are now completely accustomed to using Google services and have come to prefer them,\u201d he said.  \u201cHence, I think separating Google Play from the rest of Google\u2019s Digital Life services would have very little impact as users would simply download and install them from the store,\u201d Windsor said.

Slideshow ( 6 images )  Sidewalk Labs had developed a proposal for a futuristic, data-driven city development along Toronto\u2019s downtown lakeshore. It was working with a government-mandated agency, Waterfront Toronto, that planned to vote on whether to approve the final proposal in June.  The project had long faced opposition over issues including data privacy concerns. Alphabet is the parent company of Google.  \u201cAs unprecedented economic uncertainty has set in around the world and in the Toronto real estate market, it has become too difficult to make the 12-acre (5-hectare) project financially viable without sacrificing core parts of the plan we had developed,\u201d Sidewalk\u2019s CEO Dan Doctoroff said in a letter released on Thursday.  The project had initially included a small light railway transit system, 2,500 homes where 40% would be below market price, and a tall-timber factory that Sidewalk projected would create 4,000 jobs.  Sidewalk Labs caused an uproar when it proposed getting a share of property taxes and development fees linked to the rising value of Toronto city land to finance the project. It dropped the suggestion when it submitted the master plan in June 2019 to Waterfront.  Sidewalk, which provides urban technology infrastructure, put forward an addendum scaling back the original proposal. It was approved by Waterfront in October, allowing the company to move towards the agency\u2019s final approval vote next month.  Sidewalk\u2019s decision comes amid significant cost cutting at parent Alphabet, with hiring, marketing and employee perks pared. Alphabet is grappling with falling ad sales at its Google unit because of the novel coronavirus.  \u201cWhile this is not the outcome we had hoped for, Waterfront Toronto offers thanks and appreciation to Sidewalk Labs for its vision,\u201d said Stephen Diamond, the chair of the agency.  Jan de Silva, president of the Toronto Regional Board of Trade President Jan de Silva, a staunch supporter of the project, said the announcement was not unexpected, but that she had not heard concerns from industry about negative implications for Toronto overall.  \u201cThere\u2019s a strong sentiment that Toronto is going to continue to be a high growth jurisdiction and that land values will continue to appreciate,\u201d de Silva said.

Revenue growth at Facebook, the world\u2019s second-biggest seller of online ads after Google, has been cooling steadily as its business matures, although it came in at more than 20% throughout 2019.  Still, compared to expectations, the company has had a bumper year due to surging use of its platforms by users stuck at home amid virus-related lockdowns, which cushioned online ad sales even as broader economic activity suffered.  USER BASE GROWTH  Facebook continued to expand its user base, with monthly active users rising to 2.74 billion, compared with estimates of 2.70 billion according to the IBES data, although user numbers declined in North America compared to the second quarter.  The company projected that trend would continue for the rest of the year, with user numbers either flat or slightly down in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.  \u201cIt appears that investors are disappointed that despite user growth jumping across most regions during the quarter, the social media platform reported a decrease in users in North America, which covers the U.S. and Canada - its most lucrative ad market,\u201d said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.  Total expenses increased 28% to $13.43 billion, with costs continuing to grow as Facebook tries to build out its non-ad businesses and quell criticism that its handling of user privacy and abusive content is lax.  Facebook CFO Dave Wehner said on an earnings conference call that expenses would rise due to the costs of returning work-from-home staff to offices as well as increased headcount, product investments and higher legal expenses.  He said the company was expecting a margin decline as a result, although he did not give specific revenue guidance.  The company has been under especially strong pressure ahead of next week\u2019s U.S. presidential election and is aiming to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Russia used its platforms to spread election-related misinformation.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google will block election-related ads on its platforms after polls close in the U.S. election on Nov. 3, the company told advertisers in an email on Friday.  The email, seen by Reuters and first reported by Axios, said that \u201cadvertisers will not be able to run ads referencing candidates, the election, or its outcome, given that an unprecedented amount of votes will be counted after election day this year.\u201d  Experts warn that the election results could be delayed due to increased mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic.  The email said the company would ban election ads, including those that mention state or federal office-holders, candidates, or political parties, as well as ads running on election-related search queries.  Social media companies have been facing growing pressure to police misinformation in political ads. Facebook Inc FB.O recently said it would stop accepting new political ads in the week before the election and would reject ads that seek to claim victory before the results of the election are declared.  A Google spokeswoman said the ban was expected to be in place for a minimum of a week but that it was not decided when the ban would be lifted. She said the company would consider factors such as the time taken for votes to be counted or whether there was civil unrest.  The ban forms part of Google\u2019s \u2018sensitive events\u2019 policy, she said. Google has blocked some ads relating to COVID-19 under the same policy, which seeks to prohibit content that potentially capitalizes on or lacks reasonable sensitivity towards events like public health emergencies or natural disasters.  The ban will apply to all ads on Google\u2019s ad-serving platforms, including its video-streaming service YouTube and Google Ads.  Twitter Inc TWTR.N banned political ads last year, while Google has previously limited the ways election advertisers can micro-target voters.","19":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A reshuffling of Wall Street benchmark industry sectors that transferred high-flying FANG stocks like Facebook Inc FB.O and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O out of the technology label may be a boon to some under-the-radar companies that used to compete with them for investor attention.  FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 20, 2018. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Companies such as Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O, Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.N, Xerox Corp XRX.N, Akamai Technologies Inc AKAM.O, and Texas Instruments Inc TXN.O that do not often grab headlines could be among the unexpected winners from the largest reclassification of companies on Wall Street since 1999, fund managers say.  That is because fund managers who are looking for technology exposure may be willing to add positions in companies that they previously overlooked now that Alphabet and Facebook have been regrouped into the new communications services sector and are no longer an option.  \u201cAt the end of the day, there are a lot of investors who are very sector-aware,\u201d said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors in New York.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a smaller tech company, this is great because you no longer have to compete against Google for capital.\u201d  The overhaul by S&P Dow Jones Indices of the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) took effect on Monday. The changes are meant to reflect how the tech, media and consumer industries have evolved. Maintained by S&P and MSCI since 1999 and widely used by portfolio managers, the taxonomy classifies companies across 11 sectors.  The communication services sector will include three out of the four so-called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Alphabet - even though investors widely consider them the leaders of the tech rally that powered the stock market higher in recent years.  While Alphabet and Facebook will leave technology, Netflix will be moved out of consumer discretionary to join the renamed sector. Amazon.com will stay put in consumer discretionary.  Shares of Alphabet, which made up approximately 10.2 percent of the technology sector, are up 12.3 percent for the year to date. After Apple, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, Visa Inc V.N, Intel Corp INTC.O and Cisco now round out the S&P tech index's largest five components.  Overall, the regrouping of companies in new sectors is expected to generate more than $30 billion in market activity as active investors and passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recalibrate their positions to reflect the new weightings, according to estimates from State Street.  While most diversified fund managers have wide leeway in deciding what companies to own, most tend to hug the weightings of the S&P 500 sectors when constructing their portfolios.  That means that if a fund manager used to own Alphabet as a way to gain technology exposure, he or she would need to find another company to fill that hole now that Alphabet is in another sector.  PLAYING DEFENSE  The shuffling of benchmark sectors may also make it harder for investors to play defense during the next market sell-off. Former value-stock companies like AT&T Inc T.N that were in the telecommunications sector are now lumped together with growth-focused companies like Netflix Inc NFLX.O in the communications services sector.  \u201cIn times when you would want to play defense and allocate to telecom, you can\u2019t really do that anymore,\u201d said Cliff Hodge, director of investments for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Cornerstone Wealth.  Approximately 61 percent of the new communications sector will be growth stocks - so named because investors are often willing to pay a higher multiple in anticipation of above-market growth rates - while 100 percent of the former telecommunications sector were value stocks, the name given to companies that have slower growth rates but better dividends and balance sheets, according to State Street Advisors.  The former telecom sector traded at a forward price to earnings ratio of 10.6, nearly half of the 19.3 P\/E of the new communications sector.  The sector paid a dividend yield of 5.45 percent, making it an attractive place for investors to hide during market downturns. Yet the sector, renamed communication services, now includes stocks like Netflix, which doesn\u2019t pay a dividend at all.  With the telecom sector gone, more investors will gravitate toward consumer staples and utilities sectors, which have become a popular - and expensive - place for dividend income, said Jeffrey Liguori, chief investment officer at Providence, Rhode Island-based Napatree Capital.  \u201cVerizon is not a telephone company anymore and neither is AT&T,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should be trading like media companies and getting valuations that are more appropriate as well.\u201d","20":"FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured at the entrance to the Google offices in London, Britain January 18, 2019.

On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone stopped the Commerce Department from barring TikTok\u2019s data hosting within the United States and other technical transactions that she said would effectively ban the use of the app in the country.  The restrictions were set to take effect Nov. 12. A Justice Department lawyer told Nichols the government had not decided whether to appeal Beetlestone\u2019s order.

FILE PHOTO: A man stands in front of a screen during a Google event in New Delhi, India September 27, 2016. REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi\/File Photo  The case is Google\u2019s fourth major antitrust challenge in India, one of its key markets where it is currently facing public criticism from local startups for enforcing certain policies and company charges they contend hurt their growth.  It also comes as Google faces new antitrust challenges in the United States, and a potential antitrust probe in China that is set to look into how it allegedly uses its dominance of its Android mobile operating system to stifle competition. Google has denied any wrongdoing.  The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has since June been looking into allegations that Google engages in anti-competitive practices by creating barriers for firms wanting to use or develop modified versions of Android for smart TVs, such as Amazon Fire TV\u2019s operating system, according to the source, who has direct knowledge of the case.  The case has been filed by two Indian antitrust lawyers, Kshitiz Arya and Purushottam Anand. They both confirmed the case filing against Google for alleged abuse in the smart television market, but declined to comment further.  The source said the CCI had directed Google to submit its written responses to the allegations and that the company has sought more time.  A Google spokesman declined comment, since the case with the antitrust body was pending. Amazon and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.  Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the CCI are not disclosed publicly.  The antitrust watchdog could order a wider investigation against Google if it finds merit in the allegations, or throw out the case completely.  Smart TVs, or WiFi-enabled TVs with apps for streaming services like Netflix and YouTube, have become increasingly popular in India.  Data from Counterpoint Research shows 8 million smart TV sets were sold in India in 2019. Three in five smart TVs sold in India are based on Google\u2019s Android system, which also powers nearly 99% of India\u2019s half a billion smartphone user base.  The latest case alleges that Google\u2019s agreements with companies such as Xiaomi and TV manufacturer TCL India effectively stop them from using both the Android system and a modified version of it on different devices they make, according to the source.  For example, if a company sells smartphones based on Google\u2019s Android, it cannot sell smart TVs running on competing platforms like the Amazon Fire TV system, according to the case against the Mountain View, California-based company, the source said.  And in reverse, if a company\u2019s smart TV is using Amazon\u2019s Fire operating system, then that company is restricted from offering Google\u2019s popular Play Store or the Google maps app on its smartphones.  Xiaomi India and TCL India, which is part of China\u2019s TCL Technology Group Corp, are both party to the case along with Google. Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment while TCL declined to comment.  In 2018, the CCI fined Google 1.36 billion rupees($18.5 million) for \u201csearch bias,\u201d but a company appeal against that is pending. The CCI last year also started probing Google for allegedly misusing its dominant position to reduce the ability of smartphone makers to opt for alternate versions of its Android system.  Earlier this year, the CCI started reviewing a case alleging that Google abuses its market position to unfairly promote its mobile payments app in the country.","28":"FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured at the entrance to the Google offices in London, Britain January 18, 2019.

Alphabet shares were barely changed at $1,552, above their pre-pandemic high, after it said revenue fell 2% in the second quarter, less than analysts\u2019 estimate of a 4% decline.  Alphabet, whose ad sales account for about 78% of its revenue, has struggled during past economic slowdowns, as marketing is often the first budget item to get slashed.  But Google and its online advertising rivals Facebook Inc FB.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday all reported better results in the pandemic than in past recessions.  With its mostly free tools for web browsing, video watching and teleconferencing, Google has become a larger part of many consumers\u2019 lives as lockdown orders force people to rely on the internet for work and entertainment. In turn, the internet has become more attractive to advertisers than TV, radio and other avenues.  \u201cWe saw the early signs of stabilization as users returned to commercial activity online,\u201d Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts during a conference call on Thursday.  Search ad sales at the end of June were about flat with a year ago, marking an improvement from a \u201cmid-teens\u201d percentage decline in March, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told the analysts.  After the company announced it would extend its coronavirus work-from-home order until summer 2021, a Google sign is shown at one of the company's office complexes in Irvine, California, U.S., July 27, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  YouTube ad sales rose 6% in the second quarter, and were growing even faster by late June, Porat said. Sales of ads on partner properties fell 10% but were \u201cimproving somewhat toward the end of the quarter as advertisers\u2019 spend began to return,\u201d she added.  Overall second-quarter revenue was $38.3 billion, with the slowest growth since a 2.9% increase during the Great Recession in 2009.  Alphabet announced a $28 billion boost to its share buyback program. It said it would still hire a big class of recent graduates even as it slashes spending on real estate and other activities.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is really how to reimagine what the workplace will look like,\u201d Porat said.  Total costs and expenses rose about 7% from a year ago to $31.9 billion in the second quarter, compared with a 12% jump a quarter ago.  Capital expenditures fell 12% to $5.4 billion, compared with a 3% drop last quarter.  Alphabet\u2019s profit was nearly $7 billion, or $10.13 per share, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $5.6 billion, or $8.29 per share, for the quarter.  About 66% of its revenue came from Google search and YouTube ads, 12% from ads sold on partner properties online, 8% from its cloud business, and 14% from its mobile app store and about a dozen other smaller businesses.  But the company faces challenges across all those fronts. New data privacy laws, including one that went into effect this month in Google\u2019s home state of California, are depressing ad prices.  Antitrust regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia are weighing whether Google has stifled competition on its way to dominating search, mobile software and other businesses, with some bodies even considering forcing it divest parts of its operations.  About 2,000 employees last month petitioned Google\u2019s emerging cloud business to scuttle deals with some police agencies, citing racial discrimination concerns. And whether a massive hiring spree will win other cloud clients is uncertain. Cloud sales in the second quarter of about $3 billion were in line with analysts\u2019 estimates.","31":"Sept 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube is rolling out its version of social media rival TikTok, a new short-form video service called Shorts, enabled within its video-sharing platform.

Harley-Davidson Inc climbed 6.1 percent after its profit beat estimates and the company forecast a lower-than-expected hit to margins from tariffs.  Whirlpool Corp tumbled 13.8 percent to a more than two-year low after reporting weak quarterly results and cutting its full-year forecasts.  Shares of Biogen Inc rose 3.6 percent and Eli Lilly and Co shares rose 4.6 percent after the companies reported strong results.

The company's cloud business is much smaller compared with market leader Amazon's AMZN.O AWS and Microsoft's MSFT.O Azure, but Wall Street analysts were upbeat about the $2 billion quarterly revenue from the unit.  Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai, who has big ambitions to eventually generate more revenue from the company\u2019s cloud business than its mainstay ad business, said the unit is now at an annual revenue run rate of $8 billion and would triple sales staff over the next few years.  \u201cMuch smaller than AWS, but like Azure, growing faster,\u201d Baird analysts wrote in a note.  Amazon, which also reported on Thursday, said AWS raked in $8.4 billion in revenue in the second quarter, a 37% jump from a year earlier. Azure sales jumped 64% in the fourth quarter.  The rise in Alphabet\u2019s shares, set for their biggest single-day gain in four years, could help the stock catch up with its peers this year. Through Thursday\u2019s close, Alphabet had risen 9 percent this year, compared with more than 30% for both Amazon and Microsoft.  Alphabet beat second-quarter revenue and earnings expectations on higher ad sales, bouncing back from a rare revenue miss in the first quarter, and offered no worrisome guidance about increasing regulatory scrutiny.  Eighteen Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, with Wedbush and Evercore making the most aggressive moves by raising their targets by $150. About 90% of all analysts covering the stock have a \u201cbuy\u201d or higher rating.  Still, questions linger about whether privacy, content moderation and proposed antitrust rules in the United States and other high-revenue countries will online advertising.  \u201cWe expect the negative news flow to continue this year and Big Tech is clearly coming under increased scrutiny,\u201d Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White wrote in a note.  Alphabet on Friday acknowledged a broader U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review of large technology firms and said it will continue to engage with the regulator.","38":"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Tuesday unveiled a new mid-tier laptop aimed at users on the go, the first of several big announcements expected at the company\u2019s annual hardware launch event.

This means Wing can begin a commercial service delivering goods from local businesses to homes, which includes flights beyond visual line of site and over people, the FAA and Wing said. Wing Aviation plans to start commercial package delivery in Blacksburg, Virginia later this year.  Wing partnered with the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and Virginia Tech, as one of the participants in the Transportation Department\u2019s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program.  \u201cThis is an important step forward for the safe testing and integration of drones into our economy.

Wing plans to reach out to the local community before it begins a food delivery trial, to gather feedback, the FAA said.  Wing has recently begun commercial air delivery service in the north of Canberra, Australia and is also about to begin its first trial in Europe, delivering to homes in Helsinki, Finland.  Wing said its data shows a lower risk to pedestrians from drone deliveries than the same trip made by car.  In May 2018, Chao announced it had approved 10 projects to help it assess how to regulate drones and integrate them safely into U.S. air space. The United States has lagged other countries in experimentation with drones, something the program hopes to correct.  In January, the FAA proposed rules that would allow drones to operate over populated areas and end a requirement for special permits for night use. The FAA is also considering moving ahead with additional rules in response to public safety and national security concerns as it works to integrate drones with airplane traffic.

The Apple-Google technology enables governments fighting the novel coronavirus to publish mobile apps in the coming days that the companies said will be able to reliably log users who are in physical proximity for at least five minutes. A user who later becomes infected with the virus could use the app to automatically and anonymously notify recent contacts.  Some governments have applauded the system, which could help them test and isolate more potentially infected individuals than they would normally be able to based on patients recalling their recent interactions from memory.  But others have been frustrated with rules set by Apple and Google that curb their ability to collect users\u2019 location, phone numbers and other details. Some of those authorities are developing apps using their own technology, which Apple and Google said will experience glitches and drain device batteries.  Apple and Google rules bar authorities from requiring residents to use the app. Apps sidestepping their technology have seen limited adoption so far.

The Cupertino, California company\u2019s shares added another 0.3 percent on Friday, putting its market capitalization at $1.005 trillion.  Apple\u2019s 12-month gain is far better than the S&P 500\u2019s 14 percent increase over the past year, but it pales beside Amazon\u2019s astounding 85 percent surge, propelled by the online retailer\u2019s and cloud computing heavyweight\u2019s scorchingly fast revenue and profit growth.  Amazon is now the second-largest publicly-listed U.S. company, with a market capitalization of $889 billion, followed closely by Alphabet and Microsoft, at $856 billion and $830 billion respectively.

According to the report, security researcher John Wu published a blog post bit.ly\/2p5d2Cu Tuesday that explained how users of Huawei's Mate 30 Pro were able to manually download and install Google apps, despite a U.S. blacklisting that prohibits the Chinese company from using American components and software.  But in the wake of the revelations, the Mate 30 devices, made to work on new 5G mobile networks, lost their clearance to manually install Android apps, as reported by a number of smartphone experts, Bloomberg said.  The Mate 30 is Huawei\u2019s first major flagship smartphone launched last month, since U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration effectively blacklisted the company in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company denies.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Waymo, the self-driving vehicle technology unit of Google parent Alphabet, Inc GOOGL.O, said it will start offering rides in minivans with no human attendant on board to current members of its Waymo One service in Phoenix. Within a few weeks, Waymo plans to open access to anyone who downloads its smartphone app and wants a ride within a 50-square mile area of Phoenix.  Waymo chief John Krafcik said during a conference call that the company for now will offer only rides in driverless cars. Within a few weeks, Waymo will relaunch service for a larger, 100 square mile swath of the Phoenix area, using Pacifica minivans made by partner Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N.  Some of the Waymo vans in Phoenix will still have attendants on board.  Waymo has not said where or when it will expand its robo-taxi business beyond Phoenix. \u201cYou can imagine we\u2019d love the opportunity to bring the Waymo One driver to our home state of California,\u201d Krafcik said.  Before the coronavirus pandemic forced Waymo to suspend operations this spring, Waymo was using vehicles with no human attendant on board to provide five to ten percent out of a total of 1,000 to 2,000 rides per week in its Phoenix service zone, Krafcik said. Rides in fully autonomous vehicles were limited to a small, selected group of Waymo customers.  Waymo\u2019s move to expand service using vehicles with no attendant on board puts it ahead of rival robo-taxi companies in deploying a revenue generating service in the United States. Waymo earlier this year raised more than $3 billion, mostly from outside investors.  Cruise, majority controlled by General Motors CoGM.N, is testing vehicles in San Francisco, but has so far not offered rides to the public.  The pandemic has depressed demand for ride hailing services of all kinds. Waymo has stepped up attention to sanitation of its vehicles in response, Krafcik said. Waymo will monitor vans remotely, and employees will remind customers to keep masks on in the vehicles. Vehicles will be cleaned regularly under a maintenance and fleet management partnership with auto retailer AutoNation Inc AN.N, Krafcik said.  Fiat Chrysler has engineered a system that can flush the air from a minivan after every ride, he said.  The field of companies trying to develop self-driving vehicles has been consolidating as technology and regulatory challenges pushed the prospects of significant revenue from carrying passengers further into the future. Waymo and other autonomous vehicle technology companies have put increased focus on automating commercial vehicles for goods delivery.  Waymo rival Zoox was acquired earlier this year by Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. Ride hailing company Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N was set back by a fatal accident involving one of its test vehicles.  The U.S. Congress has failed to act on proposals to create standards and safety regulations the industry can rely on as a legal shield when deploying self-driving vehicles.  In Arizona, Waymo said it informs state officials ahead of any change in its service.

Google was provisionally certified in March to handle U.S. government data with \u201cmoderate\u201d security, but Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp have higher clearances.  Amazon was widely viewed among Pentagon officials and technology vendors as the front-runner for the contract, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud, or JEDI.  Google had been angling for the deal, hoping that the $10 billion annual contract could provide a giant boost to its nascent cloud business and catch up with Amazon and fellow JEDI competitor Microsoft.  That the Pentagon could trust housing its digital data with Google would have been helpful to its marketing efforts with large companies.  But thousands of Google employees this year protested use of Google\u2019s technology in warfare or in ways that could lead to human rights violations.

The third-quarter results were the second time running that billionaire Jeff Bezos' firm had fallen short of sales targets and, allied to a similar disappointment from Google-owner Alphabet GOOGL.O, they sent a shockwave through stock markets.  There were no ratings downgrades from the Wall Street analysts who have almost universally backed the companies\u2019 long-term prospects but several said there were signs that both were beginning to face tougher competition from tech peers as well as the retail companies Amazon has bullied in recent years.  The fall of as much as 9 percent in shares knocked more than $80 billion off Amazon's market value and relegated it behind Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Apple Inc AAPL.O in terms of market value.  Now that the Seattle-based firm has devoured retail players like Borders, Sears and Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, it is facing bigger challenges from multinationals who are making substantial investments to compete, D.A.

Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin saw two possible reasons Amazon forecast a holiday shopping quarter weaker than anticipated by Wall Street.  \u201cThey are worried about the macro. The second thing is they\u2019re worried about competition,\u201d he said, noting that there were both signs of a slowing economy and that major retailers were aggressively deploying strategies to compete with Amazon for holiday sales.  Amazon expected sales in the holiday quarter leading up to Christmas to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, to as much as $72.5 billion, while analysts on average had expected $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates.  Several analysts called the company\u2019s outlook conservative and said any outright dip in profit seems highly unlikely.  \u201cOverall, Amazon\u2019s growth trajectory remains solid, including advertising, grocery, pharmacy, and specialty retail, as well as Amazon Business ($10 billion in sales in eight countries) and Amazon Web Services,\u201d Telsey Advisory Group analysts said.  Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all continued growth in cloud services but with signs of deceleration.  In the latest quarterly reports, Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing business Azure marked revenue growth of 76 percent, down from 89 percent in the previous quarter. Google\u2019s other revenue, which includes its cloud business, grew 29 percent on year, 4 percent below estimates of Cowen & Co. analysts. Amazon\u2019s cloud business saw a 46 percent rise in revenue to $6.68 billion, only narrowly edging past estimates of $6.67 billion.  \u201cIn general the cloud business will continue to grow but not at the previous pace and that\u2019s an indication of the market maturity,\u201d says Sid Nag, senior director, cloud technologies and services, Gartner Research.

Daniel Doctoroff, Chief Executive Officer of Sidewalk Labs, poses for a portrait in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, April 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  This is the first time a timeline has been publicly disclosed for the project designed to increase land efficiency, cut costs and conserve energy in one of the world\u2019s priciest housing markets as development struggles to catch up with a rapidly growing population.  Government-backed agency Waterfront Toronto in March 2017 requested proposals to develop a 12-acre (4.86 hectares) environmentally friendly mixed-use area that would add jobs and be affordable for all ages and income brackets. That was the first part of the planned revitalization of about 800 acres of industrial wasteland to the east of the city\u2019s downtown on Lake Ontario.  Sidewalk Labs was chosen in October based on a proposal that included autonomous vehicles, a thermal grid that does not use fossil fuels, low-cost modular buildings with flexible uses, and robotic delivery and waste-management systems. The company settled on Toronto after searching for sites across North America, Europe and Australia to create a smart city.  A development plan is expected to be approved by the Sidewalk and Waterfront Toronto boards by the end of 2018, and the first residents could move in as early as 2022, CEO Dan Doctoroff said in an interview.  The timeline is subject to government approvals and other processes that Sidewalk expects to spend most of 2019 working through, Doctoroff said.  \u201cQuayside will be a prototype for a broader opportunity,\u201d Doctoroff said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do, no one has really succeeded in doing. Thus far, I\u2019ve been thrilled with the way things have gone ... but I\u2019m not sanguine about the challenges.\u201d  Other smart city projects have largely failed because of budgets, the involvement of too many parties, and the use of public resources on development with no immediate benefits for the broader population.  Corporate access to personal information is a growing concern. Sidewalk Labs has faced growing scrutiny over its plans to put sensors and cameras all over Quayside.  Doctoroff said Sidewalk Labs would destroy non-essential information, only retain data that would improve the quality of life, and not sell them to advertisers. Third parties must adopt privacy policies developed for the plan, he added.  Most of the technology will be sourced from several other companies, Doctoroff said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we might invest in (some of) them to encourage them or potentially to fund some of those things, but that will be a smaller percentage.\u201d  Sidewalk has invested $50 million for testing and engagement this year. It will lease a new waterfront office in summer, where it will showcase some Quayside technologies, he said.  Sidewalk will have a better idea by year-end whether its partnership with Waterfront Toronto could extend to the broader eastern waterfront, he said.  Some technologies can be effective in Quayside\u2019s limited area, but others including mobility, energy and building systems need larger economies of scale to be effective, Doctoroff said.  Sidewalk Labs has been approached by others to do similar projects elsewhere but is focused on Toronto for now, Doctoroff said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get it right here.\u201d","53":"WASHINGTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The judge hearing the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust case against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google suggested a trial date of Sept. 12, 2023, on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured outs a Google office near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Dave Paresh  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said the local Google unit did not tell users of its Android operating system for almost two years that they needed to switch off two settings - not one - if they did not want the company to keep their information.  \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct caused users to understand that personal data about their location was not being obtained ... by Google when in fact personal data was being obtained,\u201d the ACCC wrote in a Federal Court filing on Tuesday, which it published on its website.  \u201cThe misleading information provided by Google meant that users were not able to make an informed choice.\u201d  A Google spokeswoman said the company would defend the matter, that the company was reviewing the ACCC\u2019s allegations and that it would continue to engage with the regulator.  The lawsuit is the first of several the ACCC said it would pursue against the local arms of global technology companies like Google and social media firm Facebook Inc when it called for tougher laws concerning privacy and content-sharing.  Already European Union countries have seized on the bloc\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules to rein in big technology companies. In January, a French regulator fined Google 50 million euros ($55.5 million) for breaches of privacy laws.  Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commissioner is also investigating Google over a complaint alleging breach of privacy laws, while Facebook agreed in July to a record-breaking $5 billion fine in the United States to resolve privacy concerns dating back to its use of people\u2019s data in the 2016 presidential election.  The Australian lawsuit against Google is seeking unspecified penalties and orders requiring the publication of corrective notices by Google, the ACCC said.  The Australian regulator said in its lawsuit that Google failed to make clear that people should turn off two location-based settings, \u201cLocation History\u201d and \u201cWeb & App Activity\u201d, to stop the company collecting and using data from either.  Google further misled consumers - and breached Australian consumer law - by telling them the only way to prevent the company from collecting their location data was to stop using its main services like Google Search and Google Maps, the regulator said.  \u201cWe want declarations that the current behaviour should not continue,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims told reporters in Sydney.  \u201cWe want significant penalties and ... we want Google to have to let people know what has gone on, so that people have a greater awareness of what data is actually being collected here and what it is being used for.\u201d  The matter is scheduled for a case management hearing on Nov. 14, according to the Federal Court website.","58":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The selection of U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, nominated to the court by President Barack Obama, to hear the U.S. Justice Department's case against Alphabet's Google GOOGL.O, suggests a tough courtroom battle ahead for the $1-trillion search and advertising company.  FILE PHOTO: The Google sign is shown on one of the company's office buildings in Irvine, California, U.S., October 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Alphabet's GOOGL.O Google of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals like Microsoft's Bing in search and search advertising. The lawsuit, which was filed on Tuesday, is the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades.  Mehta, who was randomly selected, is not seen as pro-business or favorable to monopolies, said Sally Hubbard, who advocates for tougher antitrust enforcement at the Open Markets Institute.  \u201cWe have a judge that is not hostile to antitrust, so this is a really good moment for the case,\u201d she said.  Google had no comment on Mehta\u2019s selection. The search and advertising company has called the lawsuit \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d adding that people \u201cuse Google because they choose to - not because they\u2019re forced to or because they can\u2019t find alternatives.\u201d  In its lawsuit, the Justice Department is taking on an iconic company that has become all but synonymous with the internet and assumed a central role in the day-to-day lives of billions of people. The case is likely to take years to resolve.  Sam Weinstein, who teaches antitrust at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, noted that Mehta had ruled for the government in blocking the merger of Sysco and U.S. Foods in 2015, shortly after he was confirmed in late 2014. The deal was abandoned.  \u201cIf I were betting on this, I would say that it\u2019s better for the government than for Google,\u201d said Weinstein, who added: \u201cIn any individual case, it\u2019s hard to pin too much on the judge.\u201d  Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow & Mazard PLLC, agreed that Mehta\u2019s selection was \u201cgood news for the government\u201d but warned that the case against Google is a monopolization case, which tend to be harder to win than merger cases.  Mehta was previously a partner at the law firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. He was born in India in 1971 and moved to the United States at the age of 1. He also worked as a public defender in Washington for five years.  The federal lawsuit that was filed on Tuesday marks a rare moment of agreement between the Trump administration and progressive Democrats. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted on Sept. 10, using the hashtag #BreakUpBigTech, that she wanted \u201cswift, aggressive action.\u201d  Still, coming just days before the U.S. presidential election, the filing\u2019s timing could be seen as a political gesture since it fulfills a promise made by President Donald Trump to his supporters to hold certain companies to account for allegedly stifling conservative voices.  Republican lawmakers have sought, without explaining how, to use antitrust laws to compel Big Tech to stop these alleged limitations.  The antitrust case could deliver a huge opportunity for Microsoft Corp MSFT.O to increase usage of its Bing search engine, an unexpected epilogue years after it abandoned a long campaign for legal relief.","59":"WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Seven additional states may file a separate antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google in the coming weeks, New York Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday.

Alphabet management, which effectively has voting control of the company, had moved against the proposals.  Shareholders and employees said Wednesday that a gender pay gap and lack of diversity could make it difficult for the company to hire and retain workers, posing a long-term risk to its ability to innovate.  \u201cAt Alphabet, diversity and inclusion activities by individual contributors have been met with a disorganized array of responses, including formal reprimand,\u201d Google software engineer Irene Knapp said during the shareholder meeting. \u201cThe chilling effect \u2026 has impaired company culture.\u201d  Eileen Naughton, who leads Google\u2019s HR operations, said the company remains committed to an internal goal to reach \u201cmarket supply\u201d representation of women and minorities by 2020, which could help bring hiring in line with the diversity of the candidate pool.  Reuters reported in March that several hundred employees formed an organized effort asking Google to adopt several measures, including human resources guidelines that specify protections for anyone involved in an internal HR investigation.  The shareholder proposals had centered on some of Google\u2019s biggest issues outside of the antitrust scrutiny it is facing at home and abroad.

Google is fighting multiple lawsuits from ex-employees accusing the tech giant of discriminating against women in pay and promotions. Employees have also demanded that the company do more to promote civil discourse on the company\u2019s internal online message boards. How to combat extremist material on Google\u2019s YouTube video service and other public products has also been a major challenge for the company. Google has tried to quell advertiser unease about advertising on open platforms such as YouTube, and stave off proposed regulations to impose penalties for failure to remove problematic uploads.

The move comes after many startups in India banded together to consider ways to challenge the company by lodging complaints with the government and courts over the original deadline for compliance of Sept. 30 next year.  They were upset about the commission fee and also criticised several other Google Play Store policies for hurting their businesses.  \u201cWe do not succeed unless our partners succeed,\u201d Google said in a blog post, adding that it will set up \u201clistening sessions\u201d with leading Indian startups to understand their issues.  Last week, Google fixed the enforcement date for the new billing system at Sept. 30, 2021 and said only 3% of apps globally were non-compliant.

Nearly 99% of India\u2019s half a billion smartphones run on Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system.

It has invested in some and helped hundreds with product development. In July, its Indian-born CEO Sundar Pichai committed $10 billion in new investments over five to seven years.  Globally, app developers have said a 30% fee is excessive compared with the 2% fees for typical credit card payments processors. Google and rival Apple, which charges a similar fee, have said the amount covers the security and marketing benefits their app stores provide.  On Monday, Paytm\u2019s Sharma posted a newspaper clipping of Google\u2019s decision to defer the fee, saying it \u201cproves who is ruling us\u201d.

Facebook said it was introducing a \u201cone-strike\u201d policy for use of Facebook Live, a service which lets users broadcast live video. Those who broke the company\u2019s most serious rules anywhere on its site would have their access to make live broadcasts temporarily restricted.  Facebook has come under intense scrutiny in recent years over hate speech, privacy lapses and its dominant market position in social media. The company is trying to address those concerns while averting more strenuous action from regulators.","73":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas on Thursday sued Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google search engine, alleging that its educational software collects young students' personal information without the required parental consent.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Google is seen in Davos, Switzerland Januar 20, 2020. Picture taken January 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Google called the allegations \u201cfactually wrong\u201d and did not respond to a request to elaborate.  The company sells its Chromebook laptops to schools around the world alongside its free or low-cost G Suite for Education software package, which includes email and writing tools.  Brian McMath, an assistant attorney general under Balderas, said recent testing by his team and outside technical experts found that students aged below 13 who are given Chromebooks by their schools have their Web browsing, location, passwords and other personal information transmitted to Google.  The lawsuit states that Google failed to gather \u201cverifiable parental consent\u201d before collecting the data, a violation of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act.  McMath said while there was no evidence that Google had misused the students\u2019 personal information, he was concerned that the company might generate revenue from the data.  Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said \u201cG Suite for Education allows schools to control account access and requires that schools obtain parental consent when necessary.\u201d  The Federal Trade Commission, which oversees the child privacy law, has said that school districts essentially provide the consent when evaluating and purchasing educational software.  But Balderas and about two dozen other state attorneys general last year urged the FTC to reconsider, contending that it gave companies such as Google too much latitude to track children under 13 without their parents\u2019 knowledge.  In 2018, Balderas sued Google and a few other tech companies, accusing them of illegally collecting data from mobile apps made for children. The companies have denied any wrongdoing, and the case awaits a decision by a federal judge.  In September, Google\u2019s YouTube video service was asked to pay the FTC $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children.  Social media companies have been facing regulatory scrutiny globally over their policies and data monitoring practices, particularly for children. On Feb. 4, Facebook Inc FB.O said it planned to add new tools and features for parental control in its messaging app for users under the age of 13.","74":"OAKLAND, Calif., Jan 21 (Reuters) - Google parent Alphabet Inc announced on Thursday it is shutting down its internet balloon business Loon, saying \u201cthe road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped.\u201d (Reporting by Paresh Dave Editing by Chris Reese)","75":"FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured at the entrance to the Google offices in London, Britain January 18, 2019.

Alphabet got a boost from how it values investments in Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and other startups. That accounting change and a one-time benefit cut its effective tax rate nearly in half.  Investors are uncertain about future profit at Alphabet as the company navigates the move to a phone-based computing world and invests in small, fast-growing initiatives from self-driving cars to selling hardware and cloud computing services. The quarterly results did not clarify the outlook.  Alphabet\u2019s operating margin of 22 percent, down from 27 percent a year ago, missed expectations because of the growth in expenses.  Alphabet is investing to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc and having to share more of its revenue with phone and browser makers, said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.  \u201cThe jump in profits is purely due to one-time items,\u201d he said.  Longer-term capital expenditures nearly tripled to $7.3 billion in the first quarter from $2.5 billion a year ago.  Still, worldwide sales increased to $31.1 billion, above the average analysts\u2019 estimate of $30.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Those ad sales showed investors that there were no immediate signs that rising global privacy concerns had affected profits, even as concerns over Facebook Inc\u2019s use of privacy cast some suspicion on Google.  Officials across the world seek to force changes in Google\u2019s business practices, such as giving customers more control over their data.  \u201cThe strong economy has companies spending more on advertising,\u201d said analyst Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners. \u201cGoogle continues to dominate both mobile and desktop search\u201d and there will be \u201cvery little effect\u201d from Facebook privacy data fallout, he said.  FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S., August 7, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts Monday that, \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that most of our ad business is search, where we rely on very limited information, essentially what is in the keywords to show a relevant ad.\u201d  STARTUP INVESTMENTS BOOST PROFITS  Alphabet\u2019s quarterly profit of $9.4 billion, or $13.33 per share, exceeded estimates of $6.56 billion, or $9.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  About $2.4 billion in earnings were attributable to a new accounting method for unrealized gains in Alphabet\u2019s investments in startups such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. Alphabet now records estimates of the current value of its startup investments rather than waiting to report income once it has opportunity to sell those shares.  That change and a one-time benefit drove the effective tax rate in the quarter to 11 percent from 20 percent a year earlier.  Excluding the investment-related gains and other items, adjusted earnings were $9.93 per share.  Google had several one-time costs including acquiring 2,000 employees in Taiwan for $1.1 billion from HTC Corp and moving up when it awards equity to employees.  Continuing cost increases came from acquiring streaming rights for YouTube\u2019s new TV service and marketing new products.  Google executives say the spending to install powerful computers and internet cables is necessary to keep up with demand for YouTube, its Google Assistant virtual helper service and data analytics tools within its Google Cloud services.  Revenue from Google\u2019s non-advertising units was $4.4 billion in the first quarter.  Alphabet is paring back on \u201cother bets,\u201d a set of ancillary projects in areas such as medical technology and drones. Operating loss from \u201cother bets\u201d fell to $571 million, from $703 million a year ago.  Investors are counting on one other bet, the Waymo self-driving vehicles effort, to generate noteworthy revenue this year as it begins offering ride-hailing services.  Google revealed smart thermostat maker Nest generated about $726 million in revenue in 2017, above some analysts\u2019 estimates. Financial results for Nest had not been released since its acquisition in 2014.","77":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Google is seen in Davos, Switzerland Januar 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google GOOGL.O said on Saturday that it was working with the U.S. government to develop a nationwide website that would help Americans with questions about coronavirus symptoms, risk factors and testing.  \u201cWe are fully aligned and continue to work with the U.S. government to contain the spread of COVID-19, inform citizens, and protect the health of our communities,\u201d Google said in a statement on Twitter.  President Donald Trump had thanked Google on Friday for developing a website that he said would help people determine whether they needed a coronavirus test, saying that 1,700 engineers were working on it.  That prompted the search and advertising giant to respond that, in fact, a life sciences division, Verily, was in the early stages of developing a tool to help triage Americans who may need testing for the coronavirus and that it would be tested in the Bay Area and expanded over time.  Alphabet\u2019s shares closed up more than 9% after the Friday announcement by the president.  Pressure has been rising on U.S. officials to increase and improve testing for the fast-spreading virus, which has reached almost every U.S. state, closed schools and forced the cancellation of thousands of sporting events, conferences and concerts amid efforts to stop its spread by keeping Americans out of big crowds.  Like Google, Verily is a subsidiary of Alphabet, which is based in Mountain View, California.  The cooperation with the Trump administration comes as Alphabet faces antitrust investigations by federal and state agencies over its search and digital advertising businesses, among others.  Additionally, Trump has accused Google of skewing its search results to portray him negatively. The company has also attracted the administration\u2019s ire for not renewing a contract to provide its artificial intelligence technologies for a military drone program.","78":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shareholder activists on Wednesday urged Google parent Alphabet Inc to break itself up before regulators force the world\u2019s biggest internet ad seller to split into different pieces.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  SumOfUs, a U.S.-based group that aims to curb the growing power of corporations, presented the proposal at Alphabet\u2019s annual shareholder meeting at an auditorium at the company\u2019s offices in Sunnyvale, California.  Sonamtso, a campaigns director for Students for a Free Tibet who goes by one name, said at the meeting on behalf of SumOfUs that Alphabet is too big to manage.  It should sell off some assets now \u201crather than waiting for antitrust regulators to set a path\u201d and potentially deriving less shareholder value, Sonamtso said.  But the proposal and 13 other shareholder measures opposed by the company were voted down on Wednesday, according to its preliminary tally. Alphabet\u2019s top two executives, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, hold 51.3 percent of shareholder votes.  Nevertheless, it shows a growing focus on the prospect of antitrust action against Alphabet and other big technology firms such as Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc as they face a political and public backlash over privacy issues and the power they now wield over the world\u2019s information.  U.S. President Donald Trump has been a frequent critic of Google, claiming without evidence that its search engine unfairly produces results unfavorable to him. He has suggested that U.S. regulators should follow Europe\u2019s lead and look closely at tech companies\u2019 monopolies, but has not suggested any specific remedy.  The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission are gearing up to investigate whether Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook misuse their massive market power, sources told Reuters earlier this month.  The 14 proposals on Alphabet\u2019s ballot were the most on any U.S. public company\u2019s ballot in a decade, according to research firm ISS Analytics, reflecting the breadth of issues facing the tech giant.  Four Alphabet employees at the meeting separately urged company leaders to address other issues, including offering equitable pay and benefits to all employees and contractors, increasing workforce diversity and doing more to tackle climate change.  Alphabet said in shareholder materials its existing policies address the proposed measures and declined to comment further.  Activists said they were optimistic that sustained pressure could prompt change.  \u201cWe started as a voice in the wilderness on some of these issues, but conversations have come more to the fore,\u201d SumOfUs campaign manager Sondhya Gupta said.  Alphabet shares were down 0.4 percent at $1100.65.","79":"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s shares closed 6% down on Monday following reports that the U.S. Justice Department may investigate Google for hampering competition.

REUTERS\/Dave Paresh  The potential investigation represents the latest attack on a tech company by the Trump administration, which has accused social media companies and Google of suppressing conservative voices on their platforms online.  Alphabet\u2019s market capitalization was reduced by $54 billion as its shares recorded their biggest drop outside earnings since April 2011. Facebook Inc closed 7.5% down, while Amazon.com Inc fell about 5%.  Amazon shares were also pressured by news that the company could face heightened antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between U.S. regulators, which puts the e-commerce giant under the trade commission\u2019s watch.  Evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey cut his price target on the Alphabet stock by $50 to $1,200, the second lowest on Wall Street and well below the median price target of $1,350.  \u201cFor investors, the investigation comes at a time when the stock\u2019s bull case is challenged by concerns of an abrupt revenue slowdown last quarter,\u201d Rippey said.  \u201cWhile precedent suggests that Google enjoys broad discretion over the direction of search results, the questions arising from an investigation will challenge the possibility of multiple expansion,\u201d he added.  Google\u2019s search, YouTube, reviews, maps and other businesses, which are largely free to consumers but financed through advertising, have catapulted it from a start-up to one of the world\u2019s richest companies in just two decades.  Along the way, it has made enemies in the tech world, who have complained to law enforcers about its market dominance, and also in Washington, where lawmakers have complained about issues from its alleged political bias to its plans for China.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post said a possible investigation could lead to a breakup.  \u201cTo break up Google, the DoJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition. It is very rare to break up a company but not unheard of,\u201d Post wrote in a note.  Google also faced a widespread outage on Sunday as it experienced high levels of congestion in the eastern United States, affecting multiple services in Google Cloud, G Suite and YouTube. The company later said it identified the root cause and resolved the issue, but did not elaborate further.  The U.S. Justice Department has jurisdiction for a potential probe of Apple Inc as part of a broader review of whether technology giants are using their size to act in an anti-competitive manner, two sources told Reuters.","80":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Wednesday announced a new hiring goal and security policy to address racial issues at its offices, as protests over police brutality against African Americans have carried into discussions about corporate culture.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured outs a Google office near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 8, 2019. REUTERS\/Dave Paresh  Alphabet\u2019s board formed a special litigation committee last spring after several shareholder groups filed lawsuits alleging that company directors breached their fiduciary duties by covering up sexual misconduct claims against two former top executives over the past five years.  Four of the lawsuits were joined together in June in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California, and Alphabet was expected to respond to the allegations by Nov. 8.  But Alphabet and the plaintiffs said in a joint court filing on Oct. 18 that because the internal investigation was expected to end by early December, they agreed to move the company\u2019s response deadline to Dec. 13 so that it would have the findings from the investigation in hand.  The board committee is working with law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore, the filing said.  CNBC first reported the investigation on Wednesday, citing unspecified materials that showed an independent subcommittee of the board had retained an unnamed law firm to assist with the investigation.  Alphabet said in a statement to Reuters that its investigation had already been noted in the court filings.  \u201cIn early 2019, Alphabet\u2019s board of directors formed a special litigation committee to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct,\u201d the company said.  The company declined to elaborate, and spokespeople for Cravath did not immediately respond to requests to comment.  It is unclear whether Cravath or the special litigation committee have interviewed any alleged victims, witnesses or accused executives, some of whom are no longer at Alphabet.  The investigation includes reviewing the behavior of Alphabet\u2019s chief legal officer, David Drummond, who has been accused of having relationships with employees, CNBC said.  Drummond told news website BuzzFeed in August that he made some mistakes with one relationship he had with a colleague, but said that he had not started any other relationships with a co-worker.  The shareholders suing Alphabet directors and executives include individuals and various labor unions and pension funds, among which is the New York City Employees Retirement System. They have called for Alphabet to enact governance and oversight to stop future workplace conduct issues. They also call for Alphabet directors to pay damages to Alphabet for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties and engaging in corporate waste.  The allegations stem primarily from large severance payments made to Andy Rubin, who led Google\u2019s Android mobile operating division until 2014, and Amit Singhal, head of Google\u2019s search unit until 2016. Company investigations into both men had found accusations of sexual harassment against them to be credible, according to the lawsuits.  Rubin and Singhal have disputed the allegations.","95":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window)  * Alphabet, Amazon tumble on weak results, forecasts  * Growth stocks hit; Facebook, Apple, Netflix down 2-5 pct  * GDP growth slows less than expected in third quarter  * Indexes down: Dow 1.10 pct, S&P 1.56 pct, Nasdaq 1.98 pct (Updates prices to open)  Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged on Friday as grim earnings reports from Amazon and Alphabet rekindled a rush to dump technology and high-growth stocks, but data showing economic growth in the last quarter slowed less than expected provided some relief.  The Nasdaq dropped nearly 2 percent, sharply cutting its gains for the year and moving deeper into correction territory, while the blue-chip Dow shed 1.1 percent and the benchmark S&P fell 1.56 percent, putting under threat their slim gains for the year.  Amazon.com Inc tumbled 7.1 percent after it not just missed quarterly sales estimates, but also gave a below par holiday-season sales forecast.  Google-parent Alphabet Inc sank 3.3 percent after its revenue missed estimates, fanning concerns that investments in new businesses, rising regulatory scrutiny and competition are producing slow returns.  That triggered a sell-off in other members of the so-called FAANG group. Both Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc dropped 2.3 percent and Apple Inc slid 1.5 percent.  All of the 11 major S&P sectors were in the red, with the communication services taking the steepest hit with a 2.06 percent fall and technology stocks down 1.48 percent.  \u201cWhen the stocks that are carrying the markets begin to crack, investors are going take cover. Investors are waiting for more visibility for things to see where the rotation takes them,\u201d said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.  On the brighter side was data that showed gross domestic product increased at a 3.5 percent annualized rate in the third quarter as a tariff-related drop in soybean exports was partly offset by the strongest consumer spending in nearly four years and a surge in inventory investment.  \u201cThis is seen as a slight positive. There\u2019s less pressure on the Federal Reserve to do something (on interest rates),\u201d Bakhos said.  While U.S. economic growth kept apace despite trade wars, the same cannot be said of U.S. corporate profit growth, as a slew of disappointing forecasts this earnings season showed how tariffs, rising wages and borrowing costs as well as jitters over geopolitical events are hurting companies.  At 9:56 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 274.85 points, or 1.10 percent, at 24,709.70, the S&P 500 was down 42.12 points, or 1.56 percent, at 2,663.45 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 144.96 points, or 1.98 percent, at 7,173.38.  A clutch of weak outlook on Wednesday pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory and erased the Dow and the S&P 500\u2019s gains for the year. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp\u2019s strong earnings led a rally that pulled the S&P and Dow back into the black for 2018.  Microsoft, whose strong results helped push the Nasdaq to its biggest daily gain since March just a day earlier, fell 1.2 percent.  Intel Corp defied weakness to gain 3.6 percent after its better-than-expected quarterly results, though interim Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan said trade tensions with China could be a \u201cheadwind\u201d next year.  Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 5.14-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.38-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.  The S&P index recorded no new 52-week highs and 51 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded three new highs and 173 new lows.

The move is the latest in a series of platform crackdowns on the unfounded and sprawling conspiracy theory.  WHAT IS QANON?  QAnon followers espouse an intertwined series of beliefs, based on anonymous Web postings from \u201cQ,\u201d who claims to have insider knowledge of the Trump administration.  A core tenet of the conspiracy theory is that U.S. President Donald Trump is secretly fighting a cabal of child-sex predators that includes prominent Democrats, Hollywood elites and \u201cdeep state\u201d allies.  QAnon, which borrows some elements from the bogus \u201cpizzagate\u201d theory about a pedophile ring run out of a Washington, D.C., restaurant, has become a \u201cbig tent\u201d conspiracy theory encompassing misinformation about topics ranging from alien landings to vaccine safety.  Followers of QAnon say a so-called Great Awakening is coming to bring salvation.  HOW HAS IT SPREAD ONLINE?  The \u201cQ\u201d posts, which started in 2017 on the message board 4chan, are now posted on 8kun, a rebranded version of the shuttered web board 8chan.  QAnon has been amplified on Twitter, Facebook , Instagram and YouTube, the video streaming service of Google.  Media investigations have shown that social media recommendation algorithms can drive people who show an interest in conspiracy theories toward more material.  A report by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) found that the number of users engaging in discussion of QAnon on Twitter and Facebook have surged this year, with membership of QAnon groups on Facebook growing by 120% in March.  Researchers say Russian government-supported organizations are playing a small but increasing role in amplifying the conspiracy theories.  QAnon backers helped organize real-life protests against child trafficking in August and were involved in a pro-police demonstration in Portland, Oregon.  QAnon also looks poised to gain a toehold in the U.S. House of Representatives, with at least one Republican candidate who espouses its beliefs on track to win in the Nov. 3 elections.  WHAT ARE ONLINE PLATFORMS DOING ABOUT IT?  Twitter in July said it would stop recommending QAnon content and accounts in a crackdown it expected would affect about 150,000 accounts. It also said it would block QAnon URLs and permanently suspend QAnon accounts coordinating abuse or violating its rules.  Facebook Inc in October stepped up its earlier actions against QAnon by saying it would remove any Facebook pages, groups and Instagram accounts \u201crepresenting\u201d QAnon. It had previously announced a ban on ads that praised or represented militarized social movements and QAnon.  Following these moves, video platform YouTube said it was banning content that targets an individual or a group using conspiracy theories such as QAnon or pizzagate that have \u201cbeen used to justify real-world violence.\u201d  YouTube has also said it reduces its recommendations of certain QAnon videos that \u201ccould misinform users in harmful ways.\u201d ISD researchers found that about 20% of all QAnon-related Facebook posts contained YouTube links. YouTube does not have a specific ban on monetizing QAnon content.  A spokeswoman for the short-form video app TikTok said QAnon content \u201cfrequently contains disinformation and hate speech\u201d and that it has blocked dozens of QAnon hashtags.  A Reddit spokeswoman told Reuters the site has removed QAnon communities that repeatedly violated its rules since 2018, when it took down forums such as r\/greatawakening.  E-commerce site Etsy also said in October it was removing all QAnon merchandise from its marketplace. A review of Amazon.com Inc and Ebay Inc showed sellers listing QAnon-branded items including books, face masks, T-shirts and hats.  Amazon and Ebay did not immediately respond to questions about whether they were taking specific actions against QAnon products.

They also call for Alphabet directors to pay damages to Alphabet for allegedly breaching their fiduciary duties and engaging in corporate waste.  The allegations stem primarily from large severance payments to Andy Rubin, who led Google\u2019s Android mobile operating division until 2014, and Amit Singhal, head of Google\u2019s search unit until 2016.

Plaintiff James Martin obtained the documents through a \u201cshareholder inspection demand,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Google provided them on the condition they not be published, according to his attorneys, and details from the minutes are redacted across at least eight pages in the 82-page lawsuit filed on Thursday.

The employee demonstrations followed a New York Times report in October that said Google in 2014 gave a $90 million exit package to Rubin.  Ellen Winick Stross, an attorney for Rubin, said on Thursday that Martin\u2019s lawsuit, \u201clike much of the recent media coverage, mischaracterizes Andy\u2019s departure from Google and sensationalizes claims made about Andy by his ex-wife. Andy left Google voluntarily. Andy denies any misconduct, and we look forward to telling his story in court.\u201d  Employee organizers said they welcomed the lawsuits as they continue to push for further changes, including an employee representative on Alphabet\u2019s board.

In its first-half 2018 transparency report on government data requests to its website, Apple separated out National Security Letters and requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. Apple had combined numbers for the two items since it began reporting them in 2014.  Apple had previously published its aggregate number sooner than other technology companies that broke them out separately because the FISA numbers are subject to a six-month reporting delay by law.  Apple will also report the number of FISA requests for a user\u2019s content versus those not inquiring about such content.  The changes will mean longer delays in Apple\u2019s reporting of overall national security requests. But the new format is similar to those for companies such as Microsoft and Google, making it easier for researchers and the public to compare.  From January through June, Apple received 0 to 499 National Security Letters, which function somewhat like subpoenas, related to 1,000 to 1,499 users, the company said. Because of the reporting changes, Apple did not cite the number of FISA requests received for the first half of 2018 but will do so after Dec. 31.  Apple on Thursday also changed the way it presents data on government requests, launching an interactive website that makes it easier for consumers to look up government data requests in their home country. It also offered the raw data in a format that makes it easier for researchers to upload into software programs.  Apple said it received 4,177 \u201caccount requests\u201d from the government related to 40,641 users. Law enforcement officials can seek information such as stored photos, email, device backups that might include text messages, contacts or calendars.

The tax strategy was legal and allowed Google to avoid triggering U.S. income taxes or European withholding taxes on the funds, which represent the bulk of its overseas profits.

REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he would consider working with Democrats to regulate social media companies, after he and other conservatives accused companies such as Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google of allegedly stifling right wing views.  In an extended news conference on Wednesday, Trump, however, urged caution in any effort to regulate the social media and technology companies. He did not spell out any specific rules that he would advocate.  \u201cBelieve it or not, I\u2019m one that really likes free speech. A lot of people don\u2019t understand that, but I am a big believer. And when you start regulating, a lot of bad things can happen,\u201d Trump added.  Asked whether he would consider working with Democrats to regulate social media companies, Trump said, \u201cI would do that, yeah. I would look at that.\u201d  Creating new regulations would be inconsistent for a president who has made reducing regulation a goal of his administration. His officials have made numerous such efforts, in particular, toward cutting environmental and financial rules.  Just last month, Trump suggested that Twitter was biased against him and accused the company of deleting many of his followers and making it harder for users to follow him. In a tweet, he said that the company had \u201cstifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all.\u201d  Twitter said then that any reduction was likely due to its recent moves to remove millions of suspicious accounts after it and other social media services were used in misinformation campaigns attempting to influence voters in the 2016 U.S. presidential race and other elections.  Despite his attacks, Trump remains an avid user of Twitter, which allows him to bypass TV news and newspapers in order to communicate directly with supporters.","110":"A Jaguar I-PACE self-driving car is pictured during its unveiling by Waymo in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., March 27, 2018.

Google, which generates more revenue from internet advertising than any other company, benefited from lockdowns that drove retail and other clients online, helping offset cutbacks by travel and entertainment advertisers.  \u201cGoogle\u2019s products and support have been a lifeline for millions of small medium businesses hit hard by the pandemic,\u201d Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts on a conference call.  Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat described the fourth quarter as a \u201cgreat end to a challenging year.\u201d  Alphabet\u2019s 2020 sales growth of 13% was the slowest increase since 2009 when it posted 8.5% growth. Still, matched with spending cuts, Alphabet increased its cash hoard by $17 billion in 2020 to $137 billion.  But now with coronavirus vaccines deployed and advertising spending on the uptick, Porat and other executives said the company would return to expanding the Google Cloud business with staff and data centers and incorporating artificial intelligence into more services.  In a new disclosure, Alphabet said Google Cloud posted an operating loss of $1.24 billion in the fourth quarter and a $5.6 billion loss for 2020, about 21% steeper than 2019\u2019s annual loss.  Google has long faced questions over whether it can spin the cash from its advertising business into a newly profitable venture. Pichai acknowledged that reaching that goal may take some time.  Aided by $3 billion in unrealized startup investment gains, Alphabet\u2019s fourth-quarter profit rose 43% to $15.2 billion, or $22.30 per share, beating estimates of $15.95 per share.  Google\u2019s advertising business, including YouTube, accounted for 81% of Alphabet\u2019s record $56.9 billion in quarterly sales, which rose 23% compared with a year ago.  Cloud sales, also benefiting from the pandemic, were $3.83 billion, or $13.1 billion for the full year, up 46% from 2019.  Analysts tracked by Refinitiv had estimated quarterly revenue of $53.1 billion and Cloud sales of $3.82 billion.  Alphabet said it expects a $2.1 billion boost to operating results in 2021 after a new assessment extended the useful life of its servers and networking gear by a year or more.  Graphic: Google content, data costs soar - here  COSTS, SCRUTINY SOW CONCERNS  Alphabet remains undervalued compared with some rivals. Microsoft Corp shares trade at 10 times expected revenue over the next 12 months and Facebook Inc seven times, while Alphabet shares about six times.  Rising costs, increased competition and a line of regulatory battles are among big concerns for Alphabet investors.  Alphabet\u2019s costs to license programming for YouTube, operate data centers and stock consumer products have soared in recent years. Those other costs of revenue now account for about 27 cents for every $1 in sales, up from 23 cents four years ago.  Google\u2019s lead over the global internet advertising market is shrinking as Amazon.com Inc becomes a bigger threat and China-focused vendors such as Alibaba grow quickly. Last week, research company eMarketer estimated Google will capture 30% of the market in 2021 while increasing sales by 18% to $117 billion.  Google is fighting antitrust investigations or charges across Australia, Asia, Europe and North America.  In addition, Google has threatened to pull its search engine from Australia if the country enforces new rules that would require the company to negotiate fair payments to news publishers to include their content in results.  Analysts also have expressed concern about potential revisions to content moderation and data privacy laws under new U.S. President Joe Biden. Those laws currently favor companies such as Google.","113":"WASHINGTON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google unit won approval from U.S. regulators to deploy a radar-based motion sensing device known as Project Soli.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said in an order late on Monday that it would grant Google a waiver to operate the Soli sensors at higher power levels than currently allowed. The FCC said the sensors can also be operated aboard aircraft.  The FCC said the decision \u201cwill serve the public interest by providing for innovative device control features using touchless hand gesture technology.\u201d  A Google spokeswoman did not immediately comment on Tuesday, citing the New Year\u2019s Day holiday.  The FCC said the Soli sensor captures motion in a three-dimensional space using a radar beam to enable touchless control of functions or features that can benefit users with mobility or speech impairments.  Google says the sensor can allow users to press an invisible button between the thumb and index fingers or a virtual dial that turns by rubbing a thumb against the index finger.  The company says that \u201ceven though these controls are virtual, the interactions feel physical and responsive\u201d as feedback is generated by the haptic sensation of fingers touching.  Google says the virtual tools can approximate the precision of natural human hand motion and the sensor can be embedded in wearables, phones, computers and vehicles.  In March, Google asked the FCC to allow its short-range interactive motion sensing Soli radar to operate in the 57- to 64-GHz frequency band at power levels consistent with European Telecommunications Standards Institute standards. Facebook Inc raised concerns with the FCC that the Soli sensors operating in the spectrum band at higher power levels might have issues coexisting with other technologies.  After discussions, Google and Facebook jointly told the FCC in September that they agreed the sensors could operate at higher than currently allowed power levels without interference but at lower levels than previously proposed by Google.  Facebook told the FCC in September that it expected a \u201cvariety of use cases to develop with respect to new radar devices, including Soli.\u201d  The Soli devices can be operated aboard aircraft but must still comply with Federal Aviation Administration rules governing portable electronic devices.

Global bonds remained under pressure on speculation the Bank of Japan may soon trim its massive stimulus. In China, government bond yields jumped and the offshore yuan hit a one-year low after China\u2019s cabinet said it would pursue a more vigorous fiscal policy and as traders bet on further easing in monetary conditions.  Shanghai blue chips rose 1.5 percent to a one-month high, while MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.6 percent.  The better mood helped Japan\u2019s Nikkei edge up 0.5 percent, even as a disappointing reading on factory activity suggested the threat of a trade war was starting to bite.  E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.2 percent, and European bourses looked set to start higher  Tech stocks got a boost from the parent of Google which jumped 3.6 percent after hours to hit a record high, valuing the group at a cool $870 billion.  That made up for an otherwise dull Monday on Wall Street where the Dow ended down 0.06 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent and the Nasdaq 0.28 percent.  WHO WILL BUY THESE BONDS?  Bond bulls were still smarting from speculation that the Bank of Japan is close to announcing measures to scale back its massive monetary stimulus, a risk that lifted long-term borrowing costs globally.  Markets were worried that Japanese investors would have less incentive to hunt offshore for yield, said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett.  \u201cThe 10 basis-point steepening in the Japanese yield curve is massive in the context of a market that rarely moves more than 1 basis point,\u201d she added.  \u201cIt reflects a broader fear that central banks are reducing their purchases while U.S. bond supply is set to rise significantly.\u201d  As a result, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit their highest in five weeks around 2.96 percent and were again nearing the psychological 3 percent bulwark.  GDP GUESSING GAMES  Part of the shift in yields was because of chatter that data on second-quarter U.S. economic growth (GDP) due on Friday would easily top current forecasts of 4.1 percent.  Dealers noted some media reports President Donald Trump himself was predicting an outcome of 4.8 percent. That would not be out of bounds given the much-watched Atlanta Fed GDP tracker puts growth at an annualised 4.5 percent.  Such a strong outcome would only add to the risk of faster rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and underpin the dollar.  Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was hovering at 94.697 compared to a low of 94.207 on Monday. It bought 111.30 yen, against Monday\u2019s trough of 110.75.  The euro lapsed to $1.1680, having run into profit-taking at a peak of $1.1750 overnight.  In commodity markets, oil prices eased as the focus turned to oversupply worries and away from escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

To use Waymo\u2019s service, dubbed Waymo One, riders must download an app and provide a credit card number, similar to ridesharing services Uber and Lyft. A human driver will be behind the wheel, but only to intervene in case of emergency.  Major challenges remain, starting with technical hurdles. A Waymo One taxi tested by Reuters last week proved slow and jerky at times. Whether customers will continue using the service once the novelty wears off remains to be seen. Regulations governing the industry across the country are an incoherent patchwork, a significant hurdle to fast expansion.  Waymo would not say exactly how many of its cars would be on the road in Arizona. It said its around-the-clock service initially would be limited to \u201chundreds\u201d of people invited to sign up last year. For now, pricing is roughly in line with that of Uber and Lyft. A 15-minute, 3-mile (4.8 km) drive taken by Reuters last week cost $7.59, just above the $7.22 offered by Lyft.  \u201cOver time, we hope to make Waymo One available to even more members of the public,\u201d Chief Executive John Krafcik wrote in a blog on Wednesday. \u201cSelf-driving technology is new to many, so we\u2019re proceeding carefully.\u201d  The company has been testing its driverless cars for a decade. Its fleet, now numbering 600 vehicles, has logged more than 10 million miles on public roads in and around 25 U.S. cities. Alphabet does not disclose its total investment, but industry experts put that sum at well over $1 billion.  Monetizing driverless technology has been slow going. A handful of startups, including Boston-based Optimus Ride, have managed to win contracts providing self-driving services in enclosed, low-speed environments such as business parks and retirement communities.  Launching taxi service on the streets of metro Phoenix underscores Waymo\u2019s big ambitions, said Ryan Chin, co-founder and chief executive of Optimus Ride.  \u201cIf you\u2019re going to invest that much capital and time and engineering, you have to go for these larger robotaxi markets,\u201d Chin said. \u201cYou may start in the smaller markets but the bigger goal is to go for the big fish.\u201d  Klaus Froehlich, BMW\u2019s global head of development, said Waymo\u2019s move puts pressure on all robotaxi hopefuls to move quickly to grab market share before others enter the game.  That strategy has been key in ridesharing, where first movers such as San Francisco-based Uber and China\u2019s Didi Chuxing have proven tough to dislodge in many cities where they operate. Driverless vehicles are the next step in the race to shape urban mobility.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  \u201cWaymo is now accelerating ... because if they wait two or three years longer they will get overtaken,\u201d Froehlich said on the sidelines of last week\u2019s Los Angeles auto show. \u201cSo they have to move early, even though that\u2019s quite a risky thing for them.\u201d  \u201cGOOD AFTERNOON, WAYMO RIDER\u201d  Waymo invited Reuters to ride in a white Chrysler Pacifica hybrid modified with the company\u2019s technology through the streets of Chandler, Ariz., a city about 22 miles (35 km) southeast of Phoenix. A dome-shaped sensor atop the car was the primary clue that this was no ordinary vehicle.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  Inside, a safety driver sat at the wheel, with a Waymo representative in the front passenger seat. Two video screens built into the seatbacks, facing the backseat passengers, read \u201cGood afternoon, Waymo Rider.\u201d The monitors showed the car\u2019s trajectory, and contained touchscreen buttons that could be tapped to summon an outside Waymo operator with any questions.  The drive took place on city streets with moderate traffic on wide, well-paved roads on a relatively clear day. But even in these favorable conditions, Waymo\u2019s technology performed much like a student driver: slow and timid.  The vehicle was hyper-aware of pedestrians and had trouble distinguishing their intentions. For example, it stopped for a man standing at a crosswalk talking on his cellphone even though it was clear that he was not going to cross the street.  The car slowed well ahead of stop signs and drove at a snail\u2019s pace over speed bumps. Yet it sometimes executed lane changes with an unsettling jerk as an automated voice over the speaker system called out \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright.\u201d That is a feature Waymo says helps riders understand what the car is doing.  Other maneuvers came off without a hitch, including one of the trickiest: crossing three lanes of oncoming traffic to execute a left turn into a parking lot.  The safety driver never touched the wheel during the entire drive. Waymo says it will phase out these human minders eventually, but has given no timeline for doing so.  Navigating an uncertain U.S. regulatory environment could prove even more challenging.  Arizona has fewer regulations on self-driving cars than most states, a major factor in Waymo\u2019s decision to launch there. The rest of the country is a jumble of sometimes contradictory requirements. Federal guidance has yet to arrive.  A bill that would speed the use of self-driving cars without human controls has been stalled in the U.S. Senate for over a year. Meanwhile, rules on key issues such as data, privacy, liability and cyber security are still undecided.  For now, Waymo says it is focused on the Phoenix area, where it hopes to gain valuable insights into supply and demand, as it awaits decisions from regulators.","129":"FILE PHOTO: Visitors pass by the logo of Google at the high profile startups and high tech leaders gathering, Viva Tech,in Paris, France May 16, 2019.

REUTERS\/Brandon Wade  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters Breakingviews) - The reshuffle of chief executives at Google and parent Alphabet is something of a solution in search of a problem. Sundar Pichai, who runs the search engine, will now also lead the $890 billion Alphabet, replacing Larry Page. Sergey Brin, Page\u2019s fellow co-founder, will step back too, according to Tuesday\u2019s announcement. But an overriding reason for the change is elusive.  Establishing Alphabet as a holding company in 2015 was a head-scratcher anyway. The idea was to have various units, from Google to self-driving division Waymo, operate independently. Page became CEO of the parent firm while Brin became president, and Pichai was put in charge at Google.  Part of the rationale was to allow Alphabet\u2019s so-called \u201cother bets\u201d to flourish. But they were really the co-founders\u2019 pet projects, and their revenue was and remains a fraction of Google\u2019s advertising machine, which includes YouTube. In the third quarter, non-Google sales amounted to just 0.3% of Alphabet\u2019s total of $40.5 billion.  Perhaps the partial reversal is a recognition that the other bets haven\u2019t yet taken off \u2013 and the fact that Brin and Page were already taking a back seat, although they retain a lot of influence through their supervoting shares. Their willingness to cede to Pichai, just like their acceptance of Eric Schmidt as adult supervision earlier in their company\u2019s life, is sensible, too.  Alphabet said the move simplifies the management structure. It certainly reflects reality: Pichai is already the most high-profile public face of the company, a role that will become increasingly important amidst regulatory scrutiny in Washington and Brussels. He testified before Congress a year ago.  The shift will probably spare the two co-founders any demands to show up themselves in the future. It also frees them to focus more on other projects both within and outside Alphabet. For example, Page backs space-mining firm Planetary Resources.  As for Pichai, he gets a promotion and will now explicitly run the world\u2019s third-most valuable public company. There\u2019s a lot to be said for succession steps that elicit little more than a shrug from investors.","131":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors CoGM.N will use embedded Google technology to power navigation, voice activated controls and other vehicle infotainment functions starting in 2021, in a win for Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O in the race with Amazon.com and other technology companies to control dashboards.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Roosevelt Cassio  GM said it will offer Google Assistant, Google Maps and other applications available through the Google Play app store in all its vehicle brands outside China, which is GM\u2019s largest single market. GM said the first vehicles with built-in Google infotainment technology will launch in 2021, with more models rolling out in the following years.  Google has previously struck deals to embed infotainment technology in cars built by allied automakers Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Volvo Cars, owned by China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.  Amazon is wooing automakers to embed its rival Alexa voice assistant technology in vehicles.  For years, GM and other automakers were reluctant to share dashboard space with Google, Apple Inc AAPL.O and other tech companies. Automakers feared losing control of valuable data, and having their brands eclipsed by powerful Silicon Valley names.  Consumers are, however, forcing automakers to shift gears. Connecting smartphones and apps to cars can be a clumsy experience because of automakers\u2019 poor technology, but having functionality built in from internet giants has begun to make for a smoother experience.  \u201cWe have the ability today to give commands to vehicles with embedded voice assistants. It is very limited,\u201d Santiago Chamorro, GM\u2019s vice president for Global Connected Customer Experience, said in an interview. \u201cWith Google voice assistant it is a better experience for them.\u201d  Patrick Brady, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering, said the issue of harvesting and monetizing data is \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d when it comes to cars.  \u201cWe are working to bring services into the car,\u201d he said. Google will not have access to data about the way an individual drives, or data about the vehicle\u2019s maintenance needs, he said.  GM could though enable customers to schedule vehicle maintenance using Google\u2019s voice commands, Chamorro said.  The automaker said pricing for packages that include Google services will be set closer to vehicle launches. GM will continue to offer Apple Inc\u2019s CarPlay and AndroidAuto to allow consumers to project a version of their smartphone screen onto a dashboard screen.  GM was a pioneer in offering drivers an on-board concierge service through its Onstar telematics system, which connects drivers to human operators. Some of the services those operators provide, such as turn-by-turn navigation, Google technology delivers with its automated system.  Chamorro said GM will continue the Onstar service, which GM has promoted recently as a form of insurance, connecting motorists to an operator who can help in an emergency. \u201cThat is fundamentally a human activity,\u201d Chamorro said. \u201cWe have 100 trained technicians\u201d who can respond when an Onstar customer is in danger.  For Google, the GM agreement offers the potential of embedding technology in as many as 3.6 million cars annually - the number of vehicles GM sold outside China last year. The Renault-Nissan alliance sells more than 10 million vehicles a year. Google\u2019s Brady said the company is discussing deals with other automakers but for now is focused on launching embedded systems with GM, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Volvo.  \u201cWe are mostly focusing on making those partnerships successful,\u201d he said.","132":"PARIS (Reuters) - France\u2019s top administrative court upheld a 50 million-euro fine ($56 million) imposed last year on Alphabet\u2019s Google for breaching European Union online privacy rules, it said on Friday.

A spokeswoman for Google said in a written statement on Friday Google would review possible changes.  \u201cPeople expect to understand and control how their data is used, and we\u2019ve invested in industry-leading tools that help them do both,\u201d the statement said.  \u201cThis case was not about whether consent is needed for personalised advertising, but about how exactly it should be obtained. In light of this decision, we will now review what changes we need to make.\u201d  The French regulator CNIL in January last year found the world\u2019s biggest search engine lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informs users about its handling of personal data and failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.  Its decision relied on the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the biggest shake-up of data privacy laws in more than two decades, which came into force in 2018.  It allows users to better control their personal data and gives regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for violations.  France\u2019s supreme administrative court, the Council of State, on Friday confirmed the CNIL\u2019s reading of the case.  \u201c(The court) also notes that the information available is sometimes incomplete, in particular regarding the data retention period and the purposes of the various processing operations carried out by Google,\u201d it said.","133":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Waymo on Wednesday showed off a 360-degree video to help people envision what it is like to ride inside an autonomous vehicle, as the Alphabet Inc company on the cusp of launching self-driving rides with real people hopes to win over potential passengers.  FILE PHOTO: Waymo unveils a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Waymo said in a blog post that it had driven more than 5 million miles (8.05 million km) on public roads, doubling its miles since January 2017, when it unveiled its improved self-driving system installed in Chrysler Pacifica minivans at the Detroit auto show.  Waymo's blog linked to a 3-minute, 36-second video posted on YouTube (here). It comes ahead of what will be Waymo's first foray into ride hailing with no human behind the steering wheel in Phoenix, Arizona, in coming months.  Convincing a potentially wary public of the merits - and safety - of self-driving is a key goal of Waymo, considered a pioneer in the global race to deploy autonomous vehicles.  A Gallup poll published last week found that 54 percent of the 3,297 U.S. respondents said they were \u201cunlikely\u201d to use self-driving cars, with 59 percent saying they would feel uncomfortable riding in one. The survey was conducted in September and October.  Large tech companies, big automakers and well-funded startups have been testing such cars, but for the most part real passengers have not yet been added to the mix. Experts believe self-driving cars used in fleets for ride hailing services are among the most economically viable ways to deploy such technology broadly.  The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars, which has made it a key testing ground for the technology.  Waymo said in November that members of the public using a ride-hailing app would be able to ride in its fleet of minivans in ensuing months. At first, a Waymo employee would accompany the passengers in the backseat, but eventually they will travel alone. The company has been testing its cars in Arizona with an employee in the back seat and no one at the wheel since October.  The passenger service is expected to roll out in more geographical areas in the United States, at a later, unannounced date.","134":"June 3 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s shares fell as much as 7% on Monday following reports that the U.S. Justice Department may investigate Google for hampering competition.  The potential investigation represents the latest attack on a tech company by the Trump administration, which has accused social media companies and Google of suppressing conservative voices on their platforms online.  Alphabet\u2019s market capitalization was reduced by $54 billion as its shares recorded their biggest drop outside earnings since April 2011. Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc were both down about 3%.  Amazon shares were also pressured by news that the company could face heightened antitrust scrutiny under a new agreement between U.S. regulators which puts the e-commerce giant under the trade commission\u2019s watch.  Evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey cut his price target on the Alphabet stock by $50 to $1200, the second lowest on Wall Street and well below the median price target of $1350.  \u201cFor investors, the investigation comes at a time when the stock\u2019s bull case is challenged by concerns of an abrupt revenue slowdown last quarter,\u201d Rippey said.  \u201cWhile precedent suggests that Google enjoys broad discretion over the direction of search results, the questions arising from an investigation will challenge the possibility of multiple expansion,\u201d he added.  Google\u2019s search, YouTube, reviews, maps and other businesses, which are largely free to consumers but financed through advertising, have catapulted it from a start-up to one of the world\u2019s richest companies in just two decades.  Along the way, it has made enemies in the tech world, who have complained to law enforcers about its market dominance, and also in Washington, where lawmakers have complained about issues from its alleged political bias to its plans for China.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post said a possible investigation could lead to a breakup.  \u201cTo break up Google, the DoJ would likely have to file a lawsuit and convince judges that Google has undermined competition. It is very rare to break up a company but not unheard of,\u201d Post wrote in a note.  Google also faced a widespread outage on Sunday as it experienced high levels of congestion in the eastern United States, affecting multiple services in Google Cloud, G Suite and YouTube.

If a phone user is found to be infected, people who spent more than 15 minutes within a radius of one meter (3.3 feet) of that individual sometime over the previous 14 days will be notified that they were in close contact with a coronavirus-infected person, and be prompted to seek medical consultation.

Tap out \"I love\" and Gmail might propose \"you\" or \"it.\"  But users are out of luck if the object of their affection is \u201chim\u201d or \u201cher.\u201d  Google\u2019s technology will not suggest gender-based pronouns because the risk is too high that its \u201cSmart Compose\u201d technology might predict someone\u2019s sex or gender identity incorrectly and offend users, product leaders revealed to Reuters in interviews.  Gmail product manager Paul Lambert said a company research scientist discovered the problem in January when he typed \u201cI am meeting an investor next week,\u201d and Smart Compose suggested a possible follow-up question: \u201cDo you want to meet him?\u201d instead of \u201cher.\u201d  Consumers have become accustomed to embarrassing gaffes from autocorrect on smartphones. But Google refused to take chances at a time when gender issues are reshaping politics and society, and critics are scrutinizing potential biases in artificial intelligence like never before.  \u201cNot all \u2018screw ups\u2019 are equal,\u201d Lambert said. Gender is a \u201ca big, big thing\u201d to get wrong.  Getting Smart Compose right could be good for business. Demonstrating that Google understands the nuances of AI better than competitors is part of the company\u2019s strategy to build affinity for its brand and attract customers to its AI-powered cloud computing tools, advertising services and hardware.  Gmail has 1.5 billion users, and Lambert said Smart Compose assists on 11 percent of messages worldwide sent from Gmail.com, where the feature first launched.  Smart Compose is an example of what AI developers call natural language generation (NLG), in which computers learn to write sentences by studying patterns and relationships between words in literature, emails and web pages.  A system shown billions of human sentences becomes adept at completing common phrases but is limited by generalities. Men have long dominated fields such as finance and science, for example, so the technology would conclude from the data that an investor or engineer is \u201che\u201d or \u201chim.\u201d The issue trips up nearly every major tech company.  Lambert said the Smart Compose team of about 15 engineers and designers tried several workarounds, but none proved bias-free or worthwhile. They decided the best solution was the strictest one: Limit coverage. The gendered pronoun ban affects fewer than 1 percent of cases where Smart Compose would propose something, Lambert said.  FILE PHOTO: The Google name is displayed outside the company's office in London, Britain, November 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Toby Melville\/File Photo  \u201cThe only reliable technique we have is to be conservative,\u201d said Prabhakar Raghavan, who oversaw engineering of Gmail and other services until a recent promotion.  NEW POLICY  Google\u2019s decision to play it safe on gender follows some high-profile embarrassments for the company\u2019s predictive technologies.  The company apologized in 2015 when the image recognition feature of its photo service labeled a black couple as gorillas. In 2016, Google altered its search engine\u2019s autocomplete function after it suggested the anti-Semitic query \u201care jews evil\u201d when users sought information about Jews.  Google has banned expletives and racial slurs from its predictive technologies, as well as mentions of its business rivals or tragic events.  The company\u2019s new policy banning gendered pronouns also affected the list of possible responses in Google\u2019s Smart Reply. That service allow users to respond instantly to text messages and emails with short phrases such as \u201csounds good.\u201d  Google uses tests developed by its AI ethics team to uncover new biases. A spam and abuse team pokes at systems, trying to find \u201cjuicy\u201d gaffes by thinking as hackers or journalists might, Lambert said.  Workers outside the United States look for local cultural issues. Smart Compose will soon work in four other languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French.  \u201cYou need a lot of human oversight,\u201d said engineering leader Raghavan, because \u201cin each language, the net of inappropriateness has to cover something different.\u201d  WIDESPREAD CHALLENGE  Google is not the only tech company wrestling with the gender-based pronoun problem.  Agolo, a New York startup that has received investment from Thomson Reuters, uses AI to summarize business documents.  Its technology cannot reliably determine in some documents which pronoun goes with which name. So the summary pulls several sentences to give users more context, said Mohamed AlTantawy, Agolo\u2019s chief technology officer.  He said longer copy is better than missing details. \u201cThe smallest mistakes will make people lose confidence,\u201d AlTantawy said. \u201cPeople want 100 percent correct.\u201d  Yet, imperfections remain. Predictive keyboard tools developed by Google and Apple Inc AAPL.O propose the gendered \"policeman\" to complete \"police\" and \"salesman\" for \"sales.\"  Type the neutral Turkish phrase \"one is a soldier\" into Google Translate and it spits out \"he's a soldier\" in English. So do translation tools from Alibaba BABA.N and Microsoft Corp MSFT.O. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O opts for \"she\" for the same phrase on its translation service for cloud computing customers.  AI experts have called on the companies to display a disclaimer and multiple possible translations.  Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn said it avoids gendered pronouns in its year-old predictive messaging tool, Smart Replies, to ward off potential blunders.  Alibaba and Amazon did not respond to requests to comment.  Warnings and limitations like those in Smart Compose remain the most-used countermeasures in complex systems, said John Hegele, integration engineer at Durham, North Carolina-based Automated Insights Inc, which generates news articles from statistics.  \u201cThe end goal is a fully machine-generated system where it magically knows what to write,\u201d Hegele said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a ton of advances made but we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d","137":"(Updates to U.S. equity market open; changes dateline, previous LONDON)  * Gloom lifts off stocks after recent tech rout  * World shares set for first quarterly loss in 2 years  * Dollar steadies, Treasury yields move lower  By Trevor Hunnicutt  NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Riskier assets such as stocks steadied on Thursday, after a woeful week for giant technology companies, even as global equities careened towards their first quarterly drop in two years.  Stock indexes tracked by the 47-country MSCI index glided 0.61 percent higher, as trading opened in New York with Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Google parent Alphabet Inc retaking the market\u2019s leadership mantle.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 239.46 points, or 1 percent, to 24,087.88, the S&P 500 gained 25.23 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,630.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.75 points, or 0.99 percent, to 7,017.98.  Despite the equity gains, safe-haven bonds also advanced in price. The U.S. dollar weakened, stalling its sharp rise.  The turbulent start to 2018 in financial markets has brought an end to one of the longest quarterly bull runs, and there have been few places to hide.  Investors have faced the biggest ever rise in stock volatility, rapidly escalating tensions over global trade, deepening turmoil in the White House and major wobbles in the tech sector.  A \u201cmelt-up\u201d that sent the MSCI\u2019s world share index up 8 percent in January suddenly melted away. Now, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, FTSE, Nikkei and scores of other major indexes are all down for the year.  \u201cWe have got to make sure (the market selloff) ...is not too prolonged because the longer this goes, the higher the chance it will start to affect the man in the street,\u201d said Roger Jones, the head of equities at London & Capital.  Facebook, Apple and some of their peers were hurt this quarter as investors rethought high U.S. stock valuations in light of the prospect of a U.S.-China trade war and potentially increased regulation of tech companies.  Reuters\u2019 monthly markets poll showed the trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting their equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose in price to yield 2.7534 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Wednesday. That pushed the gap between U.S. short- and long-dated Treasuries to its tightest level in a decade. Some investors see a narrowing between those bonds\u2019 yields as a sign the economy will sputter.  For currency traders, the dollar settled too after a stronger-than-expected revision to U.S. fourth quarter economic growth data and hopes a nuclear standoff with North Korea has been averted gave it its largest daily gain in nearly seven months on Wednesday. An index of the greenback against its trading partners rose 0.08 percent.  A 45-year low in jobless claims helped the tentative return of risk appetite, and U.S. inflation data also cooled safety plays including Treasuries and German Bunds.  Oil managed a rebound despite data on Wednesday that showed a surprise build in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. crude rose 0.62 percent to $64.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $69.11, up 0.51 percent on the day.  In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.6 percent, while Shanghai closed up 1.2 percent and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng recovered from an early wobble to add 0.3 percent.

Driven by ad sales, second-quarter revenue and earnings beat analysts\u2019 expectations. In addition, the world\u2019s largest online search and ads firm, unlike No. 2 online ad player Facebook Inc a day earlier, offered no worrisome guidance about increasing regulatory scrutiny.  The results helped Alphabet dismiss as a rare blip a $1 billion revenue miss in the first quarter, which had prompted an outburst of investor questions and the biggest one-day sell-off in its shares in about seven years.  In after-hours trade on Thursday, the shares rose to $1,226.60, on track for their biggest single-day increase in four years though still down about 4% from their high before the April slide.  Alphabet\u2019s shares have lagged peers on Wall Street this year, rising about 9 percent through Thursday\u2019s close, compared to a roughly 20% gain for the S&P 500 broadly.  Questions linger about whether privacy, content moderation and antitrust rules proposed or already passed in the United States and other high-revenue countries will slash ad prices. Google also faces an industrywide slowdown in ad sales in the United States and Europe, with revenue from emerging markets not yet picking up the slack.

That was up 19% over last year and compared with 17% growth in the first quarter. Analysts on average estimated 16.8% growth and $38.2 billion in revenue, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The last time that Alphabet had two consecutive quarters of revenue growth below 20% was three years ago.  Executives said the latest results backed their contention that the performance recently has been affected by currency exchange rates and one-off fluctuations rather than advertiser flight or some deeper challenge to its business.  Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, appeared to dispel other analyst concerns, saying the company has seen \u201cvirtually no impact\u201d to revenue from efforts to stop running ads on YouTube videos that some have characterized as extremist or hateful.  Alphabet authorized up to $25 billion in new stock buybacks, aiming to make use of its $121 billion in cash.  Pichai said quarterly revenue from licensing cloud computing services and workplace software jumped to about $2 billion, from its last disclosure of $1 billion at the end of 2017.

REUTERS\/Arnd WIegmann  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Alphabet still runs fast, but its pace is slowing. It\u2019s a common problem that comes with aging. A potential bid for device-maker Fitbit could bring new youthful energy for the $880 billion firm, or just a slightly expanded waistline.  The owner of Google showed on Monday that its core business of selling online ads still pumps out profit. Alphabet\u2019s revenue hit $40.5 billion in the third quarter of the year, an increase of 20% from last year. But that\u2019s less rapid than its rate a year ago. Internet advertising is maturing and rival Amazon is pushing hard \u2013 that business is the main component of a part of Jeff Bezos\u2019 e-commerce giant that grew over 40%.  The offer for Fitbit that Reuters reported, citing sources, has some logic. Alphabet co-founder and Chief Executive Larry Page has made pushes in mobile devices, smart contacts and delivering broadband via balloon among others. Acquisitions played a part in several of these efforts. While some proved wildly successful \u2013 its mobile ad business success can be pinned in large part to buying the maker of the Android operating system \u2013 others, such as fiber broadband, have been duds.  Healthcare is an area where Google has had little visible success. Perhaps Fitbit\u2019s experience in designing wearables will help Alphabet make useful devices for heart-rate monitoring or glucose monitors. Alphabet could bring heft that Fitbit on its own lacks. The stock is down 70% from its initial public offering in 2015, partly due to the success of Apple\u2019s Watch.  Growing sideways brings pitfalls. As well as being a distraction, an Alphabet bid for Fitbit could draw political scrutiny. Data collected by health trackers is particularly sensitive in the eyes of regulators and antitrust watchdogs have said such information would become a more important part of merger reviews. Fitbit is also a consumer brand members of Congress are likely to understand, or even use.  Fitbit is tiny enough to swallow whole \u2013 its market capitalization at Friday\u2019s close was just $1.1 billion \u2013 and the revenue potential from diversifying into healthcare and medical tracking devices is large. That, though, has to be weighed against the risk of regulatory flack, and a sense that Google is losing focus. There are better ways to regain a youthful stride.","159":"(Reuters) - Bike sharing service Lime said on Monday it raised $335 million from a group of investors including ride-sharing firm Uber Technologies Inc and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O.

Waymo Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik, in a media briefing late on Monday, declined to confirm whether Alphabet plans to sell or spin off Waymo, saying it was \u201ccertainly a possibility for the future.\u201d  Krafcik described the outside investment as part of \u201can evolutionary path that we had always imagined\u201d that could lead to \u201cmore independence\u201d for Waymo.  He said Alphabet would continue to join other investors in funding Waymo.  In addition to Alphabet, initial investors include auto parts supplier Magna International Inc MG.TO, with which Waymo has an assembly deal; U.S. dealership chain AutoNation Inc AN.N, which services and maintains Waymo's vehicles; the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and three large investment firms: Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and Mubadala Investment.  AutoNation said it invested $50 million as part of the initial funding round. Figures for other outside investors were not immediately available.  Silver Lake partner Egon Durban is a nominee for Waymo\u2019s operating board. Andreessen said its partner David George led its investment but is not taking a board seat.  Alphabet CFO Porat said a more \u201cintense focus\u201d on \u201cmetrics and milestones\u201d had already played out at Alphabet\u2019s Verily health care business, which raised $1 billion from Silver Lake and others in January 2019.  \u201cThere\u2019s a valuable added governance discipline when you have additional voices at the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of somewhere between private-independent and public.\u201d  Waymo did not provide a valuation.  Last September, investment bank Morgan Stanley slashed its projected valuation of Waymo to $105 billion from its earlier estimate of $175 billion, saying the commercialization of self-driving vehicles and technology was taking longer than expected.  Krafcik said Waymo plans to offer a range of self-driving transportation services, from its Waymo One ride hailing business in Phoenix through the new Waymo Via logistics business that would bundle local and long-haul delivery.  He said Waymo, which has partnered with Lyft Inc LYFT.O, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL], is considering partnerships with other automakers and transportation service providers in various markets outside North America, but did not provide details.","162":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google is drawing thousands of new customers to gyms and salons each month through an appointment-booking tool released last year, Reuters has learned, a quiet step in the company\u2019s transition to the next generation of search.  The service, known as Reserve with Google, spares users the phone calls, online searching and form filling typically associated with appointments. Say you want a massage at 5 p.m. someplace within a half-mile of work. Google.com\/maps\/reserve displays openings at nearby businesses and allows users to book, and even pay, without having to call or visit another website.  Google declined to comment on performance of the tool, which it launched last March.  But in interviews with Reuters, seven software firms that supply schedule data to Google described the volume as significant, with as much as 75 percent of bookings representing new customers. Consumers like the convenience. Business owners say the tool is putting their names in front of more potential clients.  The early results are a good sign for Google\u2019s strategy for search at a time when it is battling technology rivals to guide consumers to shops, products, recipes, music and more. Google wants to do more than supply users with a list of web pages that they must research themselves. The next step is to complete tasks for them and provide direct solutions.  Google Assistant - the company\u2019s version of Apple Inc\u2019s Siri or Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Alexa - is a central piece of the effort. Users will be able to make Reserve bookings via voice commands to Google Assistant by later this year, people familiar with the matter said. That is something not yet built into Siri or Alexa.  Google says its Assistant will even place robo-calls to businesses to make bookings if a suitable option is not available through Reserve, a feature it showed off in May at Google I\/O, the company\u2019s conference for software developers.  \u201cThere\u2019s a competitive race to be the established consumer brand for appointment booking,\u201d said Marc Woodward, vice president at scheduling software maker Genbook. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to need this omniscient understanding of availability\u201d at businesses.  Google does not charge users or businesses for Reserve. And it has not told schedule partners how it would make money on the service.  Employee Jason Etchingham (L) and co-owner of FLEX, George Mardigian, look over reservations at his gym in Oakland, California, U.S., May 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Jane Lanhee Lee  But shops may place more advertising with Google if Reserve drives customers through their doors. Or Google could eventually charge businesses transaction fees.  CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts in April that completing actions on users\u2019 behalf \u201cobviously...has a commercial impact.\u201d  INITIAL RESULTS  Dozens of firms peddle booking software that spas, restaurants and other businesses use to accept reservations on their websites.  To launch Reserve, Google cut deals with 25 large software suppliers, promising to consolidate and polish the process to increase bookings to the firms\u2019 clients.  The arrangement gives Google continuous feeds of schedules from tens of thousands of shops spanning 13 countries. These are mostly health, beauty and restaurant businesses not already covered by booking giants such as Expedia Group Inc , OpenTable Inc and Zocdoc Inc.  Google does not pay for the data. The payoff, schedule suppliers say, is that the booking tool makes clients more attractive in Google results.  Schedulers declined to provide Reuters with detailed performance and financial information about their results with Reserve, citing nondisclosure agreements with Google. Still, they said Reserve\u2019s monthly growth has won them over.  Buenos Aires-based Restorando, which works with restaurants in Latin America, said Google attracted about 15,000 diners who spent about $270,000 in the first few weeks, according to spokesman Frank Martin.  TimeTrade, a Tewksbury, Mass.-firm whose clients include beauty chain Sephora, said 75 percent of clients\u2019 Reserve reservations have come from new customers. Another supplier, San Francisco-based MyTime, estimated its figure at 50 percent. About 40 percent of all Google reservations to MyTime clients come after hours, evidence of its advantage over phone bookings, CEO Ethan Anderson said.  Vancouver-based fitness entrepreneur Chara Marie, who uses Yocale schedule software and coaches clients on exercise and nutrition, said about one in four new clients a week have come through Reserve in recent months.  She is an avid user too, booking about 45 nail, hair and massage appointments in the last year through Reserve. Marie, 29, said she is hooked on the convenience and does not miss playing phone tag.  \u201cIt allows you to spend more time doing what you want to be doing,\u201d Marie said.  To be sure, some business owners have questioned Google diluting customer relationships and capturing data.  \u201cAm I losing control of my business a little bit?\u201d said George Mardigian of Reserve bookings to his Oakland, Calif. gym Flex Fitness. \u201cWe\u2019re a neighborhood gym, and we want to keep things sort of close to the vest.\u201d  The Reserve tool has worked well enough that Google says new partners are coming soon, including schedulers who work with horseback riding tours, magic shows and baby sitters.  ASSESSING COMPETITION  Google is not the only big technology company looking to commercialize online bookings outside of restaurants and travel.  Amazon Home Services has schedules for TV installers, landscapers and other home-related service providers. Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram recently announced deals with 11 of the same schedulers as Google.  Yelp Inc said its list of \u201cbookable\u201d businesses, last reported at 100,000 in 2016, is growing, though some schedulers have declined to accept its revenue-sharing terms.  Google can stand apart if it can master the integration with Google Assistant, Genbook\u2019s Woodward said. He pointed to search data showing increasingly complex queries such as \u201cwhere to get a Swedish massage nearby at a discount today.\u201d  If Google can deliver the answer, along with a seamless, voice-activated booking, it will be hard to beat, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about what you can achieve on the platform,\u201d Woodward said.","163":"(Reuters) - Amazon.com AMZN.O became the second most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Tuesday, surpassing Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O for the first time.

The new Google Pixel 4 smartphone and accessories are displayed during a Google launch event in New York City, New York, U.S., October 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz  Senior executives from Google, Reddit, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and legal experts are due to face questions on Wednesday in Congress about the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which critics say shields tech companies from dealing with threatening, violent, dangerous or bullying content.  Lawmakers from both major political parties have said Congress could make additional changes to the law to restrict companies\u2019 immunity. Last year, Congress made it easier for prosecutors and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that kept exploitative material on their platforms.  At issue is Section 230 of the act, which generally provides immunity to online platforms for content posted by users, although companies can still be held liable for content that violates criminal or intellectual property law.  Advocates say the law has helped the rapid growth of internet companies over the past 20 years and encouraged free expression.  Katherine Oyama, Google\u2019s global head of intellectual property policy, said Section 230 incentivizes \u201caction against harmful content\u201d and Google has more than 10,000 people working on content moderation.  Without Section 230, search engines, video sharing platforms, blogs and other providers would \u201ceither not be able to filter content at all (resulting in more offensive online content, including adult content, spam, security threats, etc.) or would over-filter content (including important cases of political speech),\u201d Oyama said in written testimony.  The U.S. House Energy and Commerce committee released written testimonies ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, which is titled \u201cFostering a Healthier Internet to Protect Consumers.\u201d  Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said Section 230 has incentivized \u201cgood faith attempts to mitigate the unavoidable downsides of free expression.  \u201cWhile these downsides are serious and demand the attention of both us in industry and you in Congress, they do not outweigh the overwhelming good that 230 has enabled.\u201d  Huffman said that \u201call-or-nothing moderation simply isn\u2019t feasible,\u201d given the fact Reddit handles more than 750,000 posts and 6.3 million comments per day across over 130,000 active communities.  Danielle Keats Citron, a Boston University law professor, said courts had stretched Section 230\u2019s legal shield far beyond what it was intended for, and instead has been used \u201cto immunize  platforms from liability even though they knew about users\u2019 illegal activity, deliberately refused to remove it, and ensured that those responsible for the illegality could not be identified.\u201d  In June, Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced legislation to remove immunity large tech companies receive under Section 230 unless they submit to an external audit that proves their algorithms and content-removal practices are politically neutral.","172":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google on Monday defended the integrity of the company's products a day ahead of a congressional hearing where he is expected to face tough questions from U.S. lawmakers.

Google has repeatedly denied this.  The company faced renewed criticism on Capitol Hill after senior executives skipped a high-profile Senate Intelligence Committee hearing earlier in September.  Google previously told U.S. lawmakers it was considering \u201ca variety of options\u201d to offer additional services in China, but declined to detail plans for addressing Chinese censorship.

TikTok owner ByteDance has also said any deal will need China\u2019s approval, and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.  The Trump administration contends TikTok poses national security concerns as personal data collected on 100 million Americans who use the app could be obtained by China\u2019s government.  Any deal is subject to review by the U.S. government\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

Separately the Justice Department appealed the Sept. 19 preliminary junction issued by U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The injunction blocked the U.S. Commerce Department order, which would also bar other U.S. transactions with Tencent Holding\u2019s WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States.

Brin did not touch on those issues, nor did he specify any actions the company would take to recognize new responsibilities.

FILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of laptop and mobile device users are seen next to a screen projection of Google logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  But a decision in the most important of three antitrust cases against Google - this one aimed at loosening its stranglehold over Android-powered smartphones - is likely to show just how difficult it is, even for a committed trust-buster like Vestager, to dent the power of the U.S. giants.  The final ruling, expected within the next few months, will likely involve a multi-billion-dollar fine and an end to clauses in licensing agreements that stop smartphone vendors from promoting alternatives to apps such as Google Search and Maps, people familiar with the European Commission\u2019s thinking say.  The decision, which is expected to hew closely to recommendations made in 2016 soon after the probe began, will almost certainly leave Google\u2019s market dominance intact because the incentives to stick with the company are so strong, say industry executives, analysts and even its foes.  Robert Marcus, a former member of Microsoft\u2019s mobile strategy team and now general partner at investment firm Quantum Wave Capital, said it was \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d that any EU penalty would \u201cchange anything massively for Google.\u201d  The case holds lessons for regulators in Europe and elsewhere as they pursue Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon over practices including anti-competitive conduct, tax avoidance and a cavalier approach to user data and hate speech.  German regulators have shown that targeted measures can force changes in a company\u2019s conduct, such as compelling social media companies to quickly remove hate speech. Tax authorities can close loopholes and change laws to collect more money.  But stimulating competition in markets where products and services are free is a far more difficult undertaking.  \u201cOnce someone is entrenched, you can\u2019t say, \u2018stop\u2019 and things get better,\u201d said Mark Patterson, a Fordham University law professor who has researched Google antitrust issues.  The Commission declined to comment on the case. Google did not respond to a request for comment.  FEW ALTERNATIVES  Google holds 90 percent of the European search market, meaning there are few plausible alternatives for handset makers or consumers who might want to opt out. Phone vendors will be reluctant to dump popular applications such as Google Maps even if they could do so freely. An executive at one major smartphone maker said European wireless carriers have told his company they would refuse to market phones without Google Search or the Google Play app store.  Alternatives to Android remain scarce. And Google still has the option of going all-out with its own Pixel phones if new rules make licensing Android unappealing. Tom Moss, a former Google employee who wrote key parts of the first Android licensing agreements a decade ago, told Reuters tight control was necessary at the time, both to assure a standard platform for third-party software-makers to build Android apps and to guarantee customers a consistent experience.  Moss, now with the gaming hardware company Razer, acknowledges that at this stage, however, \u201ckeeping all the same policies and approaches can seem heavy-handed, unfair and anticompetitive\u201d.  He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world\u201d for Google that the EU is reassessing the arrangements.  The EU\u2019s Android investigation began in 2015 following a complaint two years earlier from lobbying group FairSearch, whose members at the time included competitors like Oracle, Nokia and Microsoft.  Sources said Amazon also complained.  A preliminary document from 2016, seen by Reuters, said regulators should levy a large fine and that Google should stop giving revenue sharing payments to smartphone makers to pre-install only Google Search, as well as stop requiring Google\u2019s Chrome browser and other apps to be installed alongside Google\u2019s Play store.  The EU was not likely to go further than that recommendation, EU sources said. Ordering the company to divest its Android business altogether, for example, would be difficult to justify under European law, European Commission sources said.  Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said in January the EU \u201ccould require more onerous changes\u201d than it did last year in its inquiry into whether Google was favoring its own online shopping service in search results.  In that case, Google was fined $2.4 billion euros - a large amount for most companies, but barely 2 percent of the company\u2019s 2017 sales.  Changes made by Google in response to the EU\u2019s order did stoke more competition for certain ad slots, but because of the way Google\u2019s ad auction system works that resulted in more money for the company without giving competitors enough of a leg up to gain market share.  There\u2019s still a possibility the Commission could compel Google to work with manufacturing partners that want to use modified versions of Android, allowing what is known as \u201cforking\u201d of the operating system, EU sources said.  But the ruling almost certainly will not be enough to break Google\u2019s monopolistic hold, FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said.  \u201cThe Android case has taken too long, and ... Google has in large measure achieved the elimination of competition it sought,\u201d Vinje said.  Google is appealing the shopping verdict, and could also appeal any ruling in the Android case.  RIVALS  The big issue for Google is less what the EU might do than how the strategies of smartphone makers might evolve. Global leader Samsung Electronics has long pushed its own apps for messaging, Internet browsing and other functionality.  Samsung could end its relationship with Google if it truly wanted to go in a different direction, Moss said. So far, however, Samsung has been unwilling to take that step. Among other things, doing so could drive customers to Google\u2019s own Pixel smartphone because it comes with a full range of Google apps and often gets first access to new features.  Other challenges could come from Amazon, Alibaba and other companies who might customize an \u201copen source\u201d version of Android that Google has made freely available for public use.  There are few signs so far that any major smartphone vendors want to opt for a different operating system. Amazon tried to build its own phone with a modified version of Android several years ago, but it was a spectacular flop.  Google\u2019s rivals in searches and Internet browsers are holding out hope they\u2019ll be better able to compete under a new EU regulatory regime.  Guillaume Champeau, ethics and public relations officer at French search engine company Qwant, said an agreement it reached with a phone maker fell through last year because of Google\u2019s rules.  \u201cWe want to have a chance to compete, but we need to be able to have agreements with phone manufacturers,\u201d he said.  Such deals would not be a big threat to Google.  \u201cAndroid is utterly dominant,\u201d said technology analyst Geoff Blaber of CCS Insight. \u201cWhatever the ruling, manufacturers are heavily reliant [on it] so nothing is going to change dramatically.\u201d","185":"Feb 21 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc said on Thursday it has removed its advertising from Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube once again, following growing concerns the platform had displayed ads next to video content that showed the exploitation of children.  \u201cUntil Google can protect our brand from offensive content of any kind, we are removing all advertising from YouTube,\u201d an AT&T spokesman said in a statement.  The move comes just one month after the U.S. wireless carrier announced it would resume buying advertising on YouTube, after a nearly two-year boycott of the platform. The previous boycott was also due to concerns that its ads could run on videos featuring hate speech or other disturbing material.  A few large companies said this week they had paused advertising on YouTube after Wired magazine reported that their commercials had run alongside offensive videos and comments.  YouTube said it had removed some of the content, which violated its policies against child endangerment, nudity and other behavior it considers inappropriate.  A YouTube spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.","186":"(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O on Tuesday beat analysts' estimate for quarterly revenue as its Google unit posted double-digit advertising growth despite the economic slowdown from the novel coronavirus.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Google is seen in Davos, Switzerland Januar 20, 2020. Picture taken January 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Shares of Alphabet rose 4% to $1,282 following the after-hours release of financial results. Alphabet shares were down about 8% this year at Tuesday\u2019s close.  A booming economy and rising internet usage have driven Google to record revenues in the last few years. But the virus has split those two trends, with consumer spending now plunging and reliance on internet services surging.  Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts on Tuesday that while users were searching more, they were looking up less commercial topics and advertisers were cutting spending.  \u201cAs of today, we anticipate the second quarter will be a difficult one for our advertising business,\u201d Porat said.  Porat said search ad revenue had declined by a \u201cmid-teens percentage\u201d by the end of March compared with a year earlier.  Alphabet\u2019s overall revenue in the first quarter was $41.2 billion, up 13% compared with the same period last year. The average estimate among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv was $40.29 billion, up 10.87%, expecting the slowest growth since 11.1% in the second quarter of 2015.  While Google tools including Duo video chatting and YouTube have become essential to many users this year, the company largely does not charge for them and instead generates revenue selling ad tools as well as links, banners and commercials on its services and those of partners.  But more than 26 million people have filed for unemployment during the last month in United States, Google\u2019s largest market for ad sales, erasing all of the country\u2019s job gains in the last decade. Google\u2019s ads business generated about 83% of Alphabet\u2019s revenue last year. It tends to flow with the broader economy, which explains Alphabet\u2019s slower revenue growth in the first quarter.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Google ad sales were $33.8 billion, up about 10% from last year\u2019s first quarter.  \u201cYouTube provided an upside surprise, with growth actually accelerating despite the impact on ad budgets from the lockdowns,\u201d said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.  About 5.5% of Alphabet\u2019s revenue last year came from cloud services for which Google charges businesses, schools and governments. This year, the company has extended various free offers to aid customers affected by the pandemic.  The cloud business generated $2.8 billion in revenue, up 52% from a year ago.  Alphabet\u2019s total costs and expenses rose about 12% from a year ago to $33.2 billion.  With usage of Google\u2019s services up but sales down, the company in the current quarter has introduced what analysts have called \u201causterity\u201d measures. It has pared hiring, internship programs, marketing, office expansions and other spending plans.  Google just three months ago had said it would accelerate overall spending to add more staff for its cloud business and other areas where it is challenging to unseat dominant competitors.  The company does not forecast revenue or profit. But the current quarter and remainder of 2020 could be bleak, according to some outside forecasts by ad agencies and other industry consultants. Two expected boosts to revenue - the U.S. presidential election and the Olympics - will offer smaller bumps because of the virus as campaigning grows more muted and the Tokyo games get pushed to next year. Some have estimated ad sales declines of up to 20% in the coming quarters.  Investors have become accustomed to unpredictability from Alphabet, though, even before the virus appeared. People have been interacting more with phones and smart speakers, which has forced Google to experiment with new ways to display ads, some of which advertisers have not valued as highly as legacy formats. Currency fluctuations and a greater push by advertisers to avoid offensive content have hurt Google, too.  Alphabet\u2019s first-quarter profit was $6.8 billion, or $9.87 per share, compared with the analysts\u2019 average estimate of $7.21 billion, or $10.40 per share.  Its profit figures can be difficult to compare because they include gains and losses accumulated only on paper from its investments in startups and other outside businesses.","187":"TURIN, Italy (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s self-driving unit Waymo wants to bring its robo-taxi service to Europe after it launches in the United States later this year.

Waymo will use vehicles made by Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Jaguar Land Rover in its autonomous fleet in the United States, but Krafcik did not signal if either would be potential partners for services in Europe.  The company is set to launch its ride-hailing service in certain areas of Phoenix, Arizona in coming months, with plans to subsequently roll out the program more widely in the United States.  \u201cThe world keeps saying that self-driving cars are coming soon. We are doing this, today, in Phoenix, driving without humans in the front row,\u201d Krafcik said. \u201cSometimes I feel like the world hasn\u2019t quite reckoned with that thought.\u201d  In the United States its service will carry the Waymo brand, but that may not be the case in Europe if it has a partner.  \u201cIt\u2019s probably safe to say the Waymo brand wouldn\u2019t be as strong as some other existing incumbent brands that are already strong in Europe,\u201d Krafcik said.  Large tech companies, established automakers and well-funded startups including Uber Technologies Inc and Tesla Inc are all stepping up efforts to gain pole position in the self-driving cars market, which is expected to carry the automobiles industry into the next era.  Fiat Chrysler said last week it would supply Waymo with another 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. The companies are also in early discussions about using Waymo\u2019s technology in FCA cars to be sold in retail.  On June 1, Waymo showcased some of the Chrysler vans during FCA\u2019s investor day in Italy, taking participants for test drives.  \u201cFor the first time we brought Waymo technology and demonstrated true Level 4 (autonomy), no humans in the front row, fully autonomous, no safety-net driving, right here in Italy - it was amazing,\u201d Krafcik said.

Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff said at a press conference that Sidewalk Labs, an Alphabet unit, will not disclose personal information to third parties without explicit consent and will not sell personal information.  FILE PHOTO: The downtown skyline and CN Tower are seen past the eastern waterfront area envisioned by Alphabet Inc's Sidewalk Labs as a new technical hub in the Port Lands district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada April 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren\/File Photo  Here are some facts on Sidewalk Toronto:  SIZE:  The Quayside development is said to occupy 12 acres, the Villiers West taking up 19 acres, and the rest of the IDEA District at 159 acres.  JOB CREATION:  Sidewalk Labs says in the proposal that up to 93,000 jobs could be generated, with 44,000 permanent, direct jobs by 2040. Out of the 44,000 jobs, a little over half are said to be in manufacturing and cultural work, around a quarter in administrative support, retail and transit, and 10,000 in finance, real estate and management.  SUSTAINABILITY:  The smart city proposal indicates that the Quayside would emit 85% fewer greenhouse gas emissions compared to downtown Toronto, with the full-scale development called the IDEA District at 89% fewer emissions. Projects like energy efficient housing, a facility that converts organic food waste into biogas and a clean thermal grid for heating and cooling are pitched.  HOUSING AFFORDABILITY:  Half of the houses are \u201cpurpose-built\u201d rental units, with additional affordable housing and middle-income housing units. The houses would be built out of mass timber sourced from a timber factory in Ontario which Sidewalk Labs plans to invest in to provide 2,500 full-time jobs over 20 years.  MOBILITY  A self-financing light rail transit extension connecting the Greater Toronto Area to the waterfront, a freight logistics hub with underground delivery and every building accessible by cyclists is proposed.

ECONOMIC IMPACT  The proposal says by 2040 the smart city will contribute C$14.2 billion annually to Canada\u2019s GDP, C$4.3 billion in tax revenue and create 44,000 permanent jobs.  COST AND FUNDING  The Quayside and Villiers West is said to cost C$3.9 billion, with Sidewalk Labs and local partners planning a C$900 million equity investment. Additionally, Sidewalk Labs and their local partners say they would invest up to C$1.3 billion, which they expect will encourage primarily third parties to raise an estimated C$38 billion in total investment to cover the total project cost of infrastructure and real estate across the IDEA district.","189":"(This February 15 story corrects to Monday in paragraph 2)  SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s Seven West Media Ltd became the country\u2019s first major news outlet to strike a licensing deal with Google, as the government pushes ahead with a law that would force the internet giant to pay media companies for content.  At an earnings announcement on Monday, Seven, which owns a free-to-air television network and the main metro newspaper in the city of Perth, said it would supply content for Google\u2019s News Showcase platform. It did not disclose terms.  The deal shows Seven splitting from rivals News Corp and Nine Entertainment Co Holdings Ltd which have failed to reach agreements with Google and instead backed laws, set to be passed this week, where the government sets the online giant\u2019s content fees in the absence of a private deal.  So far in Australia, only specialist online publishers and one regional newspaper have struck deals to receive payment for their content appearing on the new Google platform which went live in the country this month. Outside Australia, Reuters is among news outlets with similar Google deals.  \u201cThe negotiations with Google recognise the value of quality and original journalism throughout the country and, in particular, in regional areas,\u201d said Seven West Chairman Kerry Stokes in a statement.  Google\u2019s Australia CEO Mel Silva said the U.S. company was \u201cproud to support original, trusted, and quality journalism\u201d by featuring Seven on its platform.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Last month, Silva told a parliamentary hearing Google would pull its search engine from Australia if the so-called News Media Bargaining Code became law. A Google representative declined to comment on the effect of the Seven deal.  Hours before Seven revealed its plans, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp he still planned to introduce the laws, but added: \u201cI think we\u2019re very close to some significant commercial deals and, in doing so, that will the transform the domestic media landscape\u201d.  The way the law is worded, the government only imposes a negotiator to set fees if the media company and Google can\u2019t come to an arrangement privately.  A Seven spokesman told Reuters the company still supported the law.  A Nine spokeswoman declined comment, while a News Corp representative in Australia was not immediately available for comment.  \u201cThe signs are that the Australian government and Google are close to a compromise,\u201d said Paul Budde, an independent media and telecommunications industry analyst.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThis allows the government to claim victory, while the damage to Google will be limited. Publishers will in one way or another be paid for news.\u201d  Seven separately reported a 26.5% jump in underlying profit for the six months to end-December, helped by strong performance in its advertising market.  Seven shares jumped as much as 10.6% to their highest level since May 31, 2019 in early trade, while the broader market was up 0.9%.

Alphabet Inc rose 0.4 percent in premarket trading, and its results will round up earnings from the so-called FAANG group.  The reports have been a mixed bag, with Apple Inc and Facebook Inc posting better-than-expected quarterly results last week, while Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc gave downbeat current-quarter forecasts.

In a bright spot, Ultimate Software Group Inc surged 19 percent after the HR software provider agreed to be bought by an investor group led by Hellman & Friedman in a $11 billion deal.  Papa John\u2019s International Inc jumped 4.7 percent after a $200 million investment by hedge fund Starboard Value LP.  Gilead Sciences Inc dipped 0.5 percent ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings expected after the bell.  Last week the U.S. central bank in a sharp reversal of stance from six weeks ago, pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes. In light of this, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s speech on Wednesday will be closely watched.

The new fee goes into effect on Oct. 29 for any new smartphone or tablet models launched in the European Economic Area and running Google\u2019s Android operating system, the company announced on Tuesday.  The fee can be as low as $2.50 and rises depending on the country and device size, the person said. It is standard across manufacturers, with the majority likely to pay around $20, the person added.  Companies can offset the charge, which applies to a suite of apps including the Google Play app store, Gmail and Google Maps, by agreeing to bundle Google\u2019s search and Chrome internet browser. Under that arrangement, Google would give the device maker a portion of ad revenue it generates through search and Chrome.  Tech news outlet the Verge reported the pricing earlier on Friday, citing confidential documents.  The European Commission in July found Google abused its market dominance in mobile software to essentially force Android partners to pre-install search and Chrome on their gadgets. It levied a record $5-billion fine, which Google has appealed, and threatened additional penalties unless the company ended its illegal practices.  The new system should give Google\u2019s rivals such as Microsoft Corp more room to partner with hardware makers to become the default apps for search and browsing, analysts said.

It sent questionnaires to Google rivals last month, asking for details of the company\u2019s practices and the impact on competing services between January 2012 to December 2017.  Regulators also wanted to know if rivals experienced an impact in the operation of their local services as a result of major search algorithm changes by Google, including the introduction of its Panda 4.0 algorithm.  Introduced in 2014, this algorithm determines what appears in Google search results.  Companies were also asked if Google\u2019s introduction of the Local Universal or One Box had a substantial impact on their local search services.  Local Universal is targeted at hotel ads while One Box, which is information and images outlined in a box, is a tool for local businesses to get more visibility in Google search results.

Slideshow ( 9 images )  Sidewalk Labs, which provides urban technology infrastructure, is planning a 4.9-acre smart city along Toronto\u2019s harbor front, a project that has already faced opposition from locals over concerns of data privacy.  Sidewalk Labs said the proposal was yet to the evaluated by Toronto city and the public and has the potential to generate around C$6 billion ($4.5 billion) to pay for the infrastructure over 30 years.  The proposal suggests that a light rail transit and infrastructure be financed by a mix of development charges, incremental property taxes and increased land value.  Sidewalk Labs outlined its project for a light railway transit, 2,500 homes where 40 percent would be below market price, and a tall-timber factory they project will create 4,000 jobs.  These would be initially financed by Sidewalk, and the company plans to recoup its investment through the various taxes, the proposals showed.  Alphabet is the parent company of Google.  \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to take the risk up front of developing a model to help make that happen, and we\u2019re prepared to essentially get paid back when we\u2019ve demonstrated that it can be successful,\u201d Sidewalk Labs CEO Dan Doctoroff told Toronto Star newspaper, which first reported the proposal.  On Thursday, Amazon scrapped its plans to set up its second headquarters in New York after facing public outcry.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the move comes after talks with Facebook and Alphabet failed to yield a voluntary code to address complaints by domestic media players that the tech giants have too tight a grip on advertising, their main source of income.  \u201cWe understand the challenge that we face, this is a big mountain to climb,\u201d Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra. \u201cThese are big companies that we are dealing with but there is also so much at stake, so we\u2019re prepared for this fight.\u201d  The government has now asked the country\u2019s competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to frame a mandatory code of conduct between media outlets and digital platforms after talks stalled on content payment rules.  The government scrapped its initial plan to come up with a voluntary code by November and has asked ACCC to submit its draft mandatory code by July, to be passed into legislation shortly thereafter, the treasurer said.  Frydenberg said the mandatory code will include sharing of data, ranking and display of news content and the sharing of revenue generated from news, adding that it would also establish penalty and binding dispute resolution mechanisms.  Australia\u2019s online advertising market is worth about almost A$9 billion ($5.72 billion) a year and has grown more than eight-fold since 2005.  For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly a third goes to Google and Facebook, an ACCC report on digital platforms published in June last year showed.  Last December, Australia said Google and Facebook would have to agree to new rules to ensure they do not abuse their market power and damage competition, or the government would impose new controls.  Facebook expressed dismay at the government move on Monday.  \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed by the government\u2019s announcement, especially as we\u2019ve worked hard to meet their agreed deadline,\u201d Facebook said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve invested millions of dollars locally to support Australian publishers through content arrangements, partnerships and training for the industry,\u201d Facebook Australia and New Zealand Managing Director Will Easton said in an emailed statement.  Google said it would continue to cooperate with plans for the media code of conduct.  \u201cWe have sought to work constructively with industry, the ACCC and government to develop a code of conduct, and we will continue to do so in the revised process set out by the Government today,\u201d a Google spokesperson said.  Monday\u2019s move also comes as the new coronavirus pandemic hits Australia\u2019s media business hard, with several regional outlets reporting steep declines in advertising revenue.  Pending the new code, the federal government last week unveiled a support package for the local media businesses including a 12-month waiver of spectrum tax for commercial television and radio broadcasters, and a A$50 million public interest news gathering program.","196":"FILE PHOTO: An illuminated Google logo is seen inside an office building in Zurich, Switzerland December 5, 2018.

Tap out \u201cI love\u201d and Gmail might propose \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cit.\u201d  But users are out of luck if the object of their affection is \u201chim\u201d or \u201cher.\u201d  Google\u2019s technology will not suggest gender-based pronouns because the risk is too high that its \u201cSmart Compose\u201d technology might predict someone\u2019s sex or gender identity incorrectly and offend users, product leaders revealed to Reuters in interviews.  Gmail product manager Paul Lambert said a company research scientist discovered the problem in January when he typed \u201cI am meeting an investor next week,\u201d and Smart Compose suggested a possible follow-up question: \u201cDo you want to meet him?\u201d instead of \u201cher.\u201d  Consumers have become accustomed to embarrassing gaffes from autocorrect on smartphones. But Google refused to take chances at a time when gender issues are reshaping politics and society, and critics are scrutinizing potential biases in artificial intelligence like never before.  \u201cNot all \u2018screw ups\u2019 are equal,\u201d Lambert said. Gender is a \u201ca big, big thing\u201d to get wrong.  Getting Smart Compose right could be good for business. Demonstrating that Google understands the nuances of AI better than competitors is part of the company\u2019s strategy to build affinity for its brand and attract customers to its AI-powered cloud computing tools, advertising services and hardware.  Gmail has 1.5 billion users, and Lambert said Smart Compose assists on 11 percent of messages worldwide sent from Gmail.com, where the feature first launched.  Smart Compose is an example of what AI developers call natural language generation (NLG), in which computers learn to write sentences by studying patterns and relationships between words in literature, emails and web pages.  A system shown billions of human sentences becomes adept at completing common phrases but is limited by generalities. Men have long dominated fields such as finance and science, for example, so the technology would conclude from the data that an investor or engineer is \u201che\u201d or \u201chim.\u201d The issue trips up nearly every major tech company.  Lambert said the Smart Compose team of about 15 engineers and designers tried several workarounds, but none proved bias-free or worthwhile. They decided the best solution was the strictest one: Limit coverage. The gendered pronoun ban affects fewer than 1 percent of cases where Smart Compose would propose something, Lambert said.  \u201cThe only reliable technique we have is to be conservative,\u201d said Prabhakar Raghavan, who oversaw engineering of Gmail and other services until a recent promotion.  NEW POLICY  Google\u2019s decision to play it safe on gender follows some high-profile embarrassments for the company\u2019s predictive technologies.  The company apologized in 2015 when the image recognition feature of its photo service labeled a black couple as gorillas. In 2016, Google altered its search engine\u2019s autocomplete function after it suggested the anti-Semitic query \u201care jews evil\u201d when users sought information about Jews.  Google has banned expletives and racial slurs from its predictive technologies, as well as mentions of its business rivals or tragic events.  The company\u2019s new policy banning gendered pronouns also affected the list of possible responses in Google\u2019s Smart Reply. That service allow users to respond instantly to text messages and emails with short phrases such as \u201csounds good.\u201d  Google uses tests developed by its AI ethics team to uncover new biases. A spam and abuse team pokes at systems, trying to find \u201cjuicy\u201d gaffes by thinking as hackers or journalists might, Lambert said.  Workers outside the United States look for local cultural issues. Smart Compose will soon work in four other languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French.  \u201cYou need a lot of human oversight,\u201d said engineering leader Raghavan, because \u201cin each language, the net of inappropriateness has to cover something different.\u201d  WIDESPREAD CHALLENGE  Google is not the only tech company wrestling with the gender-based pronoun problem.  Agolo, a New York startup that has received investment from Thomson Reuters, uses AI to summarize business documents.  Its technology cannot reliably determine in some documents which pronoun goes with which name. So the summary pulls several sentences to give users more context, said Mohamed AlTantawy, Agolo\u2019s chief technology officer.  He said longer copy is better than missing details. \u201cThe smallest mistakes will make people lose confidence,\u201d AlTantawy said. \u201cPeople want 100 percent correct.\u201d  Yet, imperfections remain. Predictive keyboard tools developed by Google and Apple Inc propose the gendered \u201cpoliceman\u201d to complete \u201cpolice\u201d and \u201csalesman\u201d for \u201csales.\u201d  Type the neutral Turkish phrase \u201cone is a soldier\u201d into Google Translate and it spits out \u201che\u2019s a soldier\u201d in English. So do translation tools from Alibaba and Microsoft Corp . Amazon.com Inc opts for \u201cshe\u201d for the same phrase on its translation service for cloud computing customers.  AI experts have called on the companies to display a disclaimer and multiple possible translations.  Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn said it avoids gendered pronouns in its year-old predictive messaging tool, Smart Replies, to ward off potential blunders.  Alibaba and Amazon did not respond to requests to comment.  Warnings and limitations like those in Smart Compose remain the most-used countermeasures in complex systems, said John Hegele, integration engineer at Durham, North Carolina-based Automated Insights Inc, which generates news articles from statistics.  \u201cThe end goal is a fully machine-generated system where it magically knows what to write,\u201d Hegele said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a ton of advances made but we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d (Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Marla Dickerson)","198":"FILE PHOTO: The Google Maps app logo is seen on a smartphone in this picture illustration taken September 15, 2017.

Google\u2019s dominance in online advertising has been challenged this year by the antitrust battle over its Android mobile software, which led to a $5 billion fine for the quarter, and other regulatory actions, including new European privacy rules.  Government pressure to improve moderation of user-created content has forced Google to hire more analysts. YouTube, a Google-owned streaming service, has increased spending on video content to keep consumers from shifting to offerings from Netflix Inc and expanding media conglomerates such as AT&T Inc.  But those issues have yet to halt Alphabet, which has grown quarterly revenue at least 20 percent year-over-year for two straight years.  \u201cThere was never a question about Google\u2019s dominance of a buoyant digital ads market,\u201d said analyst Richard Kramer of Arete Research.

Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts that investments in artificial intelligence software meant to better predict where to place ads are making its services more attractive to advertisers. The company is selling more ads as its YouTube video service and Google search grow globally, he said.  Profit margins have dipped as more ads get shown on mobile devices, where Apple Inc and other firms charge fees to distribute Google search on their devices and apps.  But Google in the second quarter entered the second year of its latest multi-year deal with Apple, which analysts said helped even out costs.

Adjusted earnings per share were $10.58, excluding the fine and the effects of other investments. Analysts estimated $9.52 per share, according to research aggregated by Thomson Reuters. Some analysts excluded other items as well, and Alphabet also beat that consensus of $9.59.  Alphabet\u2019s $32.66 billion in second-quarter revenue, 86 percent of which came from Google\u2019s advertising business, beat an average estimate of $32.17 billion.  The rest of the revenue came from Google\u2019s non-advertising businesses, which include selling apps, gadgets and cloud computing services, and ventures such as offering internet service.  The newer businesses are sucking up investments as Google adds data centers and employees to support them.

Alphabet, Facebook Inc and other leading application makers have become big forces in advertising as consumers globally, and in turn, advertisers devote increasing attention to smartphone and TV apps instead of newspapers and traditional TV broadcasts.  Pichai said the company had opportunity to show ads on Google Home smart speakers and Google Maps and was slowly determining the best way to do so.  Company shares have benefited from easing regulatory concerns. A new privacy law enacted by the EU in May has had a minimal effect on Google\u2019s advertising business, and smartphone industry executives have described the EU antitrust case over Android as too late to matter. The company has cautioned that it is too early to measure the impact on both fronts.  But Alphabet\u2019s outlook is tempered by cost concerns, and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s encroachment into advertising has threatened Google\u2019s lucrative deals with media companies and advertisers.  Alphabet trails Facebook, Amazon and Twitter Inc in valuation as measured by the ratio of enterprise value to expected earnings. Its enterprise value, or market capitalization and debt minus cash, trades at 13 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, compared with about 14 times for Facebook, 24 times for Twitter and 26 times for Amazon, according to TR data.","204":"July 25 (Reuters) - Google-parent Alphabet Inc beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, benefiting from advertisers spending more on its search and YouTube services.

Shares in the parent of Google climbed 3.6 percent after-hours to hit a record high, valuing the internet giant at a cool $870 billion.  That made up for an otherwise dull day on Wall Street where the Dow eased 0.06 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent and the Nasdaq 0.28 percent.  In Asia, Japan\u2019s Nikkei bounced 0.4 percent in early trade as a pullback in the yen eased concerns about earnings pressure on exporters.  Moves elsewhere were marginal with MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan barely changed.  Bond bulls were still smarting from speculation that the Bank of Japan is close to announcing measures to scale back its massive monetary stimulus, a risk that lifted long-term borrowing costs globally.  Markets were worried that Japanese investors would have less incentive to hunt offshore for yield, said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett.  \u201cThe 10 basis-point steepening in the Japanese yield curve is massive in the context of a market that rarely moves more than 1\u201d basis point, she added.  \u201cIt reflects a broader fear that central banks are reducing their purchases while U.S. bond supply is set to rise significantly.\u201d  As a result, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields jumped to their highest in five weeks around 2.96 percent and were again nearing the psychological 3 percent bulwark.  Part of the move was driven by chatter that data on second-quarter U.S. economic growth (GDP) due on Friday would easily top current forecasts of 4.1 percent.  Dealers noted some media reports President Donald Trump himself was predicting an outcome of 4.8 percent. That would not be out of bounds given the much-watched Atlanta Fed GDP tracker puts growth at an annualised 4.5 percent.  Such a strong outcome would only add to the risk of faster rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and underpin the dollar.  Against a basket of currencies, the dollar bounced to 94.619 from a low of 94.207 on Monday. The dollar also edged up to 111.40 yen, from a trough of 110.75.  The euro lapsed to $1.1690, having run into profit-taking at a peak of $1.1750 overnight.  In commodity markets, oil prices idled as the focus turned to oversupply worries and away from escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran.  U.S. crude was flat at $67.87, while Brent dipped 7 cents to $72.99 a barrel.

REUTERS\/Issei Kato\/File Photo\/File Photo  TOKYO (Reuters) - Alphabet and SoftBank\u2019s attempts to launch flying cellphone antennas high into the atmosphere have received backing from global telcos, energizing lobbying efforts aimed at driving regulatory approval for the emerging technology.  Loon, which was spun out of Google parent Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O business incubator, and HAPSMobile, a unit of SoftBank Group Corp's 9984.T domestic telco, plan to deliver high speed internet to remote areas by flying network equipment at high altitudes.  Lobbying efforts by the two firms, which formed an alliance last year, are being joined by companies including aerospace firm Airbus AIR.PA, network vendors Nokia NOKIA.HE and Ericsson ERICb.ST and telcos China Telecom 0728.HK, Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE, Telefonica TEF.MC and Bharti Airtel BRTI.NS.  The backing is a vote of confidence in the technology after Alphabet this month shut down another of its big bets, Makani, which aimed to generate wind energy with kites, in a move widely seen as signaling pressure from CEO Sundar Pichai for unproven businesses like Loon to start delivering results.  The expanded alliance announced in a joint statement aims to secure spectrum and promote uniform regulation and industry-wide standards for the high altitude vehicles, which carry network equipment on balloons in the case of Loon and drones with HAPSMobile. Both systems are solar powered.  Loon has already struck deals with wireless carriers in Kenya and Peru. Such technology allows telcos to extend coverage into hard-to-reach areas where there is low population density or geographical obstacles like mountains and maintain service after disasters.  HAPSMobile, the brainchild of SoftBank Corp's 9434.T Chief Technology Officer Junichi Miyakawa, aims to commercialize its services in 2023 and has been conducting low altitude test flights of its drones, which have a wingspan of almost 80 meters (87.49 yards), from a NASA facility in California.  The devices fly in the stratosphere, which offers mild weather all year round and low latency, which is just 20 kilometers above the Earth\u2019s surface, compared to satellites which even in low-orbit are at an altitude of 1,200 kilometers.  The solar-powered HAWK30 drone can currently only stay airborne all year round at latitudes of plus or minus 30 degrees from the equator, constraining its ability to operate in northerly countries like United States and Japan - although a planned future device will extend that to 50 degrees.","213":"FILE PHOTO: The outside of the Google offices is seen in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., January 18, 2019.

The French regulator said the world\u2019s biggest search engine lacked transparency and clarity in the way it informs users about its handling of personal data and failed to properly obtain their consent for personalized ads.  The EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the biggest shake-up of data privacy laws in more than two decades, came into force in May. It allows users to better control their personal data and gives regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for violations.  \u201cThe amount decided, and the publicity of the fine, are justified by the severity of the infringements observed regarding the essential principles of the GDPR: transparency, information and consent,\u201d the CNIL said in a statement.

REUTERS\/Stephen Lam\/File Photo  Co-founded over 35 years ago by Stanford University professor John Hennessy, who is currently the Chairman of Alphabet Inc, MIPS Computer Systems Inc had developed a new approach to chip architectures that remains in wide use.  In late 2018 and 2019, as the U.S.-China tech trade war was in full swing, the core technology of MIPS was licensed to a Shanghai-based firm, CIP United Co Ltd, via a complex series of transactions involving companies in the Cayman Islands and Samoa.  For a graphic on MIPS' changing ownership, click  Today, CIP controls full MIPS licensing rights for all new and existing customers in China, Hong Kong and Macau, as well as the ability to develop new derivative technologies based on the MIPS architecture, according to four people with knowledge of the situation.  \u201cA license for all of mainland China has already been sold, lock stock and barrel,\u201d one of the people said. The deal was worth $60 million.  The details of the MIPS licensing deal and the transactions that preceded it - revealed in U.S. bankruptcy proceedings involving MIPS\u2019 parent company, Wave Computing Inc, and interviews with nearly two dozen people - offer a rare glimpse into how foreign firms were able to gain access to one strategically important American technology.  CIP United declined to comment about the MIPS licensing deal. Wave, through a public relations firm, said the company and its law firms believe its new management team \u201cis confident the company has complied and is compliant with\u201d rules on export, import and foreign investments regarding the MIPS licensing deal.  A 2019 CIP investor presentation, seen by Reuters, shows how the company was intent on using MIPS to help China catch up to the United States in advanced semiconductor technology, which is critical for everything from smartphones to sophisticated weaponry.  The MIPS license promises to provide \u201ccore technology\u201d that will help China \u201cimplement the ambitious goal of Made in China 2025,\u201d the presentation stated, referring to a government program to achieve self-sufficiency in strategic industries.  The United States has often cited the 2025 program as the reason for national security measures aimed at stopping China from accessing U.S. technology. A June 2018 document from the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, states: \u201cIn policy documents such as Made in China 2025, China has articulated the target list of technology sectors it seeks to dominate. Much of recent Chinese investment behavior appears consistent with this target list.\u201d  Increasingly mindful that it has triggered U.S. backlash, Beijing began to downplay Made in China 2025, Reuters reported in 2018. reut.rs\/3grYrWF  Since Washington tightened restrictions on direct Chinese investments into U.S. tech startups in late 2018, licensing agreements and offshore entities have become a popular avenue for technology transfer, according to Silicon Valley venture capitalists, lawyers, and tech startup CEOs interviewed by Reuters. That was also the case with MIPS.  The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a U.S. interagency panel led by the Treasury Department, reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security. But licensing deals are not typically subject to CFIUS review and considered legal as long as they aren\u2019t designed to skirt regulations and comply with U.S. export control laws, which regulate the shipment of strategically sensitive goods.  \u201cChina is using joint ventures or licensing agreements to transfer technology to China rather than work long-term with a U.S. partner, and it will be important to examine those agreements more carefully to keep company technology onshore,\u201d said Michael Brown, a veteran tech executive who now heads an innovation unit at the U.S. Department of Defense.  CFIUS didn\u2019t reply to request for comment on this issue, or on any specifics related to the MIPS technology transfer.  Hennessy told Reuters he sold all his MIPS related shares by 2005 and was not aware of the details of licensing deals in China.  COMPLEX DEALS  Wave filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late April after it was forced to return $40 million to an investor as a funding deal related to the acquisition of MIPS went sour, according to court documents.  The agreement with CIP in China, however, remains in place, with numerous Chinese companies - including telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] \u2013 licensing the MIPS technology from CIP, according to a former CIP engineer. Huawei has faced U.S. accusations of pilfering tech secrets and using its own gear to help the Chinese government\u2019s spy network. Huawei has denied these allegations. Huawei confirmed to Reuters that it is a royalty paying customer, but declined to elaborate further.  MIPS has been an important foundational technology for China as it ramped up its domestic chip efforts, according to a former senior engineer for Huawei and two American chip consultants who have worked closely with China. China has been striving to build up a chip industry that\u2019s independent of the United States and has tried in the past to use the MIPS architecture to build its own microprocessors, the complex chips that are the brains of most electronic devices, according to independent chip consultant Nick Ilyadis.  The path to sending the MIPS core technology to China started out with a maneuver to help ease U.S. concerns about technology transfer.  Canyon Bridge, an investment firm which Reuters has reported was founded partly with Chinese government funds, announced in September, 2017 that it was buying Imagination Technologies, a UK-based graphics chip company that was then the owner of MIPS. reut.rs\/2EbNStx  Acquiring MIPS would have subject the transaction to a review by CFIUS. The deal was ultimately made contingent on completing a reorganization \u201cto separate MIPS from the remainder of the group,\u201d according to an Imagination press release dated September 22, 2017 announcing the MIPS sale.  Imagination\u2019s chief executive Ray Bingham, who is also a partner of Canyon Bridge, did not reply to requests for comment.  From the Imagination spin-off, MIPS changed hands multiple times before ending up inside Wave Computing, a company that counts Canyon Bridge and China\u2019s Alibaba Investments Limited as minority investors.  Reuters could not determine if Alibaba or Canyon Bridge were aware in advance of Wave\u2019s plan to license the MIPS technology to a Chinese company. Alibaba didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment and Canyon Bridge declined to comment about the MIPS license.  The Alibaba and Canyon Bridge investments in Wave did not require a CFIUS filing because their investments were passive and below the 10% threshold that would require such a filing, according to CFIUS experts.  Two former CFIUS members, who declined to be named, said they would have looked into the Wave investments to determine if the investments were in the purview of CFIUS\u2019 scope. CFIUS had already denied Canyon Bridge\u2019s takeover of U.S. chip maker Lattice Semiconductor after Reuters had reported Canyon Bridge was backed by the Chinese government. reut.rs\/2E6QRDZ  \u201cI wanted a harder line\u201d for CFIUS oversight of tech investments, said James Lewis the director of the technology policy program at Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The 33-count indictment largely mirrors allegations that Alphabet\u2019s Waymo unit, where Levandowski had worked, had made in a civil lawsuit against Uber in 2017, which later settled.  Lawyers for Levandowski said their client stole nothing and that they looked forward to proving his innocence at trial.  Levandowski, who could face many years in prison and a fine if convicted, is expected to appear later on Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California.  The prosecution of Levandowski, 39, is one of Silicon Valley\u2019s highest-profile cases alleging theft of trade secrets.  Prosecutors accused Levandowski of stealing materials in late 2015 and early 2016 related to Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car technology. They said he did this after deciding to leave Alphabet and form his own self-driving company, Ottomotto, which Uber later bought.  The alleged stolen materials included details related to Lidar, a crucial sensor technology, according to the indictment.  All people are free to change jobs, U.S. Attorney David Anderson said at a news conference. \u201cBut what we cannot do is stuff our pockets on the way out the door.\u201d  Levandowski left Waymo in early 2016 and eventually took over Uber\u2019s self-driving car project before being fired. He later started another self-driving software company.  \u201cFor more than a decade, Anthony Levandowski has been an industry-leading innovator in self-driving technologies,\u201d one of his lawyers, Miles Ehrlich, said in front of the courthouse, calling the government case a \u201crehash\u201d of already discredited claims.

REUTERS\/Stringer\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O on Friday settled a shareholder lawsuit that accused the Google parent of covering up lavish exit packages to executives found responsible for sexual misconduct, saying it would overhaul workplace policies and increase oversight of its diversity efforts.  The company will prohibit severance packages to employees who are subject to any pending investigation for sexual misconduct or retaliation. Sexual misconduct accusations against senior executives will be investigated by a \u201crapid response\u201d team, and they will be barred from amending their stock-selling plans while under investigation.  Penalties and training will be made more consistent. And Google employees will be able to publicly discuss the facts of their cases.  A new council to oversee diversity efforts will include executives including CEO Sundar Pichai as well as independent experts such as a retired judge and outside attorneys. The council will report quarterly to the leadership development committee of Alphabet\u2019s board.  The company will spend $310 million over a decade on diversity initiatives, such as computer science training for minorities, and Google will expand globally its U.S. policy of not considering prior salaries in setting wages for new hires.  Julie Goldsmith Reiser, an attorney who handled the case for shareholders, said the commitments raised the bar beyond what any other company facing diversity and sexual harassment challenges has agreed to.  \u201cIt is a lot of tools that Alphabet will have in the toolbox to make its workplace better,\u201d she said.  Several changes that already applied to Google also will be enforced Alphabet-wide, including making arbitration optional for employee and contractor sexual harassment claims.  The lawsuit from last year in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California accused Alphabet leadership of making misguided decisions around sexual misconduct issues that hurt the company\u2019s reputation and share price, as Google and other companies faced a reckoning during the Me Too movement.","219":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Google is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018.

REUTERS\/Thomas Peter  The transparency marks a milestone after years of aggressive investment and comes as the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing more work, shopping and entertainment online.  That drives the ad business Google dominates over rivals Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc, and it also has created a surge in demand for both parts of Google\u2019s cloud business: computing services for retailers and other companies and corporate productivity suites including tools like Gmail.  JPMorgan & Chase Co analysts, among the few to make predictions about Google Cloud, estimate the unit\u2019s 2020 operating margin at 2%. Bank of America analysts estimate an unspecified operating loss.  By comparison, Amazon\u2019s Web Services, the top cloud vendor by sales, posted third-quarter operating margin of 30.5% and $3.5 billion in operating income.  Microsoft\u2019s Azure, the industry No. 2, does not report comparable figures.  Google got serious about the cloud around 2016, five years after Amazon\u2019s unit had become a multibillion-dollar behemoth.

The JPMorgan analysts estimate Google Cloud spent about 40% more in 2020 than Amazon\u2019s cloud unit did in 2016, when it had about $12 billion in sales. Google\u2019s spending reflects higher competition, as well as cloud vendors expanding into newer technologies.  Analysts expect Google\u2019s advertising business will post $42.6 billion in fourth-quarter sales, pushing overall Alphabet quarterly revenue to $53 billion. That would leave Alphabet with 2020 sales of $179 billion and profit of $11 billion.","231":"TORONTO (Reuters) - Alphabet's GOOGL.O Sidewalk Labs released a detailed overview on Friday of the futuristic technology it intends to incorporate in the smart city it wants to build in Toronto.  The company says 82% of its proposals have existing precedents around the world, either fully or partially implemented - although not necessarily at the scale Sidewalk envisions. Here are a few key technologies that already exist in some form and what Sidewalk would do with them in the Quayside project.  BIKE CROSSINGS  Known as \u201cbicycle green waves,\u201d these street crossings detect when a bike is present and coordinate traffic lights to allow a cyclist to travel without having to stop. This already exists in cities around the world, including Amsterdam and parts of Toronto itself.  ADAPTIVE TRAFFIC SIGNALS  A 25-year-old on a jog may take less time to cross the street than an 85-year-old using a cane - adaptive pedestrian signals can adjust to each of these. In Singapore, individuals can trigger a longer walk signal at certain intersections using a senior\u2019s transit card.  ONLINE AFFORDABLE HOUSING APPLICATION  Sidewalk is proposing to streamline and simplify the application for the affordable housing that will make up 40% of the apartments in Quayside. New York City and San Francisco have both created online affordable housing applications, but Sidewalk says these don\u2019t include income verification, which its would.  DATA-GATHERING DEVICE REGISTRY  Seattle maintains a master list of surveillance technology used by the city, but Sidewalk would take that a step farther and create a public map of sensors and data-collection devices in Quayside.  SMART GARBAGE  Many cities have garbage cans with volume sensors, but Sidewalk proposes self-driving cans that empty themselves into a centralized waste disposal site before returning to their original location. Sidewalk didn\u2019t name a company that would provide this infrastructure, although it said it exists.  NOISE MONITORS  Sidewalk would install sound-level sensors into residential apartments - a practice it says occurs often in industrial buildings, but not in homes or offices.  INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION  Helsinki, Birmingham and Antwerp all have Maas Global, which stands for Mobility as a Service - a company that provides one subscription to a variety of modes of transportation, including public transit, bikeshare and ridesharing. Sidewalk envisions a similar all-in-one system for transportation in Quayside.","232":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE\/ in an Eikon news window)  * Tech stocks gains as Apple hits record high, Alphabet rises  * Alphabet, Amazon jump as Morgan Stanley lifts price targets  * Canada, U.S. resume NAFTA talks amid growing optimism  * Dick\u2019s Sporting falls on weak sales, weighs on Under Armour  * Indexes up: Dow 0.31 pct, S&P 0.57 pct, Nasdaq 0.86 pct (Changes comments, updates to early afternoon)  By Shreyashi Sanyal  Aug 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting all-time highs for the fourth session in a row, boosted by a jump in Amazon.com and Alphabet, and on optimism over trade talks between the United States and Canada.

Alphabet Inc\u2019s video streaming plaform banned Trump on Jan. 12 for a minimum of one week for violating its policy against inciting violence after his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress began to certify Biden\u2019s victory on Jan. 6.

As Trump used social media to falsely challenge the results of the Nov. 3 election, his supporters followed with violent rhetoric on the services and planned openly for the Jan. 6 gatherings, according to researchers and public postings, prompting criticism of the companies for failing to take action in advance.  Activists have threatened to organize a boycott of YouTube advertising if it does not ban Trump permanently, as Twitter Inc has done. Facebook has blocked his accounts indefinitely.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Apple, which has kept details of its self-driving program under wraps, put in 79,745 miles (128,337 km) of testing in California in 2018, still far short of 10 million miles of testing on roads around the world by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo. But the miles put in by Apple last year far surpassed the 838 miles of testing that the iPhone maker did the previous year.  The data was part of California regulators\u2019 annual so-called \u201cdisengagement reports,\u201d which track how often a human safety driver must intervene to take control from a self-driving system during testing on public roads.  In the complex world of self-driving technology where road-test data is a closely guarded secret, the number of miles between disengagements has become a key metric for industry watchers to indicate how far any player\u2019s technology has progressed.  Waymo led the industry with 11,017 miles between disengagements in 2018, a 50 percent improvement from 5,595 miles the year before. Waymo said the improvement came despite driving 1.2 million miles in California, where roads are much busier than other areas where it is testing vehicles, such as suburban Arizona.  \u201cA lower rate of disengagements shows that our cars are getting better at recognizing and handling a wide variety of driving situations, including \u2018edge cases\u2019 across the cities we\u2019ve been testing in: those unusual situations that a human driver might see only once (or never) in a lifetime of driving,\u201d Waymo said in blog post.  Apple, by contrast, came in dead last, logging just over one mile per disengagement. In a letter to regulators, Apple said its approach to reporting disengagements had been \u201cconservative\u201d and that its report was \u201cover-inclusive.\u201d  Apple said it changed how it categorized disengagements starting in July 2018. Since then, the company said it had driven about 2,000 miles between what it calls \u201cimportant disengagements,\u201d which it defined as \u201csituations that might have resulted in a safety-related event or a violation of the rules of the road.\u201d At least two of those \u201cimportant disengagements\u201d happened when other human drivers hit its test vehicles, Apple said.  Apple declined to comment beyond its public documents, but even its re-worked disengagement numbers put it below other firms testing the technology.  General Motor\u2019s Cruise said it had driven 447,621 miles in California autonomously in 2018, with a disengagement every 5,205 miles on average, an improvement over every 1,236 miles last year. Cruise has yet to meet a target it set for early 2018 of driving 1 million miles autonomously per month.  Apple, which has only talked in general terms about its interest in self-driving, is a relative latecomer to the field, having only secured a California permit to conduct testing in 2017.  Last year Apple re-hired Doug Field to work on its self-driving car project, called Project Titan, with longtime executive Bob Mansfield. Field had previously left Apple to become senior vice president of engineering at Tesla Inc.  Some companies, including Ford Motor Co , Tesla Inc, Lyft and German auto supplier Bosch, said they had performed no autonomous testing in California last year.","242":"FILE PHOTO: People try out Google's Pixel 2 phones during a launch event in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2017.

Its search engine is banned in the Chinese market along with its app store, email and cloud storage services.

Alphabet shares, up 13% on the year, rose 8.5% after hours to $1,689.89.  Google\u2019s billions of users are spending more time online transacting and entertaining themselves this year as they try to avoid the virus.  But many advertisers ceased spending in the second quarter as travel and leisure activity disappeared. As the global economy in the third quarter began to chug along again, advertisers flocked to Google to let shoppers know about deals and adjusted service offerings. Google also gained from political ad spending ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, advertising analysts said.  Ad sales surged across all regions and industries, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. For instance, U.S. revenue grew 15% in the third quarter compared with 1% in the second quarter.  Porat declined to say whether the trend was sustainable in the fourth quarter, with Europe and other areas once again locking down because of significant increases in infections.  \u201cWhile we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the third quarter, there is obviously uncertainty in the external environment,\u201d Porat said.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  Alphabet said it would elevate cloud into a separate reporting unit starting in the fourth quarter, effectively dropping cloud financial results from its Google unit and giving investors their first view into the business\u2019 profitability.  Porat told financial analysts the company would not slow down spending on the cloud unit, even though another round of COVID-19 lockdowns may hit ad demand.  \u201cWe are investing aggressively in cloud, given the opportunity that we see and frankly the fact that we were later relative to peers,\u201d she said.  AD REBOUND  Alphabet\u2019s bounce-back followed its first sales decline compared with a year-earlier period in the second quarter, since going public in 2004.  Third quarter sales were $46.2 billion, up 15% from a year ago, compared with the average estimate of $42.9 billion, or 5.9% growth, among analysts tracked by Refinitiv.  Alphabet\u2019s profit was $11.2 billion, or $16.40 per share, compared with the average estimate of $7.698 billion, or $11.18 per share. Earnings benefited from cutbacks in marketing and travel and in particular a 20% drop in spending on equipment and workspace construction.  Google ad sales accounted for 80% of Alphabet\u2019s revenue, with bumps across each of the ads businesses where Google technology dominates the online landscape, including search, YouTube and the broader web.  The ubiquity and popularity of Google services has become a liability for the company. The U.S. government last week sued the company for operating a search monopoly and stifling competition. Other regulators in the United States and elsewhere have raised concerns about user privacy and censorship.  The various cases could lead to Google having to make costly changes to its bureaucracy and technology. But Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said Thursday that resolving the complaints would create \u201ccertainty, clarity and opportunities.\u201d  U.S President Donald Trump referenced his administration\u2019s lawsuit in a campaign video released on Wednesday, saying \u201cBig Tech has to be spoken to and probably in some form has to be stopped because they\u2019re taking away your rights.\u201d  Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Twitter Inc also released financial results on Thursday that were above expectations, showing how internet companies have fared well through the pandemic.

The project will now go through a formal evaluation and further public consultation before a final vote on March 31, 2020 by Waterfront Toronto, a corporation funded by the city, provincial and federal governments.  Sidewalk agreed to decrease the initial development to 12 acres, after outlining a development of 190 acres in June. It also agreed to scrap a proposed \u201cUrban Data Trust,\u201d which many critics warned had the potential to compromise the privacy of individuals\u2019 data.  Sidewalk had also wanted to be the sole developer of the area, but has now agreed to partner with \u201cone or more real estate developers\u201d that would be chosen through a \u201ccustomary\u201d competitive public procurement process led by Waterfront.  \u201cWhile a final Board decision whether or not to proceed has yet to be made, we are pleased that we are now able to move to the evaluation stage,\u201d Stephen Diamond, chair of the Waterfront Toronto board of directors, said in a statement.  The project proposes features such as a thermal grid to lower power use, traffic signals that use data to prioritize pedestrians who need more time to cross roads and a self-financing light rail transit connecting the Greater Toronto Area to the waterfront, among other features, according to a master plan released by Sidewalk Labs in June.  That plan also said the project will add C$14.2 billion ($10.8 billion) annually to Canada\u2019s GDP, C$4.3 billion in tax revenue, and create 44,000 permanent jobs by 2040. Andrew Tumilty, spokesman for Waterfront Toronto, said the group does not yet have adjusted figures, adding that would be worked through in the formal evaluation process.  Waterfront Toronto has a mandate to approve projects, although some aspects - including sales of government land - would still have to be approved by the relevant level of government.  The project has faced hurdles. Critics said Sidewalk Labs\u2019 proposals for data usage and storage took too much from individuals, and did not create enough opportunities for Canadian businesses.

But their vision faces unprecedented scrutiny, with governments on five continents demanding better safeguards, an end to what many view as anticompetitive conduct, and more taxes from the world\u2019s largest online advertising company. Thousands of employees have protested, and some have even resigned, over ongoing concern that Google\u2019s famous \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d mantra - once embraced by Page and Brin - may be cracking.  Streamlining Alphabet\u2019s unorthodox management structure could help the company better respond to the challenges and focus on growing profits, investors said.  \u201cThis signals a shift away from the more fringy efforts ... and more towards a company focused on technology that makes money,\u201d said Kim Caughey Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners.  Alphabet, which owns more than a dozen companies including self-driving car business Waymo and health care software company Verily, was created in 2015 as part of a restructuring. The Google unit retained control of major businesses including video giant YouTube, the Android smartphone software and hardware operations, and cloud computing.  Page had wanted to focus on developing the newer businesses, which collectively lose money. He left Google, by far the biggest and most profitable part of Alphabet, to Pichai, who in turn delegates a lot of authority to deputies who manage the various product lines. Brin had stayed on as Alphabet\u2019s president, spending time on robotics, health ventures and other research projects.  But Page and Brin, once regular sights at public events and at Google headquarters, had become much less visible in recent years. Page\u2019s retreat into the background drew increasing criticism from employees and U.S. lawmakers, who demanded answers from him rather than Pichai about controversial projects such as an experimental search app for Chinese users.  Page and Brin, both 46, remain directors of the parent company but will cede their respective CEO and president titles immediately, Alphabet said. The president role will not be filled, it said, describing the changes as long discussed.  Page\u2019s voice has been impaired for years because of a chronic condition, but his health did not play a role in the decision to step aside, Alphabet said.  \u201cWith Alphabet now well-established, and Google and the Other Bets operating effectively as independent companies, it\u2019s the natural time to simplify our management structure,\u201d the co-founders said. \u201cWe are deeply committed to Google and Alphabet for the long term.\u201d  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The co-founders still control the company through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26.1% of Alphabet\u2019s total voting power, Brin 25.25% and Pichai less than 1%. Alphabet shares rose 0.56% following the after-hours announcement to $1,302.  \u2018MOONSHOTS\u2019 AND REGULATORS  Page and Brin developed the core Google search technology while they were still graduate students at Stanford, and it quickly proved far superior to competing search engines of the early Internet era.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  By the time it went public in 2004, Google dominated Web search and was on its way to becoming a household name and the most powerful force in the global advertising business. The young co-founders also nurtured a free-wheeling, engineering-driven culture that became a model in Silicon Valley, which is littered with startups launched by Google veterans.  Pichai, 47, who has spent 15 years at Google, rose to prominence while leading development of Google\u2019s Chrome browser. He later led product development and engineering across all of Google\u2019s services for a year before gaining the CEO title.  Page and Brin are active in a range of non-Google ventures. Page funded a company attempting to develop flying cars, and Brin at a conference last year discussed a budding interest in cryptocurrency. The Alphabet structure was designed in part to let them pursue new \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects.  Investors and regulators, however, were never completely sold.  Alphabet had used the separation between Page\u2019s and Pichai\u2019s roles to defend its limited financial disclosures about YouTube and other large Google businesses when the practice was questioned by U.S. securities regulators in 2017.  It contended that publicly reported financial results were in line with what Page reviewed as Alphabet CEO. Regulators did not take further action, but the company\u2019s stance has frustrated investors trying to evaluate its performance.  Alphabet declined to comment on whether public financial reporting would change with Pichai assuming both CEO positions.","256":"FILE PHOTO: File photo of a 3D printed Google logo in illustration taken April 12, 2020.

CNBC first reported the investigation on Wednesday, citing unspecified materials that added that the board had retained an unnamed law firm to assist with the investigation. cnb.cx\/33qcDd4  Alphabet\u2019s board formed a special litigation committee this spring after shareholders filed a lawsuit alleging that company directors played direct roles in covering up sexual misconduct by top executives, according to a filing in the lawsuit from last month. The committee is working with law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore, the filing said.  It is unclear whether Cravath or the special litigation committee have interviewed any alleged victims, witnesses or accused executives, some of whom are no longer at Alphabet.  Alphabet spokeswoman Heather Dickinson did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.  The board investigation includes looking into the behavior of Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, who has been accused of having relationships with employees, CNBC said.  Drummond has acknowledged some mistakes with a relationship he had with a colleague, but said he has not started a relationship with any co-workers since then.  The shareholders who sued Alphabet leadership are awaiting the results of the internal investigation as they decide how to proceed with the case. They have called for various governance reforms at the company, including reducing executives\u2019 voting control and adding more independent directors.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Google logo is placed on broken glass in front of displayed Australian flag in this illustration taken, January 22, 2021. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The dispute is being closely watched worldwide since it would be the biggest challenge yet to how the U.S. tech companies that dominate social media and search engines use news on their websites.  WHAT DOES THE LEGISLATION SAY?  * The planned law states that Australian news outlets can negotiate individually or collectively with Facebook and Google over payment for content used on the tech firms\u2019 sites. Other tech firms may be added if they are deemed big enough.  * If the parties cannot reach an agreement, an arbitrator will decide whose offer is more reasonable. If Facebook or Google break any resulting agreements, they can be fined up to A$10 million ($7.4 million) in civil penalties.  * The law also requires tech firms give media outlets notice when they change search algorithms in a way affecting the order in which content appears. They must also share their use of consumer data extracted from news content on their sites.  * The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) began investigating search engine and social media companies in 2017 and worked with the federal government on drafting the rules, which are the subject of a parliamentary inquiry but expected to be passed into law.  * While internet and media companies have battled in other jurisdictions, notably in Germany over the copyright rules for news snippets and other items published by Google, Australia\u2019s proposal represents the most expansive reform.  WHY WAS THE LAW PROPOSED?  * In recent years, traditional media companies operating in Australia have suffered huge hits to income streams, such as subscriptions and advertising. For every A$100 spent on online advertising in Australia, excluding classifieds, nearly one-third goes to Google and Facebook, the competition regulator has said.  * In 2019, the regulator published a report stating news outlets lacked bargaining power when negotiating with digital firms over compensation for content posted on online platforms. It said this was a problem because those same publishers relied on Facebook and Google to reach many of their consumers.  * The government wanted the tech giants to abide by a voluntary code. Citing lack of progress in discussions, it decided that legislation was necessary.  WHAT HAS THE RESPONSE BEEN?  * The local arm of News Corp is a vocal supporter of the legislation. It partly blamed the tech companies for the closure of dozens of mastheads in 2020.  * Google and Facebook say they help connect media outlets with consumers, boosting their subscriptions and enabling them to charge advertisers more.  * Facebook says it has sent billions of clicks a year to Australian news websites via articles appearing on users\u2019 pages, and has threatened to remove news links from Australian users\u2019 feeds.  * Google says it is prepared to pay for content, though no major media organisation has agreed to its terms. Google has said it will withdraw its main search engine from Australia if the laws go ahead.  * Australia is planning more regulation of large technology companies in the media industry. The ACCC has suggested new data-sharing rules which would challenge the dominance of Google and Facebook in the online advertising market, and will publish a report in March on the role of Google and Apple Inc in the smartphone software industry.  * Australia has previously engaged in lengthy battles with major corporations. In 2012, the then centre-left government became the first in the world to prohibit cigarette companies from using designs on their packaging to attract consumers. Tobacco companies mounted legal challenges but the courts ultimately upheld the law.","279":"Aug 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday filed criminal charges against Anthony Levandowski, accusing the former high-ranking Alphabet Inc engineer of stealing the company\u2019s self-driving car technology before joining rival Uber Technologies Inc.

President Joe Biden, who has raced to curb the pandemic since taking office, has made inoculating Americans one of his top priorities and called the move \u201ca wartime effort.\u201d But tackling public fear about taking the vaccine has emerged as a major impediment for the administration.  Since the onset of the pandemic, calls from lawmakers asking the companies to tackle the spread of COVID misinformation on their platforms have grown.  The White House\u2019s direct engagement with the companies to mitigate the challenge has not been previously reported. Biden\u2019s chief of staff Ron Klain has previously said the administration will try to work with Silicon Valley on the issue.  \u201cDisinformation that causes vaccine hesitancy is going to be a huge obstacle to getting everyone vaccinated and there are no larger players in that than the social media platforms,\u201d said the source, who has direct knowledge of the White House\u2019s efforts.  \u201cWe are talking to them ... so they understand the importance of misinformation and disinformation and how they can get rid of it quickly.\u201d  The Biden White House is especially trying to make sure such material \u201cdoes not start trending on such platforms and become a broader movement,\u201d the source said.  The source cited the example of the anti-vaccine protests at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles in early February, and said the White House wants to stop events like that from happening again.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The protest, organized on Facebook through a page that promotes debunked claims about the coronavirus pandemic, masks and immunization, briefly blocked public access to the stadium - one of the largest vaccination sites in the country, where health authorities are administering more than 8,000 vaccines a day.  The event illustrated the extent to which social media platforms have become a critical organizing tool for movements such as the anti-vaccine drive, that spread misinformation and disinformation.  A growing number of anti-vaccine activists, emboldened by their rising social media following, have helped the movement gain strength in the United States. A report by the Center for Countering Digital Hate in July 2020 found social media accounts held by anti-vaxxers have increased their following by at least 7\u00b78 million people since 2019.  The companies have repeatedly vowed to get rid of such material on their platforms but gaps remain in their enforcement efforts.

YouTube\u2019s paid option will still remove ads from originals as well as all other videos, and it comes with music streaming privileges.

YouTube has not disclosed the total number of subscribers for the paid offering, launched three years ago, which is available in 29 countries.  It said its move to make programing free was aimed at satisfying growing international user interest in original programing and advertiser demand to associate with special content. The move also gives the company more flexibility in marketing its programs.  Some future programing or behind-the-scenes content may remain exclusive to subscribers, if only for a brief time, a person familiar with the thinking said.

Google has said the ACCC\u2019s stance has put its flagship search engine under threat.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that work on this project has been paused, but before we blame the regulator we shouldn\u2019t forget that the work done by the ACCC provided much of the impetus for Google to do deals with Australian publishers in the first place,\u201d said Misha Ketchell, editor and executive director of academic-focused publisher The Conversation, one of the firms with a Google deal.  \u201cWe are still optimistic.

The offering is expected to be priced between $32 and $34 per share, valuing the company at $6.7 billion at the upper-end of the price range.  The company, founded in 2012, allows patients to schedule physician visits, check lab results, make emergency virtual appointments and refill prescriptions through its mobile app or online platform.  The IPO comes as the COVID-19 pandemic boosts demand for telehealth services and companies look to expand their footprint.  At the higher end of the range, Oscar Health would have a fully diluted valuation, which includes securities such as options and restricted stock units, of about $8 billion.  This is well above the $3.2 billion Oscar was worth in a private fundraising round in 2018, according to PitchBook.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google aims to power its data centers and offices 24-7 using solely carbon-free electricity by 2030, its chief executive told Reuters, building on its previous goal of matching its energy use with 100% renewable energy.  FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is spelled out in heliostats (mirrors that track the sun and reflect the sunlight onto a central receiving point) during a tour of the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in the Mojave Desert near the California-Nevada border February 13, 2014. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus  The \u201cstretch goal,\u201d as CEO Sundar Pichai described it, will force Google to move beyond the tech industry norm of offseting carbon emissions from electricity use and require technological and political breakthroughs to achieve.  \u201cThe problem is so immense, many of us need to lead the way and show solutions,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cWe\u2019re one small player in this but we can set an example.\u201d  Wildfires burning a record area in the western United States this month have increased public awareness of climate change, Pichai said, and Google wants to bring further attention through its new goal as well as product features.  Wind, solar and other renewable sources accounted for 61% of Google\u2019s global hourly electricity usage last year. The proportion varied by facility, with carbon-free sources fulfilling 96% of hourly power needs at Google\u2019s wind-swept Oklahoma data center compared with 3% at its gas-reliant Singapore operation.  But Google, which consumes slightly more power annually worldwide than residents and businesses in Delaware, has grown optimistic that it can bridge the gap with batteries to store solar power overnight, emerging sources such as geothermal reservoirs and better management of power needs.  \u201cTo plan 24\/7 hourly being carbon-free in our data centers and campuses around the world, we see an enormous logistics challenge, which is why we\u2019ve been hard at work modeling the last year how to get there,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cAnd we feel confident we can get there by 2030.\u201d  He declined to share the likely cost of achieving the goal.  Big Google rivals including Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O have targeted removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit over the coming decades, but none of them have publicly set a goal to stop sourcing carbon-based energy.  But the companies share a common goal of catalyzing businesses and governments to curb climate pollution before 2030, when scientists say global warming could become catastrophic if unchecked.  Jennifer Layke, global director at research group World Resources Institute, which has received Google funding, said the company inspired others in the United States and Europe over the last decade but its efforts must now spur action in crucial polluting regions such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.  \u201cIf we can\u2019t shift from carbon, we will suffer the firestorms and the droughts,\u201d she said.  Google has been carbon-neutral since 2007, meaning it has planted trees, bought carbon credits and funded large amounts of wind power in places where it is abundant to offset its tapping of coal and natural gas power in other regions. It also said Monday that its estimated 1 million metric tons of emissions between 2006 and its 1998 launch now have been offset.  The company\u2019s new goals include bringing 5 gigawatts of renewable energy near some suppliers, funding tree planting beyond its offset needs and sharing data or forging partnerships with 500 governments around the world to try to cut 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030.  Google said it would continue to offset carbon emissions unrelated to electricity use, such as from employee travel.  Its carbon-free electricity goal satisfies one demand of 2,000 Google employees who last November petitioned the company to stop selling data storage and other cloud computing tools to oil companies and funding think tanks or politicians who deny the existence of climate change.  Pichai said the company would continue to \u201csupport everyone\u201d with its cloud services and help oil and gas companies transition to tapping other sources.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The companies will develop a subscription platform, share advertising revenue through Google\u2019s ad technology services, build out audio journalism and develop video journalism by YouTube. The deal comes after years of public feuding between Murdoch and Google, most recently in Australia, where Google has threatened to shut down its search engine to avoid \u201cunworkable\u201d content laws.  It is a capstone for the 89-year-old media mogul, his son Lachlan and News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson to seek compensation for premium content from platforms. Murdoch previously secured payments from Apple Inc and Facebook Inc for their Apple News and Facebook News products.  The company declined to comment on financial details of the deal, which it said involved \u201csignificant payments\u201d by Google.  In Australia, the country\u2019s two largest free-to-air television broadcasters have struck deals with Google collectively worth A$60 million ($47 million) a year, according to media reports.  The Australian deals come days before the government plans to pass laws that would allow it to appoint an arbitrator to set Google\u2019s content fees if it cannot strike a deal privately, a factor that government and media figures held up as a turning point for negotiations which stalled a year earlier.  News Corp owns two-thirds of Australia\u2019s major city newspapers.  Microsoft Corp , a big beneficiary of Google leaving the Australian market, has publicly endorsed the proposed Australian law and recently urged the U.S. government to copy it.  The company\u2019s deal with Google also comes after the tech giant agreed to pay $76 million over three years to a group of 121 French news publishers to end a more than year-long copyright spat, documents seen by Reuters show.  Google has also moved to secure deals with major publishers in the U.K., Germany, Brazil and Argentina.  \u201cThe fact that Google was only brought to the table kicking and screaming due to significant antitrust reports and leading policymakers in Europe and Australia defending the importance of a strong, independent press for society only underscores the importance of [Australian] Parliament\u2019s new law and markets like the U.S. waking up to their harms to democracy,\u201d said Jason Kint, chief executive of media industry trade association Digital Content Next.  The impact of News Corp\u2019s deal with Google on the news publishing environment remains a big question.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  The move comes as scrutiny grows worldwide over data privacy, with U.S. and European lawmakers recently focusing on how tech companies treat user data.  In court documents, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) accused Google of not explicitly getting consent or properly informing consumers of a 2016 move to combine personal information in Google accounts with browsing activities on non-Google websites.  \u201cThis change ... was worth a lot of money to Google,\u201d said commission chairman Rod Sims. \u201cWe allege they\u2019ve achieved it through misleading behaviour.\u201d  The change allowed Google to link the browsing behaviour of millions of consumers with their names and identities, providing it with extreme market power, the regulator added.  \u201cWe consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,\u201d Sims said.  However, Google said the change was optional and consumer consent was sought through prominent and easy-to-understand notifications.  \u201cIf a user did not consent, their experience of our products and services remained unchanged,\u201d a Google spokesman said in an email, adding that the company intends to defend its position.  In June 2016, Google had changed the wording of its privacy policy, dropping a statement that it would not combine data known as \u201ccookies\u201d from its advertisement display business, DoubleClick, with users\u2019 personal information.  Instead, the new policy read, \u201cDepending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google services.\u201d  The Australian regulator alleges that Google used the combined data to boost targeted advertising - a key income source - and that it did not make clear to consumers the changes in its privacy policy.  \u201cThis is an action we are taking that others have not,\u201d said Sims.  The regulator, through its action in Australia\u2019s Federal Court, wanted to establish the common law on what providers in various jurisdictions could do, and was potentially seeking \u201cmillions\u201d in damages, he added, without specifying a figure.  \u201cWe will keep taking action, as will agencies overseas, and it will shape how these platforms behave, to make sure that the internet is a benefit to users, not a detriment.\u201d","316":"FILE PHOTO: The Intel logo is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 13, 2017.

The EU executive has acknowledged the companies\u2019 efforts via regular reports but also urged them to do more. Last year, it commissioned a study to look in to the matter.  The study said the code should continue as a basis for further action but noted some shortcomings.  Key among these are the code\u2019s self-regulatory nature, the lack of uniformity of implementation and the lack of clarity around its scope and some of the key concepts, the study conducted by consultancy Valdani, Vicari and Associates (VVA) said.  It recommended giving some teeth to the code to ensure compliance.  \u201cThe European Commission should consider proposals for co-regulation within which appropriate enforcement mechanisms, sanctions and redress mechanisms should be established,\u201d the study said.

REUTERS\/Dave Paresh  To grow beyond its main search and advertising business, Google restructured in 2015 and established Alphabet as a holding company overseeing various \u201cother bets\u201d, ranging from its autonomous vehicle unit to helium balloons that provide solar-powered internet services in remote areas.  Below are some of those projects.  X  Known as Alphabet\u2019s \u201cMoonshot Factory\u201d, X is a research and development unit that acts as a nursery for the company\u2019s many offshoot projects, such as Waymo, Wing, Makani, Loon and others, helping them take root as viable separate entities.  WAYMO  Begun as Google\u2019s self-driving car project, Waymo has become one of the most advanced autonomous vehicle technology firms.  In December 2018, it launched the first commercial automated ride-hailing service of its size among the main U.S. companies vying to dominate the nascent market.  It is now offering fully automated \u201crider-only\u201d services to early users in Phoenix, Arizona, as it looks beyond the robo-taxi business to generate future revenue.  LOON  Incubated in Google\u2019s research lab in 2011, Loon was spun out as an Alphabet subsidiary in July 2018.  It aims to bring connectivity to remote parts of the world by floating solar-powered networking gear over areas where cell towers would be too expensive to build.  Its tennis-court-sized helium balloons have demonstrated utility. Over the last three years, Loon successfully let wireless carriers in Peru and Puerto Rico use balloons for free to supplant cell phone towers downed by natural disasters.  But the lifespan of the balloons is only around five months because the plastic degrades. Their presence has also generated safety concerns from some aviation authorities.  WING AVIATION  Wing is Alphabet\u2019s delivery service using specialized drones, beginning commercial air delivery services this year in Canberra, Australia, and Helsinki, Finland.  In the United States in September, Wing partnered with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and FedEx Corp to start U.S. deliveries from October.  MAKANI TECHNOLOGIES LLC  Makani attempts to harness renewable energy from wind by using propellers on airborne kites to generate electricity.  It joined the Moonshot Factory in 2013 and spun out this year to become an independent unit within Alphabet, partnering with Royal Dutch Shell Plc to build commercial versions of its kites, according to Makani\u2019s website.  VERILY  Verily is Alphabet\u2019s life science tech unit that works on machine learning and wearable devices for a wide range of healthcare scenarios.  It partners with several pharma companies for research on such projects as surgical robots and retina scan technology for early detection of some eye diseases.  SIDEWALK LABS  Sidewalk Labs provides sensor-based urban technology to manage crowds and vehicular traffic.  It is working on a project to develop a futuristic smart city in Toronto that includes self-driving garbage cans and infrared sensors to track foot traffic in stores.  CAPITALG  CapitalG, formerly Google Capital, is Alphabet\u2019s private equity fund primarily focused on backing new tech ventures.  It has invested in such companies as ride-hailing firm Lyft Inc, stock trading app Robinhood and short-term home rental firm Airbnb Inc.  GV  GV was founded as Google Ventures in 2009 before it spun off as a venture capital investment unit under Alphabet. Based in Mountain View, California, the firm has funded over 400 companies in the life sciences, consumer and technology sectors.  DEEPMIND  Acquired by Google in 2014, DeepMind is a UK-based unit taking on research projects that mostly deal with artificial intelligence.  Founded in London in 2012, DeepMind uses general-purpose learning algorithms for applications such as simulations, e-commerce and games.  CALICO  Another health-related venture, Calico focuses on research and development of methods to cure life-threatening diseases, and tackling problems affecting mental and physical agility due to aging.

When he took over as Google\u2019s chief in 2015, Pichai drew an annual salary of $652,500. The following year his earnings skyrocketed, thanks to a massive $199 million in stock awards, the highest ever for any Alphabet executive back then.

Wing Aviation plans to start commercial package delivery in Blacksburg, Virginia, later this year.  Wing partnered with the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and Virginia Tech as one of the participants in the Transportation Department\u2019s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program.  \u201cThis is an important step forward for the safe testing and integration of drones into our economy. Safety continues to be our Number One priority as this technology continues to develop and realize its full potential,\u201d said U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.  The certification is good for two years, the FAA said. One pilot can operate up to five drones at once and only during the day. Drones cannot carry hazardous materials or hover over people, the FAA said.  The FAA said Wing demonstrated that its operations met the agency\u2019s safety requirements, based on extensive data and documentation, as well as thousands of safe flights conducted in Australia. Wing plans to reach out to the local community before it begins a food delivery trial in order to gather feedback, the FAA said.  Wing has recently begun commercial air delivery service in the north of Canberra, Australia, and is also about to begin its first trial in Europe, delivering to homes in Helsinki, Finland.  Wing said its data shows a lower risk to pedestrians from drone deliveries than the same trip made by car.  In May 2018, Chao announced approval for 10 projects to help assess how to regulate drones and integrate them safely into U.S. air space. The United States has lagged other countries in experimentation with drones, something the program hopes to correct.  In January, the FAA proposed rules that would allow drones to operate over populated areas and end a requirement for special permits for night use. The FAA is also considering moving ahead with additional rules in response to public safety and national security concerns as it works to integrate drones with airplane traffic.","327":"Aug 1 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google has suspended producing transcriptions of voice recordings from its Google Assistant product in the European Union, CNBC reported here on Thursday.

Loon, spun out from Alphabet\u2019s business incubator in July, carries the gear with a long balloon, while HAPSMobile uses a drone. Both systems are solar powered, limiting the areas they can serve to equatorial regions of the globe.  Mobile network operators, governments and other potential clients have yet to demonstrate much enthusiasm for buying such technologies, despite the need to plug gaps in internet coverage in rural areas or at times of natural disasters.  The two firms are competing with billionaire entrepreneurs, such as Elon Musk, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, which are all backing separate ventures that aim to offer internet links using satellites in near-Earth orbit.  Loon and HAPSMobile said at a Tokyo news conference on Wednesday that they needed to collaborate to win over customers and were discussing sharing technology, standardizing gear and cooperating in regulatory talks.

When Page declined to show up for a Senate hearing in Washington last year, senators left an empty chair next to top officers of Twitter and Facebook. Google leaders have acknowledged that was an embarrassing gaffe for the company. Other lawmakers have also to no avail demanded answers from Page on strategic decisions.  The departure two years ago of Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, who had helped the company maintain ties in Washington, has also left a hole.  Alphabet shareholder King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said the company was transforming and facing a new set of issues including political attacks and regulatory scrutiny. \u201cPichai is uniquely suited to address given his overall affable attitude,\u201d Lip said by email.

The second document is a settlement agreement under which Google agrees to pay $10 million to the same group in exchange for the publishers\u2019 commitment not to sue over copyright claims for three years.  Publishers would commit to an upcoming new product called Google News Showcase that would allow publishers to curate content and provide limited access to paywalled stories.  Google declined to comment on terms of the deal.  In January, the Reuters news agency, a division of Thomson Reuters Corp, struck a deal with Google to be the first global news provider to Google News Showcase.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Reuters\u2019 French rival AFP has maintained its complaint with the French antitrust watchdog against Google, an internal source said. Last month, AFP\u2019s Chief Executive Fabrice Fries welcomed the deal between Google and APIG, but called on the tech company to extend such copyright deals to news agencies.  MAKING GOOGLE PAY  Pressure is mounting on Google globally to pay for news content, as the industry\u2019s advertising and revenues have plummeted with the rise of digital platforms.  In Spain and Germany, publishers have tried but failed to charge Google for displaying excerpts, or snippets. German publishers lost a legal battle in 2019 for 1 billion euros worth of copyright fees since 2013.  The text of the EU \u201cneighbouring rights\u201d rule was aimed at creating a new sustainable stream of revenues for news publishers.  In the United States, the news industry is backing legislation that would allow it to negotiate collectively with the big platforms without violating antitrust law. In Congress, lawmakers recently issued a report saying dominant tech firms have harmed the news industry because they \u201ccan impose unilateral terms on publishers, such as take-it-or-leave-it revenue sharing agreements.\u201d  Andrew MacLeod, chief executive of Canada\u2019s Postmedia, said publishers there are watching discussions in other parts of the world. \u201cWe seek an outcome to grow and architect our future rather than relying on a handout.\u201d  LACKING TRANSPARENCY  French publishers had little choice but to go along with the deal, three sources close to the matter, citing pressures from shareholders.  The same sources said some publishers were upset Google refused to provide access to data showing how much money it generates from news.  \u201cThese opaque agreements don\u2019t ensure the fair treatment of all news publishers, since the calculation formula isn\u2019t made public,\u201d the union for independent online news publishers Spiil said this week. \u201cGoogle took advantage of our divisions to advance its interests.\u201d  Fees range from as large as $1.3 million for France\u2019s reference daily Le Monde to $13,741 for local publisher La Voix de la Haute Marne, documents show. They did not specify how the amounts were calculated.  Leading national dailies Le Monde, Le Figaro and Liberation and their groups negotiated about 3 million euros ($3.6 million) each per year on top of the fee in the agreement, notably by agreeing in November to sell subscriptions through Google, one source close to the matter said.  The head of Le Monde group Louis Dreyfus and Liberation\u2019s boss Denis Olivennes declined to comment. Representatives for Le Figaro were not immediately available for comment.  The head of APIG, Pierre Louette, did not respond to messages seeking comment.

Facebook\u2019s success has shaken Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, led by an Indian-born CEO, Sundar Pichai, who has made developing markets a priority.  Google officials in India earlier this year were alarmed to learn that Facebook Inc was likely to generate about $980 million in revenue in the country in 2018, according to one of the sources. Google\u2019s India revenues reached $1 billion only last year.  Facebook and Google declined to comment on Indian revenue figures or the competition between the two companies.  Google is now pushing back, attempting to lure customers with better ad-buying tools and more localized services. The revamped strategy mirrors initiatives that have succeeded in boosting the time Indian consumers spend with Google services.  The battle in India reflects an epic challenge for Google in developing markets around the world that are crucial to the company\u2019s long-term growth - many consumers in those country\u2019s are gravitating to Facebook and it\u2019s siblings, Instagram and WhatsApp, at the expense of Google search and YouTube, and advertising dollars are quick to follow.  \u201cFacebook is a far more user-friendly platform even though they haven\u2019t created features specifically for Indian advertisers,\u201d said Vikas Chawla, who runs a small ad-buying agency in India.  Facebook ads, compared with those on Google search or YouTube, tend to transcend language barriers more easily because they rely more on visual elements, said Narayan Murthy Ivaturi, vice president at FreakOut Pte Ltd, a Singapore-headquartered digital marketing firm. Pinpointing younger consumers and rural populations is easier with Facebook and its Instagram app, he and other ad buyers said.  And Facebook is succeeding in India, which boasts the fastest-growing digital ad market of any major economy, despite internal turmoil and political controversy. It has been without a country head for the last year, and has faced a series of incidents in which rumors circulating on Facebook and WhatsApp have prompted mob violence.  A woman walks past the logo of Google during an event in New Delhi, India, August 28, 2018. REUTERS\/Adnan Abidi  Facebook and Google between them took 68 percent of India\u2019s digital ad market last year, according to advertising buyer Magna. Media agency GroupM estimates digital advertising spending will grow 30 percent in India this year.  The Facebook phenomenon is evident close to home for Google. During a recent lunch period, six out of 10 people who walked out of Google\u2019s Bangalore offices while looking at their phones told Reuters they were checking WhatsApp. All 10 said they regularly used Whatsapp.  Eight Indian ad buyers interviewed by Reuters were divided on whether Facebook would overtake Google in Indian ad revenue. That such a question would even be debated explains why Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, has pressed to flip the company\u2019s approach to emerging markets.  \u201cIndia is the most important market for the \u2018Next Billion Users\u2019 initiative,\u201d Caesar Sengupta, the head of the effort, told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual \u201cGoogle for India\u201d event in New Delhi last week.  NEW TACTICS  For many years Google designed its services for early adopters of new technology, who tended to be in Silicon Valley, said Nelson Mattos, who oversaw Google\u2019s Europe and Africa operations for several years. Great products would then find a broad global audience.  \u201cOver time, as you saw the growth of Facebook, the importance of WhatsApp and other tools in these new markets, and not the same adoption of Google, the company started to realize that maybe they had to change that approach,\u201d Mattos said.  Shortly after taking the helm three years ago, Pichai mapped a new strategy for places such as India: More services tailored to locals; more marketing on radio, billboards and TV; more local staff and start-up investment.  Google\u2019s India workforce has more than doubled since to more than 4,000 employees, or about eight times Facebook\u2019s presence, according to a tally of LinkedIn profiles and company statements.  Its products evolved too, becoming easier to use with low data plans. Smartphone apps such as Files Go and Tez - rebranded last week as Google Pay - were aimed at Indians.  \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a sea change,\u201d said Asif Baki, a user researcher at Google who oversees two-week \u201cimmersion trips\u201d in developing markets for senior executives and staff.  The efforts are bearing fruit. Indian users during the first half of this year spent more time on Google services than on Facebook services, according to estimates from audience measurement firm Comscore. Over a similar period a year ago, Facebook came out on top.  Extending those gains to the ad business is a work in progress. A handful of Google executives, including leaders for display ads and small business advertisers, traveled to India earlier this year in a previously unreported trip to better understand the needs of Indian clients.  The visit spurred them to consider ideas such as enabling advertisers to reach users only in a particular Indian state, since language and literacy vary greatly around the country, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  At the New Delhi event, Google unveiled a plan to bring Indian newspaper content online, to increase the supply of search results - and ads - available in regional languages.  Google still has to reckon with other issues. Small businesses in emerging markets are less likely to have websites, a foundation for Google ad campaigns but unnecessary for Facebook.  Executives met with one Indian merchant who recorded product videos on YouTube then messaged the links to potential customers on WhatsApp, said Kim Spalding, the company\u2019s general manager and product lead for small business ads.  Facebook, meanwhile, is already on to commercializing such behavior. Just weeks ago, it began charging for text-based marketing features on WhatsApp, with video ads expected to launch next year.","343":"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Insurance startup Clover Health will go public through a merger with blank-check firm Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp III in a deal valued at $3.7 billion including debt, the company said on Tuesday.

The issue was discovered and patched in March as part of a review of how Google shares data with other applications, Google said in a blog post. No developer exploited the vulnerability or misused data, the review found.  Shares of its parent company Alphabet closed down 1 percent at $1155.92 following the latest in a run of privacy issues to hit big U.S. tech companies.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Google opted not to disclose the security issue due to fears of regulatory scrutiny, citing unnamed sources and a memo prepared by Google\u2019s legal and policy staff for senior executives.  Google feared disclosure would invite comparison to Facebook Inc\u2019s leak of user information to data firm Cambridge Analytica, the Journal reported, adding that Chief Executive Sundar Pichai had been briefed on the issue. Google declined to comment beyond its blog post.  Google said on Monday none of the thresholds it requires to disclose a breach were met after reviewing the type of data involved, whether it could identify the users to inform, establish any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take to protect themselves.  Security and privacy experts and financial analysts questioned the decision.  \u201cUsers have the right to be notified if their information could have been compromised,\u201d said Jacob Lehmann, managing director at consulting and accounting firm Friedman CyZen. \u201cThis is a direct result of the scrutiny that Facebook dealt with regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\u201d  The Google app logo is seen on a smartphone in this picture illustration taken September 15, 2017. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  FACEBOOK CHALLENGER  Google+ launched in 2011 as the advertising giant grew more concerned about competition from Facebook, which could pinpoint ads to users based on data they had shared about their friends, likes and online activity.  Google+ copied Facebook with status updates and news feeds and let people organize their groups of friends into what it calls \u201ccircles.\u201d  But Google+ and the company\u2019s other experiments with social media struggled to win over users because of complicated features and privacy mishaps.  Facebook introduced a feature that allowed users to connect their accounts with their profiles on dating, music and other apps.  Google followed suit, letting outside developers access some Google+ data with users\u2019 permission. The bug disclosed on Monday, introduced in a software update, exposed private data including name, email address, occupation, gender and age, Google said. It could not definitely say how many users were affected because it said it keeps only two weeks of such records.  Google+ will remain an internal networking option for organizations that buy Google\u2019s G Suite, a bundle of apps for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations.  Google\u2019s plan to withdraw the free version of Google+, scheduled for August, could help strengthen its case to U.S. policymakers and regulators that it is different from Facebook, which has faced political heat over allegations that data belonging to 87 million of its users was improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.  Google refused to send Pichai to a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Sept. 5, where Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer and Twitter Inc\u2019s chief executive testified. An empty chair was left for Google after the committee rejected Google\u2019s top lawyer as a witness.  Several policies Google introduced on Monday are designed to curb the data accessible to developers offering mobile apps on the Google Play store or add-on apps for sending and organizing Gmail messages.  Play Store apps will no longer be allowed to access text message and call logs unless they are the default calling or texting app on a user\u2019s device or have an exception from Google.  Gmail add-ons available to consumers starting next year will be barred from selling user data and be subject to a third-party security assessment that will cost them about $15,000 to $75,000, Google said.  Such moves could strengthen Google by making it harder for competing services to grow off its data, said Chris Messina, a designer who worked on Google+ before leaving in 2013. \u201cIn 2011, you wanted casual, scrappy developers creating apps, and now it is going to require a professional class that is serious. The walls are going up.\u201d","347":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Google logo is seen in this illustration taken April 12, 2020.

FILE PHOTO: Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during signing ceremony committing Google to help expand information technology education at El Centro College in Dallas, Texas, U.S. October 3, 2019. REUTERS\/Brandon Wade\/File Photo  Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced on Tuesday they were stepping aside as executives of the Internet behemoth they founded 21 years ago, with trusted lieutenant Sundar Pichai, who has run the core Google search business since 2015, taking the reins as CEO of parent Alphabet.  Shares of Alphabet rose 2% on Wednesday, with some investors saying Pichai\u2019s pragmatic approach and his background at Alphabet\u2019s core business may make him less patient about money-losing projects fostered in recent years by Page and Brin. One of the biggest changes for Pichai will be taking responsibility for those so-called \u201cmoonshots,\u201d which are aimed at diversifying Alphabet\u2019s business.  Alphabet has plowed billions of dollars into ventures Wall Street has never been completely sold on, including self-driving cars, atmospheric balloons to deliver internet service, delivery drones and smart contact lenses.  \u201cThe question is, will they continue to spend money on these other bets? Under the new leadership, are they going to take a harder look at all of these businesses and start to try to focus more on ones that provide growth,\u201d said Daniel Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, which owns Alphabet shares worth over $100 million. \u201cThat would add an extra excitement about the stock.\u201d  Alphabet\u2019s Other Bets division, which includes those ventures, had an operating loss of $3.4 billion last year, compared to a $36.5 billion operating profit delivered by Google. Pichai now faces the challenge of balancing the potential benefit of bold, uncertain bets about future technology with their short-term costs.  Investments in Other Bets have already been cut over the last two years, as Alphabet pushes more money into Google\u2019s cloud computing and consumer hardware businesses. Pichai could continue that trend.  \u201cI don\u2019t think this means they\u2019re going to discard their other bets. I think they\u2019ll continue to explore other potential business opportunities, but those may be under greater scrutiny,\u201d said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC, which holds shares of Alphabet on behalf of its clients.  Page and Brin, both 46, will remain directors of the parent company and still control it through their ownership of preferred shares. As of April, Page held 26% of Alphabet\u2019s total voting power, Brin 25% and Pichai less than 1%.  King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, said he expected decisions to be made faster under Pichai, who has spent 15 years at Google and rose to prominence while leading the development of Google\u2019s Chrome browser.  \u201cHe can execute more effectively without having to worry about stepping on the toes of Page and Brin,\u201d Lip said.  The company\u2019s stock has risen 70% since Pichai became CEO of Google, which accounts for close to 99% of Alphabet\u2019s total revenue.","349":"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * Energy stocks gain on higher oil prices  * Dow set for worst first quarter ever  * Carnival slumps on plan to raise debt, suspend dividend  * Indexes up: Dow 0.18%, S&P 0.02%, Nasdaq 0.66% (Updates to open, adds comment)  March 31 (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets steadied on Tuesday at the end of the worst first quarter for the S&P 500 since 1938 amid growing evidence of the largescale damage caused by the collapse in oil prices and business activity due to the coronavirus.

The declines have erased more than $5 trillion from the value of S&P 500 firms in the first quarter, and investors fear corporate defaults and more mass layoffs going in to the second quarter.  The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to close out its worst first three months of the year since 2008.  \u201cWhile the majority of people want to remain optimistic that we\u2019ve seen the lows ... that optimism is merely based on a lot of hope,\u201d said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

The world\u2019s No. 2 smartphone maker is set to unveil its new Mate 30 line of phones on Sept. 18 in Munich, according to a source familiar with the matter, though it is not clear when the devices would go on sale.  The Mate 30, made to work on new 5G mobile networks, is Huawei\u2019s first major flagship smartphone launch since U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration effectively blacklisted the company in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company denies.  A Google spokesman told Reuters the Mate 30 cannot be sold with licensed Google apps and services due to the U.S. ban on sales to Huawei. A temporary reprieve that the U.S. government announced last week does not apply to new products such as the Mate 30, the spokesman said.  U.S. companies can seek a license for specific products to be exempted from the ban. Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, would not say whether it had applied for a license to offer its apps and services known as Google Mobile Services, though it has said in the past that it wants to continue supplying Huawei.  Reuters reported this week that the U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, but none have been granted.  The uncertainty surrounding the Mate 30 shows the confusion that reigns for Huawei and its business partners as a result of the escalating trade war between China and the United States. While the Huawei blacklisting was cast as a response to security concerns, President Trump has indicated it could be lifted as part of a trade deal.  \u201cHuawei will continue to use the Android OS and ecosystem if the U.S. government allows us to do so,\u201d Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly told Reuters. \u201cOtherwise, we will continue to develop our own operating system and ecosystem.\u201d  The Commerce Department declined to comment.

Huawei can likely use an open-source version of Android without falling foul of the U.S. ban on sales to them. But Google\u2019s apps can only be used in Europe under a paid license from the search giant. There is no fee for the license outside of Europe.  \u201cWithout Google Services, no one will buy the device,\u201d said independent analyst Richard Windsor. The Google software normally comes pre-loaded on Android devices.  Huawei earlier this month announced its own mobile operating system, dubbed Harmony. But analysts and Huawei executives are skeptical that it is yet a viable alternative to Android.  Huawei vaulted quickly into the top ranks of the global smartphone business in recent years with highly regarded hardware, and Europe has been a key market.  But the U.S. ban has dealt a body blow to sales outside of China, with Huawei\u2019s market share in Europe sliding to 19.3% in the second quarter from 24.9% in the first, figures from Counterpoint Research show.  As late as last week, senior Huawei executives struck a confident tone regarding Android and Google.  \u201cOur new phones will still be based on Android,\u201d Vincent Pang, senior vice president and board director of Huawei, told a media gathering at the top of New York City\u2019s One World Trade Center, an iconic American symbol of perseverance.  \u201cWe want to maintain one standard, one ecosystem, one technology,\u201d he said.  CHIPS IN THE CLEAR  Huawei is confident that other hardware in the new phone will be compliant with U.S. law.  The brains of the Mate 30 line, the Kirin 990 chipset, will be formally unveiled on Sept. 6 by Richard Yu, Huawei\u2019s top consumer executive, when he gives the opening keynote address at the IFA consumer tech fair in Berlin.  The Kirin 990 was developed by HiSilicon, Huawei\u2019s chips unit, based on blueprints from British chip designer ARM Holdings, owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank.  ARM severed relations with Huawei after the U.S. ban because its designs contain technology of U.S. origin. But a source familiar with Huawei\u2019s plan said its ARM license is based on work that predated the blacklisting of Huawei.  Huawei last week said it has perpetual ownership of the ARMv8 license and chips based on it, including the Kirin 990, would not be affected by the ban.  ARM declined to comment on its relationship with Huawei, saying only that \u201cARM continues to remain compliant with the latest U.S. Commerce Department restrictions and we are adhering to the guidelines related to the specific types of conversations permitted, technical or otherwise.\u201d","351":"FILE PHOTO: A Google sign is pictured on a Google building in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., October 20, 2020.

The world\u2019s largest search engine updated its policy as the health crisis has continued to rage throughout the United States, and digital advertising giants like Google and Facebook Inc have faced calls to do more to clamp down on misinformation.

It also prevents ads from running on publisher content that encourages those topics.

FILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured at Google's European Engineering Center in Zurich, Switzerland July 19, 2018 REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  The claimants had said Google GOOGL.O had illegally accessed details of iPhone users' internet browsing data by bypassing privacy settings on the Safari browser between June 2011 and February 2012.  Richard Lloyd, a consumer activist who was behind the \u201cGoogle You Owe Us\u201d court challenge, had estimated that about 4.5 million people had been affected by the \u201cSafari Workaround\u201d and wanted the tech giant to pay out several hundred dollars in damages to each affected individual.  Google had argued the mass case brought by Lloyd, the only named claimant, was not appropriate and should not proceed.  \u201cThere is no dispute that it is arguable that Google\u2019s alleged role in the collection, collation, and use of data obtained via the Safari Workaround was wrongful, and a breach of duty,\u201d the judge, Mark Warby, said in his ruling.  However, he said the case brought by Lloyd did not support the contention that he and those he represented had suffered \u201cdamage\u201d as specified by Britain\u2019s Data Protection Act nor could the court allow such representative action to go ahead.  In his ruling, he said the main beneficiaries of the claim would have been those who funded it and the lawyers.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The recommendation, in a preliminary report on the U.S. firms\u2019 market power, is being closely watched around the world as lawmakers wrestle with the powerful tech firms\u2019 large and growing influence in public life, from privacy to publishing.  It comes days after Australia passed laws forcing tech companies to help police access private user data, and amid growing concern from authorities worldwide about the giants\u2019 commercial behavior and distribution of so-called \u201cfake news\u201d.  \u201cWhen you get to a certain stage and you get market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities and that means, also, additional scrutiny,\u201d Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims told reporters in Sydney.  He said the companies\u2019 enormous market share - Google has a 94 percent share of web searches in Australia - and opaque methods for ranking advertisements gave the firms the ability and incentive to favor their businesses over advertisers\u2019.  \u201cThe idea of the regulator role would be to keep an eye on that and proactively bring some transparency,\u201d he said, adding the two firms also had outsized influence over news distribution.  Drafting the report had also spurred five investigations into possible consumer or privacy law breaches in Australia, Sims said, without disclosing which firms they concerned.  Facebook and Google, in separate statements, both said they will continue to work with the ACCC while the regulator prepares its final report due in June.  The two firms have already promised to do more to tackle the spread of fake news and, in submissions to the ACCC, said they provided users access to global news articles while providing advertisers a cheap way of reaching big audiences.  The ACCC has said its recommendations are subject to change, but suggests handing the new regulator investigative powers to examine how the companies rank advertisements and news articles.  \u201cIt is potentially a game changer,\u201d Margaret Simons, an associate professor of media at Monash University in Melbourne, said by phone, since it would bring the tech companies under a regulatory framework more typically applied to media firms.  \u201cWith the \u2018if\u2019 being whether or not governments act,\u201d she said, adding that the ACCC\u2019s work was being closely watched internationally.  Australia\u2019s government, which ordered the probe into the firms\u2019 influence a year ago as part of wider media reforms said it would consider the ACCC\u2019s final recommendations in June.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Supreme Court is seen through the U.S. Capitol columns in Washington, U.S. September 29, 2020. REUTERS\/Erin Scott\/File Photo  The shorthanded court, down one justice following last month\u2019s death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, heard oral arguments in Google\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling reviving the lawsuit in which Oracle has sought at least $8 billion in damages.  Some of the eight justices expressed concern that Google simply copied Oracle\u2019s software code instead of innovating and creating its own for mobile devices. Others emphasized that siding with Oracle could give software developers too much power with potentially harmful effects on the technology industry.  A jury cleared Google in 2016, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned that decision in 2018, finding that Google\u2019s inclusion of Oracle\u2019s software code in Android was not permissible under U.S. copyright law.  Oracle accused Google of copying thousands of lines of computer code from its popular Java programming language without a license in order to make Android, a competing platform that has harmed Oracle\u2019s business.  Google lawyer Thomas Goldstein told the justices that the disputed Java code should not receive copyright protection because it was the \u201cthe only way\u201d to create new programs using the programming language.  \u201cThe language only permits us to use those,\u201d Goldstein said.  Chief Justice John Roberts suggested Google still should have paid Oracle for a license to Java.  \u201cCracking the safe may be the only way to get the money that you want, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can do it,\u201d Roberts said.  Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned Goldstein on whether Google had simply piggybacked on Oracle\u2019s innovation.  Gorsuch asked, \u201cWhat do we do about the fact that the other competitors, Apple, Microsoft ... have, in fact, been able to come up with phones that work just fine without engaging in this kind of copying?\u201d  Oracle and Google, two California-based technology giants with combined annual revenues of about $200 billion, have been feuding since Oracle sued for copyright infringement in 2010 in federal court in San Francisco.  Google has said the shortcut commands it copied into Android do not warrant copyright protection because they help developers write programs to work across platforms, a key to software innovation.  \u2018A THOUSAND WAYS\u2019  Some justices expressed concern that siding with Oracle could give software developers too much power by letting them copyright mere methods of organizing a system as opposed to something creative or innovative.  \u201cI mean, there are a thousand ways of organizing things, which the first person who developed them, you\u2019re saying, could have a copyright and then prevent anybody else from using them,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan told Oracle\u2019s lawyer, Joshua Rosenkranz.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested Oracle was trying to \u201cupend\u201d the software industry\u2019s understanding of which software elements can be copyrighted and which cannot.  \u201cPlease explain to me why we should now upend what the industry has viewed as the copyrightable elements,\u201d Sotomayor told Rosenkranz.  Even if the shortcut commands can be copyrighted, Google has said, its use of them was permissible under the \u201cfair use\u201d defense to copyright infringement, which can protect copying that transforms an original copyrighted work. Google has argued that its copying was \u201cundoubtedly transformative\u201d because it resulted in \u201can entirely new smartphone platform.\u201d  The Federal Circuit in 2018 rejected Google\u2019s defense, saying \u201ca mere change in format (e.g., from desktop and laptop computers to smartphones and tablets) is insufficient as a matter of law to qualify as a transformative use.\u201d  Oracle will recalculate its damages request if it wins at the Supreme Court and the case is sent back to a lower court for further litigation, seeking more than the amount it previously sought, Oracle General Counsel Dorian Daley told Reuters.  Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked whether a ruling in favor of Oracle would have the dire consequences that Google has predicted. Kavanaugh noted that it has been years since a lower court concluded Oracle\u2019s commands deserved copyright protection.  \u201cI\u2019m not aware that the sky has fallen in,\u201d Kavanaugh said.  Goldstein said that ruling\u2019s fallout was limited because a jury later sided with Google on its \u201cfair use\u201d defense.  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration backed Oracle in the case. The arguments were conducted by teleconference because of the coronavirus pandemic.  A ruling is expected by the end of June.","357":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google competitors have called for further action by European Union antitrust regulators to ensure the Alphabet-owned GOOGL.O firm treats rivals offering shopping services equally.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington issued the preliminary injunction in a brief order late on Sunday. He declined \u201cat this time\u201d to block restrictions set to take effect on Nov. 12 on technical and business arrangements which are crucial for the app to function properly.  Nichols\u2019 detailed written opinion is expected to be released as soon as Monday.  The Commerce Department said in a statement it \u201cwill comply with the injunction and has taken immediate steps to do so.\u201d  The statement, which defended the TikTok order and Trump\u2019s executive order demanding owner ByteDance divest its TikTok U.S. operations, did not specify whether the government would appeal.  The injunction comes at a time when negotiations are underway to hammer out terms of a preliminary deal for Walmart Inc and Oracle Corp to take stakes in a new company, TikTok Global, that would oversee U.S. operations. Trump has said he had given the deal his \u201cblessing.\u201d  But key terms of the deal - including who will have majority ownership - are in dispute. ByteDance has also said any deal will need to be approved by China and Beijing has revised its list of technologies subject to export bans, in a way that gives it a say over any TikTok deal.  TikTok said it was pleased with the injunction and added it would maintain its \u201congoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the president gave his preliminary approval to last week, into an agreement.\u201d  John E.

FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S. August 7, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which goes into effect on Jan. 1, requires large businesses to let consumers opt out of the sale of their personal data. Lobbying by internet companies earlier this year failed to have the law exclude personalized ads, leaving the most popular and lucrative online ads in jeopardy.  Advertisers sometimes spend up to 10 times more money to place personalized ads, which take into account a consumer\u2019s browsing history, interests and past behavior when determining which message to display.  It is unclear how many publisher and advertiser clients will enable the new restrictions, as interpretations of the law may vary. Google declined to elaborate on whether further measures related to the new law were forthcoming.  Websites and apps selling ads through Google tools such as AdSense and Ad Manager are not required to make significant changes under the company\u2019s new compliance terms, which it posted online and sent to clients over the last three days.  But ad sellers can choose to stop personalized ads either to all consumers with internet addresses originating in California or to any individual worldwide that blocks the sale of personal data.  Google said that when the \u201crestricted data processing\u201d is triggered, ads will only be based off general data such as the user\u2019s city-level location or the subject of the page where the ad is appearing.  Additionally, Google will not record personal information for future advertising purposes in the restricted mode.  Advertisers using Google\u2019s tools also will have the choice to restrict data processing, though they would then lose features used to personalize ads to consumers that, for instance, have visited a particular store or installed a particular app.  The California law has been compared to Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, a privacy law affecting European users that went into effect in 2018 and has become the basis of data privacy investigations targeting Google, Facebook Inc and other tech companies.","367":"June 29 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said on Monday that it had removed search ads that charged users searching for voting information large fees for voter registration or harvested their personal data.

U.S. voters do not need to pay to register to vote.  PrivacyWall did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Google\u2019s parent company beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates for revenue and profit, but the bigger-than-expected spending prompted investors to question whether cash funneled into Alphabet\u2019s newer businesses will generate the returns that its search engine unit historically has.  \u201cWhile the core business is still growing impressively, the significant spending shows growth isn\u2019t quite as capital-light as had been hoped,\u201d said George Salmon, a stock analyst at financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown.  The company reported $31.07 billion in total fourth-quarter costs and expenses, up 26 percent from last year. Capital expenditures rose 64 percent compared to last year, up to $7.08 billion.  Spending was pushed higher by Google boosting staffing on its cloud computing division, promoting its consumer devices and YouTube subscription packages and acquiring office buildings in Silicon Valley and New York City.

The policy seeks to prohibit content that potentially capitalizes on events like public health emergencies or natural disasters.  In the email, which was first reported by Axios, Google also reminded advertisers of its policy against ads that promote hate or incite violence. \u201cGiven the events of the last week, we are extremely vigilant about enforcing on any ads that might reasonably be construed as crossing this line,\u201d it said.","382":"FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured at the entrance to the Google offices in London, Britain January 18, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt (L) and David Drummond, Google's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, react before a meeting about the \"right to be forgotten\" in Madrid September 9, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrea Comas (SPAIN)  Drummond, also senior vice president of corporate development, had been with Google since its start in 1998. He incorporated the company as outside counsel, winning the business of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He later spent nearly 18 years as the company\u2019s top lawyer and one of its few black executives.  Scrutiny centered on Drummond as the board last year investigated the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct complaints throughout its workforce, and he became a lightning rod for criticism about what some employees viewed as tolerance for poor behavior.  Pichai now has his first big chance to make his mark on Alphabet leadership since Page and Brin left him day-to-day reins of the company last month.  Drummond\u2019s last day is Jan. 31, and a replacement has not been decided yet, Alphabet said.  \u201cWith Larry and Sergey now leaving their executive roles at Alphabet, the company is entering an exciting new phase, and I believe that it\u2019s also the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders,\u201d Drummond said in an email to employees shared by Google.  Some employees had questioned Drummond\u2019s role at the company after the New York Times in 2018 reported on an extramarital affair he had with subordinate, Jennifer Blakely, starting in 2004. She told the paper that she was effectively forced to transfer teams to comply with Google\u2019s workplace dating policy.  Blakely had a son with Drummond, but in August 2019 she publicly criticized him for not providing support. Drummond responded in a statement calling himself \u201cfar from perfect.\u201d Blakely did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.  Some shareholders have urged Alphabet to make changes that had been within Drummond\u2019s purview, including greater financial transparency, bigger share buybacks and a management shakeup. Alphabet shares have risen 6.5% this month as analysts expressed optimism about possible changes.  In a departure from company norm, Drummond is not receiving an exit pay package. In recent weeks, Drummond sold more than $200 million worth of his Alphabet shares, leaving him with about $90 million in company stock.  He remains a defendant, alongside other executives, in a lawsuit shareholders brought last year accusing Alphabet leadership of covering up sexual harassment scandals within the company including by awarding lavish exit packages to two top executives found responsible for misconduct.  \u201cWhile we are glad to see Mr. Drummond is no longer with Alphabet, we still intend to hold him accountable for fiduciary breaches through our litigation,\u201d said Julie Goldsmith Reiser, attorney for the lead plaintiffs.  The board completed an internal investigation last month, but has not publicized findings. The litigation is in mediation, and the board\u2019s findings and resulting actions may become known as it goes on.  Pichai in 2018 said Google made mistakes in some cases and introduced new procedures aimed at creating equity and transparency in harassment investigations.  \u201cI am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society\u2026 and, yes, here at Google, too,\u201d said Pichai, who at the time was Google CEO and had not yet gained the additional title of Alphabet CEO.  The #MeToo movement has forced major shake-ups in management and harassment policy across corporate America.  Through blog posts, congressional appearances and media interviews, Drummond\u2019s presence was felt in nearly every public battle the company fought as it crippled traditional businesses in media and telecoms on its way to online dominance.  Drummond has described himself as a diversity advocate, telling Fortune in 2017 that he \u201cpushed\u201d the company to do more on the issue. He encouraged Google to publish data about the demographics of its workforce, and in 2014 he marched into a companywide meeting and spoke alongside colleagues frustrated by police violence against young black men.  BIGGER ROLE  When Google re-organized under the Alphabet umbrella in 2015, Page elevated Drummond\u2019s role beyond managing the company\u2019s legal and regulatory problems to overseeing its investment funds and far-off ventures.  Earlier in his tenure, he beat a lawsuit lodged by insurer Geico that would have undermined the company's now-massive search ads business. He settled with Viacom VIACA.O a copyright infringement lawsuit that could have crushed YouTube on its way to becoming the top online video destination. And he fended off five major book publishers to enable Google to make their copyrighted works searchable online.  Drummond tussled on behalf of Google with rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for a decade on executive poaching, anticompetitive conduct and patents, with each company taking its share of licks.  As Google\u2019s lead dealmaker, Drummond oversaw billions of dollars\u2019 worth of acquisitions including of YouTube, DoubleClick and Motorola.  Drummond for a time served as the public face of strong stands against governments around the world. He has regularly advocated for freedoms of speech, and in 2010, he called for trade sanctions on countries that censor the internet, such as China and Turkey.","388":"OAKLAND, Calif., July 31 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google said on Friday that 20 U.S. states and territories, representing about 45% of the country\u2019s population, are \u201cexploring\u201d contact tracing apps for the novel coronavirus using a tool it developed with Apple Inc.

For the fourth quarter, Google reported $31.07 billion in costs and expenses, up 26 percent from last year. Capital expenditure rose 64 percent to $7.08 billion.  Last week, Reuters reported Amazon.com Inc was exploring alternatives to locate part of its new headquarters in New York in case the plan fails due to local opposition.

Waymo on Friday confirmed that it had set up a legal entity in China several months ago and has people working there.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which quit China\u2019s search engine market in 2010, has been actively seeking ways to re-enter the sector in the country where many of its products are blocked by regulators.  In August, Reuters reported that the company plans to launch a version of its search engine in China that will block some websites and search terms.

FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is seen at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Charles Platiau  Google said in a statement Mitchell violated the company\u2019s code of conduct and security policies by moving electronic files outside the company. Mitchell, who announced her firing on Twitter, did not respond to a request for comment.  Google\u2019s ethics in artificial intelligence work has been under scrutiny since the firing of Gebru, a scientist who gained prominence for exposing bias in facial analysis systems. The dismissal prompted thousands of Google workers to protest. She and Mitchell had called for greater diversity and inclusion among Google\u2019s research staff and expressed concern that the company was starting to censor papers critical of its products.  Gebru said Google fired her after she questioned an order not to publish a study saying AI that mimics language could hurt marginalized populations. Mitchell, a co-author of the paper, publicly criticized the company for firing Gebru and undermining the credibility of her work.  The pair for about two years had co-led the ethical AI team, started by Mitchell.  Google AI research director Zoubin Ghahramani and a company lawyer informed Mitchell\u2019s team of her firing on Friday in a meeting called at short notice, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person said little explanation was given for the dismissal. Google declined to comment.  The company said Mitchell\u2019s firing followed disciplinary recommendations by investigators and a review committee. It said her violations \u201cincluded the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees\u201d. The investigation began Jan. 19.  Google employee Alex Hanna said on Twitter the company was running a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Mitchell and Gebru, with whom she worked closely. Google declined to comment on Hanna\u2019s remarks.  Google has recruited top scientists with promises of research freedom, but the limits are tested as researchers increasingly write about the negative effects of technology and offer unflattering perspectives on their employer\u2019s products.  Reuters reported exclusively in December that Google introduced a new \u201csensitive topics\u201d review last year to ensure that papers on topics such as the oil industry and content recommendation systems would not get the company into legal or regulatory trouble. Mitchell publicly expressed concern that the policy could lead to censorship.  Google reiterated to researchers in a memo and meeting on Friday that it was working to improve pre-publication review of papers. It also announced new policies on Friday to handle sensitive departures and evaluate executives based on team diversity and inclusion.","392":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Six Google employees on Thursday joined U.S. lawmakers to support bills that would ban mandatory arbitration in employment and consumer contracts, as the workers seek to build on recent success in getting the Alphabet Inc company to drop some arbitration provisions.

REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  Mandatory arbitration, which prevents people from taking disputes to court, has become a big target for workers\u2019 rights activists in recent years. They have expressed concern that requiring private arbitration helps businesses facing harassment and discrimination allegations to avoid public scrutiny.  \u201cWe cannot have an honest conversation about labor rights or restoring consumer protections until we pull back the curtain of forced arbitration, which denies employees and consumers of their ability to fully and publicly vindicate their rights,\u201d Tanuja Gupta, a New York-based Google employee said during a news conference in Washington on Thursday.  The Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act and several pieces of related legislation would ensure individual and class-action lawsuits are an option in a variety of disputes, members of Congress said at the news conference.  Business groups have said arbitration provides timely resolutions and that lawsuits benefit lawyers more than plaintiffs.  Democratic lawmakers have attempted to curtail mandatory arbitration before but have struggled to gain support from Republican colleagues.  Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he expects the FAIR Act to at least pass the Democrat-controlled House this year.  \u201cThis bill is about guaranteeing every individual their day in court,\u201d Blumenthal said.  Andy Phelan, a spokesperson for Representative Hank Johnson, who has long backed arbitration changes, said tech workers harmed by such provisions had never before appeared at a bill introduction.  Last week, Google became the latest of a handful of tech companies to announce it would no longer require employees to arbitrate employment disputes.  Thousands of Google workers briefly walked off the job in November as part of a demonstration organized by Gupta and a few others to advocate for workplace policy changes, including on arbitration.

The search giant on Tuesday announced an expansion of its advertising real estate to boost revenue from mobile shoppers. It will feature ads on the homepage of its smartphone app worldwide, show more ads in Maps and place ads with image galleries in search results.  The changes come as choppy revenue growth prompt questions from some Alphabet investors about whether services such as Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram are drawing online shoppers and in turn, advertisers away from Google.  Google executives told reporters on Monday the latest features were a response to how users behave, not competition.  The company wants to make it easier for users to discover and buy new products because they shop in spurts while watching TV or sitting in the bathroom, said Oliver Heckmann, vice president of engineering for travel and shopping.  \u201cIt actually changed with mobiles and what users expect from an online service like Google,\u201d he said.  Shares of Alphabet fell 1% to $1,124.86 on Tuesday.  The ads on the Google homepage appear on what the company calls its Discover feature, a Facebook-style news feed that users swipe through to view an algorithmically personalized set of links to articles, videos and other online content.  The company said on Monday that ads would run where ever Discover is available, including on its mobile website, but clarified on Tuesday that ads would only be in the Google app.  Google tested ads on Discover last year, when it said more than 800 million people were using the feature monthly.  The gallery ads are part of an effort to make search results more visual. Ads with several images are expected to garner more clicks, which could lead to them being shown in more results, executives said.  In Maps, ads will now appear in recommended search queries, on routing pages and during navigation.  Google - which announced the changes at its Marketing Live conference for advertisers - also said it would begin showing personalized content on its Google Shopping home page. That offers only a search box in most countries at present.  The company will continue to use the Shopping service to take orders for in-store pick up or delivery from a variety of shops.

But Waze usage is flat in some countries as Google Maps gets significant promotion, and Waze has lost money as it focuses on a little-used carpooling app and pursues an advertising business that barely registers within the Google empire, according to interviews with 11 former employees over the last year.  Amid increased scrutiny of \u201ckiller acquisitions\u201d designed to neutralize potential competitors, antitrust critics and U.S. lawmakers in recent months have questioned whether competition authorities failed by allowing Google to purchase Waze.  \u201cWe could have probably grown faster and much more efficiently had we stayed independent,\u201d Bardin wrote, noting that Google imposed constraints on Waze and copied its ideas into Google Maps.

Founded in 2008 in Israel, Waze grew popular because it crowdsourced map and traffic information from users, keeping it more updated than rivals and shaving minutes off journeys.  Before the pandemic, Waze generated more than $200 million annually from fast food, retail and other ads shown throughout its app, two former employees said, but how to grow further has been a big internal debate.  Some employees advocated an increased focus on advertising, but Bardin was more interested in an app Waze launched in 2016 to connect commuters with people who would pay them for rides, the sources said.  Waze Carpool generated 550,000 rides in September 2019. To stoke usage last year, Bardin encouraged employers to subsidize commutes of essential workers. Results of that effort have not been disclosed.","403":"(Corrects paragraph 6 to say average earnings expectations over the past four quarters was 78 percent, not 72 percent)  * Futures up: Dow 0.08 pct, S&P 0.07 pct, Nasdaq 0.09 pct  Feb 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were subdued on Monday following a strong jobs report which highlighted strength in the domestic economy, while investors waited for Alphabet\u2019s earnings following a mixed bag of results from other FAANG stocks.  Alphabet Inc rose 0.5 percent in premarket trading ahead of its quarterly results after the bell, and will round up earnings from the FAANG group.  The reports have been a mixed bag, with Apple Inc and Facebook Inc posting better-than-expected quarterly results last week, while Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc gave a downbeat current-quarter forecast.  Still, the indexes held onto their two-month levels, as recent signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and the Federal Reserve\u2019s signal of slowing down its pace of monetary tightening led to a collective sigh of relief among investors who have fretted over growth.  A nonfarm payrolls report on Friday showed U.S. job growth surged in January, with employers hiring the most workers in 11 months. Still, concerns remained that a slowdown in the rest of the world could hurt U.S. earnings, with warnings from bellwethers including Caterpillar Inc.  Nearly half of the S&P 500 companies that have reported Q4 earnings so far, 70.9 percent beat analysts\u2019 expectations, below the last four quarters average of 78 percent.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks past the sign of \"Google for India\", the company's annual technology event in New Delhi, India, September 19, 2019. REUTERS\/Sankalp Phartiyal\/File Photo  Although Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, has worked closely with India\u2019s booming startup sector and is ramping up its investments, it has recently angered many tech companies with what they say are unfair practices.  Setting the stage for a potential showdown, entrepreneurs held two video conferences this week to strategise, three executives told Reuters.  \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be a bitter fight,\u201d said Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of e-commerce firm IndiaMART. \u201cGoogle will lose this battle. It\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d  He said executives have discussed forming a new startup association aimed chiefly at lodging protests with the Indian government and courts against the Silicon Valley company.  Nearly 99% of the smartphones of India\u2019s half a billion users run on Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system. Some Indian startups say that allows Google to exert excessive control over the types of apps and other services they can offer, an allegation the company denies.  The uproar began last month when Google removed popular payments app Paytm from its Play Store, citing policy violations. This led to a sharp rebuke from the Indian firm\u2019s founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, whose app returned to the Google platform a few hours later, after Paytm made certain changes.  In a video call on Tuesday, Sharma called Google the \u201cbig daddy\u201d that controls the \u201coxygen supply of (app) distribution\u201d on Android phones, according to an attendee. He urged the roughly 50 executives on the call to join hands to \u201cstop this tsunami.\u201d  \u201cIf we together don\u2019t do anything, then history will not be kind to us. We have to control our digital destiny,\u201d Sharma said.  One idea raised was to launch a local rival to Google\u2019s app store, but Sharma said this would not be immediately effective given Google\u2019s dominance, one source said.  Sharma and Paytm, which is backed by Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, did not respond to requests for comment.  Google declined to comment. It has previously said its policies aim to protect Android users and that it applies and enforces them consistently on developers.  STRAINING TIES  This week the U.S. company angered some Indian startups by deciding to enforce a 30% commission it charges on payments made within apps on the Android store.  Two dozen executives were on a call on Friday where many slammed that decision. They discussed filing antitrust complaints and approaching Google\u2019s India head for discussions, said two sources with direct knowledge of the call.  Participants included sports technology firm Dream Sports, backed by U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global, social media company ShareChat and digital payments firm PhonePe, the sources said. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.  Google defends the policy, saying 97% of apps worldwide comply with it.  Google already faces an antitrust case related to its payments app in India and a competition investigation into claims it abused Android\u2019s dominant position. The company says it complies with all laws.  These spats strain Google\u2019s strong ties to Indian startups. It has invested in some and helped hundreds with product development. In July, its Indian-born CEO Sundar Pichai committed $10 billion in new investments over five to seven years.  The conflict \u201cis counterproductive to what Google has been doing - it\u2019s an odd place for them to be,\u201d said a senior tech executive familiar with Google\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s a reputation issue. It\u2019s in the interest of Google to resolve this issue.\u201d  Google looms over every aspect of the industry.  Paytm on Saturday told several startup founders, in a communication seen by Reuters, that it was collating input on challenges to Google Play Store and its policies to submit to the authorities.  To craft their attack, they are using a shared Google document.","406":"(Reuters) - Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, said on Tuesday it raised an additional $750 million in its first external investment round, bringing the total funding to $3 billion.

All of Google\u2019s U.S. offices will now remain closed at least until Sept. 7, Google spokeswoman Katherine Williams told Reuters.  Google said in late May it would reopen buildings in more cities at roughly 10% of their capacity beginning July 6 and scale it up to 30% in September, if conditions permitted.

Here are some answers to key questions about the case:  WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST GOOGLE?  The Justice Department alleges that Google broke antitrust law to maintain its monopoly in search, where it has about 90 percent of the U.S. market, and two kinds of advertising - search advertising and general search text advertising.  As evidence, the department points to billions of dollars that Google pays to smartphone makers such as Apple, Samsung and others to make Google\u2019s search engine the default on their devices. As a result, the government argued, smaller search engines never get the scale they need to improve their algorithms, and grow.  WHAT REMEDIES DID THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REQUEST THE JUDGE IMPOSE?  The Justice Department has broad leeway in requesting a remedy and on Tuesday, it said \u201cnothing was off the table,\u201d including a breakup of the search and advertising company.  In the complaint\u2019s \u201crequest for relief,\u201d the U.S. is seeking \u201cstructural relief as needed to cure any anti-competitive harm.\u201d \u201cStructural relief\u201d in antitrust matters generally means the sale of an asset.  It also asked the court to order Google to stop anti-competitive behavior and to pay the government\u2019s costs.  WHAT OTHER ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST GOOGLE?  In the past, Google has been accused of using its popular search function to favor its products, like YouTube, as well as big advertisers.  For example, a recent search for a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d video resulted in several choices from Google\u2019s YouTube before NBC, which produces the show. Companies such as Yelp have argued they are better than Google at helping consumers find certain services but that they often appear below a box of Google recommendations, resulting in fewer clicks.  Other allegations relate to advertising more broadly. In advertising, Google dominates the interlocking businesses that connect advertisers with newspapers, websites and other firms looking to host them. Google has been accused of being opaque in revealing its revenue from transactions, using \u201cbundles\u201d of products to disadvantage smaller rivals, and of rigging auctions.  WHAT DOES GOOGLE SAY ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS?  Google on Tuesday called the lawsuit against the company \u201cdeeply flawed\u201d and said that users would find it more difficult to access superior search tools and affordable smartphones if the government wins its case.  Regarding search, Google has said that users have access to other information sources, like Twitter for news and Amazon for products. And it says that people use Google for quick answers, which has spurred the company to develop new ways to organize results.  In terms of advertising, it argues that it competes with a large array of companies, including giants like Oracle Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. And it argues that online advertising prices have steadily declined over the past decade.  As for Android, Google has said that phone makers that use its smartphone system do not have to include Google apps and may pre-install competing apps.  WHAT ROLE DO STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE?  A large group of attorneys general is also investigating Google, with 11 states joining the DOJ suit Tuesday. A group headed by Texas is focused on Google\u2019s advertising practices, while other states are looking at search and Android. These may also result in lawsuits.  HOW LONG WOULD A TRIAL AND APPEALS TAKE?  It is in Google\u2019s interest to drag out the legal fight. Antitrust experts say it would take at least six to nine months to get to trial, with a decision coming several months after the trial\u2019s end. It would then likely be appealed.  On Tuesday, Google said it typically takes 12 to 18 months before such cases get to trial.  ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST GOOGLE POLITICALLY MOTIVATED?  Several tech trade lobbying groups said the suit was politically motivated. \u201cThe suit was hurried out on the eve of an election where the administration has aggressively pressured tech companies to take actions in its favor,\u201d the Computer & Communications Industry Association said in a statement.  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been angry with several Silicon Valley companies for allegedly silencing conservatives and many Republican lawmakers have brought up the issue of bias during recent antitrust congressional hearings.

The state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, who posted copies of the lawsuits here on his website, said he was seeking penalties against the companies and an injunction for failing to disclose ad spending in state elections since 2013.  Facebook said it looked forward to resolving the lawsuit quickly after it recently introduced tools for people to see who is buying political ads on its social network.  A representative for Google could not immediately be reached for comment. Like Facebook, Google has pledged to create an online archive of ads that run on its service.  Facebook and Google have faced criticism from lawmakers, users and advocates for campaign finance regulation for their role in selling political ads after Russians allegedly used fake names to buy ads to sway American voters around the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  Unlike most U.S. jurisdictions, both Washington state and the city of Seattle have laws dating to the 1970s that require companies that sell advertising, such as radio stations, to disclose who buys political ads. Other states put the burden of disclosure on the buyers themselves.  A Seattle official said in February that he thought Facebook was in violation of the city\u2019s law, though Seattle has not sued the company.  Ferguson said his office received a citizen complaint in April alleging that Facebook and Google had not provided legally required information on political ads.","412":"FILE PHOTO: Professor Frances H.

REUTERS\/Alexandre Meneghini  While relations between the United States and Cuba have nosedived of late, the old Cold War foes seem able to agree on the need to increase internet access in what has long been one of the Western world\u2019s least connected nations.  While President Donald Trump has tightened the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, he has not eliminated an exception to it established by his predecessor Barack Obama, which allows U.S. telecommunications companies to provide services to Cuba, such as setting up fiber-optic cable.  U.S. tech behemoth Google has been working to expand its business in Cuba for years although the source said the agreement was not a commitment from the firm to build anything.  The Cuban government had been set to hold a news conference in Havana with Google on Tuesday but then rescheduled it for Thursday.  Neither Google officials working on Cuba projects nor the government replied to requests for comment.  Whether because of a lack of cash, the U.S. embargo or concerns about the flow of information, the internet in Cuba was largely only available to the public at tourist hotels until 2013.  But the government has since made boosting connectivity a priority, introducing cybercafes and outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots, slowly starting to hook up homes to the Web and last December introducing mobile internet.  Still, Cubans complain the connection is slow and expensive and coverage is spotty. The cash-strapped government has acknowledged it needs to build up the infrastructure.  Google already took advantage of the Obama-era thaw in U.S.-Cuban relations, which have since frozen over once more, to set up a small pilot display center in Havana and signed a deal in 2016 granting internet users quicker access to its branded content.  Former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt met with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel twice last year, first in June in Havana and then at a meeting with other technology executives in New York in September.","417":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators said Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O disclosure of user data vulnerabilities at Google+ raised \"serious questions\" over whether it violated a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, potentially exposing Google to penalties.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Alphabet said this month it would shut down the consumer version of its failed social network Google+ and tighten its data-sharing policies after announcing the private profile data of at least 500,000 users may have been exposed to hundreds of external developers.  The issue, the latest in a run of privacy issues to hit big U.S. tech companies, was discovered and patched in March. The Wall Street Journal reported that Google opted not to disclose the security issue due to fears of regulatory scrutiny, citing unnamed sources and a memo prepared by Google\u2019s legal and policy staff for senior executives.  Senators Amy Klobuchar and Catherine Cortez Masto wrote to Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Wednesday asking why the company had failed to disclose the issue for six months.  The incident raises \u201cserious questions\u201d about whether the company violated a 2011 consent decree with the FTC, they wrote, adding that Google failed to \u201cprotect consumers\u2019 data and kept consumers in the dark about serious security risks.\u201d  The company agreed to 20 years of audits to ensure consumer privacy as part of the consent decree with the FTC over botched rollouts of the social network Buzz, which is now defunct.

Alphabet Inc jumped 8% in premarket trading, as a drop in Google ad sales steadied in April and some consumers returned to using the search engine for shopping in addition to finding coronavirus information.  Wall Street\u2019s main indexes closed down on Tuesday, as investors shifted out of growth stocks and into more value-oriented cyclical names. But the main indexes have recovered 30% from their lows in March, boosted by aggressive stimulus efforts and, more recently, hopes of an economic revival as states begin to relax lockdown measures.  The U.S. economy likely contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the Great Recession as strict lockdown measures curbed consumer activity, ending the longest expansion in the nation\u2019s history.  The Commerce Department\u2019s report, due at 8:30 a.m. EDT, is expected to show a decline in gross domestic product (GDP), which will further reinforce analysts\u2019 forecasts that the U.S. economy was already in a deep recession.  Also up is a policy decision from the Federal Reserve and more corporate earnings reports from planemaker Boeing Co before the bell and technology heavyweight Microsoft Corp later in the day.

A Google sign is pictured on a Google building in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., October 20, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  \u201cToday, millions of Americans rely on the Internet and online platforms for their daily lives,\u201d Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. \u201cCompetition in this industry is vitally important, which is why today\u2019s challenge against Google \u2014 the gatekeeper of the Internet \u2014 for violating antitrust laws is a monumental case both for the Department of Justice and for the American people.\u201d  \u201cOver the course of the last 16 months, the Antitrust Division collected convincing evidence that Google no longer competes only on the merits but instead uses its monopoly power \u2013 and billions in monopoly profits \u2013 to lock up key pathways to search on mobile phones, browsers, and next generation devices, depriving rivals of distribution and scale,\u201d he added.  \u201cThe end result is that no one can feasibly challenge Google\u2019s dominance in search and search advertising.\u201d  The following are key quotes from the lawsuit:  \u201cGoogle is a monopolist in the general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising markets. Google aggressively uses its monopoly positions, and the money that flows from them, to continuously foreclose rivals and protect its monopolies.\u201d  \u201cIn sum, Google deprives rivals of the quality, reach, and financial position necessary to mount any meaningful competition to Google\u2019s longstanding monopolies. By foreclosing competition from rivals, Google harms consumers and advertisers.\u201d  \u201cAbsent a court order, Google will continue executing its anticompetitive strategy, crippling the competitive process, reducing consumer choice, and stifling innovation. Google is now the unchallenged gateway to the internet for billions of users worldwide.  \u201cAs a consequence, countless advertisers must pay a toll to Google\u2019s search advertising and general search text advertising monopolies; American consumers are forced to accept Google\u2019s policies, privacy practices, and use of personal data; and new companies with innovative business models cannot emerge from Google\u2019s long shadow.  \u201cFor the sake of American consumers, advertisers, and all companies now reliant on the internet economy, the time has come to stop Google\u2019s anticompetitive conduct and restore competition.\u201d  \u201cGoogle\u2019s practices are anticompetitive under long-established antitrust law. Almost 20 years ago, the D.C. Circuit in United States v. Microsoft recognized that anticompetitive agreements by a high-tech monopolist shutting off effective distribution channels for rivals, such as by requiring preset default status (as Google does) and making software undeletable (as Google also does), were exclusionary and unlawful under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\u201d  \u201cAlthough it is possible to change the search default on Safari from Google to a competing general search engine, few people do, making Google the de facto exclusive general  search engine. That is why Google pays Apple billions on a yearly basis for default status.  Indeed, Google\u2019s documents recognize that \u201cSafari default is a significant revenue channel\u201d and that losing the deal would fundamentally harm Google\u2019s bottom line. Thus, Google views the prospect of losing default status on Apple devices as a \u201cCode Red\u201d scenario.  In short, Google pays Apple billions to be the default search provider, in part, because Google knows the agreement increases the company\u2019s valuable scale; this simultaneously denies that scale to rivals.\u201d  The complaint pointed to the billions of dollars that Google pays to smartphone makers such as Apple, Samsung and others to be a default search engine on their devices. \u201cSome of these agreements also require distributors to take a bundle of Google apps, including its search apps, and feature them on devices in prime positions where consumers are most likely to start their internet searches,\u201d the complaint said.  \u201cGoogle\u2019s anticompetitive practices are especially pernicious because they deny rivals scale to compete effectively. General search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising require complex algorithms that are constantly learning which organic results and ads best respond to user queries,\u201d the government said in its complaint.  \u201cBy using distribution agreements to lock up scale for itself and deny it to others, Google unlawfully maintains its monopolies.\u201d","427":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will pay $245 million worth of its own shares to Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo self-driving vehicle unit to settle a legal dispute over trade secrets, allowing Uber\u2019s chief executive to move past one of the company\u2019s most bruising public controversies.  The settlement announcement on Friday brought an abrupt halt to the captivating case just before the fifth day of testimony was to begin at a jury trial in federal court in San Francisco.  In a lawsuit filed last year, Waymo said that one of its former engineers who became chief of Uber\u2019s self-driving car project took with him thousands of confidential documents.  The lawsuit cost Uber precious time in its self-driving car ambition, which is a key to its long-term profitability. Uber fired its self-driving chief after Waymo sued, and it is well behind on its plans to deploy fleets of autonomous cars in one of the most lucrative races in Silicon Valley.  The settlement allows Uber\u2019s chief executive officer, Dara Khosrowshahi, to put another scandal behind the company and move ahead with development of self-driving technology, following the tumultuous leadership by former CEO Travis Kalanick, who testified at the trial on Tuesday and Wednesday.  As part of the deal, Waymo gets a 0.34 percent stake in Uber, worth about $245 million based on Uber\u2019s current $72 billion valuation, a Waymo representative said. The settlement includes an agreement to ensure that Waymo confidential information is not being incorporated into Uber technology, which Waymo has said was its main goal in bringing the lawsuit.  In settlement talks last year, Waymo had sought at least $1 billion from Uber, and wanted an independent monitor to ensure that Uber would not use Waymo technology in the future, Reuters reported. Waymo also asked for an apology. Uber rejected those terms as non-starters.  Waymo had agreed earlier this week to a settlement proposal valued at $500 million, and Khosrowshahi brought the proposal to the Uber board of directors, offering his support.  But Uber\u2019s board rejected those terms on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the discussions said, sending Khosrowshahi and chief legal officer Tony West back to renegotiate.  In the interim, the famously pugnacious Kalanick testified in court, maintaining a calm demeanor as he answered questions about Uber\u2019s soured relationship with Alphabet and his admiration for Anthony Levandowski, the self-driving-car engineer whose actions led to the lawsuit.  After four days of testimony, Waymo had presented little public evidence that Uber used Waymo\u2019s trade secrets.  By late Thursday, Waymo agreed to the $245 million deal, one of the sources said.  In a statement on Friday, Khosrowshahi expressed \u201cregret\u201d for Uber\u2019s actions.  \u201cWhile we do not believe that any trade secrets made their way from Waymo to Uber, nor do we believe that Uber has used any of Waymo\u2019s proprietary information in its self-driving technology, we are taking steps with Waymo to ensure our Lidar and software represents just our good work,\u201d Khosrowshahi said in a statement.  Lidar is a light-based sensor crucial to autonomous driving.  Neither company offered details on what those steps will entail. Shares of Alphabet closed up 3.8 percent on Friday.  Elizabeth Rowe, a professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law, analyzed about 150 trade secret verdicts through 2014 and said $245 million would rank as the second highest. Given that landscape, along with the fact that Alphabet CEO Larry Page could have had to testify next week, the settlement makes sense for Waymo, she said.  FILE PHOTO: Waymo unveils a self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 8, 2017. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  \u201cTheir risks would have gone up on many levels,\u201d Rowe said.  Waymo\u2019s lawsuit said that Levandowski had downloaded more than 14,000 confidential files containing designs for autonomous vehicles in December 2015 before he went on to work at Uber in 2016.  The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a separate, criminal investigation into the trade secrets. Levandowski has never publicly addressed the allegations of taking the documents and law enforcement has not charged anyone with their theft. Levandowski was not a defendant in the case.  SERIES OF PROBLEMS AT UBER  The Waymo lawsuit was the most pressing legal battle for Uber, but only one item in a long list of controversies that has dogged the company for the last year.  Public accusations of sexual harassment and a toxic workplace prompted an internal investigation at Uber that resulted in more than 20 people being fired, and the company faces multiple federal criminal probes. The company has also suffered from turmoil at the top with the ousting of Kalanick in June and a bitter board dispute.  Uber had planned to have self-driving cars in 20 cities by the end of 2018, 50 cities by 2019 and 150 by 2020, according to documents shown in court. It is far from achieving those ambitions.  Uber now has small pilots in Tempe, Arizona, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Although it has acquired the necessary California permit, it still does not have self-driving cars transporting passengers there.  The settlement increases Alphabet\u2019s stake in Uber from an initial investment of $258 million in 2013, which at the time was Uber\u2019s largest fundraising round.  Uber has gone on to raise more than $14 billion in new funding and last month closed a deal with SoftBank Group Corp, in which the Japanese conglomerate, along with other investors, took about a 17.5 percent stake in the company. SoftBank bought the majority of its stake at about a 30 percent discount from Uber\u2019s valuation.  Autonomous cars offer a multi-billion-dollar opportunity to remake urban transportation systems, and companies including Apple Inc, General Motors Co and scores of startups are competing to develop the technology.  To prevail in the trial, Waymo would have had to prove not only that Uber acquired Waymo\u2019s trade secrets, but that it used them in its own technology.  Kalanick in a statement on Friday said the path to victory was clear: Uber\u2019s sole objective was to hire the most talented scientists and engineers and it had never possessed trade secrets.  \u201cHad the trial proceeded to its conclusion, it is clear Uber would have prevailed,\u201d Kalanick said.","428":"WASHINGTON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday asked Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google if it will reenter the Chinese search engine market and if it would comply with China\u2019s internet censorship policies upon its return.

The company\u2019s shares, which have risen almost 17 percent over the past six weeks, fell 2.3 percent to $1,114.60 in after-hours trading.  Partly because of the higher spending, Alphabet reported an operating margin of 21 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 24 percent a year ago.  \u201cGoogle saw a steep decline in operating margins,\u201d said Richard Kramer, analyst at Arete Research \u201cThey have plenty of cash to invest, and $7 billion in capex is a huge spend.\u201d  Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said capital expenditures this year would \u201cmoderate quite significantly,\u201d speaking to investors and analysts after results were announced.  The company has authorized a plan to buy back an additional $12.5 billion worth of its shares, Porat also said.  Facebook Inc\u2019s better-then-expected fourth-quarter results last week had lifted expectations for Alphabet as they suggested that concerns about a global economic slowdown may be overblown.  Alphabet\u2019s fourth quarter revenue rose 22 percent from a year ago to $39.28 billion, compared to the average expectation of $38.93 billion among analysts tracked by Refinitiv. About 83 percent of the revenue came from Google\u2019s ad system, chiefly mobile search and YouTube, the company said on a call with analysts.  The company had $31.07 billion in total fourth-quarter costs and expenses, up 26 percent from last year. Capital expenditures rose 64 percent compared to last year, up to $7.08 billion.  Porat said increased operating costs stemmed from licensing content for YouTube, expanded data center operations and Google\u2019s hardware business.  A run-up in spending has reflected Google\u2019s efforts to boost staffing on its cloud computing division, promote its consumer devices and YouTube subscription packages and acquire office buildings in Silicon Valley and New York.  Quarterly profit was $8.95 billion, or $12.77 per share, compared with a $3 billion loss a year ago. That compared to analyst estimates of $7.69 billion, or $10.87 per share.  The loss last year related to a one-time charge from new U.S. tax rules, while earnings since then have benefited from new rules about valuing Alphabet\u2019s dozens of investments in external startups. Fourth-quarter earnings also benefited from a $1.3 billion unrealized gain related to a non-marketable debt, Alphabet said.

SoftBank\u2019s year-old HAPSMobile and Alphabet\u2019s Loon, which spun out last July from the research incubator of the Google parent, separately have been trying to fly networking equipment at high altitudes to provide high-speed internet where ground-based towers are unreachable.

They are discussing the possibility of using each others\u2019 technology, standardizing their airborne and ground networking gear and joining forces in regulatory discussions, they said in a statement.

The tech company\u2019s third-quarter results fanned investor concern that big investments in new businesses, increasing regulatory scrutiny and emerging competition are producing slow and unpredictable returns.  Alphabet disclosed, for example, that passengers of its self-driving Waymo minivans are now paying for rides, but the offering remains limited to the Phoenix, Arizona region and Waymo\u2019s finances are not broken out.  Overall revenue rose 21 percent to $33.74 billion, missing analysts\u2019 estimate by about $310 million, according to Refinitiv data.  Google ad sales contributed 86 percent of revenue, but growth slowed to 20 percent from nearly 24 percent last quarter.  \u201cGoogle\u2019s earnings momentum remains strong,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. \u201cBut if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period\u2019s disappointment.\u201d  The company attributed much of the slower revenue growth to unfavorable currency exchange rates. Lower ad pricing to contend with antitrust concerns, new privacy rules in Europe and increased competition from Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O may have played a role too, financial analysts said.  Non-advertising revenue, such as from sales of mobile apps and cloud computing services, also came in slightly below expectations.  Those results combined with rising expenses brought down the company\u2019s operating margin to 25 percent from 28 percent a year ago.

Priming Alphabet\u2019s newer ventures has been costly in terms of marketing and hiring, with about 5,300 employees added in the third quarter.  Alphabet\u2019s cost of revenue was $14.3 billion in the third quarter, up 28 percent from a year ago. Capital expenditures soared to $5.3 billion from $3.5 billion last year, with 20 data center sites in development, Porat said.  Google has posted strong revenue growth for several years as retailers flock to buy product image ads on Google\u2019s search engine and commercials on YouTube.  But Google's cost structure has been disrupted by surges in usage of its services on smartphones, where the company splits ad revenue with technology makers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O, and smart speakers, where ads do not appear.  Google has been fined $7.7 billion for antitrust violations in Europe over the last two years, and heightened attention on privacy, security, competition and the rise of artificial intelligence tools has led investors to fret about potentially costly regulatory scrutiny in the United States and elsewhere.  The steady revenue growth had helped Alphabet weather an otherwise bruising last few months on the stock market for big technology and communications companies.  Alphabet gained 5.8 percent this year before Thursday and traded at 24 times expected earnings over the next year. Shares of No. 2 online ad firm Facebook Inc FB.O, which faces questions about flattening usage limiting revenue growth, had fallen 12.5 percent and were trading at 19 times future earnings.","440":"LONDON (Reuters) - US financial technology startup Albert has raised $100 million in a round led by General Atlantic, the company said on Tuesday.

The disengagement data is widely used as a yardstick to compare companies testing self-driving vehicles on California roads, and is often cited as evidence that Waymo leads the sector.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The announcement in a Wednesday blog post by the Alphabet Inc unit comes shortly before Apple is expected to start enforcing new tracking transparency rules.  Apple for years has supplied apps with a unique identifier, known as IDFA, to help them link the same user across multiple programs. The code can be essential in determining to whom to show an ad and tracking whether it prompted them to make a purchase.  But Apple has said that early this year it will require that apps show users a one-time pop-up message to gain their consent to access their IDFA.  Facebook Inc and other app makers are concerned the warning may discourage users from opting in and cripple ad sales.  As users of Google\u2019s apps are typically logged in, it has a tracking alternative to IDFA and as such its core ad business would likely not be affected by Apple\u2019s changes.  But it warned in its blog post that publishers and advertisers that rely on its mobile ad software will experience weaker results without IDFA access.  Google said it is developing alternatives for clients but these may not be ready immediately.  Google added that clients can use its software regardless of whether they show the pop-up and obtain the necessary consent, and it is not making any recommendations on what they should do.  Apple said apps not using IDFA still are required to seek user permission if they show and measure ads based on data acquired from other companies.  To comply, Google said its iPhone apps will stop using data from so-called third parties to personalize ads.  Facebook said last month that it plans to display the pop-up to seek users\u2019 consent.  \u201cApple has made it clear that if we don\u2019t use Apple\u2019s prompt that they will block Facebook from the App Store, which would only further harm the people and businesses that rely on our services every month,\u201d it said.","452":"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo early this week proposed a settlement deal with Uber Technologies Inc in which Uber would pay $500 million in equity to resolve a high-stakes trade-secrets case, but Uber directors rejected the offer in a board meeting on Tuesday, according to two sources close to the discussions.

The new fee goes into effect on Oct. 29 for any new smartphone or tablet models launched in the European Economic Area and running Google\u2019s Android operating system, the company announced on Tuesday.  The fee can be as low as $2.50 and rises depending on the country and device size, the person said. It is standard across manufacturers, with the majority likely to pay around $20, the person added.  Companies can offset the charge, which applies to a suite of apps including the Google Play app store, Gmail and Google Maps, by placing Google\u2019s search and Chrome internet browser in a prominent position. Under that arrangement, Google would give the device maker a portion of ad revenue it generates through search and Chrome.  Tech news outlet the Verge reported the pricing earlier on Friday, citing confidential documents.  The European Commission in July found Google abused its market dominance in mobile software to essentially force Android partners to pre-install search and Chrome on their gadgets. It levied a record $5-billion fine, which Google has appealed, and threatened additional penalties unless the company ended its illegal practices.

Google has tried for years to get Samsung, the world\u2019s leading mobile device maker by units sold, to drop its own services and give greater prominence to Google\u2019s search, Assistant and Play Store apps, according to a person previously involved in the relationship.  The search giant, whose Android software powers phones from Samsung and dozens of other companies, sometimes as an incentive gives manufacturers a portion of ad revenue generated from Google apps featured on their devices.  But Samsung has clung to efforts to promote its own apps, from which it can collect all the revenue, despite years of glitches and tepid user interest.  The strategy has been challenged in recent months, though, as the novel coronavirus pandemic and a slowdown in phone upgrades have hurt sales and prompted many companies to shutter costly projects and search for new revenue.  Exact financial details under negotiation between the companies could not be determined. But Google is dangling more lucrative terms for Samsung than in previous deals if it retreats from its app strategy, according to a source familiar with the talks. The companies are aiming to finalize terms by Friday, the source added.  Google said in a statement that it regularly discusses ways to improve the user experience with partners and that Samsung remains free to create its own app store and digital assistant.  Bloomberg first reported on Tuesday that the companies were negotiating a new deal.","462":"Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oscar Health, a health insurance start-up backed by Google parent Alphabet Inc, will raise as much as $1.05 billion in its initial public offering, according to a regulatory filings on Monday.

Now we will be able to cover the whole country in a very short span of time,\u201d said Information Minister Joe Mucheru after launching the service.  The technology has been used before, but not commercially. U.S. telecom operators used balloons to connect more than 250,000 people in Puerto Rico after a 2017 hurricane.  The project aims to provide affordable fourth generation (4G) internet to under-covered or uncovered rural communities.

Waymo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, which quit China\u2019s search engine market in 2010, has been actively seeking ways to re-enter the sector in the country where many of its products are blocked by regulators.  In August, Reuters reported that the company plans to launch a version of its search engine in China that will block some websites and search terms. Google\u2019s Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has told staff that development is in an early stage.  Google has also joined an investment in Chinese live-stream mobile game platform Chushou and launched an artificial intelligence game on Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s social media app WeChat.  Waymo\u2019s move also comes as China makes a major push into autonomous smart vehicles to keep pace with the United States in a global race to develop self-driving vehicles.

(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google aims to power its data centers and offices using solely carbon-free electricity by 2030, its chief executive told Reuters, building on its previous goal of matching its energy use with 100% renewable energy.  FILE PHOTO: The Google logo is spelled out in heliostats (mirrors that track the sun and reflect the sunlight onto a central receiving point) during a tour of the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in the Mojave Desert near the California-Nevada border February 13, 2014. REUTERS\/Steve Marcus\/File Photo  The \u201cstretch goal,\u201d as CEO Sundar Pichai described it, will force Google to move beyond the tech industry norm of offsetting carbon emissions from electricity use and require technological and political breakthroughs to achieve.  \u201cThe problem is so immense, many of us need to lead the way and show solutions,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cWe\u2019re one small player in this but we can set an example.\u201d  Wildfires burning a record area in the western United States this month have increased public awareness of climate change, Pichai said, and Google wants to bring further attention through its new goal as well as product features.  Wind, solar and other renewable sources accounted for 61% of Google\u2019s global hourly electricity usage last year. The proportion varied by facility, with carbon-free sources fulfilling 96% of hourly power needs at Google\u2019s wind-swept Oklahoma data center compared with 3% at its gas-reliant Singapore operation.  But Google, which consumes slightly more power annually worldwide than residents and businesses in Delaware, has grown optimistic that it can bridge the gap with batteries to store solar power overnight, emerging sources such as geothermal reservoirs and better management of power needs.  \u201cTo plan 24\/7 hourly being carbon-free in our data centers and campuses around the world, we see an enormous logistics challenge, which is why we\u2019ve been hard at work modeling the last year how to get there,\u201d Pichai said. \u201cAnd we feel confident we can get there by 2030.\u201d  He declined to share the likely cost of achieving the goal.  Big Google rivals including Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O have targeted removing more carbon from the atmosphere than they emit over the coming decades, but none of them have publicly set a goal to stop sourcing carbon-based energy.  But the companies share a common goal of catalyzing businesses and governments to curb climate pollution before 2030, when scientists say global warming could become catastrophic if unchecked.  Jennifer Layke, global director at research group World Resources Institute, which has received Google funding, said the company inspired others in the United States and Europe over the last decade but its efforts must now spur action in crucial polluting regions such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam.  \u201cIf we can\u2019t shift from carbon, we will suffer the firestorms and the droughts,\u201d she said.  Google has been carbon-neutral since 2007, meaning it has planted trees, bought carbon credits and funded large amounts of wind power in places where it is abundant to offset its tapping of coal and natural gas power in other regions. It also said Monday that its estimated 1 million metric tons of emissions between 2006 and its 1998 launch now have been offset.  The company\u2019s new goals include bringing 5 gigawatts of renewable energy near some suppliers, funding tree planting beyond its offset needs and sharing data or forging partnerships with 500 governments around the world to try to cut 1 gigaton of carbon emissions annually by 2030.  Google said it would continue to offset carbon emissions unrelated to electricity use, such as from employee travel.  Its carbon-free electricity goal satisfies one demand of 2,000 Google employees who last November petitioned the company to stop selling data storage and other cloud computing tools to oil companies and funding think tanks or politicians who deny the existence of climate change.  On Monday, several employees who signed the petition said Google risks undermining its new goals if it keeps supporting customers and politicians exacerbating global warming.  \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is a step in the right direction, but the urgency of the situation demands more,\u201d employees said in a statement.  Pichai said Google would continue to \u201csupport everyone\u201d with its cloud services and help oil and gas companies transition to tapping other sources.","471":"(Reuters) - Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google on Friday updated technical details of the coronavirus contact tracing system they plan to release next month, saying new features would strengthen privacy protections and give health authorities more detailed data.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The system announced on April 10 will use Bluetooth technology to let authorities build apps to alert people who have been in proximity with those who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.  The technology does not employ GPS location data and stores most sensitive data in a decentralized way on users\u2019 phones. The approach opened a rift with European governments planning systems that would store data on centralized servers.  Without the Apple-Google technology, apps built by those governments will face limitations such as needing a phone\u2019s screen to be unlocked to work properly.  Health and privacy researchers also cited privacy concerns that the companies addressed on Friday by making it harder to use system-generated data to track people.  The numbers that identify users will be randomly generated, and so-called \u201cmetadata\u201d such as Bluetooth signal strength and users\u2019 phone models will now be encrypted along with primary data about who they have been near.  \u201cExposure time,\u201d or how long two phones have been near each other, will be rounded to 5-minute intervals, to prevent using detailed time data to match up phones to people.  The companies also sought to address health researchers\u2019 concerns that the system would be ineffective. Since Bluetooth signals can penetrate some walls and can be detected even when brief and faint, researchers worried about false alerts from neighbors in apartment buildings or passers-by in public spaces.  Apple and Google will now provide data about Bluetooth power levels to better estimate how close two phones came to each other and for how long, letting authorities set their own thresholds for when to alert people.  The companies also said they would provide data on how many days had passed since the last contact with an infected person, to help authorities notify users about what steps to take.","472":"BOSTON\/LONDON (Reuters) - Vanguard Group Inc said it voted against the pay of Alphabet Inc executives, including new CEO Sundar Pichai, one of several examples of proxy voting the top mutual fund firm gave in a report to be released on Tuesday as it names a new stewardship chief.

But like other fund firms lately, Vanguard has begun to disclose more details about its reasoning behind specific proxy votes on topics like director elections, social issues or climate policies.  John Galloway, whom Vanguard will name as its new head of stewardship on Tuesday, said an argument to keep the talks behind closed doors would be to have more candid conversations with company executives. But he is more concerned about making Vanguard\u2019s views transparent to its clients, as many votes are decided for subtle reasons.  \u201cHow we evaluate nuance is really important and certainly outstrips other concerns,\u201d Galloway said in a telephone interview.  In another example, in Britain, Vanguard said it declined to back a shareholder resolution at Barclays aimed at pushing the bank to phase out financial activities in the energy and utilities sectors.

Pichai had sought to counter slowing revenue growth in the company\u2019s main advertising business by pointing to the Silicon Valley firm\u2019s younger units.  But Pichai\u2019s reveal that Google\u2019s YouTube video streaming unit is generating ad revenue at a pace of $15 billion annually put it below rough estimates as high as $25 billion.  Divulging 53% quarterly revenue growth for Google's cloud services compared with a year ago meant it grew slower than the business it is trying to catch up to, Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O Azure. It reported a 62% quarterly rise in sales last week, or 39% when considering some cloud services Microsoft sells through other units.  While financial analysts applauded the new transparency from Alphabet, some questioned executives for the second time in the last four quarters to explain why overall revenue has been missing or just barely meeting their expectations. Sales growth dipped below 20% in three quarters during 2019, compared to just once in the previous three years.  Alphabet has blamed currency exchange rates and its constant tweaking of features, saying that it is not focused on quarterly marks.  \u201cWe continue to be very focused on the benefit from better measurement, better ad delivery, better user experience,\u201d Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat responded to an analyst. \u201cBut there will be variability over time because we\u2019re very focused on what\u2019s in the right long-term interest.\u201d  Shares of the company fell about 4.5% in extended trading to $1,416.  \u201cThe stock was priced for perfection, and a top-line miss was enough to send it lower,\u201d said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cYouTube was impressive at $15 billion for the year, Cloud less so at $8.9 billion.\u201d  Other financial analysts said YouTube\u2019s ad revenue was underwhelming too.  \u201cYouTube is smaller than generally assumed, but on the flipside, search seems to have accelerated and is growing faster than feared,\u201d said James Cordwell, analyst at Atlantic Equities.

REUTERS\/Eduardo Munoz\/File Photo  Google through its namesake search engine as well as properties such as YouTube has been the web\u2019s biggest draw for advertisers for a decade, enabling it last month to become the fourth listed company to top $1 trillion in market capitalization.  But new concerns have emerged among investors about whether its dominance will last as U.S. antitrust regulators investigate Google and as Amazon and Facebook Inc FB.O continue to grow their ads businesses globally. Both beat analysts' expectations last week.  Alphabet\u2019s overall sales in the fourth quarter were $46.08 billion, up 17%, compared with an average estimate of $46.94 billion among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv.  Google ad sales in the holiday shopping quarter were $37.93 billion, up 16.7% from the same period last year  Alphabet\u2019s expenses have ballooned with hiring of thousands of salespeople, building of new data centers and marketing the Google brand through hardware and other ventures.  For the fourth quarter, Alphabet\u2019s total costs and expenses rose 18.5% from a year ago to $36.809 billion.  Porat said hiring and infrastructure spending would accelerate in 2020.  Alphabet\u2019s fourth-quarter profit was $10.67 billion, or $15.35 per share, compared with the analysts\u2019 average estimate of $8.787 billion, or $12.53 per share.  Hardware sales fell in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago, Porat said. Results could suffer further from any protracted work stoppages in Asia as companies combat the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China, she said.  Google last week temporarily shut down all its offices in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan due to the coronavirus. It has thousands of engineers across the region, including a hardware engineering center in Taiwan.

The new YouTube disclosures under Pichai showed ad revenue grew 31% compared with last year.  Pichai also said YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users, generated about $750 million in subscription and other non-advertising revenue, but did not reveal a figure for the year-earlier period.  Pichai said YouTube had 20 million paid subscribers between YouTube's Music and Premium ad-free viewing packages, and separately had 2 million paid subscribers for YouTube TV, which competes with Dish Network Corp's DISH.O Sling TV and Walt Disney Co's DIS.N Hulu to stream television online.  Amazon recently said it has 55 million music subscribers, while Apple Inc AAPL.O last year announced 60 million such subscribers. Sling had about 2.7 million subscribers as of last year, in line with estimates for Hulu.

The deal reflects venture capitalists\u2019 continued interest in businesses that bring to the web tasks that once required physical proximity or multiple phone calls, including hailing rides, renting wedding outfits and booking vacation cabins.  Peerspace said it has accommodated tens of thousands of events such as corporate meetings, film shoots and bridal showers. About 6,000 locations across nine large U.S. cities have listed on Peerspace, including churches, bookstores and mansions.  People often seek hotel ballrooms or well-known sites for events. But Peerspace has a $30-billion opportunity in the United States to promote overlooked and distinctive locations, said Joe Kraus, a general partner at GV who is joining the startup\u2019s board of directors.  Peerspace also has begun helping event organizers schedule catering and rent video equipment as part of a growing offering of add-ons.  \u201cThe long-term opportunity is not only to solve the event space but the whole event,\u201d said Kraus, whose firm is tasked with generating a financial return for Alphabet.  GV has in-house teams that plan to help Peerspace with design, employee recruiting and striking partnerships, he said.  Kraus said his role will include advising on balancing expansion and listings quality, so users do not encounter \u201csignificantly not-as-described\u201d locations.  Peerspace sends a staffer to review each location before it is listed, but the aim is to increasingly shift to user feedback and algorithms for vetting, said Chief Executive Eric Shoup.  Turo, a car rental app in which GV invested, does not inspect each new vehicle submitted by users, but new listings can get better promotion on its service if they meet criteria such as uploading several high-quality photos, Kraus said.  Peerspace is developing advanced algorithms to improve listings, Shoup said. For instance, it has tested computer vision software, a form of artificial intelligence, to automatically detect pools and fireplaces in photos so that the company can \u201cdefinitively\u201d describe a site\u2019s amenities, he said.  Foundation Capital and Red Bridge Partners also participated in the latest financing, which nearly doubles Peerspace\u2019s total capital raised to $34 million.","481":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department asked a federal judge in San Francisco on Friday to allow the government to bar Apple Inc AAPL.O and Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O from offering WeChat for download in U.S. app stores pending an appeal.  FILE PHOTO: The messenger app WeChat is seen among U.S. flags in this illustration picture taken Aug. 7, 2020. REUTERS\/Florence Lo\/Illustration  The filing asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler to put on hold her preliminary injunction issued Saturday. That injunction blocked the U.S. Commerce Department order which was set to take effect late on Sept. 20 and that would also bar other U.S. transactions with Tencent Holding's 0700.HK WeChat, potentially making the app unusable in the United States.  Beeler responded late on Friday by setting a hearing for Oct. 15 on the motion but said she could potentially hold it on \u201ca tighter time period.\u201d  The Justice Department filing said Beeler\u2019s order was in error and \u201cpermits the continued, unfettered use of WeChat, a mobile application that the Executive Branch has determined constitutes a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u201d  Tencent had put forward a \u201cmitigation proposal\u201d that sought to create a new U.S. version of the app, deploy specific security measures to protect the new apps source code, partner with a U.S. cloud provider for user data storage, and manage the new app through a U.S.-based entity, the filing said.  However, its proposal still allowed Tencent to retain ownership of WeChat and did not address U.S. concerns over the company, it added.  Tencent declined to comment.  Lawyers for U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, the group behind the legal challenge to the WeChat ban, questioned the urgency of the government\u2019s request, noting the time it took for the government to seek a stay.  \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to sit tight for five days shows that there is no emergency,\u201d they wrote.  In support of its argument, the Justice Department made public portions of a Sept. 17 Commerce Department memo outlining the WeChat transactions to be banned. \u201cThe WeChat mobile application collects and transmits sensitive personal information on U.S. persons, which is accessible to Tencent and stored in data centers in China and Canada,\u201d the memo said.  Beeler said WeChat users who filed a lawsuit \u201chave shown serious questions going to the merits of the First Amendment claim.\u201d  The Justice Department filing said \u201cthe First Amendment does not bar regulation of WeChat simply because it has achieved the popularity and dependency sought by (China), precisely so it can surveil users, promote its propaganda, and otherwise place U.S. national security at risk.\u201d  WeChat has had an average of 19 million daily active users in the United States, analytics firms Apptopia said in early August. It is popular among Chinese students, Americans living in China and some Americans who have personal or business relationships in China.  Beeler wrote \u201ccertainly the government\u2019s over-arching national-security interest is significant. But on this record \u2014 while the government has established that China\u2019s activities raise significant national security concerns \u2014 it has put in scant little evidence that its effective ban of WeChat for all U.S. users addresses those concerns.\u201d  WeChat is an all-in-one mobile app that combines services similar to Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Venmo. The app is an essential part of daily life for many in China and boasts more than 1 billion users.  TikTok on Wednesday sought a similar preliminary injunction from a U.S. judge in Washington. A judge on Friday said he would hold a hearing Sunday morning about whether to halt the U.S. app store ban on new TikTok downloads set to take effect Sunday night.","482":"WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is expected to file an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Tuesday for allegedly breaking the law in using its market power to fend off rivals, according to a source familiar with the planning.

(Reuters) - For Alphabet Inc\u2019s Verily, a healthcare venture that is one the tech giant\u2019s most prominent \u201cother bets,\u201d the coronavirus pandemic offered an immediate business opportunity.  Vehicles line up at a self-swabbing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test at a Rite Aid drive-thru during the outbreak of COVID-19, in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 22, 2021. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  Starting last February, the company shifted many of its about 1,000 employees to developing software for governments and employers to manage coronavirus testing.  It quickly landed major customers including the state of California, which records show paid Verily $49.6 million to use its Baseline software to schedule virus tests.  Smaller deals included a previously unreported $3.1 million grant from the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to operate California testing sites.  Verily executives said the pandemic work was a chance to demonstrate the company\u2019s capabilities, and attract new customers.  \u201cThe conversations are naturally flowing in that way,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical and scientific officer.  Critics say the effort has been another distraction for Verily, which has bounced between dozens of projects without producing a stable revenue stream. The venture has drawn more than $1.8 billion in funding from Alphabet and outside investors including private equity firm Silver Lake.  Converting temporary buyers into long-term clients may be wishful thinking, four industry analysts said.  Two former executives and a current employee criticized the company for taking on another one-off opportunity instead of focusing on attracting recurring subscribers to its software for clinical research, disease management and other tasks.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cI don\u2019t think COVID will give them significant tailwinds,\u201d said one of the people, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  Chief Executive Andy Conrad has told employees Verily is driving toward an initial public offering, and more consistent sales would be essential for a successful Wall Street debut.  Verily\u2019s overall sales are not disclosed by Alphabet. Evercore ISI analyst Kevin Rippey estimated 2020 \u201cother bets\u201d overall revenue at about $650 million, with Verily contributing under $175 million. The former executives described Verily\u2019s actual revenue as higher, and another analyst suggested $200 million to $300 million as more realistic.  \u2018WE HAD TO HELP\u2019  Spun out of Google in 2015, Verily develops devices and software aimed at improving data collection, treatment, research and patient care.  It has enjoyed bursts of revenue from collaborations with healthcare companies, including work with DexCom Inc on a miniaturized blood glucose monitor and a scuttled, high-profile experiment with Alcon AG to create a smart contact lens for similar measurements.  But Verily\u2019s financial future hinges on software products led by Baseline, which helps drugmakers enroll participants for clinical trials and analyze study data. It aims to reduce paperwork and site visits compared with traditional methods.  Mega said the company refashioned Baseline to schedule coronavirus tests after governments such as California started asking for help. The software also powers scheduling for 460 Rite Aid Corp pharmacies, which provide testing as part of a partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services.  Baseline enabled about 2 million people to get tests nationwide last year, she said, a fraction of the 250 million administered overall.  Dr. Vivian Lee, Verily\u2019s president of health platforms, said government COVID-19 projects helped jumpstart separate testing software dubbed Healthy at Work and Healthy at School.  The new tools have 20 customers between them, including Brown University and some biotech companies, Verily said. The University of Alabama, Birmingham has spent $6.9 million on Healthy at School, according to previously unreported records.  Ralph Zottola, an assistant vice president at the university, said it is considering Verily for software to validate whether students have been vaccinated because the company has been \u201ca good partner.\u201d  When the need for coronavirus testing software ends, Verily aims to transition some new customers to Onduo, one of its core offerings alongside Baseline. The program includes sensors, diet coaching and other personalized tools that insurers and employers can provide for managing chronic diseases and general wellness.  Onduo counts Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and insurers such as CareFirst as customers.  Still, both Onduo and Baseline remain very small players in medical software markets researchers say are worth over $100 billion in the United States annually, and some larger rivals like Teladoc Health Inc\u2019s Livongo and Omada Health Inc did not divert resources to the pandemic last year.  Livongo, which directly competes with Onduo, reported sales more than doubled to $267 million during the first three quarters of 2020 compared with same period a year earlier.  Mega defended Verily\u2019s moves during the greatest public health crisis in a century.  \u201cAcross the company, we\u2019ve raised our hands,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was an opportunity, we had to help, but it\u2019s accelerating our core business.\u201d","485":"Aug 7 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Wednesday released the second generation of its processor chip for data centers and said that it had landed Alphabet Inc\u2019 Google and Twitter Inc as customers.  AMD competes against Intel Corp to supply chips for data centers that power internet-based services. Both firms have come to rely on data center chips for growth because PC sales have stagnated as users shifted to mobile devices.  AMD\u2019s newest generation of server chip, called EPYC, uses a new chip-making technology from its contract manufacturers that helps the chips have better performance while consuming less power.  Intel, which makes chips in its own factories instead of relying on contractors, is behind schedule delivering chips made with its own newer manufacturing process. It plans to release them next year.  AMD has tried to take advantage of that by courting some of Intel\u2019s biggest customers, such as Google.  AMD said on Thursday that Google is using its second-generation EPYC server chip in Google\u2019s internal data centers and that Google will offer it to external developers as part of its cloud computing offerings later this year.

He faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison at his sentencing, currently scheduled for July 24.  Rimasauskas also agreed to forfeit about $49.7 million he personally obtained from the scheme, according to a court filing.  Paul Petrus, a lawyer for Rimasauskas, said the plea spoke for itself and declined to comment further.  Rimasauskas, originally from the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, was extradited to the United States from Lithuania in August 2017.  U.S. prosecutors accused Rimasauskas and unnamed co-conspirators of bilking Google and Facebook out of more than $100 million by posing as an Asian hardware vendor and claiming that the companies owed the vendor money.  The prosecutors did not name the companies, but Taiwan-based Quanta Computer Inc confirmed after Rimasauskas\u2019 arrest that it was the Asian vendor, and a Lithuanian court order in 2017 identified Google and Facebook as the victims.  The scheme defrauded Google out of $23 million and Facebook out of $99 million, according to that order. Prosecutors said Rimasauskas contributed to the scheme by setting up a fake company and a bank account in Latvia.  The scheme is an example of a growing type of fraud called \u201cbusiness email compromise,\u201d in which fraudsters ask for money using emails targeted at companies that work with foreign suppliers or regularly make wire transfers.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in February 2017 that losses from such scams since the agency began tracking them in 2013 totaled more than $3 billion.","487":"Aug 3 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google on Monday unveiled its first 5G-enabled phones, Pixel 4a and Pixel 5, with a price tag starting at $499.

The volatile give-and-take during the week and quarter would seem to set the table for tense months ahead as buy-the-dip bulls look for corporate earnings to validate the market\u2019s current levels and short-selling bears work to expose investors\u2019 complacency.  Yet David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s funds division, said he is optimistic that markets have clarified the effects of a large U.S. tax cut and the prospect for higher interest rates, factors he says challenged markets during the first quarter.  \u201cIt\u2019s not that the uncertainties have gone away on higher rates or lower taxes, but I think we\u2019ve grown accustomed to them, and that should lay a foundation for investors to put more money to work,\u201d he said.

Many markets across Europe and the Americas will be closed on the final weekday of the quarter in observance of Good Friday.  A monthly markets poll by Reuters showed trade war and tech sector worries have spooked global investors into cutting equity exposure to a four-month low and holdings of U.S. stocks to the lowest in nearly two years.

The service, known as Reserve with Google, spares users the phone calls, online searching and form filling typically associated with appointments. Say you want a massage at 5 p.m. someplace within a half-mile of work. Google.com\/maps\/reserve displays openings at nearby businesses and allows users to book, and even pay, without having to call or visit another website.  Google declined to comment on performance of the tool, which it launched last March.  But in interviews with Reuters, seven software firms that supply schedule data to Google described the volume as significant, with as much as 75 percent of bookings representing new customers. Consumers like the convenience. Business owners say the tool is putting their names in front of more potential clients.  The early results are a good sign for Google\u2019s strategy for search at a time when it is battling technology rivals to guide consumers to shops, products, recipes, music and more. Google wants to do more than supply users with a list of web pages that they must research themselves. The next step is to complete tasks for them and provide direct solutions.  Google Assistant - the company\u2019s version of Apple Inc\u2019s Siri or Amazon.com Inc\u2019s Alexa - is a central piece of the effort. Users will be able to make Reserve bookings via voice commands to Google Assistant by later this year, people familiar with the matter said. That is something not yet built into Siri or Alexa.  Google says its Assistant will even place robo-calls to businesses to make bookings if a suitable option is not available through Reserve, a feature it showed off in May at Google I\/O, the company\u2019s conference for software developers.  \u201cThere\u2019s a competitive race to be the established consumer brand for appointment booking,\u201d said Marc Woodward, vice president at scheduling software maker Genbook. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to need this omniscient understanding of availability\u201d at businesses.  Google does not charge users or businesses for Reserve. And it has not told schedule partners how it would make money on the service.  But shops may place more advertising with Google if Reserve drives customers through their doors. Or Google could eventually charge businesses transaction fees.  CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts in April that completing actions on users\u2019 behalf \u201cobviously...has a commercial impact.\u201d  INITIAL RESULTS  Dozens of firms peddle booking software that spas, restaurants and other businesses use to accept reservations on their websites.  To launch Reserve, Google cut deals with 25 large software suppliers, promising to consolidate and polish the process to increase bookings to the firms\u2019 clients.  The arrangement gives Google continuous feeds of schedules from tens of thousands of shops spanning 13 countries. These are mostly health, beauty and restaurant businesses not already covered by booking giants such as Expedia Group Inc , OpenTable Inc and Zocdoc Inc.  Google does not pay for the data. The payoff, schedule suppliers say, is that the booking tool makes clients more attractive in Google results.  Schedulers declined to provide Reuters with detailed performance and financial information about their results with Reserve, citing nondisclosure agreements with Google. Still, they said Reserve\u2019s monthly growth has won them over.  Buenos Aires-based Restorando, which works with restaurants in Latin America, said Google attracted about 15,000 diners who spent about $270,000 in the first few weeks, according to spokesman Frank Martin.  TimeTrade, a Tewksbury, Mass.-firm whose clients include beauty chain Sephora, said 75 percent of clients\u2019 Reserve reservations have come from new customers. Another supplier, San Francisco-based MyTime, estimated its figure at 50 percent. About 40 percent of all Google reservations to MyTime clients come after hours, evidence of its advantage over phone bookings, CEO Ethan Anderson said.  Vancouver-based fitness entrepreneur Chara Marie, who uses Yocale schedule software and coaches clients on exercise and nutrition, said about one in four new clients a week have come through Reserve in recent months.  She is an avid user too, booking about 45 nail, hair and massage appointments in the last year through Reserve. Marie, 29, said she is hooked on the convenience and does not miss playing phone tag.  \u201cIt allows you to spend more time doing what you want to be doing,\u201d Marie said.  To be sure, some business owners have questioned Google diluting customer relationships and capturing data.  \u201cAm I losing control of my business a little bit?\u201d said George Mardigian of Reserve bookings to his Oakland, Calif. gym Flex Fitness. \u201cWe\u2019re a neighborhood gym, and we want to keep things sort of close to the vest.\u201d  The Reserve tool has worked well enough that Google says new partners are coming soon, including schedulers who work with horseback riding tours, magic shows and baby sitters.  ASSESSING COMPETITION  Google is not the only big technology company looking to commercialize online bookings outside of restaurants and travel.  Amazon Home Services has schedules for TV installers, landscapers and other home-related service providers. Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram recently announced deals with 11 of the same schedulers as Google.  Yelp Inc said its list of \u201cbookable\u201d businesses, last reported at 100,000 in 2016, is growing, though some schedulers have declined to accept its revenue-sharing terms.  Google can stand apart if it can master the integration with Google Assistant, Genbook\u2019s Woodward said. He pointed to search data showing increasingly complex queries such as \u201cwhere to get a Swedish massage nearby at a discount today.\u201d  If Google can deliver the answer, along with a seamless, voice-activated booking, it will be hard to beat, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about what you can achieve on the platform,\u201d Woodward said.

Of the $10 billion on offer, the $1 billion five-year tranche was issued at a coupon of 0.45%, the lowest coupon seen on a U.S. corporate bond at that maturity, according to Refinitiv data, which goes back to 1980.  Investor appetite was fierce for the tech giant\u2019s six-part bond, as low interest rates and corporate bond buying from the Federal Reserve continues to support issuance. The deal garnered more than $31 billion in demand, according to Refinitiv IFR. Previously, Alphabet\u2019s lowest coupon was 1.25% on a $1 billion May 2014 note.  \u201cWe\u2019re at a stage where these extremely high-quality issuers - of which Alphabet is one - are going to price very very tight.

You\u2019re getting two times the yield on the five-year Treasury,\u201d said Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory.  Last week Alphabet reported its first quarterly sales drop in its 16 years as a public company. Its share price was largely unmoved however, as the loss in sales was offset by a recovery in Google\u2019s ads business.  \u201cThere is a very narrow set of companies that were already super high quality, that are not impacted by this recession we\u2019re going through right now. And Google is one of them,\u201d said Graff.  Alphabet's five-year tranche priced just higher than Amazon.com's AMZN.O 0.40% three-year note issued in June, among the lowest corporate coupons ever recorded. Alphabet's 0.45% five-year tranche was however cheaper than Amazon's June 2020 offering at the same maturity, which priced at 0.80%.  Of the $10 billion offered, $4.5 billion from the seven-, 20- and 40-year tranches will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The remaining $5.5 billion will be used for green initiatives, the company said, the largest-ever issue of corporate debt for environment, social and governance endeavors.

The new restrictions could help Google management defuse months of protest by thousands of employees against the company\u2019s work with the U.S. military to identify objects in drone video.  Google will pursue other government contracts including around cybersecurity, military recruitment and search and rescue, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said in a blog post Thursday.  \u201cWe want to be clear that while we are not developing AI for use in weapons, we will continue our work with governments and the military in many other areas,\u201d he said.  Breakthroughs in the cost and performance of advanced computers have begun to carry AI from research labs into industries such as defense and health. Google and its big technology rivals have become leading sellers of AI tools, which enable computers to review large datasets to make predictions and identify patterns and anomalies faster than humans could.  But the potential of AI systems to pinpoint drone strikes better than military specialists or identify dissidents through mass collection of online communications has sparked concerns among academic ethicists and Google employees.  \u201cTaking a clear and consistent stand against the weaponization of its technologies\u201d would help Google demonstrate \u201cits commitment to safeguarding the trust of its international base of customers and users,\u201d Lucy Suchman, a sociology professor at Lancaster University in England, told Reuters ahead of Thursday\u2019s announcement.  Google said it would not pursue AI applications intended to cause physical injury, that tie into surveillance \u201cviolating internationally accepted norms of human rights,\u201d or that present greater \u201cmaterial risk of harm\u201d than countervailing benefits.  Its principles also call for employees as well as customers \u201cto avoid unjust impacts on people,\u201d particularly around race, gender, sexual orientation and political or religious belief.  Pichai said Google reserved the right to block applications that violated its principles.  A Google official described the principles and recommendations as a template that anyone in the AI community could put into immediate use in their own software. Though Microsoft Corp and other firms released AI guidelines earlier, the industry has followed Google\u2019s efforts closely because of the internal pushback against the drone imagery deal.

Google said the law proposed last month would help big media firms artificially inflate their search ranking, luring more viewers to their platforms and giving them an unfair advantage over small contributors running their own websites or YouTube channels.  Google\u2019s YouTube video service allows individuals and companies to create channels featuring advertisements that create revenue for both them and YouTube.  The U.S. tech giant said the law may also obligate it to give big news firms confidential data about systems that they could use to try to appear higher in rankings on YouTube, resulting in fewer views for content of smaller businesses.  \u201cThis law wouldn\u2019t just impact the way Google and YouTube work with news media businesses - it would impact all of our Australian users,\u201d Google Australia Managing Director Mel Silva said in a post titled \u201cOpen letter to Australians\u201d.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99% of smart phones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The companies plan to allow only public health authorities to use the technology.  Both companies said privacy and preventing governments from using the system to compile data on citizens was a primary goal. The system uses Bluetooth signals from phones to detect encounters and does not use or store GPS location data.  But the developers of official coronavirus-related apps in several U.S. states told Reuters last month it was vital they be allowed to use GPS location data in conjunction with the new contact tracing system to track how outbreaks move and identify hotspots.  The Apple-Google decision to not allow GPS data collection with their contact tracing system will require public health authorities that want to access GPS location to rely on what Apple and Google have described as unstable, battery-draining workarounds.  Alternatives likely would miss some encounters because iPhones and Android devices turn off Bluetooth connections after some time for battery-saving and other reasons unless users remember to re-activate them.  But some apps said they planned to stick to their own approaches.  Software company Twenty, which developed the state of Utah\u2019s Healthy Together contact tracing app with both GPS and Bluetooth, said on Monday the app \u201coperates effectively\u201d without the new Apple-Google tool.  \u201cIf their approach can be more effective than our current solution, we\u2019ll eagerly incorporate their features into our existing application, provided it meets the specifications of current and prospective public health partners,\u201d Twenty said.  Canada\u2019s Alberta province, which does not collect GPS data, said it has no plans to adopt the Apple-Google system for its ABTraceTogether app.  Privacy experts have warned that any cache of location data related to health issues could make businesses and individuals vulnerable to being ostracized if the data is exposed.  Apple and Google also said Monday they will allow only one app per country to use the contact system, to avoid fragmentation and encourage wider adoption. The companies said they would, however, support countries that opt for a state or regional approach, and that U.S. states will be allowed to use the system.","503":"BOGOTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Colombian regulators on Friday ordered Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google to clearly ask each user whether the world\u2019s largest search engine can use their personal data which is being captured without authorization.

In a blog post, Google committed to introducing some recycled plastic to 100% of products by 2022.

Since late last week, demonstrations by truck drivers have been seen in over a dozen locations around China, according to Hong Kong-based China Labour Bulletin, which tracks labour action in mainland China. On social media, photos and videos circulated showing long lines of parked trucks adorned with banners.  The demonstrations come as oil prices hit their highest level since 2014 in recent weeks, scraping $80 per barrel and stoking cost increases for businesses and consumers, especially in large oil-importing nations such as China.  The truck drivers also cited a squeeze on haulage rates due to the dominance of Manbang, formally known as Full Truck Alliance Group. Manbang raised $1.9 billion in April from Japan\u2019s Softbank and Alphabet\u2019s venture capital fund CapitalG.  The firm is often described as China\u2019s \u201cUber for trucks\u201d, in reference to U.S. ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc . It runs an app that allows companies to connect with truck drivers - often independent contractors - tapping into demand for haulage in one of the world\u2019s busiest markets for goods transport.  China Labour Bulletin said that earlier in June, Manbang implemented a policy to prevent registered truck drivers and customers from contacting each other directly, to ensure transactions and haulage rates were set only via the app.  Manbang, formed in a merger of haulage platforms Yun Man Man and Huo Che Bang, did not respond to requests for comment. The firm in April said 5.2 million of China\u2019s 7 million freight trucks were members of the Full Truck Alliance Group.  Demonstrations were recorded in provinces including Shandong, Sichuan, Chongqing, Anhui, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Hubei, Henan and Zhejiang, the labour monitor said.  Banners featured slogans such as \u201cboycott low prices\u201d and \u201ctruckers all rise\u201d. There were also messages threatening violence toward truck drivers who did not strike.  So far, there have been no reports of any significant impact from the demonstrations.  China\u2019s truckers are not alone.

The analysis of location data from billions of Google users\u2019 phones is the largest public dataset available to help health authorities assess if people are abiding with shelter-in-place and similar orders issued across the world to rein in the virus.  The company released reports for 131 countries with charts that compare traffic from Feb. 16 to March 29 to retail and recreational venues, train and bus stations, grocery stores and workplaces with a five-week period earlier this year.  Google said it published the reports to avoid any confusion about what it was providing to authorities, given the global debate that has emerged about balancing privacy-invasive location tracking with the need to prevent further outbreaks.  The data often correlated with the severity of outbreaks and the harshness and breadth of orders imposed by governments.  Italy and Spain, two of the hardest-hit countries, both saw visits to retail and recreation locations such as restaurants and movie theaters plunge 94%. The United Kingdom, France and Philippines had declines of more than 80% while India, which went into a sudden 21-day lockdown on March 25, was also notable at 77%.  In the United States, where state responses have varied greatly, and in Australia, where good weather initially prompted many people to go the beach before social distancing measures were ratcheted up, the drops were less steep at under 50%.  In contrast, in Japan and Sweden, where authorities have not imposed harsh restrictions, visits to retail and recreation sites fell by roughly only a quarter. While in South Korea, which has successfully contained a large outbreak through aggressive testing and contact tracing, the decline was just 19%.  The data also underscore some challenges authorities have faced in keeping people apart. Grocery store visits surged in Singapore, the United Kingdom and elsewhere as travel restrictions were set to go into place. Visits to parks spiked in March in some San Francisco Bay Area counties under lockdown in California, forcing them to later put the sites off limits.  The data also underscores how the mood of people around the world has shifted. In New Orleans, during its annual Mardi Gras celebrations Feb.16-25, which has with hindsight been criticized for helping spread the virus, there were off-the-chart increases in traffic to transit stations, parks and businesses.  But three weeks later in Dublin, heart of St. Patrick\u2019s holiday celebrations, traffic was down at retail and recreational venues as the country ordered big events canceled.  Within countries, there were wide gaps in behavior by region. California, which was the first in the U.S. with a statewide lockdown, cut visits to retail and recreation locations by half. In New York state, the slide in such visits was gradual as officials waited to impose strict curbs but they eventually fell 62%. By contrast, Arkansas, one of the few states without a sweeping lockdown, had the smallest decline at 29%.  The coronavirus has infected more than 1 million people globally, and COVID-19, the respiratory illness it causes, has killed 52,000, according to a Reuters tally.

BALANCING PRIVACY  Data in Google\u2019s reports come from users who enabled Google\u2019s \u201cLocation History\u201d feature on their devices. The company said it adopted technical measures to ensure that no individual could be identified through the new reports.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThese reports have been developed to be helpful while adhering to our stringent privacy protocols and policies,\u201d Dr. Karen DeSalvo, chief health officer for Google Health and Jen Fitzpatrick, senior vice president for Google Geo, wrote in a blog post.  China, Singapore, South Korea and other countries have asked residents to use apps and other technology to track their compliance with quarantines, but privacy activists argue such measures can compromise individual liberties.  Infectious disease specialists have said analyzing travel across groups by age, income and other demographics could help shape public service announcements.  Google, which infers demographics from users\u2019 internet use as well as some data given when signing up to Google services, said it was not reporting demographic information. The company said, though, it was open to including additional information and countries in follow-up reports.  Google said consultations with officials in the U.S. and the World Health Organization helped inform the data shared.

Google\u2019s website that logs outages said the services that were affected for nearly an hour should be restored for most users.  The company has some of the most widely used services in the world. YouTube records over 2 billion logged-in users each month, with people watching over a billion hours of video on its platform.  \u201cWe\u2019re back up and running!,\u201d the video platform said in a tweet.

Google will also start placing ads with a gallery of up to eight images in search results, potentially increasing ad supply further.  The changes come as choppy revenue growth prompt questions from some Alphabet investors about whether services such as Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc\u2019s Instagram are drawing online shoppers and in turn, advertisers away from Google.  Google executives told reporters on Monday the latest features were a response to how users behave, not competition.  The company wants to make it easier for users to discover and buy new products because they shop in brief spurts while watching TV or sitting in the bathroom, said Oliver Heckmann, vice president of engineering for Travel and Shopping.  \u201cIt actually changed with mobiles and what users expect from an online service like Google,\u201d he said.  The ads on the Google homepage appear on what the company calls its Discover feature, a Facebook-style news feed that users swipe through to view an algorithmically personalized set of links to articles, videos and other online content.  The company said on Monday that ads would run whereever Discover is available, including on its mobile website, but clarified on Tuesday that ads would only be in the Google app.  Google has been testing ads on Discover since last fall, when it said more than 800 million people were using the feature monthly.  The gallery ads are part of a Google effort to make search results more visual, the company said. Ads with images are expected to garner more clicks, which could lead them being shown in more results, executives said.  Google - which announced the changes at its Marketing Live conferece for advertisers - also said it would begin showing personalized content on its Google Shopping home page. That offers only a search box in most countries at present.  The company will continue to use the Shopping service to take orders for in-store pick up or delivery from a variety of shops. But it will phase out its Google Express delivery brand in favor of Google Shopping.  Google first launched a more robust shopping page in India last year.

Wall Street was set for a short climb when it reopens, with Google-parent Alphabet, part of the so-called FAANG stocks, expected to jump almost 5 percent after a better-than-expected quarterly revenue jump.  Metals prices were also sharply higher thanks to the stimulus signals in Beijing, while global bonds were still sluggish following speculation that the Bank of Japan may soon trim its massive stimulus.  The euro had nosed higher on solid German manufacturing data and though the dollar was having a largely quiet day there were plenty of jarring moves in emerging markets to raise the pulse rate.  Turkey\u2019s lira slid more than 3 percent along with its main stock market after its central bank opted to keep interest rates on hold despite double-digit inflation that would best be tackled via a big rate hike.  China\u2019s offshore yuan meanwhile had hit a one-year low and Beijing\u2019s government bond yields had jumped after the cabinet said it would pursue a more vigorous fiscal policy and as traders bet on further easing in monetary conditions.  \u201cThe big story is that the Chinese currency continues to slide,\u201d said Societe Generale FX strategist Alvin Tan.  \u201cIt is clear the government is moving towards policies that are supporting growth,\u201d he adding, saying the trend was likely to bring a reaction from the United States in time.  For now though the focus in the U.S. remains the banner corporate earnings season. To date, 82 percent of the 90 S&P 500 companies that have posted results had topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Analysts estimate of profit growth have risen to about 22 percent for the second quarter, up from 20.7 percent at the start of the month.  E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.2 percent, as European bourses continued to shuffle higher.  Tech stocks were set to get a boost from Alphabet, the parent of Google, which was up 4.6 percent in premarket trading a record high, valuing the group at around $900 billion.  Other FAANG stocks also rose. Facebook climbed 1.9 percent, while Amazon gained 1.4 percent. Twitter gained 0.9 percent.  European stocks were also up, partly thanks to some upbeat results from UBS, autos firm PSA and chipmaker AMS, higher metals prices and renewed signs of strength in Germany\u2019s powerful manufacturing sector.  But they were also just riding in the slipstream of Asia\u2019s and Wall Street\u2019s overnight gains.  Shanghai blue chips had closed up 1.5 percent at a one-month high and Japan\u2019s Nikkei had added 0.5 percent, even though a disappointing reading on factory activity suggested the threat of a trade war was starting to bite.  WHO WILL BUY THESE BONDS?  Bond bulls were still smarting from speculation that the Bank of Japan is close to scaling back its monetary stimulus, a risk that lifted long-term borrowing costs globally.  Markets were worried that Japanese investors would have less incentive to hunt offshore for yield, said ANZ economist Felicity Emmett.  \u201cThe 10-basis-point steepening in the Japanese yield curve is massive in the context of a market that rarely moves more than 1 basis point,\u201d she said. \u201cIt reflects a broader fear that central banks are reducing their purchases while U.S. bond supply is set to rise significantly.\u201d  As a result, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered around their highest in five weeks at 2.95 percent, and were again nearing the 3 percent mark.  Germany\u2019s government bond yields rose to a five-week high of 0.416 percent. Most other euro zone yields were higher by 1-3 basis points.  \u201cGlobal stocks, Asian stocks in particular have seen a boost from (potential) policy-easing measures in China, and this helps the general risk sentiment and adds to some of the headwinds to bond markets,\u201d said Commerzbank strategist Rainer Guntermann.  GDP GUESSING GAMES  Part of the shift in yields was caused by talk that data on second-quarter U.S. economic growth, due on Friday, would top current forecasts of 4.1 percent.  Dealers noted some media reports that President Donald Trump was predicting an outcome of 4.8 percent. That would not be out of bounds, given the widely-watched Atlanta Fed GDP tracker puts growth at an annualised 4.5 percent.  Such a strong outcome would only add to the risk of faster rate increases from the Federal Reserve and underpin the dollar.  Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was barely moved at 94.56 compared with a low of 94.207 on Monday. It bought 111.19 yen, against Monday\u2019s trough of 110.75.  The euro stalled to $1.1695, having run into profit-taking at a peak of $1.1750 overnight. Turkey\u2019s lira was still down 3 percent after the inaction from its central bank was seen as a missed chance to get some much-needed credibility.  In commodity markets, oil prices were a shade firmer as the focus flicked between oversupply worries and escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran.  U.S. crude added 24 cents to $68.12. Brent edged up 10 cents to $73.17 a barrel.  Spot gold was barely budged at $1,224 an ounce.","513":"SAN FRANCISCO, April 21 (Reuters) - Blockchain firm Ripple sued Alphabet Inc\u2019s YouTube on Tuesday, alleging the video-sharing platform failed to protect consumers from cryptocurrency \u201cgiveaway\u201d scams that use fake social media profiles to dupe victims into sending money.  The company says scammers on YouTube have been impersonating Ripple and its chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, to bait viewers into sending them thousands of dollars worth of XRP, a cryptocurrency championed by Ripple, according to a court filing.  The scammers promise to send back up to 5 million XRP, worth nearly $1 million, but victims who participate in the fake \u201cgiveaways\u201d never receive any money in return, said the filing.  Ripple says it wants the case to be a \u201ccall to action\u201d for the social media industry to stop their platforms from being overrun by fake accounts and misinformation.  \u201cFor every scam, giveaway, fake conspiracy that is taken down, multiple more pop up nearly immediately,\u201d Ripple said in a blog post. \u201cYouTube and other big technology and social media platforms must be held accountable for not implementing sufficient processes for fighting these scams.\u201d  YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Founded in 2012, Ripple is one of the best known companies that develop so-called blockchain technology, or the system underpinning cryptocurrencies. The company develops blockchain systems to help financial services firms carry out cross-border payments, using XRP.  Its filing, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, says YouTube\u2019s failure to address the \u201cpervasive and injurious fraud\u201d has harmed the reputation of both Ripple and Garlinghouse.  Ripple said millions of people have viewed the scams on YouTube, which enabled the fraud to proliferate by ignoring its demands for the videos to be taken down and continuing to sell ads to the scammers.  YouTube also awarded a \u201cverification badge\u201d to a hacked channel displaying a photo of Garlinghouse as its profile picture, falsely indicating to viewers that the account was legitimate, the filing said.

The world\u2019s No. 2 smartphone maker is set to unveil its new Mate 30 line of phones on Sept. 18 in Munich, according to a source familiar with the matter, though it is not clear when the devices would go on sale.  The Mate 30, made to work on new 5G mobile networks, is Huawei\u2019s first major flagship smartphone launch since U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration effectively blacklisted the company in mid-May, alleging it is involved in activities that compromise U.S. national security, a charge the company denies.  A Google spokesman told Reuters the Mate 30 cannot be sold with licensed Google apps and services due to the U.S. ban on sales to Huawei. A temporary reprieve that the U.S. government announced last week does not apply to new products such as the Mate 30, the spokesman said.  U.S. companies can seek a license for specific products to be exempted from the ban. Google, a part of Alphabet Inc , would not say whether it had applied for a license to offer its apps and services known as Google Mobile Services, though it has said in the past that it wants to continue supplying Huawei.  Reuters reported this week that the U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to Huawei, but none have been granted.  The uncertainty surrounding the Mate 30 shows the confusion that reigns for Huawei and its business partners as a result of the escalating trade war between China and the United States. While the Huawei blacklisting was cast as a response to security concerns, President Trump has indicated it could be lifted as part of a trade deal.  \u201cHuawei will continue to use the Android OS and ecosystem if the U.S. government allows us to do so,\u201d Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly told Reuters. \u201cOtherwise, we will continue to develop our own operating system and ecosystem.\u201d  The Commerce Department declined to comment.  NO GOOGLE, NO SALES?  Huawei can likely use an open-source version of Android without falling foul of the U.S. ban on sales to them. But Google\u2019s apps can only be used under a paid license.  \u201cWithout Google Services, no one will buy the device,\u201d said independent analyst Richard Windsor. The Google software normally comes pre-loaded on Android devices.  Huawei earlier this month announced its own mobile operating system, dubbed Harmony. But analysts are skeptical that it is yet a viable alternative to Android.  Huawei vaulted quickly into the top ranks of the global smartphone business in recent years with highly regarded hardware, and Europe has been a key market.  But the U.S. ban has dealt a body blow to sales outside of China, with Huawei\u2019s market share in Europe sliding to 19.3% in the second quarter from 24.9% in the first, figures from Counterpoint Research show.  As late as last week, senior Huawei executives struck a confident tone regarding Android and Google.  \u201cOur new phones will still be based on Android,\u201d Vincent Pang, senior vice president and board director of Huawei, told a media gathering at the top of New York City\u2019s One World Trade Center, an iconic American symbol of perseverance.  \u201cWe want to maintain one standard, one ecosystem, one technology,\u201d he said.  CHIPS IN THE CLEAR  Huawei is confident that other hardware in the new phone will be compliant with U.S. law.  The brains of the Mate 30 line, the Kirin 990 chipset, will be formally unveiled on Sept. 6 by Richard Yu, Huawei\u2019s top consumer executive, when he gives the opening keynote address at the IFA consumer tech fair in Berlin.  The Kirin 990 was developed by HiSilicon, Huawei\u2019s chips unit, based on blueprints from British chip designer ARM Holdings, owned by Japan\u2019s SoftBank.  ARM severed relations with Huawei after the U.S. ban because its designs contain technology of U.S. origin. But a source familiar with Huawei\u2019s plan said its ARM license is based on work that predated the blacklisting of Huawei.  Huawei last week said it has perpetual ownership of the ARMv8 license and chips based on it, including the Kirin 990, would not be affected by the ban.  ARM declined to comment on its relationship with Huawei, saying only that \u201cARM continues to remain compliant with the latest U.S. Commerce Department restrictions and we are adhering to the guidelines related to the specific types of conversations permitted, technical or otherwise.\u201d (Reporting by Kenneth Li in New York and Douglas Busvine in Frankfurt Additional reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco, Alexandra Alper in Washington and Angela Moon in New York Editing by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Weber)","516":"FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Google logo is seen in this illustration taken April 12, 2020.

Google said the app favored by many supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump must demonstrate \u201crobust\u201d content moderation if it wants to get back in the store. Apple gave the service 24 hours to submit a detailed moderation plan, pointing to participants using the service to coordinate Wednesday\u2019s siege of the U.S. Capitol building.  The actions by the two Silicon Valley companies mean that the network seen as a haven for people expelled from Twitter could become unavailable for new downloads on the world\u2019s main mobile phone app stores within a day. It would still be available in mobile browsers.  Parler Chief Executive John Matze said in posts on his service on Friday that Apple was applying standards to Parler that it did not apply to itself and the companies were attacking civil liberties. He added in a text message to Reuters, \u201cCoordinating riots, violence and rebellions has no place on social media.\u201d  Right-leaning social media users in the United States have flocked to Parler, messaging app Telegram and hands-off social site Gab, citing the more aggressive policing of political comments on mainstream platforms such as Twitter Inc and Facebook Inc.

In suspending the service, Google, whose software powers Android phones, cited its policy against apps that promote violence and gave recent examples from Parler, including a Friday post that began \u201cHow do we take back our country?

This is the first time a timeline has been publicly disclosed for the project designed to increase land efficiency, cut costs and conserve energy in one of the world\u2019s priciest housing markets as development struggles to catch up with a rapidly growing population.  Government-backed agency Waterfront Toronto in March 2017 requested proposals to develop a 12-acre (4.86 hectares) environmentally friendly mixed-use area that would add jobs and be affordable for all ages and income brackets. That was the first part of the planned revitalization of about 800 acres of industrial wasteland to the east of the city\u2019s downtown on Lake Ontario.  Sidewalk Labs was chosen in October based on a proposal that included autonomous vehicles, a thermal grid that does not use fossil fuels, low-cost modular buildings with flexible uses, and robotic delivery and waste-management systems. The company settled on Toronto after searching for sites across North America, Europe and Australia to create a smart city.  A development plan is expected to be approved by the Sidewalk and Waterfront Toronto boards by the end of 2018, and the first residents could move in as early as 2022, CEO Dan Doctoroff said in an interview.  \u201cQuayside will be a prototype for a broader opportunity,\u201d Doctoroff said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do, no one has really succeeded in doing. Thus far, I\u2019ve been thrilled with the way things have gone ... but I\u2019m not sanguine about the challenges.\u201d  Other smart city projects have largely failed because of budgets, the involvement of too many parties, and the use of public resources on development with no immediate benefits for the broader population.  Corporate access to personal information is a growing concern. Sidewalk Labs has faced growing scrutiny over its plans to put sensors and cameras all over Quayside.  Doctoroff said Sidewalk Labs would destroy non-essential information, only retain data that would improve the quality of life, and not sell them to advertisers. Third parties must adopt privacy policies developed for the plan, he added.  Most of the technology will be sourced from several other companies, Doctoroff said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible we might invest in (some of) them to encourage them or potentially to fund some of those things, but that will be a smaller percentage.\u201d  Sidewalk has invested $50 million for testing and engagement this year. It will lease a new waterfront office in summer, where it will showcase some Quayside technologies, he said.  Sidewalk will have a better idea by year-end whether its partnership with Waterfront Toronto could extend to the broader eastern waterfront, he said.  Some technologies can be effective in Quayside\u2019s limited area, but others including mobility, energy and building systems need larger economies of scale to be effective, Doctoroff said.  Sidewalk Labs has been approached by others to do similar projects elsewhere but is focused on Toronto for now, Doctoroff said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get it right here.\u201d (Reporting by Nichola Saminather; Editing by Richard Chang)","524":"An illuminated Google logo is seen inside an office building in Zurich, Switzerland December 5, 2018. Picture taken with a fisheye lens. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google said on Monday it would shut down its Google+ social media service in April, four months ahead of schedule, after finding a software flaw for the second time this year that allowed partner apps to access its users' private data.  However, Google said in a blog post that it found no evidence that any other apps had accessed the data, such as name, email, gender and age, using the latest bug. It affected 52.5 million Google+ accounts, including those of some business customers, for six days after it was introduced last month, Google said.  The disclosure comes a day before Chief Executive Sundar Pichai is set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Congress about Google's data collection practices. Some U.S. lawmakers from both major political parties have called for new privacy rules to better control Google, Facebook Inc FB.O and other large technology companies.  In October, the company said it would shut down the consumer version Google+ in August 2019 because it would be too challenging to maintain the unpopular service. At the time, it said profile data from up to 500,000 users might have been exposed to partner apps by a bug that was present for more than two years.  Apps that pull data from Google+ to personalize their own services with user authorization will lose access in 90 days, the company said. Developing Google+ for business customers would remain a focus, it added.","525":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet\u2019s Google will testify before a House of Representatives congressional committee next week in a hearing to discuss the tremendous market power wielded by online platforms.  FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are seen in a combination photo from Reuters files. REUTERS\/File Photos  In a statement on Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee said witnesses would include: Adam Cohen, director of economic policy at Google; Nate Sutton, associate general counsel for regulation at Amazon; Facebook\u2019s Matt Perault, head of global policy development and Apple vice president for corporate law Kyle Andeer.  The hearing will be held on Tuesday, July 16, the advisory said.  Apple and Google did not respond to a request for comment. Facebook had no immediate comment. Amazon spokeswoman Jodi Seth said they will testify, but did not share details.  Separately, a subcommittee of the Senate judiciary panel said in a notice on Tuesday that it had also scheduled a hearing for July 16. It was not immediately clear who would attend.  The hearings come as the House Judiciary Committee is probing competition in digital markets as part of an investigation announced last month, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concern about the power exercised by several of the world\u2019s most valuable companies.  The executive branch has antitrust probes underway with the Justice Department looking at Google and Apple while the FTC probes Facebook and Amazon.  The hearing also comes at a time when both Republicans and Democrats have expressed exasperation with the big tech giants, but for different reasons.  Conservatives, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have complained that social media companies try to diminish their voices online.  Meanwhile, progressives like presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren have called for Amazon, Google and Facebook to sell companies that they purchased previously as a way to address competition concerns.  Furthermore, Facebook is expected to pay a $5 billion penalty for its work with a consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica, which obtained data from millions of Facebook users without their permission. Cambridge was hired by President Donald Trump for his 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.  Social media and technology executives have been called to testify before lawmakers in high-profile hearings on various subjects over the past two years, including on foreign influence operations on their platforms.","526":"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google this year moved to tighten control over its scientists\u2019 papers by launching a \u201csensitive topics\u201d review, and in at least three cases requested authors refrain from casting its technology in a negative light, according to internal communications and interviews with researchers involved in the work.  FILE PHOTO: An illuminated Google logo is seen inside an office building in Zurich, Switzerland December 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Google\u2019s new review procedure asks that researchers consult with legal, policy and public relations teams before pursuing topics such as face and sentiment analysis and categorizations of race, gender or political affiliation, according to internal webpages explaining the policy.  \u201cAdvances in technology and the growing complexity of our external environment are increasingly leading to situations where seemingly inoffensive projects raise ethical, reputational, regulatory or legal issues,\u201d one of the pages for research staff stated. Reuters could not determine the date of the post, though three current employees said the policy began in June.  Google declined to comment for this story.  The \u201csensitive topics\u201d process adds a round of scrutiny to Google\u2019s standard review of papers for pitfalls such as disclosing of trade secrets, eight current and former employees said.  For some projects, Google officials have intervened in later stages. A senior Google manager reviewing a study on content recommendation technology shortly before publication this summer told authors to \u201ctake great care to strike a positive tone,\u201d according to internal correspondence read to Reuters.  The manager added, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean we should hide from the real challenges\u201d posed by the software.  Subsequent correspondence from a researcher to reviewers shows authors \u201cupdated to remove all references to Google products.\u201d A draft seen by Reuters had mentioned Google-owned YouTube.  Four staff researchers, including senior scientist Margaret Mitchell, said they believe Google is starting to interfere with crucial studies of potential technology harms.  \u201cIf we are researching the appropriate thing given our expertise, and we are not permitted to publish that on grounds that are not in line with high-quality peer review, then we\u2019re getting into a serious problem of censorship,\u201d Mitchell said.  Google states on its public-facing website that its scientists have \u201csubstantial\u201d freedom.  Tensions between Google and some of its staff broke into view this month after the abrupt exit of scientist Timnit Gebru, who led a 12-person team with Mitchell focused on ethics in artificial intelligence software (AI).  Gebru says Google fired her after she questioned an order not to publish research claiming AI that mimics speech could disadvantage marginalized populations. Google said it accepted and expedited her resignation. It could not be determined whether Gebru\u2019s paper underwent a \u201csensitive topics\u201d review.  Google Senior Vice President Jeff Dean said in a statement this month that Gebru\u2019s paper dwelled on potential harms without discussing efforts underway to address them.  Dean added that Google supports AI ethics scholarship and is \u201cactively working on improving our paper review processes, because we know that too many checks and balances can become cumbersome.\u201d  \u2018SENSITIVE TOPICS\u2019  The explosion in research and development of AI across the tech industry has prompted authorities in the United States and elsewhere to propose rules for its use. Some have cited scientific studies showing that facial analysis software and other AI can perpetuate biases or erode privacy.  Google in recent years incorporated AI throughout its services, using the technology to interpret complex search queries, decide recommendations on YouTube and autocomplete sentences in Gmail. Its researchers published more than 200 papers in the last year about developing AI responsibly, among more than 1,000 projects in total, Dean said.  Studying Google services for biases is among the \u201csensitive topics\u201d under the company\u2019s new policy, according to an internal webpage. Among dozens of other \u201csensitive topics\u201d listed were the oil industry, China, Iran, Israel, COVID-19, home security, insurance, location data, religion, self-driving vehicles, telecoms and systems that recommend or personalize web content.  The Google paper for which authors were told to strike a positive tone discusses recommendation AI, which services like YouTube employ to personalize users\u2019 content feeds. A draft reviewed by Reuters included \u201cconcerns\u201d that this technology can promote \u201cdisinformation, discriminatory or otherwise unfair results\u201d and \u201cinsufficient diversity of content,\u201d as well as lead to \u201cpolitical polarization.\u201d  The final publication instead says the systems can promote \u201caccurate information, fairness, and diversity of content.\u201d The published version, entitled \u201cWhat are you optimizing for? Aligning Recommender Systems with Human Values,\u201d omitted credit to Google researchers. Reuters could not determine why.  A paper this month on AI for understanding a foreign language softened a reference to how the Google Translate product was making mistakes following a request from company reviewers, a source said. The published version says the authors used Google Translate, and a separate sentence says part of the research method was to \u201creview and fix inaccurate translations.\u201d  For a paper published last week, a Google employee described the process as a \u201clong-haul,\u201d involving more than 100 email exchanges between researchers and reviewers, according to the internal correspondence.  The researchers found that AI can cough up personal data and copyrighted material - including a page from a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d novel - that had been pulled from the internet to develop the system.  A draft described how such disclosures could infringe copyrights or violate European privacy law, a person familiar with the matter said. Following company reviews, authors removed the legal risks, and Google published the paper.","527":"FILE PHOTO: An illuminated Google logo is seen inside an office building in Zurich, Switzerland December 5, 2018.
