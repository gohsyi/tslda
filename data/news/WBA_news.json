The move follows recently updated guidelines here from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S drugstore chain said.  Walgreens said it was implementing safety measures, including the use of disposable facemasks at all times by its pharmacy staff, in line with the guidance.  Rivals such as CVS Health Corp and Rite Aid Corp have also said they were preparing to meet a surge in demand for flu shots when the season kicks off in October.  Routine immunizations are even more important in the current COVID-19 environment to help reduce the overall burden of respiratory illnesses on the healthcare system, Walgreens said.","3":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed a victory to Walgreens, turning away an appeal by a fired former Florida employee of the pharmacy chain who asked not to work on Saturdays for religious reasons as a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.  FILE PHOTO: A sign rests on a counter at a Walgreens pharmacy store in Austin, TX, U.S., March 26, 2018. Picture taken on March 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohammad Khursheed\/File Photo  The justices declined to review a lower court ruling in Darrell Patterson\u2019s religious discrimination lawsuit that concluded that his demand to never work on Saturday, observed as the Sabbath by Seventh-day Adventists, placed an undue hardship on Walgreens.  Patterson, who had trained customer service representatives at a Walgreens call center in Orlando, was fired in 2011 after failing to show up for work on a Saturday for an urgent training session.  The case tested the allowances companies must make for employees for religious reasons to comply with a federal anti-discrimination law called Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.  Under Title VII, employers must \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d workers\u2019 religious practices unless that would cause the company \u201cundue hardship.\u201d  Asked by the justices for its views on the case, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration in December suggested that the court review only part of the dispute - whether lower courts used an improper standard to judge \u201cundue hardship\u201d - one that is too favorable to companies.  The case pitted business interests against religious rights, two issues that often find favor with the conservative justices who hold a 5-4 majority on the high court.  Walgreens is part of Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.  Patterson sued Walgreens in 2014 in Orlando federal court, alleging the retailer violated his religious rights under Title VII. For Seventh-day Adventists, observing the Sabbath from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday is a key tenet of their Protestant Christian denomination, founded in the 19th century.  He accused Walgreens of not adequately trying to accommodate his request not to work on Saturdays, and then trying to demote him without any guarantee not to schedule him on Saturdays.  Walgreens said it had repeatedly accommodated him since he joined the company in 2005, including shifting the training schedule to suit his needs.  The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed in 2018 with Walgreens, saying it had made numerous efforts to accommodate Patterson and was not required to guarantee he would never work on a Saturday.  Patterson appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that a reasonable accommodation requires employers to completely eliminate any conflict between work and religious needs, and that lower courts are divided over the issue.  Walgreens told the justices: \u201cTitle VII requires only that the employer \u2018reasonably accommodate\u2019 the employee, not \u2018totally accommodate.\u2019\u201d","4":"March 22 (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc:  * WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE- WALGREENS RECOGNIZES ONGOING COMMITMENT OF HOURLY TEAM MEMBERS IN STORES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WITH ONE-TIME BONUS  * WALGREENS-BONUS PAYMENT OF $300 FOR FULL-TIME, $150 FOR PART-TIME HOURLY TEAM MEMBERS IN STORES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO BE PAID BEGINNING LATE APRIL Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","5":"FILE PHOTO: A shuttered Walgreens pharmacy store is seen during the coronavirus outbreak in Times Square in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., March 20, 2020.

Representatives of the hospital could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening. A spokesman for the hospital\u2019s parent company, UnityPoint Health, told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the company did not comment on pending litigation.  A spokesman for Walgreens, whose parent company is Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, declined to comment to Reuters.  Prince, 57, was found dead at his Paisley Park home and recording studio complex near Minneapolis on April 21, 2016. The official cause of death was a self-administered overdose of the painkiller fentanyl, which is 50 times stronger than heroin.  A Minnesota prosecutor said last week he could not bring any criminal charges in connection with the \u201cPurple Rain\u201d singer\u2019s death after a two-year investigation failed to determine where he obtained a counterfeit painkiller laced with fentanyl.  Police investigating Prince\u2019s death found numerous opioids in the singer\u2019s home, according to court documents released in April 2017.  The death of the music superstar, who crafted a public image of a clean and healthy vegan lifestyle, shocked the world and set off a protracted battle among his siblings and half-siblings over who would inherit his estate, estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  Prince, known for his androgynous style and sexually charged songs, died a day before he was set to meet a California-based doctor who specializes in addiction treatment.  After his death, his longtime collaborator and protege Sheila E. told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d that Prince had been suffering from hip and knee pain from decades of intense performing, much of it in his heels.","20":"March 31 (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc:  * WALGREENS AND POSTMATES EXPAND ON-DEMAND DELIVERY SERVICE TO 7,000 STORES NATIONWIDE*  * WALGREENS - CUSTOMERS CAN GET ACCESS TO UNLIMITED FREE DELIVERY WHEN THEY SUBSCRIBE TO POSTMATES MEMBERSHIP SERVICE, POSTMATES UNLIMITED, FOR $9.99 \/MONTH Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","21":"(Reuters) - The debut of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O into the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index .DJI this week marks the worst performance of any new entrant in the past 10 years, a Reuters analysis shows.

It trimmed more than 44 points off the index, which shrugged off early losses to close the day up 98 points, or 0.4 percent.  While Walgreens performed like dog on debut, it would not today qualify as one of the \u201cDogs of the Dow,\u201d under an investment strategy based on selecting 10 Dow stocks at year end with the highest dividend yields.  Walgreens\u2019 annual dividend is 2.4 percent, above the S&P average yield of just under 2 percent, but below the 10 actual \u201cDogs\u201d with yields above 3 percent.  GE shares have risen more than 8 percent since the company was dropped from the Dow, giving it the best three-day performance among those that recently left the index.  GE left the Dow with the lowest share price and least amount of influence in the index, which is derived from an average of stock prices among constituent companies.  GE said on Tuesday that it would sell its oil-services firm Baker Hughes HBGE.N and spin off its healthcare business, leaving a slimmed-down company focused on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.  Eight of the 11 most recent companies to join the Dow have seen share prices decline in the three days following a debut.  The second worst performing entrant was Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O, which saw shares fall 6.8 percent after joining the index in September 2008 when it replaced American International Group Inc AIG.N.","22":"Feb 8 (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp:  * RITE AID ANNOUNCES CONTINUED PROGRESS IN SALE OF ASSETS TO WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE  * RITE AID CORP - AS OF FEBRUARY 8, 2018, RITE AID HAS TRANSFERRED 1,114 STORES AND RELATED ASSETS TO WBA  * RITE AID CORP - RITE AID HAS RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF $2,424 MILLION  * RITE AID CORP - HAVE NOW COMPLETED MORE THAN HALF OF PLANNED STORE TRANSFERS TO WALGREENS  * RITE AID CORP - REMAIN ON TRACK TO FINISH PROCESS WITH WALGREENS IN SPRING OF THIS YEAR Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","23":"(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O has been exploring whether to go private following private equity interest in the U.S drug store chain, which has a market value of more than $55 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.  FILE PHOTO: A customer walks out of a Walgreens pharmacy store in Austin, TX, U.S., March 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohammad Khursheed  In recent months, Walgreens has held preliminary discussions with some of the world\u2019s largest private equity firms about putting together what would be the biggest ever leveraged buyout, the sources said.  Walgreens has tasked investment bank Evercore Partners Inc EVR.N with exploring whether a transaction can be put together, the sources said, cautioning that a deal is far from certain.  Many private equity firms have pushed back on the idea, concerned about Walgreens\u2019 business prospects and the challenges of financing the deal, the sources added.  A leveraged buyout of Walgreens would likely require participation of several private equity firms, each writing large checks, at a time when many of them have lost their appetite for teaming together on so-called club deals. Many of those takeovers were completed during a boom preceding the 2008 financial crisis and subsequently struggled or collapsed.  Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina, who is the company\u2019s largest shareholder with a 16% stake, could roll his equity into the deal to help finance the transaction, one of the sources said.  Walgreens has also contemplated divesting some of its assets, such as its 27% stake in drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp ABC.N, to provide more funding, one of the sources added.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Walgreens and Evercore declined to comment.  Walgreens shares rose 8% to $64.12 in New York after Reuters was first to report the news on Tuesday. It later gave back some of those gains and was up about 3%. The stock had lost 28% of its value in the last 12 months, compared to a 13% rise in the S&P 500 Index .INX.  Walgreens\u2019 deliberations over going private reflect the challenges its business faces.  Last week, it warned it did not expect its adjusted earnings to grow in fiscal 2020 because of the low reimbursement rates for prescription drugs, especially generics, and competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  The Deerfield, Illinois-based company, which operates Walgreens and Duane Reade pharmacies in the United States and Boots in Britain, has been closing stores and launching cross-selling partnerships with companies such as grocer Kroger Co KR.N and weight loss clinic operator Jenny Craig, as it seeks to cut costs and boost its growth prospects.  Some analysts said that going private could allow Walgreens to avoid the prying eyes of Wall Street, and invest in its business and offerings without having to worry about quarterly earnings. But many questioned whether such a large leveraged buyout was possible.  \u201cGiven poor industry fundamentals, seemingly never-ending margin pressures faced in the healthcare supply chain, and, let\u2019s face it, ongoing uncertainty about unpredictable items such as opioids exposure, we would struggle to see a monster premium beyond this current run-up (in the stock),\u201d Baird analyst Eric Coldwell wrote in a note.  DEALMAKING  Walgreens' approach toward alliances and joint ventures stands in stark contrast to the strategy of rival CVS health Corp CVS.N, which acquired U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc for $70 billion last year. CVS shares have performed better than Walgreens in the last 12 months, down about 7%.  In 2017, Walgreens dropped a $17.2 billion deal to buy smaller peer Rite Aid Corp RAD.N after failing to win U.S. antitrust approval. Instead, it agreed to acquire 1,932 Rite Aid stores, about 42% of its total. The retail footprint proved too big for Walgreens, which has been gradually closing some locations.  Last year, Walgreens explored other deals, including buying out the rest of AmerisourceBergen and buying a stake in U.S. health insurer Humana Inc HUM.N, as well as selling a stake to it. It did not pursue those transactions, although it has been expanding its partnership with Humana by providing primary care services and support for seniors inside Walgreens stores.  Pessina, 78, would not be the first company boss to be involved in talks to take his firm private. Dell Technologies Inc DELL.N CEO Michael Dell, for example, took the computer maker private in 2013 in a $24.9 billion deal backed by private equity firm Silver Lake. After a string of acquisitions, Dell returned to the stock market as a public company last year and now has a market value of $39 billion.  But Dell owned about three-quarters of his company at the time of the leveraged buyout, making its funding easier.  Last year, former Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O executive chairman Paul Jacobs briefly explored a long-shot bid to take the U.S. semiconductor company, which has a market capitalization of $103 billion, private.","24":"FILE PHOTO: A customer walks out of a Walgreens pharmacy store in Austin, TX, U.S., March 26, 2018.

Walgreens already offers two other doses of Kaleo\u2019s emergency allergy shots, Auvi-Q, under a partnership that the drugstore chain entered with the company in September last year.  The company\u2019s move comes days after Novartis AG said it would make its pre-filled epinephrine shots immediately available in local pharmacies across the United States.  Mylan NV, with its EpiPen, is the market leader for these devices, which are used to deliver epinephrine to counter severe allergic reactions to triggers such as peanuts or bee-stings.  But manufacturing delays at a Pfizer Inc unit, which produces all EpiPens sold globally at a single plant near St. Louis, have led to an acute shortage.  There is also traditionally high demand for the devices in the summer as families look to renew prescriptions ahead of the back-to-school season.  EpiPen has remained on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s list of drugs in shortage for more than a year, and Pfizer on Tuesday said it anticipates further supply shortages over the coming months.

AmerisourceBergen shares rose 15.7 percent in after-hours trading and shares of Walgreens, which has around 13,000 drugstores worldwide, mostly in the United States, were unchanged.  Walgreens is valued at $67.82 billion and AmerisourceBergen has a market capitalization of $19.65 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Healthcare payers and pharmacies are responding to a shifting landscape, including changes in the U.S. Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc.  A new deal by Walgreens would follow the $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc by drugstore rival CVS Health Corp and would also reflect a move toward vertical consolidation, where members of a supply chain combine.  Representatives of Walgreens' Chief Executive Stefano Pessina made \"a high-level outreach\" to representatives of AmerisourceBergen CEO Steven Collis several weeks ago, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com\/2Ch5Gg9)  AmerisourceBergen said it did not discuss potential mergers or acquisitions. Walgreens was not available for comment.  The two companies are already closely allied, having struck a 10-year deal in 2013 for AmerisourceBergen to buy drugs for Walgreens, which subsequently acquired 26 percent of the distributor.  Walgreens would buy the remaining shares under the deal being considered, the Journal reported. An offer has not been made, and there may be no deal, it added.  The drugstore operator last year represented 30 percent of AmerisourceBergen\u2019s revenue and is its largest customer.  Walgreens reported in January its sixth straight quarterly fall in retail same-store sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 along with a drop in gross margins in its U.S. business.  AmerisourceBergen reported last week a threefold jump in quarterly profit to $861.9 million, helped by a $587.6 million tax benefit.

Walgreens shares have fallen 17.8 percent in the past 12 months, while AmerisourceBergen shares are down 1.9 percent in the same period.

Last year, the agency announced sweeping restrictions on flavored tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes. It also plans to seek a ban on menthol cigarettes, a longtime goal of public health advocates, as well as flavored cigars.  An epidemic-level rise in the popularity of e-cigarettes lately has led to a 38 percent increase in overall tobacco product use among high school students and 29 percent among middle school students last year, reversing the declines seen in the last few years, the FDA said.

The criteria to qualify as an essential, frontline worker varies from state to state. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that roughly 30 million essential workers will be next in line for a shot. An additional 57 million essential workers will be vaccinated later.  The lack of clear guidelines will significantly complicate the verification process as those workers seek shots.  The United States has two authorized COVID-19 vaccines, one from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE and another from Moderna Inc. The vaccines are rolling out as hospitals reach peak capacity and deaths have exceeded 317,000.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security in March published a list of essential U.S. workers during the pandemic. bit.ly\/3aBDtFx  The list covers nearly 70% of the U.S. labor force and has provided little clarity to health officials trying to distribute initially limited doses of vaccines.  Many states over the summer began developing their own priority lists, at times deferring to the importance of local industries. States generally have broad discretion when it comes to vaccine distribution.  This has resulted in a patchwork of guidelines across the country, with companies complaining that their workers are considered essential in one state, but not in another.  A panel of experts that advises the CDC on Sunday recommended that people 75 and older and workers including first responders, teachers, food and agriculture, manufacturing, U.S. Postal Service, public transit and grocery store workers should have the next priority for the vaccines.  Some U.S. states have signaled they will nevertheless continue with the distribution plans they originally drafted.  Michael Einhorn, the president of New York medical supply distributor Dealmed, criticized health officials\u2019 decisions to prioritize essential workers for the next phase of the vaccine, rather than distributing it along age lines.  \u201cThere will be people trying to cut the line and commit fraud to get a vaccine,\u201d said Einhorn, whose company has been involved in flu shot distribution.  HOW WILL ELIGIBILITY BE CONFIRMED FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS?  It is not clear yet how health departments and pharmacies will verify the identity of a significantly larger and more diverse group of people eligible for the next round of vaccines.  Pharmacy operators CVS, Walgreens and Kroger Co each referred to state and local guidelines when asked how they would verify essential workers.  \u201cIf the jurisdiction requests support from Walgreens, Walgreens will distribute a voucher or authorization form that the individual can use to schedule an appointment for a vaccination,\u201d a Walgreens spokeswoman said in a statement.  CVS said it would share more information once it got closer to the next phase of vaccine distribution in the first quarter of 2021.  Kroger in a statement said it would require customers to make an online appointment and use a screening tool to manage the verification process.  \u201cIn some instances, the state will identify and verify the individuals before they are referred to us for vaccination,\u201d a Kroger spokeswoman said.  States have not outlined how they will verify workers\u2019 identities. Companies pushing to have their workers vaccinated are exploring different options.  The Consumer Brands Association, which represents food, beverage, personal care and household product companies, and the Food Industry Association, representing food retailers, said they were developing template letters for employees to verify their essential worker status.  \u201cWe understand states may have different designation standards, but (we are) working to provide our members with a resource to help reduce confusion,\u201d a spokeswoman for the Food Industry Association said in a statement.

The efforts center on giving vaccine access to communities of color, who have shown higher rates of skepticism about the safety of vaccines, with many distrustful of government authorities and lacking access to healthcare services.

A customer walks out of a Walgreens pharmacy store in Austin, TX, U.S., March 26, 2018. Picture taken on March 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohammad Khursheed  The lawsuit by Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear was his sixth to date seeking to hold corporations like drug manufacturers and distributors responsible for their roles in the drug abuse crisis.  The lawsuit, filed in state circuit court in Boone County, said Walgreens filled massive opioid orders in both unusually large sizes and great frequencies. In its role as a distributor that shipped drugs, the company failed to report suspicious orders to authorities.  At the store level, Walgreens dispensed opioids at \u201csuch an alarming rate and volume that there could be no legitimate medical purpose associated to their use,\u201d according to the complaint.  The only possible explanation for the large quantities of opioids dispensed from its Kentucky stores was that some of the drugs were distributed to addicts and abused or diverted for illegal uses, the complaint said.  \u201cWhile Walgreens\u2019 slogan was \u2018at the corner of happy and healthy,\u2019 they have significantly harmed the health of our families in fueling the opioid epidemic,\u201d Beshear said in a statement.  The lawsuit alleged that because Walgreens allowed for the proliferation of dangerous opioids into Kentucky, the state\u2019s citizens suffered from drug addiction, overdoses and death.  The lawsuit seeks damages and penalties as well as an injunction.  Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens declined to comment.  Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Kentucky had 1,404 overdose deaths in 2016, the lawsuit said. The state had the third highest drug overdose rate in 2015 behind West Virginia and New Hampshire, according to Beshear\u2019s complaint.  States, counties and cities have filed hundreds of lawsuits, accusing drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing, and accused wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders.  Beshear is pursuing similar cases against drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp ABC.N, Cardinal Health Inc CAH.N and McKesson Corp MCK.N as well as drugmakers Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Endo International Plc ENDP.O.","54":"Feb 13 (Reuters) - Walgreens\u2019 potential move to buy a drug distributor in which it already has a 26 percent stake has some analysts questioning the logic and wondering if it would be enough to compete in an evolving U.S. healthcare sector.  Analysts said any deal would not be a surprise, but might cost Walgreens opportunities down the line as the company tries to keep pace with rival CVS Health Corp, which is set to buy health insurer Aetna Inc, and an impending threat from Amazon.com.  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, the largest U.S. drugstore operator, has made a takeover approach to AmerisourceBergen Corp, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, but said the talks were in early stages.  AmerisourceBergen shares were up 12 percent in early trading, while Walgreens shares were up 1.4 percent. Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and Cardinal Health were lower.  \u201cThis purported deal wouldn\u2019t be shocking ... but we\u2019re currently struggling to see the strategic allure of the combination for Walgreens,\u201d Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said in a note.  The two companies are already closely allied, having struck a 10-year deal in 2013 for AmerisourceBergen to buy drugs for Walgreens, which subsequently acquired 26 percent of the distributor.  The rationale for such a deal is a bit of a head-scratcher as Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen already have a joint venture that affords both the strategic value that combining would provide, Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said.  The news comes as the U.S. healthcare landscape remains in a state of flux, with changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act escalating drug prices and Amazon\u2019s possible entry.  Walgreens has highlighted that it tends to prefer partnerships, which analysts say could eventually turn into acquisitions.  A deal, however, would give Walgreens a bigger presence in the specialty pharmacy space, where it does not have adequate exposure, setting it up to compete better against CVS and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co.  \u201cAs the broader healthcare sector focuses more on moving specialty drug administration out of facility-based (hospital\/physician\u2019s office) settings, gaining a strong foothold in specialty through ABC could be a valuable strategic move,\u201d Tanquilut said.

However, the 541 local governments that opted out included Florida\u2019s Palm Beach County and counties in West Virginia, according to attorneys, raising the prospect that companies could face expensive trials even if they settled with the class. The two regions are among the hardest hit by the crisis, which has contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997.  Officials from Houston\u2019s Harris County, one of the largest U.S. counties, have said it would opt out, meaning they would pursue their own lawsuit and not receive funds from a nationwide settlement.  The court filing did not identify opt-outs.  U.S. Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who has been overseeing 2,600 consolidated opioid lawsuits, is pushing hard for a settlement to help get funds to those most in need in a timely fashion. He approved the novel \u201cnegotiation class\u201d as a way to reassure companies that any deal to resolve the lawsuits would bind remaining governments and prevent them from filing a case.  The lawsuits generally allege that drugmakers improperly marketed opioids while distributors and pharmacy chains failed to stop suspicious orders. The defendants deny the allegations.  Typical class actions allow members to opt out after a settlement has been reached, but the negotiation class fixes the members first. Any settlement must be approved by 75% of the class.  Lawyers said towns and counties less affected by the crisis had little reason to opt out, while areas ravaged by opioids, like West Virginia, had more incentive to pursue and control their own lawsuit.  The number of opt-outs represented around 20% of those that have already sued and could be significant if it included large cities, according to Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.  \u201cIf I\u2019m trying to negotiate with a town of 80, that\u2019s very different from Houston,\u201d she said.

Same-day drug delivery is already available in certain markets and will be expanded in 2019, Walgreens said.","65":"(Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's WBA.O quarterly profit missed Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, hit by lower payments from insurers on drugs sold at its U.S. pharmacies, knocking back its shares and those of rival CVS Health Corp CVS.N.  The company sought to reassure investors, saying it would meet its adjusted full-year profit forecast of roughly flat growth, betting on cost cuts and a harsh flu season.  But shares fell nearly 7% to $55, dragging down those of CVS 2%, as investors worried that the pressure on reimbursement rates from insurers was likely to hurt profits further.  Walgreens has also been struggling with disappointing performance in its Boots UK unit and intense competition from the arrival of Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O in the pharmacy market in the past year.  To cushion the impact, Walgreens has closed stores and launched cross-selling partnerships with companies including grocer Kroger Co KR.N and weight-loss clinic operator Jenny Craig.  \u201cThe changes in our markets are obscuring some of the positive impact we are having,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina. \u201cThis will not be the case forever.\u201d  Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers in the United States have been seeking to push more of the cost of the drugs they pay for - and reimburse - to the pharmacy chains that actually deliver them to insured consumers.  In recent years, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company had benefited from steep falls in generic drug prices that helped it offset the pressure from lower reimbursement rates, but such declines have slowed in the past year.  \u201cProfitability and sales growth may be hard to come by for the foreseeable future in this era of reimbursement pressure and a rapidly changing health care environment,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst John Boylan.  Walgreens said on Wednesday it had completed 114 of the 200 planned namesake store closures in the United States and 28 of a scheduled 200 Boots UK closures. The company\u2019s cost cutting program, launched in 2018, aims to save more than $1.8 billion annually by 2022.  Boots, acquired in 2014, has struggled with competition from online retailers, as well as a broader decline of the UK high street, which has seen dozens of major retailers collapse in recent years.  Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.37 per share, short of estimates of $1.41.  Revenue rose 1.6% to $34.34 billion, but missed analysts\u2019 estimate of $34.60 billion.

Brick-and-mortar drug retailers have been hit as consumers are increasingly buying over-the-counter treatments from online retailers such as Amazon.com. Pharmacies in the United Kingdom are also suffering from a cut in reimbursement rates by the government.  To stem the losses, the largest U.S. drugstore operator by store count has been trying to boost sales through its prescription-only pharmacy business by signing pilot projects with online beauty retailer Birchbox and supermarket chain Kroger Co.  The company also said it would be investing in new stores and online operations to counter weakness in the UK.  Comparable retail sales in its international unit fell 0.9 percent. In the United States, it was down 1.9 percent.  Overall, revenue rose nearly 11 percent to $33.44 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $33.78 billion, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  The company\u2019s quarterly profit, however, beat analysts\u2019 expectations, helped by its purchase of rival Rite Aid stores.  It agreed to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores last year to widen its footprint in the United States and give it more heft to bargain better on price with drugmakers.  \u201cOur businesses have mostly done a good job of growing or at least holding their own in a tough year in many of our markets,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina said.

Testing for COVID-19, the serious respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, has been slow in the United States due to a lack of test kits and other equipment.  While more than 300,000 people in America have tested positive for the new coronavirus, officials believe there are the undercounted cases because of a shortage of kits.  Testing, including at drive-through sites like these, is also seen as key in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to sweeping shutdowns of many businesses and mass layoffs.

The two companies have explored various possibilities for combining operations in recent years, including a sale of AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens, on the theory that their drug distribution businesses would be better positioned to withstand competitive price pressures through even bigger scale.  The coronavirus pandemic has weighed on Walgreens\u2019 retail business since then, however. Its shares have fallen more than 28 percent this year, compared to a 12% drop in the S&P 500 index due to the outbreak. AmerisourceBergen shares are flat year-to-date.  AmerisourceBergen is willing to pay about $6 billion for the Walgreens pharmaceutical wholesale business, which operates mainly under the Alliance Healthcare brand, one of the sources said.  There is no certainty that the two companies will negotiate a deal, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen, which have market capitalizations of $37 billion and $18 billion, respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  While Walgreens stores have remained open during the pandemic, the company said in April that sales at its locations had fallen as consumers stay home, often because they are avoiding doctor visits and have fewer prescriptions to fill.  Walgreens has lost about half its value over the last five years amid growing distress in the retail sector and competition from online retailers, including Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.  Last year, the debt-laden pharmacy chain explored going private and held preliminary discussions with private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said at the time.  A full or partial divestment of Alliance Healthcare would give Walgreens a cash injection and make it easier for Chief Executive Stefano Pessina, the company\u2019s largest shareholder with a 16% stake, to take it private.

FILE PHOTO: A customer walks out of a Walgreens pharmacy store in Austin, TX, U.S., March 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohammad Khursheed\/File Photo  The drop in shares to a more than five-year low wiped off nearly $8 billion from the market capitalization of the worst performing stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, and weighed on shares of rival CVS Health Corp and drug wholesalers.  Drug retailers like Walgreens and CVS Health have been squeezed by reimbursement pressure as their pharmacies receive less for filing prescriptions coupled with a steep decline in generic drug prices for several years.  And there is no relief in sight, with generic drug prices failing to recover as competition heats up and heightened public and regulatory scrutiny limits the pace of branded drug price increases.  A combination of all these factors resulted in the \u201cmost difficult quarter\u201d for the company since the merger of Alliance Boots and Walgreens in 2014, Walgreens Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina said.  \u201cWhile we are not the only company that has been impacted by the marked change in the environment, that\u2019s not an excuse,\u201d Pessina said.  Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the entire pharma supply chain has felt toxic over the past few months, but pharmacies have been suffering more than most, adding there is very little to get excited about for the foreseeable future.  Walgreens reduced its adjusted earnings growth forecast for fiscal 2019 to roughly flat from a range of 7 to 12 percent growth on a constant currency basis.  The magnitude of Walgreens\u2019 forecast cut surprised some Wall Street analysts, who had expected it after the company had warned about increased competition and reimbursement pressures at its pharmacies.  While expectations rapidly declined the last four weeks, these results and the forecast missed the most bearish of predictions, Baird analyst Eric Coldwell said.  The company said it would speed up cost cuts, which include shutting stores and consolidating warehouses, to stem some of the losses from the challenging market conditions and expects to save more than $1.5 billion annually by 2022, up from its previous estimate of $1 billion.  The company has also largely stayed away from big deals, instead focusing on partnering with companies such as Microsoft Inc and Kroger Co.  On a post-earnings call with analysts on Tuesday, company executives played down the possibility of an acquisition, a move that has been questioned by analysts for sometime now.  Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said the current drugstore environment may accelerate industry consolidation because there are many small competitors that likely are feeling the same pressures.  \u201cWe predict this could lead to increased sales volumes at the larger players, such as Walgreens, over the long term as they gain share from smaller competitors.\u201d  Excluding items, the company earned $1.64 per share, missing analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.72 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The drugstore retailer\u2019s shares rose 5% after it predicted a gradual recovery next year, with adjusted profit rising 30%-40% in the last two quarters of fiscal year 2021 following a decline of 17%-23% in the first two quarters.  Walgreens, whose 2020 adjusted profit fell 21%, has cut jobs, suspended share repurchases and closed some of its UK-based Boots stores to save costs and revive profit growth as the COVID-19 crisis hammered sales at its stores and pharmacies.  \u201cWe think the UK would be one country where there might be more lockdowns. We don\u2019t see major risk (of lockdowns) in the United States,\u201d Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said.  Walgreen\u2019s forecast did not consider any profit from its pharmacies distributing future COVID-19 vaccines.  While chances of a large lockdown are low, it could result in a bigger hit to Walgreens\u2019 profit compared to any boost from the company\u2019s role in vaccine distribution, Kehoe added.  Drugmakers are racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine with some of the leading candidates currently being tested in large, decisive studies.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton\/File Photo  A deal would not be a surprise, but analysts noted that it might cost Walgreens Boots Alliance opportunities down the line as the company tries to keep pace with rival CVS Health Corp, which is set to buy health insurer Aetna Inc, and possibly go up against Amazon.com.

While the CVS-Aetna deal is expected to create a consumer healthcare giant that will only widen CVS\u2019 formidable reach, Walgreens will get no such lift if it buys AmerisourceBergen, in which it holds a 26 percent stake, analysts said.  However, any Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen deal would give Walgreens a bigger presence in the specialty pharmacy space, where it does not have adequate exposure, setting it up to compete better against CVS and pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co.  \u201cAs the broader healthcare sector focuses more on moving specialty drug administration out of facility-based (hospital\/physician\u2019s office) settings, gaining a strong foothold in specialty through ABC could be a valuable strategic move,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut said.  AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens have a 10-year deal, struck in 2013, that allows the drug distributor to buy drugs for Walgreens, the largest U.S. drugstore operator.  The Wall Street Journal reported on the potential deal on Monday, but said talks were in early stages.  \u201cThis deal has probably been brewing longer than they\u2019re letting on ... unlike CVS-Aetna, there are more immediate margin and synergy opportunities,\u201d said Brad Haller, M&A director at West Monroe Partners.  He, however, added that those cost savings may not be immediately achievable because Walgreens is already knee-deep in completing post-merger integrations with Boots Alliance and Rite-Aid.  \u201cAdding on another large-scale integration would be difficult,\u201d he said.  Walgreens bought Alliance Boots in 2014 and said last year it would buy nearly 2,000 Rite-Aid stores.  A potential Walgreens deal comes as the U.S. healthcare landscape remains in a state of flux, with changes to the U.S. Affordable Care Act, escalating drug prices and Amazon\u2019s possible entry.  Analysts have long speculated that Amazon is likely to disrupt healthcare with deals with drug distributors, insurers or hospitals. Amazon Business, the company\u2019s business-to-business marketplace already sells professional medical products and hospital consumables such as gloves.  Amazon plans to expand the business, the WSJ reported on Tuesday, and recently dispatched employees to a large Midwestern hospital system, where hospital officials are testing whether they can use Amazon Business to order health-care supplies.  The news pushed down shares of dental supply companies Henry Schein Inc and Patterson Cos Inc. Shares of drug distributors Mckesson Corp and Cardinal Health were lower as well.","91":"Feb 12 (Reuters) -  * WALGREENS IN EARLY-STAGE TALKS TO BUY AMERISOURCEBERGEN, OF WHICH IT ALREADY OWNS 26 PERCENT - CNBC,CITING DJ","92":"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O said on Monday it does not expect adjusted earnings to grow in fiscal 2020 and warned that prescriptions it fills at its pharmacies may fetch lower reimbursements.  Shares of the company were up 1.5% at $56.21 in choppy trading after reporting a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit.  Walgreens\u2019 stock has been under pressure since the start of the year, particularly after a dismal second quarter, as investor expectations over the company\u2019s growth prospects took a hit in the face of low reimbursement rates.  \u201cIt has not been an easy task for us to recover from a very difficult second quarter,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina said in a call with analysts.  Walgreens has been benefiting from the process of procuring generic drugs to offset growing pressure from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers on reimbursements for filling prescriptions. But of late that came under pressure as prices of such drugs stabilize in the United States.  Michael Cherny, an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the reimbursement rates are the most closely watched metric for investors to understand the growth of the company\u2019s unit that houses its U.S. pharmacies.  Same-store sales at the retail pharmacy division in the United States rose 3.4% from a year earlier and the company said higher prices for patented drugs and prescription volumes helped its profit beat Wall Street estimates.  \u201cThe expectation was lower given ongoing pessimism about the ability to generate sustainable operating profit growth,\u201d Cherny said.  Walgreens said it now expects annual savings of $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022 from its cost-cut plan that was announced late last year, up from $1.5 billion. As part of the plan, it had decided in August to close 200 U.S. stores.  Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.43 per share, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $1.41 per share.  Revenue rose 1.53% from a year earlier to $33.95 billion.

Fewer than 10% of doses allocated to those Arkansas seniors have been administered, according to the state health department. The two pharmacies are working with about 40% of the state\u2019s facilities. Some of those were told that they were scheduled for February or March, said Dr. Joe Thompson, former Arkansas surgeon general and chief executive of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement  \u201cThis is not acceptable,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a failure in deployment by CVS and Walgreens.\u201d  Federal health officials in recent days have urged broadening vaccine eligibility to tens of millions of Americans to speed the national inoculation program rollout. Meanwhile, seniors at some long-term care facilities - who account for about 1% of the U.S. population but 40% of COVID-19 deaths and were supposed to be at the front of the line - continue to wait.  State and local officials and long-term care operators in states including Florida, California, Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania told Reuters they have turned to alternative providers for vaccinations for their residents or staff because the pharmacy chains were scheduling shots weeks out.  Some 75,000 long-term care facilities signed up to receive vaccines from CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc under the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Pharmacy Partnership Program.  \u201cI think they face serious bandwidth issues in terms of scheduling,\u201d said David Grabowski, a Harvard Medical School professor and healthcare policy expert. \u201cI find it very distressing that we haven\u2019t been doing this more rapidly. This is really a matter of life or death.\u201d  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson in a statement on Thursday said the two pharmacy chains assured him that all long-term care residents assigned to them would be vaccinated by the end of this month.  Many states prioritized homes with patients requiring medical care, which contributed to delays at other long-term care facilities.  CVS said it plans to finish all shots at assigned facilities within nine to 12 weeks of the first dose. That means states like California, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, which were among the last to activate the second-phase of facility vaccinations, may not be finished until April.  \u201cState decisions on which facilities are activated when have a significant impact on timing,\u201d CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford said, noting that the company has administered 1 million shots and is on track with its federal agreement.  Others hurdles included confirming vaccine availability, the winter holidays, vaccine hesitancy and fresh COVID-19 outbreaks, the companies said.  That resulted in \u201ca little bit slower start than what we were hoping for. Now that we\u2019ve gotten past the first of the year, you\u2019re seeing a quick and rapid acceleration,\u201d said Rick Gates, Walgreens\u2019 senior vice president of pharmacy and healthcare. The company has done more than 500,000 shots and expects to be done by March.  \u2018OVERWHELMED BY THE SHEER VOLUME\u2019  Meanwhile, central Florida\u2019s Seminole County is deploying mobile clinics to some assisted living facilities.  \u201cWe went because they either have not been contacted by the private providers or they had concerns because of some type of issue,\u201d said county emergency manager Alan Harris.  \u201cCVS and Walgreens, I think, are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of long-term care facilities in Florida,\u201d Harris said.  The state of Florida has hired health services firm CDR Maguire to take over vaccinations at about 1,900 assisted living facilities that CVS or Walgreens had scheduled on or after Jan. 24.  Los Angeles County opted out of the CVS-Walgreens partnership and is asking facilities that can to pick up and administer vaccine themselves. In Northern California\u2019s Contra Costa County, nonprofit Choice in Aging joined John Muir Health and Kaiser Permanente in pitching in to help.  Choice in Aging is targeting facilities with six or fewer beds in historically underserved communities. \u201cThis is a population that is never prioritized,\u201d said Choice in Aging CEO Debbie Toth.  The CDC on Thursday said 26% of the 4.7 million vaccine doses allocated for long-term care sites had been administered, lagging even the woeful 36% of the 30.6 million available nationwide.

Like other drugstore chains, Walgreens is seeing a drop in customer visits to its retail stores, where it sells over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics, as purchases have now shifted online.  To stanch falling sales at retail - its front-end business - the company has focused on boosting sales through its prescription only pharmacy business by signing partnerships with pharmacy benefit managers such as Prime Therapeutics that has given it more than 20 million additional customers.  Walgreens is also pulling non-profitable items off shelves at its front-end stores and promoting store-brands to boost margins.

Same-store sales at its pharmacies rose 5.1 percent, but missed analysts expectations for a 5.4 percent rise, according to four analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.

And the private sector is also weighing in \u2013 insurance rates for U.S. senior-care centers have risen as much as 300% for those institutions that can find it, according to Reuters\u2019 sources.  About 70% of nursing homes are for-profit, according to the government. Booming demand and the ability to leverage assets lured in private equity investors in recent years.  But things are changing. Ventas, a roughly $13 billion REIT that owns senior housing, facilities and medical offices, has lost about 40% of its market capitalization this year. Private equity looks even more exposed \u2013 a March paper by NYU professors found lower quality of care after buyouts, as firms tried to maximize margins.  Granny may benefit eventually if the pandemic forces higher quality care. For many investors, though, it\u2019s a zero-sum game. (By Robert Cyran)  POWER TRIP. U.S. taxpayers may finally have the upper hand in pushing back on abysmal flying experiences. On a recent American Airlines flight where, according to the New York Times on Tuesday, passengers who had changed seats to gain some extra distance were asked to move back to their original \u2013 crowded \u2013 spots. Even as Covid-19 cases surge in the United States, attendants noted they hadn\u2019t paid for the extra room.  In fact, passengers might argue that they had. Government-backed bailouts have left air carriers indebted to taxpayers. Airline employees are particularly invested in winning people over in the court of public opinion. Their jobs are on the line as companies like United Airlines send out notices that thousands of workers could be furloughed. Sure, the rank and file who serve drinks and accommodate room in the overhead compartments are just doing their jobs. Now they just have a few extra bosses. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)  SMALL AILMENTS, BIG PROBLEMS. Stefano Pessina, the chief executive of Walgreens Boots Alliance, should be happy November\u2019s talk of a buyout of the drugstore chain in a deal valued at $87 billion resulted in naught. The company reported disappointing quarterly results on Thursday, sending its shares down 8%. The shares are now down about 40% from where they were in November.  The pandemic worsened existing problems in UK operations, where main street shops have been losing customers to online competitors. Covid-19 squeezed them even harder. Sales fell by more than $700 million, and the company took a $2 billion impairment charge.  A buyout was always a stretch, and closing stores, cutting jobs and suspending share repurchases should help. But problems haven\u2019t disappeared. Pessina, the company\u2019s largest shareholder with 16%, might\u2019ve liked solving problems out of the public eye. But he would have been doing so with a more highly leveraged WBA. Sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. (By Robert Cyran)  MIDDLING KINGDOM. China\u2019s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has brought a rare bit of good news for embattled Ford Motor boss Jim Hackett. The $24 billion U.S. carmaker on Thursday unveiled its first quarterly sales increase in the country for almost three years. Adding to the achievement, Ford performed better than arch rival General Motors, which offloaded some 5% fewer vehicles than the same period last year.  It\u2019ll be an unusual boost for Hackett, who has had a disappointing three years at the wheel of the Detroit manufacturer. It\u2019s not an unqualified success, though: Overall industry sales in China grew much faster than Ford\u2019s in the three months to June. And it\u2019ll be hard to replicate such success back home, with new daily U.S. coronavirus cases hitting record highs in recent days. But Hackett should take any good news where he can get it.

Pharmacies stayed open, but with the lockdown in place, footfall for brick-and-mortar retailers nosedived.  Covid-19 has accelerated the high street\u2019s decline but did not create it. The retail sector employs around 3.1 million people in the UK \u2013 a number that\u2019s been falling with automation and with consumers switching to online. With Britain\u2019s unemployment rate expected to more than double to 10%, these workers will find it hard to find new jobs. Finance ministers, including Britain\u2019s Rishi Sunak, are trying to help, pumping billions into protecting employment. That\u2019s a critical endeavour, but saving all shop jobs is a lost battle. (By Dasha Afanasieva)  EXTRA BOOST. British housebuilder Persimmon said on Thursday that revenue plunged more than 30% to 1.2 billion pounds for the six months ended June 30 after the housing market screeched to a halt during two months of lockdown as potential buyers were generally unable to visit homes.  But things aren\u2019t all bad. Customer demand in the six weeks since its sales offices in England reopened in mid-May showed signs of life, with around 30% more weekly average net private sales reservations than last year. On top of that, Chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed on Wednesday that he will give the housing market a tax break, at a cost of 3.8 billion pounds. Thursday\u2019s hint of a recovery pushed Persimmon shares up more than 5% and suggests Sunak jumped the gun. With the economy expected to contract almost 9% this year, the money may be needed elsewhere. (By Dasha Afanasieva)  UP IN THE AIR. AirAsia\u2019s problems will travel to regional peers. The Malaysian carrier is in talks to raise funds, Reuters reported on Thursday, a day after auditor EY doubted its ability to operate as a going concern and a stock plunge left it with a $550 million market value. Apart from the lifelines handed to Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines, there has been a dearth of official support for the industry.  AirAsia could merge with its compatriot, Malaysia Airlines, given the latter\u2019s sovereign backer Khazanah Nasional has played down the idea of a bailout for the flag carrier.

REUTERS\/Mohammad Khursheed  Shares of the company, however, fell nearly 3 percent as the company\u2019s international business suffered mainly due to weak demand in Britain, where its market share gains were offset by a weak retail environment.  The company operates nearly 2,500 stores in the UK, roughly half its non-U.S. stores, making it vulnerable to Brexit-related uncertainties.  \u201cWalgreens\u2019 overall profitability was not as strong as we would have liked. This, in our view, was due to lower demand in the United Kingdom,\u201d Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said.  The cost-cutting program, which is expected to save more than $1 billion by the end of the third year, comes as the company consolidates 1,932 stores acquired from Rite Aid Corp RAD.N last year for $4.38 billion.  The company said its pharmaceutical wholesale division and retail businesses in Chile and Mexico were part of its cost-saving plan, which is expected to result in significant restructuring and other special charges.  International retail sales fell 5.9 percent to $2.9 billion, while same-store sales at its U.S. retail stores, where it sells over-the-counter drugs and personal care products, fell 3.2 percent.  \u201cWe were facing a tough year-ago comp number that was boosted by the impact of hurricanes and a very strong cough-cold flu season,\u201d Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said on a conference call.  U.S. retail sales also took a hit as the company scaled back sales of certain products including tobacco.  However, its U.S. pharmacy business posted a strong quarter, helping Walgreens beat profit estimates.  Same-store sales at its U.S. pharmacies rose 2.8 percent, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of a 2.6 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.18 per share, in the first quarter ended Nov. 30 from $821 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Walgreens earned $1.46 per share.  Sales rose 9.9 percent to $33.79 billion.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.43 per share and revenue of $33.78 billion.","117":"LONDON (Reuters) - Tesco's TSCO.L finance chief, who helped steer the group from an accounting scandal to a successful turnaround, is to retire, setting the stage for an entirely new top executive team at Britain's biggest retailer by next May.

REUTERS\/Hannah McKay  Alan Stewart will depart next April, Tesco said on Tuesday, six months after CEO Dave Lewis is due to step down and be replaced by Ken Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA.O.  Tesco was on its knees in September 2014 when Stewart left Marks & Spencer MKS.L to join the supermarket group as chief financial officer. The accounting scandal knocked millions off Tesco's profits and billions from its share price.  In April 2015 the group reported an annual loss of 6.4 billion pounds ($8 billion), one of the biggest in British corporate history.  But by October last year Lewis, CEO since 2014, declared Tesco\u2019s turnaround complete and this April it reported annual core profits of 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion).  \u201cAlong with Dave Lewis, he (Stewart) is a key component in effectively saving Tesco,\u201d said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.  Shares in Tesco were down 1.8% at 0852 GMT, extending 2020 losses to 10.7%.  Tesco said in its statement that Stewart had led its corporate restructuring, rebuilt its balance sheet, guided it back to investment grade and played a huge role in the financial transformation of the business in the last six years.  Stewart will leave on April 30, 2021, and the board will now conduct a thorough search both internally and externally to identify a successor, it said.  That means from May 2021, Tesco Chairman John Allan will have a totally new main board executive team.  Tesco said Stewart has been granted \u201cgood leaver\u201d status for his various deferred bonuses and share schemes, conditional on him not taking up employment as a director, consultant or adviser with retail sector competitors for six months after he leaves.

Shares of the drugstore chain fell nearly 10%, adding to year-to-date losses of about 28% through last close, after it posted a loss for the quarter, compared with a year-ago profit.  Stringent lockdown measures in Britain led to an 85% plunge in traffic in its Boots UK stores in April, the company said. Adding to the burn, its profit-yielding premium beauty and fragrance counters were closed for almost 10 weeks.  The Boots division has been a sore point for Walgreens, which has been trying to revive the unit through cost-cutting measures.  On Thursday, the company said it would close 48 Boots Opticians stores and cut 20% jobs in Boots\u2019 UK support office, impacting more than 4,000 employees or 7% of its workforce.

REUTERS\/Lisa Baertlein\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Kroger Co and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said on Monday they would stop selling e-cigarettes at their stores, amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of the product and reports of lung disease and some deaths linked to vaping.  Their move comes weeks after Walmart Inc said it was pulling the plug on e-cigarette sales, citing growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty.  E-cigarettes and other vaping products have been linked to a mysterious lung illness that is reported to have led to 18 deaths as of last week, with the number of confirmed and probable cases of the condition exceeding 1,000, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Kroger said it would discontinue sales of e-cigarettes at its stores and fuel centers after selling through its current inventory.  Walgreens said it had decided to stop selling e-cigarette products at its U.S. stores as the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other health officials continue to examine the issue.  The drugstore chain, which earlier this year set a minimum age to sell tobacco products at 21 years, said the decision was also reflective of developing regulations in a growing number of states and municipalities.  New York and Michigan have already banned the sales of flavored vaping products, while the Trump administration has announced plans to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from store shelves as officials warned that sweet flavors had drawn millions of children into nicotine addiction.
