While new watch sales have grown more slowly, the used market has been boosted by younger consumers happy to buy online, prompting Cartier owner Richemont CFR.S to buy second-hand platform Watchfinder.co.uk.  Hendy said eBay\u2019s transaction volume of second-hand luxury watches would exceed $1 billion in 2018. This compares to volumes of around 1.3 billion euros expected at German rival Chrono24 by its co-CEO and founder Tim Stracke.  eBay allowed approved professional sellers, like Watchbox, to list timepieces on eBay with an \u201cauthenticity verified\u201d tag in September by extending its eBay Authenticate program from handbags to luxury watches.  And from the first quarter of 2019, eBay will allow consumers to instantly sell their luxury watch on the site, adding authentication services to cover all consumer-to-consumer (C2C) transactions during the second half of the year.  Swiss luxury watch brands have long hesitated to sell online and used to look at platforms like eBay or specialized websites Chrono24 or Chronext as a nuisance because watches which retailers find hard to sell often end up online at a discount.  However, eBay is now looking at partnerships with luxury brands as it targets a market estimated to be worth around 17.6 billion euros ($20 billion) when jewelry is included, a recent report by Bain & Company said.  The used market has been boosted by younger consumers happy to shop online, prompting watch manufacturers like Richemont or Audemars Piguet to enter the market.  \u201cI believe that in the next few years the primary and secondary market are going to come together,\u201d Hendy said, adding that brands working with eBay would be able to engage with customers directly via its platform.

REUTERS\/Kacper Pempel\/File Photo  Shares of the online marketplace were down 1 percent in after-hours trading, reversing course after an initial jump following eBay\u2019s move to pay a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share.  The lackluster forecast comes as San Jose, California-based eBay faces demands from two prominent activist shareholders to sell some divisions and restructure others amid fierce competition with Amazon.com Inc and other online retailers.  EBay said consumer spending in December, a normally busy shopping period, was slow despite more buyers using its platform.  Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig also predicted more near-term pressure on eBay\u2019s gross merchandise volume (GMV) - the value of all products sold on its websites - as the company reduced some marketing spending. He said he was confident, however, the company would boost GMV in the long run and benefit from new ad sales and a payments initiative.  \u201cWe believe that the actions we\u2019re taking in \u201819 will set us up well,\u201d he said on a conference call with analysts.  EBay forecast revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.60 billion for the current quarter, compared with analysts\u2019 target of $2.66 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  GMV overall rose just 1 percent in the December quarter and also missed analysts\u2019 estimates, while it dipped 1 percent in the United States.  Still, results for the final quarter of 2018 showed eBay\u2019s sales had climbed 6.3 percent year-over-year to $2.88 billion, exceeding Wall Street\u2019s estimates.  A multi-year effort by eBay to make its platform simpler to users, by introducing grouped listings, personal recommendations and an easier-to-use payment process is helping attract shoppers.  EBay had 179 million active buyers at the end of the December quarter, about 2 million more than the previous quarter.  The company also announced an increase to its share buybacks by $4 billion, reflecting the influence of eBay\u2019s activist investors, said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.  \u201cThe hope for eBay, in my opinion, is their ability to supplement the marketplace with advertising and a growing payments business, but I think the core marketplace is still a challenged business,\u201d he said.  EBay\u2019s quarterly profit from continuing operations reached $763 million, compared with a loss of $2.6 billion a year earlier, when eBay recorded a one-time expense of more than $3 billion.","4":"BOSTON (Reuters) - Four former eBay Inc workers have agreed to plead guilty to participating in a cyberstalking campaign against a Massachusetts couple whose online newsletter they viewed as critical of the e-commerce company.  Former eBay security and global intelligence team members Stephanie Popp, Stephanie Stockwell, Brian Gilbert and Veronica Zea are slated to enter their pleas on Oct. 8 in federal court in Boston, according to a filing on Wednesday.  Popp\u2019s attorney declined to comment. Other defense lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.  They four are among seven defendants, including two onetime eBay security executives, who prosecutors said targeted the couple with anonymous email and Twitter threats and deliveries such as live cockroaches and a bloody Halloween pig mask.  Prosecutors said the former eBay workers also sent pornography in the couple\u2019s name to neighbors and conducted covert surveillance, in a systematic bid to terrorize the couple and deter them from criticizing the company.  They did so after two top executives expressed frustration with the newsletter. One of the executives was former Chief Executive Devin Wenig, who a person familiar with the matter confirmed is the \u201cExecutive 1\u201d identified in charging documents.  Prosecutors said that Wenig texted the other executive after the newsletter\u2019s editor published an article about eBay saying it was time to \u201ctake her down.\u201d  Wenig has not been charged and has denied directing or knowing anything about the scheme. He is a member of General Motors Co's GM.N board.  A spokesman for Wenig did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The four expected to plead guilty were first charged in June. Popp was formerly eBay\u2019s senior manager of global intelligence, while Gilbert is a former senior manager of special operations for eBay\u2019s global security team.  Stockwell is the former manager of eBay\u2019s global intelligence center and Zea was a contractor who worked in the center as an intelligence analyst.","5":"DUBAI (Reuters) - ebay Inc will sell products on a relatively new Middle Eastern e-commerce venture, founded by a Dubai billionaire, from the second half of this year, the venture said on Tuesday.

The two companies will also explore joint marketing opportunities and consider sharing their know-how and best practices with each other, the statement said.  Other details of the partnership were not disclosed and a noon spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about possible financial terms. The spokeswoman said that eBay was not acquiring a stake in noon under the agreement.  Noon, which started operations in 2017, was launched by Alabbar with the financial backing of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and other Gulf investors.  Alabbar, a prominent Emirati businessman, is the chairman of Emaar Properties, the Dubai builder of the world\u2019s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa.  E-commerce in the Middle East is potentially highly lucrative, in part because of the region\u2019s young and tech-savvy population. However, inadequate logistics and electronic payment methods have hampered it from gaining a significant foothold.  Amazon.com bought Middle Eastern online retailer Souq.com in March 2017, beating a bid by the retail unit of Alabbar\u2019s Emaar.  In May that year, the retail business Emaar Malls Group agreed to buy a 51 percent stake in Middle Eastern online fashion retailer Namshi for $151 million from Global Fashion Group.","6":"MUNICH, March 25 (Reuters) - Scout24, the Germany-based autos and property marketplace, on Monday expressed an interest in acquisitions if EBay sells its classifieds business following pressure from activist investors to do so.  \u201cThat is a concrete example we are looking at,\u201d CEO Tobias Hartmann told journalists after Scout24 reported double-digit growth in revenue and profits last year.

The company signed cooperation agreements with Elliott and Starboard Value LP, under which the two investors have agreed to certain standstill agreement, including voting along with management, and other provisions with eBay.  \u201cOver the course of the last two months, we\u2019ve met with a number of shareholders to understand their views,\u201d eBay Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig said in a statement, adding that the discussions have been constructive.  Elliott, one of Wall Street\u2019s busiest and successful activists, made a new bet on eBay in the fourth quarter and has been pushing for changes at the company, including a sale of its StubHub ticket sales and its classified-ads businesses.  Starboard, another prominent activist which has won more board seats through settlements than other hedge funds, according to data from Lazard, has also been building a stake.  The company\u2019s shares have jumped 32 percent since the start of January but are still off 13 percent over the last 52 weeks. Shares in eBay rose 5 percent to $39 in early trading after the news.  StubHub on its own could be worth between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, and eBay Classifieds, which has an international footprint, could be sold or spun off and worth between $8 billion and $12 billion, Elliott said last month.  Before eBay, Wenig had spent 18 years at Thomson Reuters, where he led the company\u2019s markets unit.","8":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo for AT&T is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019.

The New York-based hedge fund liquidated its investment when it sold 5 million shares during the quarter that ended Sept. 30. It had first bought into the stock during the third quarter 2019, according to another filing.  Investment companies are required to say what U.S. stocks they own at the end of each quarter. While these filings are made with a delay, they often shed light on investment trends that are closely watched by other investors.  Elliott, which invests $41 billion and is known as one of the world\u2019s busiest corporate activists, originally criticized AT&T for operational missteps and its takeover strategy as well as its choice of leaders. But by the time company veteran John Stankey succeeded AT&T\u2019s long-time CEO, Randall Stephenson, as its chief in July, Elliott had come around to the choice.  Among its many investments, Elliott did not make any changes to its stake in eBay EBAY.O, another company where it pushed for changes in 2019. The filing shows that Elliott owned 9.9 million shares in eBay even after Jesse Cohn, the partner who runs Elliott's U.S. activism practice, stepped off its board in September.  Elliott won the eBay seat in March 2019.  Starboard Value, another influential activist investor, which also reached a settlement with eBay in early 2019 and was able to fill one seat on eBay\u2019s board, sold off the rest of its stake during the third quarter, a filing shows.  The hedge fund sold 2,090,000 eBay shares after having already sold three quarters of its stake during the second quarter, filings showed.","9":"FILE PHOTO: The eBay logo is pictured on a phone screen in this photo illustration in New York, U.S., July 23, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: A web page featuring Amazon's Australian URL is pictured in this photo illustration April 20, 2017. REUTERS\/Jason Reed\/Illustration\/File Photo  But Amazon\u2019s recent move to stop Australians from shopping on its foreign websites, due to a new law that requires it to collect taxes, is turning away once-loyal customers like Boon.  He's considering a switch to eBay Inc EBAY.O, adding that prices for wall mounts were 40 percent higher on Amazon's Australia site if they appeared there at all.  \u201cI\u2019ll be going somewhere else to get that regular stuff,\u201d said Boon by telephone from the northern city of Brisbane, where he runs his business.  Amazon\u2019s launch of an Australian site in December, followed by last month\u2019s introduction of its Prime service for faster delivery, has been heralded as a game changer for the country\u2019s retail industry. But it has gotten off to a choppy start.  For customers like Boon, the retail giant has lost years of goodwill by forcing shoppers onto a local site with a product range roughly one ninth of the U.S. site and which sells some goods at higher prices.  It has also given online marketplace eBay, Amazon\u2019s bigger and more established rival in Australia, the opportunity to swoop in and capture that goodwill, building its first automatic tax collection and payment system and wooing local customers with discounts.  TAXING ISSUES  Australia is the first market where Amazon, the world\u2019s second-most valuable company worth $890 billion, has responded to a sales tax on internet purchases by shutting out customers based on where they live.  An Amazon spokesman said in an email the company would continue to build its range of goods and services through its Australian site, and that it was \u201cthrilled with the reception it has received from Australian customers\u201d since introducing Amazon Prime.  The Australian government extended its 10 percent goods and services tax (GST) to all goods bought online from overseas, effective July 1, requiring online retailers to collect the tax. It was previously applicable only to overseas purchases over A$1,000 ($745).  Amazon also gave Australians just one month\u2019s notice that they would be shut out of its global network - sales are cut off when an Australian delivery address is entered - even though the government\u2019s plans were announced a year ago.  Critics say the decision was an excuse to drive traffic to its new local site and promote its Amazon Prime service.  \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt that Amazon will be successful here in time, but I don\u2019t believe that this strategy is what\u2019s going to catapult them to success,\u201d said Ryan Murtagh, CEO of Neto, a provider of data and logistics support for about 3,000 online retailers in Australia.  \u201cI think actually it potentially could damage them in the long term.\u201d  Amazon has some 550 million products on its U.S. site including those sold by Amazon and third-party sellers, according to Boomerang Commerce, an artificial intelligence technology firm in California. That compares with the 500-600 million offers from third-party sellers on eBay, which includes duplicate products.  EBAY\u2019S EDGE  Ebay said the decision to build the new tax collection and payment system had paid off with early figures suggesting Australian shoppers were not swayed by the new tax.  \u201cIt was a big change and it was a global change that needed to be done,\u201d said eBay\u2019s local managing director, Tim MacKinnon, adding that the effort was led by its California headquarters.  \u201cA lot of people worked on it, a lot of different teams. We\u2019re really proud that we hit the July 1 deadline.\u201d  He added its decision to offer Australian shoppers a 10 percent discount on its local, British and U.S. websites for the first week of July had helped generate business.  \u201cAll of our sites have accelerated,\u201d said MacKinnon.  While neither Amazon nor eBay provide data on visitors to their sites and estimating their share of Australia\u2019s A$26 billion-a-year online retail market is difficult, customer dissatisfaction with Amazon Australia is not hard to find. Its Facebook page is overrun with negative comments.

Allegro, a Polish equivalent of eBay which allows both professional retailers and members of the public to sell on its platform, used an algorithm not available to other sellers to favorably position offers from its own shop, UOKiK said.  \u201cIn our opinion, Allegro used information it had gathered, including an algorithm for deciding on the relevance of items, to favor its own shop,\u201d UOKiK president Marek Niechcial told reporters.  \u201cThe company knew how to position products so buyers chose them more often than those from competitors\u2019 shops.\u201d  UOKiK also said that some sales or promotion functions were only available for the official Allegro shop.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The statement came after people familiar with the matter said ICE discussed a potential takeover of eBay. The acquisition would exceed $30 billion and represent a substantial departure from ICE\u2019s focus on financial markets.  The move would call on ICE\u2019s technological expertise in running markets to extract efficiencies from eBay\u2019s marketplace platform, which connects buyers and sellers of goods around the world.  ICE said in its statement that \u201ceBay has not engaged in a meaningful way\u201d, and as a result, it was not in negotiations regarding the sale of all or part of eBay.  The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal discussions, said ICE is not interested in eBay\u2019s classified ad unit, which eBay has been considering selling.  EBay declined to comment.  EBay\u2019s board issued a statement on Wednesday morning saying it is \u201caligned and open to all value-enhancing alternatives.\u201d  EBay\u2019s shares ended trading 8.7% firmer at $37.41 on Tuesday following the news, giving it a market value of $30.4 billion. ICE shares fell 7.5% to $92.59, giving the company a market value of $51.6 billion, as investors fretted a deal could be dilutive for the stock exchange operator.  ICE, which also operates futures exchanges and clearing-houses, has faced pressure from U.S. regulators to freeze or reduce the fees it charges to operate financial markets, spurring it to diversify its business.  ICE\u2019s approach rekindles debate among investors over whether eBay should be moving faster to shed its classifieds business, which advertises products and services for sale off the eBay marketplace.  Earlier on Tuesday, activist shareholder Starboard Value LP once again called on eBay Inc to sell off its classifieds business, arguing the company has not made enough progress to improve shareholder value.  \u201cTo achieve the optimal outcome, we believe Classifieds must be separated, and a more comprehensive and aggressive operating plan must be put in place to drive profitable growth in the core Marketplace business,\u201d Starboard said in a letter to eBay\u2019s board.  The San Jose, California-based e-commerce firm said it would \u201creview Starboard\u2019s letter and perspectives.\u201d  EBay has been shifting focus to its advertising and payments businesses amid stiff competition in its marketplace business from Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc.  The company faced pressure last year not only from Starboard but also from hedge fund Elliott Management. In a settlement, eBay offered a board seat to Elliott\u2019s Jesse Cohn and to Matt Murphy, president and CEO of Marvell Technology, which was backed by Starboard. EBay also agreed in March to conduct a strategic review of its business, and in November agreed to sell StubHub for $4.05 billion in cash.  The company is expected to provide an update this year on its classifieds business, which Elliott valued at between $8 billion and $12 billion.","19":"March 5 (Reuters) - eBay Inc:  * EBAY - WILL BLOCK NEW LISTINGS & START TO REMOVE LISTINGS THAT SELL MASKS INCLUDING N95\/N100 & SURGICAL MASKS, HAND SANITIZER & DISINFECTING WIPES  * EBAY INC - TO REMOVE ANY LISTING THAT MENTIONS COVID-19, CORONAVIRUS, 2019NCOV (EXCEPT BOOKS) IN TITLE OR DESCRIPTION - BLOG Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","20":"June 11 (Reuters) - E-commerce companies Amazon Inc and eBay Inc have been instructed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop selling unproven or unsafe disinfectants, including products falsely marketed as killing COVID-19, on their platforms, Bloomberg reported bloom.bg\/3fcuLg5 on Thursday.

After a highly sought initial public offering, shares in the Dutch company had been priced on Tuesday at 240 euros, the top of their indicated range, suggesting a market capitalization of 7.1 billion euros ($8.5 billion). After the first hour of trade on the Euronext exchange on Wednesday the share price hit 480.00 euros.  It was up 82 percent at 436.70 euros by 1105 GMT.  After several European IPOs were pulled in May, bankers say strong interest in Adyen may spill over into other upcoming deals, such as German online furniture retailer Home24, which was due to price on Wednesday.  The soaring share price prompted debate over whether the offer had been underpriced.  Investors who sold in the all-secondary offering \u201cstill own about 85 percent, so focusing on what they own, they might be happy,\u201d said one banker whose bank had a role in the IPO.  \u201cThe one thing for sure is this helps the IPO sentiment in Europe.\u201d  One banker who was not involved said the issue, which will raise 947 million euros including an overallotment option, was underpriced.  \u201cIt is difficult to be in the shoes of the pricing banks ...  typically a successful IPO goes up 10-15 percent,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut the message is not that the IPO market is up and flying. Investors are very selective.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: Euro banknotes and coins are displayed in a shop in Brussels, Belgium November 14, 2017. REUTERS\/Eric Vidal\/File Photo  Prior to Adyen, the 10 biggest IPOs in Europe by gross proceeds so far this year rose less than 6 percent on average above their offer price on their first day of trading, according to Eikon data and Reuters calculations.  Adyen\u2019s sale was only open to institutional investors, and the company said on Tuesday it had been oversubscribed \u201cmultiple times.\u201d  Books had been covered at the top price within an hour of the offer being launched on June 5, which the head of a syndicate involved in the float said may have been \u201cunprecedented.\u201d  Adyen helps retailers take customer payments and usher them through complicated payment networks quickly.  Its fast growth, its flashy customer and investor lists, together with the relatively small number of shares on offer, recent strength in technology shares, and fevered M&A in the payments segment, all bolstered demand for shares of the previously little-known company.  Still, there are reasons for investor caution. The issue price was more than 70 times Adyen\u2019s 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 99.4 million euros. The company, which is debt-free and profitable, says it expects to grow sales by 25-35 percent annually.  Among major risk factors in its prospectus, Adyen cited fierce competition and the fact that its top 10 clients, which also include Vodafone, Uber and Spotify, represent around 33 percent of sales.  Those high-profile clients may demand concessions or defect to competitors, as eBay did when it decided to abandon former owner PayPal for Adyen in January. It later emerged that eBay was offered warrants worth up to a 5 percent stake in Adyen in exchange.  Adyen will face competition from rivals like WorldPay WP.O, which was bought last year by U.S. credit-card processing company Vantiv for $10.4 billion.  U.S. giant PayPal PYPL.O agreed to buy smartphone payment terminal provider iZettle last month for $2.2 billion. Worldline bought Swiss payments processor SIX Group for $2.75 billion.  U.S. fintech rivals such as Square and Stripe are also growing quickly, and some major online retailers including Amazon AMZN.O and Alibaba BABA.N are developing their own payment systems.  Adyen\u2019s offer is primarily a way for existing investors, which include the likes of General Atlantic, Index Ventures and Iconiq Capital, the Silicon Valley fund that is an investment vehicle for the founders of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.  Including overallotments, existing shareholders sold 13.4 percent of shares in the offering, which is secondary only.  With remaining shares subject to a six-month lockup period, only a relatively small number of shares were in play on the first day of trading. In the first hour of trade, a little more than 600,000 shares traded hands - only 2 percent of the total outstanding.  \u201cLiquidity is thin. People are sitting on their shares and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the price up,\u201d said one person familiar with the deal.  Adyen co-founder and CEO Pieter van der Does, whose around 1.6 million shares in the company are worth nearly 700 million euros at current prices, eschewed any public appearances in the run-up to the IPO, meeting only with private investors. That made some sense given the business-to-business nature of the company and a business model that may not be readily understood by retail investors.  Less traditional was his decision not to ring the gong or hold any celebration at Euronext in Amsterdam on Wednesday. Some observers were also surprised by his decision not to opt for a listing on Nasdaq.  \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be building this company with such a great team,\u201d Van der Does said in a statement issued on Tuesday night. \u201cThis listing will only help us to continue to do what we are doing now: helping our merchants grow and reshaping the payments industry.\u201d  Investor Jan Hammer of Index Ventures, Adyen\u2019s largest shareholder, said the successful listing was \u201cproof that even in a traditional and highly regulated industry, building a powerful, global business is possible\u201d.  He said the company handled 108 billion euros in transactions last year out of an estimated $23 trillion globally and had room to grow despite the competition.  Another personal familiar with the IPO said it \u201cwasn\u2019t mispriced.\u201d  \u201cThey wanted pop,\u201d he said, referring to the company\u2019s founders and early investors.","22":"EBay Inc on Monday said lawyers from Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz and Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan advised it on its agreement to sell ticketing unit StubHub to ticket reseller Viagogo Ltd for $4.05 billion in cash.

In January, activist investors Elliott Management Corp and Starboard Value had urged eBay to sell its ticket sales business and eBay Classifieds Group as part of a plan that could double the company\u2019s value.  Elliott valued StubHub between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, while eBay Classifieds between $8 billion and $12 billion.  Viagogo Chief Executive Officer Eric Baker had co-founded StubHub but left before the business was sold to eBay for $310 million in 2007.  Following the activist investors\u2019 request, eBay made changes to its board of directors in March. It announced a review of its StubHub and eBay Classifieds businesses as part of an agreement with activist investors to avert a proxy contest.  Elliott Management declined to comment on the development on Monday, while Starboard Value did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for a comment.  The online seller had been a target of activist investors before. In 2014, Carl Icahn asked eBay to spin off its payments unit PayPal, a move which the company followed through in 2015.  The deal, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2020, comes after the exit of former CEO Devin Wenig in September, following his differences with the company\u2019s revamped board.  The e-commerce company is expected to provide an update on its classified ad business next year.  Last month, eBay forecast its holiday quarter revenue below estimates, as it faces intense competition from Amazon.com AMZN.O and Walmart Inc WMT.N.  \u201cThe core business remains challenged and these developments won\u2019t directly impact it this quarter,\u201d Wedbush analyst Ygal Arounian said on the divestiture impacting eBay\u2019s holiday quarter.

Britain accounted for less than 10% of the consolidated revenue of eBay\u2019s classifieds business and 1% of Adevinta\u2019s consolidated revenue, Adevinta said.  In the latest CMA merger investigation involving large digital companies, the watchdog said it is \u201cthoroughly examining deals to ensure that competition is not restricted and consumers\u2019 interests are protected\u201d.

EBay and the private equity consortium - which consists of Blackstone, Hellman & Friedman and Pemira - weren\u2019t immediately available to comment.  Demand for online market places has surged during the coronavirus pandemic as consumers have turned to online shopping due to prolonged lockdowns and social distancing measures in place in most countries.  Ebay\u2019s classified business includes brands such as Gumtree and Kijiji and offers online ads to more than 1,000 cities around the world.  The unit posted an operating income of $83 million in the first quarter of 2020, with revenues of $248 million. Its enterprise value is estimated at $8 billion to $10 billion.  Prosus, which recently failed to buy food delivery firm Just Eat TKWY.AS, is expected to play aggressively to win control of eBay's classified ads business, the sources said.

Prosus's finance head told Reuters in June that the Amsterdam-based business - which was spun out of Naspers NPNJn.J last year - has little overlap with the eBay unit.  If successful, Prosus would reinforce its network of classified businesses which were profitable at an operating level in 2019, while its food delivery companies reported heavy losses.  For Adevinta the deal would instead be a transformational move allowing it to roughly double its size and offering eBay a stake in the combined entity, the sources said.

At the end of June, Starboard owned 2,090,000 eBay shares, down 73% from the 7,920,000 it owned at the end of the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing the firm made on Friday. The filing did not say when Starboard cut its stake.  Starboard did not respond to a request for comment.

Starboard also trimmed its position in software maker Commvault Systems Inc CVLT.O by 5% to own 4.36 million at the end of the quarter.

The unit has a price tag of around US$10bn, which could make it one of the largest leveraged buyouts of the year.  The bidders expected to have made it through include two consortia. One comprises Blackstone, Hellman & Friedman and Permira. The other includes trade buyer Prosus and buyout firm General Atlantic, while Apax could also be part of the group. Trade buyer Adevinta is also through to the next stage, sources said.  The second round of bidding in an auction process is due in early July, the sources said.

Bankers are working on debt financings totalling around 5.0-5.5 times the unit\u2019s approximate \u20ac400m Ebitda.  The debt financing is expected to comprise leveraged loans and high-yield bonds to maximise liquidity.

FILE PHOTO: The German headquarters of online marketplace eBay is pictured at Europarc Dreilinden business park south of Berlin in Kleinmachnow, Germany, August 6, 2019.

The combined company will have a presence in 20 countries, with Europe its biggest market. It will have an estimated revenue of $1.8 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) close to $600 million.  A source close to the deal said the Norwegian firm sweetened terms of its bid at the weekend by offering eBay a bigger stake, after the U.S. firm\u2019s board was initially split, with some members backing a $9 billion cash bid by online retailer Prosus.  Jamie Iannone, eBay\u2019s chief executive, backed Adevinta\u2019s proposal and persuaded the board of its merits, the source said.  Ryssdal told Reuters the coronavirus crisis had boosted digital marketplaces, with some Adevinta sites receiving more traffic in June than a year earlier, rebounding from a sharp drop in March.  Ryssdal, who said he intended to stay in the chief executive role, said Adevinta would look for more acquisitions after completing the eBay deal, adding the combined company \u201cwould be a great platform to do that.\u201d  Shares in Adevinta, which was spun out of Nordic media company Schibsted and listed on the Oslo bourse last year, jumped almost 40% after trading resumed.

The eBay Classifieds Group includes the Gumtree and Kijiji brands, and offers online ads to more than 1,000 cities around the world. The business posted an operating income of $83 million on revenue of $248 million in the first quarter of 2020.  The transaction, expected to close by the first quarter of 2021, targets $150 million-$185 million in annual savings on EBITDA within three years.  Most of the synergies are expected to come from IT, where eBay is much stronger, a person familiar with the deal said.  Schibsted said the deal meant its stake in Adevinta would fall to about 33% from 59%, but it would have 39.5% of votes.  Schibsted and eBay will appoint two directors each to the expanded board of nine, Adevinta\u2019s investor presentation showed.

Wenig added that he did not expect the landscape for ticket sales to get any better in the second half.  CFO Scott Schenkel also said he expects the stronger dollar \u2014 up 4 percent since the company\u2019s prior forecast \u2014 to hit revenue by $150 million for the full year.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jamie Iannone, eBay\u2019s chief executive since April, may have chalked up an early win for shareholders in the $41 billion e-commerce group. He\u2019s close to agreeing a $9 billion cash-and-stock sale of eBay\u2019s classifieds business to Norway\u2019s Adevinta, Reuters reported on Monday. Taking the buyer\u2019s richly valued paper holds risk, but also gives the U.S. group upside from consolidation in Europe.  Adevinta, which itself is only worth $8.5 billion, was last year spun out of Schibsted and is still majority owned by the Norwegian media conglomerate. It beat away rival bidders for eBay\u2019s sought-after online-listings business, which according to Reuters included Netherlands-listed tech investor Prosus and a private-equity consortium. Iannone\u2019s predecessor was pressured into the sale by activist investors including Elliott Management.  The price looks rich, at roughly 8 times the revenue Canaccord Genuity analysts expect the eBay unit to generate next year. To hit, say, a 10% return on its investment, Adevinta would need to pump up the acquired business\u2019s operating profit to roughly $1.1 billion, according to Breakingviews calculations which assume a 19% tax rate. Potential cost savings will help, as will having greater negotiating clout with advertising platforms like Alphabet-owned Google. Yet the business Adevinta is buying only generated $420 million of operating profit last year. More than doubling that seems like a hard ask, even if the pandemic boosts the number of people selling goods like wardrobes online.  The deal looks better from eBay\u2019s point of view. Iannone has secured a good valuation, and as-yet undisclosed slug of cash, for a business that\u2019s slower growing than peers. Admittedly, eBay shareholders will take on some of the risk that Adevinta\u2019s share-price collapses: it\u2019s currently valued at an eye-watering 9.5 times 2021 sales, using Refinitiv Smart Estimates. But that\u2019s probably a worthwhile trade. The European online-listings sector is fragmented, and ripe for consolidation. Adevinta itself might be taken over. Prosus, worth 137 billion euros, is a plausible acquirer of the whole business. Private equity groups such as KKR and Hellman & Friedman have also piled into the sector. EBay\u2019s classifieds auction looks like a good deal for the seller.","51":"July 24 (Reuters) - EBay Inc said on Wednesday it would launch warehousing and shipping service for merchants selling through its platform starting next year, a new strategy that is expected to attract more sellers to the e-commerce platform.

October to December revenue at the Oslo-listed online classifieds company was flat year-on-year at 200.2 million euros ($242.8 million), while analysts in a Refinitiv poll on average had expected a drop to 186.4 million euros.  Adevinta\u2019s business contracted sharply in the second quarter of 2020 as online sites for autos, real estate and jobs suffered amid Europe\u2019s first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns, but many users have since returned.  The company currently sees solid growth in revenue generated when people buy and sell items from home, but this is less profitable than other parts of Adevinta\u2019s business, such as housing ads, leading to pressure on margins this year, it said.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a big effect, but if anyone had thought our margins would rise a great deal, we\u2019re saying we don\u2019t think so,\u201d Chief Executive Rolv Erik Ryssdal told Reuters.  \u201cDigital habits are accelerating, and it\u2019s favourable to us that people become accustomed to carrying out online transactions,\u201d Ryssdal said.

Federal prosecutors in Boston said Philip Cooke, a former supervisor of security operations at eBay\u2019s European and Asian offices, and other employees harassed the couple through Twitter and sent them disturbing packages like a bloody Halloween pig mask.  The 55-year-old, who was previously a police captain in Santa Clara, California, was the third former eBay employee to plead guilty in the case. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit cyberstalking and conspiring to tamper with a witness.  Prosecutors have agreed to recommend a 30-month prison sentence for Cooke when he is later sentenced.  He is among seven defendants, including onetime eBay security executives James Baugh and David Harville, who prosecutors said targeted the couple in Natick, Massachusetts, with threatening messages and unwanted deliveries such as a box of live cockroaches and a funeral wreath.  Prosecutors said the defendants also sent pornography in the couple\u2019s name to neighbors and conducted covert surveillance in a bid to terrorize the couple and deter them from criticizing eBay.  They did so after two top executives expressed frustration with the newsletter, EcommerceBytes. The executives included former Chief Executive Devin Wenig, who a person familiar with the matter has said is the \u201cExecutive 1\u201d identified in court papers.  Prosecutors said Wenig texted the other executive after the newsletter\u2019s editor published an article about eBay, saying it was time to \u201ctake her down.\u201d  Wenig has not been charged and has denied knowing about the scheme.

EBay said active buyers grew 2% to 183 million in the quarter from a year earlier, but they remained unchanged from the third quarter.

Adevinta said online sites for autos and real estate led the recovery as lockdowns were lifted, but also warned that renewed restrictions on movements and general economic uncertainty could pose fresh challenges.  The Oslo-listed company\u2019s July-September revenue rose 1.6% year-on-year to 183.3 million euros ($216.64 million), in line with a preliminary Oct. 19 statement and beating the 16% drop seen in the April-June quarter.  \u201cThis shows our business model is in demand ... and how important we are to car dealerships and real estate agents,\u201d Chief Executive Rolv Erik Ryssdal told Reuters.  Still, growth still lags a long-term goal to expand by between 15% and 20% annually.

Banking giants UBS AG, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, which invest for retail and institutional clients, also purchased millions of new shares, the data show.  For these investors, the nearly 30 percent gain in eBay\u2019s share price in the first seven weeks of trading this year represents a sizable windfall that was likely fueled by behind-the-scenes moves of two activist hedge funds that also built stakes recently.  Elliott Management, one of Wall Street\u2019s busiest and successful activists, said in its regulatory filing that it made a new bet on eBay in the fourth quarter, listing call options on 8.5 million shares. In January, Jesse Cohn, a partner at Elliott and head of its U.S. Equity Activism, wrote to eBay\u2019s board to urge a sale of StubHub ticketing and its classified-ads business, forecasting that doing so could help push the stock price to as high as $63 a share in 2020. It closed at $36.32 on Thursday.  Starboard Value, another prominent hedge fund which has won more board seats through settlements than others, also built a stake and contacted management, people familiar with the move said, even though eBay was not listed on Starboard\u2019s filing.  Starboard did not respond to questions about the position.

The deal, announced in November 2019, will provide Viagogo and the eBay unit, StubHub, a market share of over 80% of UK's secondary ticketing market, and customers could lose out as a result of higher prices in particular and fewer options, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in a statement bit.ly\/2zrgWeE.  The CMA said an initial probe, launched in April, found that Viagogo and StubHub were \u201cclose competitors in an already very concentrated market with limited alternatives\u201d after looking into evidence from third parties and the companies\u2019 internal documents.  Viagogo will continue to work with the CMA during its review, the company said in an e-mailed statement, adding that it believed the combination is a \u201cgood move for customers worldwide\u201d.  The regulator said it may move the probe to an in-depth investigation if the companies failed to offer an undertaking over its concerns by June 18.  The CMA also said it had so far not seen evidence that Viagogo or StubHub would be more adversely affected by the pause on live events due to the coronavirus crisis compared to other companies.  Ebay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The regulator earlier this year had ordered StubHub to make changes to its British website after it was found to be misleading people about ticket availability, just months after Viagogo was pulled up for similar violations.

In a letter to the company\u2019s board, Elliott asked eBay to hive off its StubHub ticket sales business and eBay Classifieds Group as part of a plan the hedge fund says could double the company\u2019s value.  Starboard has also taken a significant stake in eBay and been pushing for changes including asset sales in the past few months, a source familiar with the matter said separately. Starboard did not respond to a request for comment.  Shares of eBay rose as much as 12 percent before trading up 5.7 percent at $32.78 early Tuesday afternoon. They had lost a quarter of their value last year.  Elliott, which owns a more than 4 percent stake in eBay, said the company\u2019s share price could reach $55-$63 by 2020 if it implemented the hedge fund\u2019s restructuring plan.  \u201cWhile we believe that execution missteps and unclear focus have impaired value, eBay is far from broken, and its future should be bright,\u201d Elliott\u2019s Jesse Cohn wrote, adding that his mother had built a successful business on eBay by selling jewelry for more than a decade.  EBay said it would review the proposal and is looking forward to engaging with Elliott.  \u201cThe eBay Board and leadership team regularly engage with our shareholders and value their input,\u201d the company said.  The online seller has been a target for activist investors before. Carl Icahn urged eBay to spin off payments unit PayPal in 2014, a move the company followed through on in 2015.  Elliott said StubHub on its own could be worth $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion and eBay Classifieds, which has an international footprint, could be sold or spun off and worth between $8 billion and $12 billion.  Elliott also asked for an initial meeting with the board to discuss its concerns and for the board to form an operations committee to execute on an improvement plan.  DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte said he agreed that restructuring could create more value for shareholders.

The company\u2019s shares rose nearly 7% to $41.60 in extended trading.  EBay, facing intense competition from Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc, has focused on its promoted listings program and payments business, as well as worked to make its platform simpler to use through the introduction of grouped listings and personal recommendations.  More than 940,000 sellers took advantage of the promoted listings, resulting in $89 million of advertising revenue during the quarter, the company said.  \u201cThe results show eBay\u2019s new revenue sources are working to fuel growth in the bottom-line profitability. The company\u2019s renewed focus on advertising and its new payments business are boosting sales, and that\u2019s enough for investors to get excited,\u201d said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.

REUTERS\/Beck Diefenbach\/File Photo  The program is currently in trial in the United States and Germany and is similar to Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O \"Fulfillment By Amazon\" service, or FBA, which allows merchants to rent space in warehouses worldwide so they can store inventory closer to customers.  It is poised to help eBay ship products faster, increasingly a key consideration of shoppers when they browse for items online. EBay sellers send about 1.5 million packages daily in the United States.  EBay, based in San Jose, California, held the mantle of being the top online destination for sellers before Amazon\u2019s marketplace gained traction over a decade ago with the help of FBA. That gave the Seattle company far more control over the shipping process.  While EBay long resisted growing its logistics footprint, Amazon raised the stakes further this April, announcing it would halve delivery times to one day via its loyalty club Prime, a service that costs U.S. members $119 per year. At the same time, improved logistics networks and high warehouse capacity made a delivery service more feasible for eBay.  Devin Wenig, eBay\u2019s chief executive, said the company was targeting free two-day shipping under the program.  \u201cWhat this is not about is us trying to win a fast shipping war,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cOur 182 million consumers shop on eBay because of the value and uniqueness of our inventory. We\u2019re not the one-hour delivery guys.

Wenig did not discuss how much eBay would spend on the service, known as \u201cManaged Delivery,\u201d but he said it can be a profitable business on its own right.  Sellers in the program will be charged a fee for warehousing and for shipping once an item is sold.

EBay has faced pressure from Starboard before, especially after the two sides agreed in early 2019 that Starboard would be permitted to help select one board member.
