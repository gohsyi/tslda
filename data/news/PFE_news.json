Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.  Following are reactions to the news.  Scientists\u2019 reactions:  ALEXANDER GINTSBURG, DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW\u2019S GAMALEYA INSTITUTE WHICH DEVELOPED RUSSIA\u2019S MAIN VACCINE CANDIDATE, SPUTNIK V  \u201cWe welcome the progress shown by our foreign colleagues in the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus. The more vaccines are available in the world, the better people will be protected.  \u201cPeople at high risk of infection - primarily medical workers - are already being actively vaccinated in our country. Production is being scaled up and new production sites are joining the process. In the near future we expect to publish interim results of the post-registration trial of the vaccine Sputnik V, the so-called Phase III trials. I am sure that its effectiveness level will also be high.\u201d  CLEMENS WENDTNER, CHIEF PHYSICIAN OF INFECTIOLOGY AND TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEAD OF THE SPECIAL UNIT FOR HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS LIFE-THREATENING INFECTIONS, MUNICH SCHWABING CLINIC, GERMANY  \u201cThis is remarkable, as many ongoing vaccination studies on COVID-19 currently only assume a success rate of at least 50%. In addition, it should be emphasized that a sharp end point has been defined - infection yes or no. Alternatively, with less high expectations of a vaccine, already attenuated disease courses, so-called mitigated courses, could be considered a success. In addition, the mRNA vaccination appears to be effective after only four weeks, which means that one does not have to wait long for protection.\u201d  WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, UNITED STATES  \u201cThis is a hint that these mRNA vaccines are likely to work, and there\u2019s at least one other. And they\u2019re likely to be safe, at least from this trial. So that\u2019s highly encouraging. The other thing that\u2019s highly encouraging is that science can now create a vaccine in a relatively short amount of time and test it, which gives a lot of hope for the future when these things happen again.\u201d  ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL, BRITAIN  \u201cThis vaccine needs to be stored at -80c. This could create major logistical challenges for mass treatment outside major urban areas and in low or middle income countries.\u201d  \u201cHowever, overall this is a huge step forwards in the fight against COVID-19. We will need to see whether updated versions of this vaccine are needed to protect people against new strains of the virus which might emerge in future.\u201d  RICHARD HATCHETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CEPI COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS  \u201cThese are hugely positive and encouraging interim results and are testament to the ingenuity and skill of the scientific community in advancing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. We commend Pfizer\/BioNTech on this historic interim result and the speed at which they have advanced through clinical development.  \u201cWe believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio.\u201d  PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, BRITAIN  \u201cThis news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general.  \u201cOf course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.\u201d  ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, BRITAIN  \u201cAt face value, this is exceptionally good news: a vaccine that is 90% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 and with millions of doses available by the end of the year.  \u201cHowever, the full data set on which the claim is based has not yet been released and so we don\u2019t know exactly what has been found.\u201d  LAWRENCE YOUNG, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK, BRITAIN  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to interpret the interim analysis, but it does appear very encouraging.\u201d  \u201cIn this... preliminary analysis there is a significant reduction in the COVID-19, and I interpret that to mean that ... individuals are not developing disease, but it doesn\u2019t tell us anything about whether people are getting infected or not.\u201d  JOHN MOORE, PROFESSOR AT WEILL CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE, NEW YORK CITY  \u201cI can see nothing problematic.\u201d  As for what this means for other vaccines, Moore said: \u201cModerna\u2019s is likely to work as well given the similar design and performance, and Novavax also, as it seems more potent. It\u2019s harder to judge about the other candidates.\u201d  MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, BRITAIN  \u201cThis cautiously sounds like an excellent result from the phase 3 trials, but we should remain a little cautious. The provisional findings are made available in a press release, and the study is ongoing. However, if the final results show an effectiveness of anywhere near 90% with response in elderly and ethnic minority populations, that is an excellent result for a first generation vaccine.  \u201cThis has been seen before \u2013 the rapidly-produced ebola vaccine generated very high levels of effectiveness and exceeded all expectations. Equally, billions of dollars and numerous clinical trials have struggled to produce any form of vaccination against HIV. Science can be unpredictable.\u201d  AZRA GHANI, CHAIR IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON  \u201cThese new results represent the first demonstration of substantial efficacy of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19 disease which is very welcome news. It is important to bear in mind that these are early results based on a relatively small number of cases. In addition, the efficacy estimate is based on seven days of follow-up of participants following the second dose; further data in the coming weeks and months will provide a better picture of longer-term vaccine efficacy.\u201d  WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES EXPERT AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, UNITED STATES  \u201cThe efficacy data are really impressive. This is better than most of us anticipated. I would have been delighted with efficacy of 70% or 75%. 90% is very impressive for any vaccine. The study isn\u2019t completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.\u201d  IAN JONES, PROFESSOR OF VIROLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF READING, BRITAIN  \u201cOf all the vaccines currently in development the BioNtech product always looked like the most bang-per-buck as it is entirely focused on the part of the virus that binds to the human cell, the receptor binding domain.  \u201cThe only things we will not know for some time is the longevity of the response in all age groups, but assuming antibody titres are high that should be at least as good as any other vaccine currently in trial.\u201d  JOHN BELL, REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHO SITS ON THE UK GOVERNMENT\u2019S VACCINE TASKFORCE, TOLD BBC RADIO:  \u201cI\u2019m really delighted with this result for no other reason than it shows you you can make a vaccine against this little critter. As you know, there are many pathogens where we\u2019ve tried for decades and never managed to get a vaccine, you know, malaria, HIV.\u201d  \u201cDistribution of this is going to be challenging, and there\u2019s a lot of complexities associated with that. But... that\u2019s not the headline here. The headline is, we\u2019ll solve those things if we need to. But... it rolls the pitch for other vaccines because I can\u2019t see any reason now why we shouldn\u2019t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease.  \u201cOur (Oxford\u2019s) first interim analysis is also likely to be available in the very near future, and by that I mean weeks, not months. So, I\u2019m pretty optimistic that given this result, we\u2019ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well.\u201d  \u201cWhen you look at the immunological responses you get from the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine and the ones from the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and indeed even the Moderna vaccine. They all look about the same. So, I\u2019m optimistic that that probably reflects similar levels of efficacy.\u201d  FLORIAN KRAMMER, PROFESSOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, USA  \u201cThese are fantastic results. The efficacy could be higher than expected, and this probably means that - at least in the U.S. - there will be an application for approval very soon. Of course, it would be better to see age-specific data, but I suspect that these will be published soon. Frankly, this is the best news I have received since Jan. 10.\u201d  MARYLYN ADDO, HEAD OF TROPICAL MEDICINE SECTION, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER EPPENDORF (UKE), HAMBURG, GERMANY  \u201cThese are interesting first signals, but again they are only communicated in press releases. Primary data are not yet available and a peer-reviewed publication is still pending. We still have to wait for the exact data before we can make a final assessment. At present, there are still few details about the exact data, for example regarding different age groups and in which groups the 94 cases occurred exactly.\u201d  BERND SALZBERGER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL REGENSBURG, GERMANY  \u201cIn the Pfizer\/Biontech press release, the Phase II\/III placebo-controlled observer-blinded study with the vaccine BNT162b2 reported a vaccine efficacy of over 90%. Although only a few events - a total of 94 cases - have been observed in the study so far, this is a very good result. No serious side effects have been reported - overall a very positive result, which will probably lead to an early approval.\u201d  GERD FAETKENHEUER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, CLINIC I FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL COLOGNE, GERMANY  \u201cThese are great and promising data. It is incredible that in such a short period of time this progress with the development of a vaccine and clinical trials within a few months has been achieved. The results on efficacy and safety so far are excellent.  \u201cI think this will have a major impact on our handling of the pandemic and I hope that large quantities of the vaccine will be available quickly. The researchers involved can only be congratulated\u201d.  DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON  In terms of the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201cit\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s not \u2018overnight success\u2019 good news\u201d.  Altmann cautioned that this and other potentially successful vaccines would still need to be approved and delivered to people across the world, and this will still take many months.  He added, however: \u201cI always felt optimistic, and my optimism remains strong.\u201d  Government reaction:  ITALIAN HEALTH MINISTER ROBERTO SPERANZA  \u201cToday\u2019s news about the anti-COVID vaccine is encouraging. But caution is still needed. Scientific research is the real key to overcoming the emergency. In the meantime, we must never forget that the behaviour of each of us is essential to bend the curve.\u201d  SWITZERLAND\u2019S HEALTH MINISTRY  \u201cWe welcome every advance made by the global efforts to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine. The federal government is working intensively to as quickly as possible to give the Swiss people access to a safe and effective vaccine. We\u2019ve signed two contracts already, with Moderna and AstraZeneca, and we\u2019re currently in negotiations with additional, promising vaccine makers.\u201d  Corporate reaction:  LUCIO ROVATI, CEO OF ITALY\u2019S ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, WHICH IS WORKING WITH TAKIS BIOTECH ON A COVID-19 VACCINE  \u201cThis is important news. Nothing that was not expected. Anyway, great, great. The problem remains that the data is limited in duration, 28 days after the first inoculation. The problem will be to see how long the coverage lasts. But in any case it is already very important to know that there is an effective vaccine, also because it seems a vaccine well tolerated in the medium term. At the end of November data at two months will be available, as required by regulatory agencies, and so at the end of November (the vaccine) could already be approved.\u201d  QUENTIN VIVANT, SPOKESMAN FOR FRENCH DRUGMAKER SANOFI  \u201cCongratulations to our Pfizer colleagues. We feel energized to move on and bring more vaccines to the world to fight against this pandemic.\u201d  Market reaction:  RUSSELL SILBERTSON, CO-HEAD OF DEVELOPED MARKET FX & RATES AT ASSET MANAGER NINETY ONE  \u201cIf the bearish view embedded in markets was that there was no effective vaccine any time soon priced in, clearly that needs significant repricing now.  \u201cYou couple (this morning\u2019s news) with the sheer weight of all the stimulus in markets, and that\u2019s a very strong economic upside scenario.\u201d  NIKESH PATEL, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, KEMPEN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LONDON  \u201cThis is the first news that allows governments to start planning ahead to when economies can properly start to reopen from lockdowns. That gives them more visibility and concreteness about what fiscal policy they can take.  \u201cMonetary policy can only go so far at this point and it needs to be a fiscal response for a real recovery and this kind of news is great as it allows governments to make that fiscal response without fear of endless support.\u201d  NEIL WILSON, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT MARKETS.COM  \u201cWhilst we are not there yet, news that this vaccine could be highly effective is the best thing markets could hope for. Public health officials will remind us there is a long road ahead, and many challenges will be faced along the way, but there is an enormous sense of optimism today \u2013 light at the end of the tunnel. Let\u2019s just hope the vaccine deniers won\u2019t get in the way, but 2021 just got a lot brighter.\u201d  KENNETH BROUX, FX STRATEGIST AT SOCIETE GENERALE  \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccine news adds to the positive risk tone in stocks and underpins high beta currencies vs the U.S. dollar. Any positive news on a vaccine is good news for the world economy and offers perspective for rebound\/normalisation in 2021 growth.\u201d  CARSTEN BRZESKI, GLOBAL HEAD OF MACRO, ING  \u201cThe bigger driver of the economic outlook is from the outside factors. Right now that means the development of a vaccine, which is why we are following news on this front closely.\u201d  \u201cThe base case we have already is that we are likely to get a vaccine by year-end and that it will be rolled out.

Pfizer announced that the final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective. But that had little effect on the dollar amid concern more monetary stimulus is to be expected from the Federal Reserve.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday there was \u201ca long way to go\u201d to economic recovery and a retail sales report released by the U.S. Commerce Department showed spending decelerating.  \u201cMarkets are mindful that the Fed is in play\u201d, said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets.  Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased 0.1% to 92.327 after dropping as low as 92.207, its lowest level since Nov. 9.  Bitcoin, sometimes regarded as a safe haven, or at least a hedge against inflation, rose to more than $18,000 for the first time in nearly three years. It last stood around $18,200, up over 3%.  The euro was rising about 0.1% at $1.186, apparently unconcerned that Poland and Hungary are blocking the European Union\u2019s 1.8 trillion-euro ($2.14 trillion) financial package to revive an economy depressed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  \u201cIt seems likely that in December ... the EU will accept a compromise on the breach of the rule of law so that both countries can then save face and still accept the EU budget and the recovery fund\u201d, Commerzbank strategist Antje Praefcke said. \u201cAnd all will live happily ever after \u2013 and therefore no reason to sell the euro.\u201d  Budapest and Warsaw vetoed the adoption of the 1.1 trillion- euro 2021-2027 EU budget and the 750 billion-euro recovery fund on Monday because the budget law included a clause that makes access to money conditional on respecting the rule of law.  On the Brexit front, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma said Britain hoped to get a Brexit trade deal but that the EU had to understand it was dealing with a sovereign nation.  The statement came after the Sun newspaper reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was told by British negotiators to expect a Brussels trade deal early next week, with \u201ca possible landing zone\u201d as soon as next Tuesday.  Sterling was rising about 0.2% to $1.3277, near peaks reached in early September.  British inflation picked up by more than expected in October, pushed higher by prices for clothing and footwear and food as coronavirus restrictions tightened in much of the country.  Amid the uncertainty over the global economic recovery, the safe-haven Japanese yen climbed to a one-week high.  At 103.95 per dollar, the yen came back to its Nov. 9 levels, recouping much of the losses it suffered last week after Pfizer announced it had developed a working COVID-19 vaccine.  China\u2019s yuan held near a 29-month high against the dollar, finishing at its highest since June 26, 2018, despite dollar buying by major state-owned banks in what some traders suspected was an effort to slow the Chinese currency\u2019s advance towards 6.5-per to the dollar.

U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's victory has boosted investors' risk appetite, with hopes of better global trade ties supporting central Europe even as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, keeping some caution in markets. The mood was lifted on Monday when Pfizer and BioNTech said their experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data from a large study. Currencies and stocks immediately advanced, with the Prague bourse hitting a more than seven-week high and sitting on course for its biggest one-day gain since early April. The zloty was up 1.1% to 4.463 to the euro at 1334 GMT, its strongest since Oct. 12. It also got a boost from Poland's central bank meeting on Friday, where rate setters held steady on policy. Before that the bank had postponed its meeting, leading some to speculate it might announce further measures to combat the effect of the pandemic. Warsaw stocks rose 3.9% to their highest in a over two months. Budapest reversed losses and rose 3.5%. The Hungarian forint also recovered and climbed 0.5% to 357.08 per euro, a one-month high. Hungary gave a reminder of the fast spread of COVID-19 seen since the summer ended, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban announcing on Monday new lockdown measures, like closing secondary schools and restaurants. The Czech Republic has had Europe's highest infection rate but showed on Monday some signs of stabilisation as its daily tally of new cases on Sunday was the lowest in four weeks. The crown jumped to its strongest since early September, testing the technical 26.40 per euro level before edging back to 26.47, up 0.5% on the day. It has gained 3.7% since Oct. 28.

Fed chair Jay Powell and ECB President Christine Lagarde said the economy was still in for a tough time even if the development of a potential vaccine by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer PFE.N and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX.O was reason for some optimism further ahead.  \u201cFrom a huge river of uncertainty, we see the other side now,\u201d Lagarde said in a panel discussion with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey.  \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be exuberant about this vaccination because there is still uncertainty\u201d about the production and distribution of the vaccine, she said.

With the euro zone likely heading back into recession this quarter, the ECB has already said it would provide more stimulus in December, most likely through its pandemic emergency bond buying programme and through more favourable loans to the bank sector.  The U.S. economy has recouped just over half the 22 million jobs lost since businesses began reopening after the first shutdowns in March, supported both by extraordinarily easy Fed policy and the first tranche of about $3 trillion in pandemic relief.

The company, however, is lagging rivals Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc in the race for a vaccine to combat the COVID-19 pandemic that has infected about 75 million people globally.  J&J's study, named Ensemble, is being conducted by its unit Janssen, the drugmaker said here in a statement.  While seven countries have already authorized the emergency use of Pfizer and German firm BioNTech\u2019s candidates, Moderna\u2019s rival vaccine was set for regulatory authorization this week in the United States.  J&J also said it plans to submit an emergency use authorization application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February if the data from the study is safe and effective.  The company had earlier this month announced cuts in enrollment for the vaccine trial from its original plan for 60,000, as higher rates of COVID-19 infections amid a worsening pandemic should generate the data it needs with fewer study subjects.  The Ensemble trial was paused for over a week in October after a patient developed an \u201cunexplained illness\u201d during the study. The company later said it would resume the trial after an evaluation found no clear cause for the illness.  A separate late-stage clinical trial of an investigational COVID-19 vaccine candidate by Janssen to explore a two-dose regimen was ongoing, J&J said.","13":"May 22 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * PFIZER BEGINS A PHASE 1\/2 STUDY TO EVALUATE RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (RSV) VACCINE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","14":"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa has secured millions of doses of Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Inc vaccines to fight the highly infectious COVID-19 variant that is dominant in the country, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday.

Ramaphosa said the economy had shrunk by 6% between the third quarter of 2019 and that of 2020, while unemployment \u201cnow stands at a staggering 30.8%,\u201d after 1.7 million jobs were lost.  South Africa had been pinning its hopes on the cheaper AstraZeneca vaccine. Emerging scientific evidence that it is less effective against the local virus variant than other vaccines led it to switch.South Africa\u2019s health minister on Wednesday suggested the government may sell doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine it may not need or swap them others.  \u201cWhile it should not delay the start of the vaccination programme by much, it will affect the choice of vaccines and the manner of their deployment,\u201d Ramaphosa said, referring to the switch away from the AstraZeneca shot.  The J&J vaccine requires just one shot, while the Pfizer\/BioNTech option is a two-dose regimen.  REVIVING A RUINED ECONOMY  Ramaphosa outlined a plan to revive Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy, with a massive programme of building or revamping ports, container terminals, energy generation and transmission, water, transport and telecoms.  He also outlined plans to tackle South Africa\u2019s dire energy shortages - which had plunged the economy into recession before the pandemic - by greatly expanding capacity, especially in renewable power.  It was unclear how the government would fund the ambitious plans.  South Africa is deeply in debt, and the Treasury expects a budget deficit of 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the financial year ending March 2021. Ratings downgrades by Moody\u2019s and Fitch late last year, putting its debt deeper into junk, will drive up borrowing costs.  The government will seek bids for 2600 megawatts (MW) of solar and wind power to plug generation shortfall estimated by power utility Eskom in the coming weeks, he said.  Another round of bids will be invited in August 2021, he said, adding that this will be over and above the power procurement plans already announced.  Due to its reliance on coal power, South Africa is one of the world\u2019s major CO2 emitters. Critics say it has been slow to transition to renewable energy, despite huge interest from foreign providers.  \u201cEskom, our largest greenhouse gas emitter, has committed in principle to net zero emission by 2050,\u201d Ramaphosa said.","15":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Friday it could file in late November for U.S. authorization of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing, suggesting that a vaccine could potentially be available in the United States by the end of the year.  That timeline makes it unlikely, however, that a vaccine will be available before the U.S. election, as President Donald Trump has promised. Pfizer, which is developing the vaccine with German partner BioNTech 22UAy.F, said that it may confirm if the vaccine is effective as soon as this month but that it also needs safety data from a 44,000-person clinical trial that will not be available until next month.  The Pfizer news, published in a letter from its chief executive on its website, lifted the U.S. stock market and the company's shares. Shares fell slightly of rival vaccine maker Moderna Inc MRNA.O, which is close to Pfizer in its vaccine development.  \u201cSo let me be clear, assuming positive data, Pfizer will apply for Emergency Authorization Use in the U.S. soon after the safety milestone is achieved in the third week of November,\u201d Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said, noting that he published the letter to provide greater clarity on the timeline for the vaccine.  People around the world are counting on a vaccine to control the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed more than a million people and ravaged the global economy.  Fears of delays were raised after trials for two rival vaccines were put on hold in the United States in recent weeks.  Trump has said repeatedly that there would be a vaccine available before the Nov. 3 election.  When asked about the Pfizer news, White House spokesman Judd Deere said, \u201cThe president continues to be optimistic that we will have one or more vaccines very soon, before the end of the year.\u201d  The U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program has spent billions of dollars on development of vaccines and treatments. It has signed a deal to buy Pfizer vaccine shots if they work.  FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured outside Pfizer Headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., July 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo\/File Photo  But the rush to develop a vaccine has raised concerns that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, acting in haste, might not conduct an adequate review.  U.S. health officials have sought to assuage those concerns. Earlier this month, the FDA formalized a requirement that the vaccine-makers collect two months of safety data on one-half of trial participants.  Pfizer has been trying to demonstrate that its decision-making is being driven by science rather than politics, Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan said.  \u201cJust getting it to the market is only a small part of it,\u201d Divan said. \u201cPeople should actually be willing to take it.\u201d  Rival vaccine-maker Moderna could also apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA) this year. It has said that it may have interim data on its 30,000 person trial as soon as November.  Both companies are also applying for approval in Europe, where they are racing against AstraZeneca PLC AZN.L. AstraZeneca's U.S. trial has been on hold since September, while another U.S. trial of a candidate from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N was paused earlier this week.  After the FDA announced the two-month requirement on Oct. 6, which was approved by the White House but undercut the likelihood of a vaccine before voters go to polls, Trump called the move a \u201cpolitical hit job.\u201d  In addition to safety and efficacy, the FDA will also examine Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing operations for the vaccine.  A BioNTech spokeswoman confirmed the time frame for the possible EUA application to the FDA.  Pfizer\u2019s shares were up 3.5% in afternoon trading, while BioNTech\u2019s U.S.-listed shares were up 3.9%.

Spot gold slipped 2.2% to $1,908.55 per ounce by 1302 GMT, while U.S. gold futures fell 2.2% to $1,908.90. Earlier spot prices climbed to their highest since Sept. 16 at $1,965.33, driven by a weak dollar amid hopes for more stimulus following Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. elections. Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE , the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, said they expect to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for the drug later this month. \"There's some belief that this is going to be a driver for economic growth as we come out of the pandemic situation, so it's positive news for the world, but negative news for gold,\" said independent analyst Ross Norman. The news prompted sharp gains in stock markets, and set Wall Street up for a record. However weakness in the dollar index , which held close to an over 10-week low, kept gold above the key $1,900 level. Alexander Zumpfe, a precious metals trader at Heraeus, said in a note that while the reaction to the vaccine report had come as no surprise, nothing had changed in the medium-term positive outlook for the metal. \"Interest rates will remain low to negative for the foreseeable future - this makes gold still attractive for investors,\" he said. Unprecedented stimulus and near-zero interest rates globally, which cut the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets, have driven gold about 25% higher this year, given its status as a hedge against currency debasement and inflation. Elsewhere, silver slid 3.3% to $24.74 per ounce. Platinum fell 1.4% to $876.20, while palladium dipped 1.5% to $2,452.71.

An overnight recovery is impossible, let alone overnight growth that exceeds pre-COVID levels.  \u201cThe rally that began in earnest as Biden became the presumed winner of the U.S. presidential election is now the strongest two-week rally during an election contest in history.  \u201cNow that a vaccine can stop COVID-19, the Fed is likely to stop its unlimited support doctrine and this will pull the rug from what\u2019s been supporting gains in equities.\u201d  PAUL CRAIG, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT QUILTER INVESTORS  \u201cThis vaccine is not a silver bullet. Many of the issues facing developed economies now are structural and a vaccine is not going to prevent the large scale unemployment we are likely to see as a result of the lockdowns of earlier this year.  \u201cFor now, however, it is a positive and the companies benefiting certainly represent a \u2018reopening trade\u2019 of some sorts. This means the laggards of the past few months, the likes of hospitality and airlines, are up significantly, while the mega-cap tech stocks are flat.  \u201cIndeed, some winners of the pandemic are seeing underperformance now as demand for them is likely to be hit.

It then falls on states and certain large cities to start administering the vaccine to local hospitals and nursing homes. Hospitals are expected to start vaccinating their employees as early as Monday.  The CDC panel discussed clinical considerations for certain patients like pregnant women and people with severe allergies, who were not studied in clinical trials, but the panel did not formally vote on these considerations.  Officials presenting at the meeting said that while there is not yet data on how the vaccine may impact pregnant women, pregnant women could decide for themselves whether or not to be vaccinated and should consult with their doctor.  They said that pregnant women should take acetaminophen, more commonly known by its brand-name Tylenol, if they get a fever after vaccination, which is one of the vaccine\u2019s side effects, as fevers can pose risks to pregnancy.  In the same section of the meeting, officials also said patients with severe allergies to vaccines should not get it at this time. A fact sheet about the vaccine, released with its FDA emergency use authorization, also says that patients with a history of anaphylaxis due to severe allergies should not get the vaccine.  Experts on the call discussed how to refine language of what qualifies as a severe allergic reaction to ensure that only those who are at risk are excluded from vaccination.  Various experts cautioned that data still needed to be collected and their advice about who should get it may change as more information becomes available.","23":"FILE PHOTO: Robert J.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said on Friday it was considering the judgment and remained committed to pursuing cases involving \u201cmisuse of market power\u201d.  \u201cThe ACCC brought this appeal because it was concerned that Pfizer\u2019s use of its market position as supplier of the top selling branded atorvastatin immediately before generic products were able to enter the market harmed the competitive process and therefore consumers,\u201d Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.  The drug Lipitor generated annual sales of more than A$700 million ($530 million) for Pfizer in Australia before the company\u2019s patent expired there in May 2012, the Commission said when it launched the case against Pfizer in 2014.  The Commission had alleged that Pfizer had offered big discounts and rebates on Lipitor to pharmacies that bought up large quantities of the drug and agreed to limit re-supply of competing generic atorvastatin products.

Ibrance is Pfizer\u2019s blockbuster treatment and is already approved as a combination with endocrine therapy for use in breast cancer patients. The treatment brought in sales of $933 million in the first quarter of 2018.

That can lead to life-threatening damage to the heart, and over time, death, often at a young age.  Pfizer\u2019s six-patient study tested two different dosages of the gene therapy in boys in the age group of 6 to 12.

Pfizer said it had paused enrollment in the study and then modified the study protocol in order to mitigate future risks of similar safety events.  The company said future trials will use the higher dose, which had triple the concentration of virus with genetic material. The U.S. drugmaker said it also may test an intermediate dose.  Both of the boys who required hospital treatment had received the higher dose.  One had developed a kidney injury.

Since Britain approved Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine last week, taking pole position in the global race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history, the focus has shifted to how quickly other countries could move and when the shots would be available to the public.  \u201cIf I used the UK as an example, we got approval at 1 a.m. in the morning, we approved the release of the vaccine and shipped it within 24 hours,\u201d Sean Marett, chief business and chief commercial officer for BioNTech told Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC).  Health Canada is expected to approve the vaccine within \u201cthe next week\u201d, a top official said on Thursday. Canada expects the first 6 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna Inc to arrive in the first quarter of 2021, enough for three million of Canada\u2019s 38 million population.  The Pfizer and BioNTech contract with Canada requires the two drugmakers to distribute the vaccine, which needs to be kept at around -75 degrees Celsius. Marett said he does not see distribution of the vaccine as a challenge at that low temperature in countries as vast as Canada or the United States because it is not a new technology.

So far, the country has reported 408,921 cases and 12,589 deaths. That has made vaccine roll-out a top priority for the government.  \u201cThis is a bit like the biological equivalent of a moon landing,\u201d Marett said.

Speaking from Copenhagen, he said supplies were expected to be very limited in the early stages and countries must decide who gets priority, though the WHO said there is \u201cgrowing consensus\u201d that first recipients should be older people, medical workers and people with co-morbidities.  Britain approved Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted the green light from Britain\u2019s medicine authority as a global win though he recognised the logistical challenges of vaccinating an entire country of 67 million.  U.S. and EU regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval.  The WHO said on Wednesday it had received data from Pfizer and BioNTech on the vaccine and was reviewing it for \u201cpossible listing for emergency use\u201d, a benchmark for countries to authorise national use.","50":"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d that the country\u2019s medicines regulator had formally authorised the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use, a move that he said would get the economy moving again.  \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that the MHRA has formally authorised the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine for Covid-19,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThe vaccine will begin to be made available across the UK from next week.  \u201cIt\u2019s the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again.\u201d  England\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said it would take until spring to fully vaccinate the vulnerable population who wish to receive the jab.","51":"(.)  BERLIN, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s most populous state of North-Rhine Westphalia said on Wednesday it will delay the opening of new vaccination centres to Feb. 8 due to a temporary slowdown of deliveries of vaccines from Pfizer and its German partner Biotech.  Pfizer started delivering shots in the European Union at the end of December but announced on Friday there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost output.  German Health Minister Jens Spahn said he was annoyed by the short notice of the delays: \u201cIt is not easy for us... We can only vaccinate with that which has been delivered.\u201d  Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of Germany\u2019s 16 states agreed on Tuesday to extend for another two weeks a lockdown for most shops and schools until Feb. 14.  The North-Rhine Westphalia health ministry said the delays were forcing it to push back by a week the opening of 53 vaccination centres which will start offering shots to the over 80s, with no more first shots possible for the coming week.  The region has already vaccinated around 350,000 people and will add another 30,000 by the end of the week, the ministry said. Hospitals and care homes will resume vaccinations on Feb. 1 with 80,000 doses planned for that week.  The spread of the virus has slowed in Germany in recent weeks, with rise in new cases up by 15,974 to 2,068,002, but down from the 19,600 reported a week ago. However, the death toll rose by 1,148 to 48,770, above the week ago increase.  Spahn said the figures were going in the right direction, noting that there were 800 fewer patients in intensive care than a week or two ago, but this was not the time to relax controls.  \u201cThe goal is to get the figures down enough so they are manageable in the longer-term and in parallel ramp up vaccination,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: A small shopping basket filled with vials labeled \"COVID-19 - Coronavirus Vaccine\" and a medical sryinge are placed on a AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken November 29, 2020. Picture taken November 29, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Ilustration  Once seen as the frontrunner in the development of a vaccine against the coronavirus crisis, the British team was overtaken by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, whose shots - with a success rate of around 95% - were administered to UK pensioners on Tuesday in a world-first hailed as V-Day.  Detailed results from the AstraZeneca\/Oxford trials have been eagerly awaited after some scientists criticised a lack of information in their initial announcement last month.  However, the Lancet study gave few extra clues about why efficacy was 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose.  \u201c(This) will require further research as more data becomes available from the trial,\u201d the study said.  Less than 6% of UK trial participants were given the lower dose regimen and none of them was aged over 55, meaning more research will be needed to investigate the vaccine\u2019s efficacy in older people who are particularly susceptible to COVID-19.  Pooling the results, overall efficacy was 70.4%, the data on Tuesday showed. That is above the 50% minimum set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech and from Moderna have reported efficacy levels of more than 90% in late stage trials.  But the AstraZeneca\/Oxford vaccine is seen as particularly important to tackling the pandemic in the developing world, as it would be cheaper and easier to distribute.  \u201cThe basic message: that the overall efficacy across the trials that are reported here is about 70% but with a clear description of its uncertainty,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  \u201cThe statistical uncertainty is that the efficacy could be as low as 55% or as high as 80%. The Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines both have efficacies above 90% and are clearly more efficacious under trial conditions.\u201d  Asked whether the half, then full dose regimen had been a mistake, Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group and chief investigator into the trials, told a news conference it had been \u201cunplanned.\u201d  NEW TRIAL?  Mene Pangalos, head of AstraZeneca\u2019s non-oncology research and development, said requests for regulatory approval around the globe could still be submitted this year.  \u201cWe hope that once the regulatory authorities review the data, we can get approval any time from the completion of the submission, which could be any time from the end of this year to early next year,\u201d he said.  However, Pollard conceded the different results from the two dosage regimens complicated matters.  \u201cThe regulators will decide exactly what their label should say,\u201d he said, when asked whether regulators might approve the two full shots regiment first, and then potentially the half, then full, shot regiment when more data is in.  Pangalos also said he assumed U.S. regulators would want to see results from an ongoing trial in the United States before giving their approval.  He left it open whether a costly new trial was needed, as the company previously said was likely, because more infections in the ongoing trials may provide the needed clarity.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet decided on what a next study would be, if we do a next study ... we will decide in due course.\u201d  SAFETY FIRST  Pfizer on Tuesday cleared the next hurdle in the race to get its vaccine approved for U.S. emergency use after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released documents that raised no new issues about its safety or efficacy.  The Oxford researchers, in turn, said their vaccine was found to be safe, with three out of the roughly 23,700 participants experiencing serious conditions that were possibly related to either the COVID-19 vaccine or a standard meningitis vaccine given to a control group.  A case of a serious neurological illness, transverse myelitis, was reported 14 days after a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot, which was \u201cpossibly related to vaccination,\u201d they said.  This case had led to a seven-week trial suspension in the United States and to brief halts in trials in other countries.  A case of fever above 40\u00b0C occurred in South Africa, but it was not disclosed whether this participant received the vaccine because the person recovered quickly and is continuing the trial without knowledge of the shot received, as is the norm.","53":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines on Saturday with aid from the World Bank, which said it would monitor the inoculation drive to ensure the shots go to those most in need.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  About 28,500 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine landed at Beirut airport, the first of 2.1 million doses set to arrive in stages throughout the year.  Doctors hope this will ease the pressure on hospitals, battered over the past year by a financial crisis and a port explosion and now fighting some of the region\u2019s highest infection rates.  In its first operation funding the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, the World Bank reallocated $34 million from an existing health project in Lebanon to help launch the vaccination programme.  \u201cWe will MONITOR fair and transparent distribution to PRIORITY groups,\u201d Ferid Belhaj, its regional vice president, wrote in a tweet. He said health workers and the elderly would be first in line, warning against favoritism.  Caretaker health minister Hamad Hassan told reporters it was a \u201cdream come true\u201d that the first vaccines had arrived nearly a year after Lebanon detected its first case of the virus.  He pledged the vaccines would eventually reach everyone, seeking to dispel fears that politicians would try to jump the queue.  \u201cTHE BEST GIFT\u201d  Firass Abiad, head of Rafik Hariri hospital, said its medical staff would get their shots within 24 hours.  \u201cThe best gift one can ask for on Valentine\u2019s day,\u201d he said on Twitter on Saturday.  The country has also booked 2.7 million doses through the global COVAX scheme for poorer countries and officials say talks are underway for some 1.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  The total number of doses ordered so far would cover about half of Lebanon\u2019s population of more than six million, which includes at least a million Syrian refugees.  Hassan has said Lebanon\u2019s president, parliament speaker and premier would get some of the first vaccines to boost morale.  Nearly a month into a strict lockdown that has cut off livelihoods and fuelled protests, the government began lifting some restrictions this week. Still, most businesses are closed and a 24-hour curfew remains in effect.  Since January, a surge in infections has flooded Lebanon after lax measures during Christmas. The outbreak took the nation\u2019s total death toll to almost 4,000.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 - news which lifted global markets with a wave of risk appetite. The dollar's rise on Monday of 0.5%, analysts said, was caused by investors quitting long positions in other major safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies, near its previous session's highs, as market participants declined to push it further in light of uncertainty about how or when a vaccine could be rolled out. \"Today is a little bit of a cool off from what we've seen in this past couple of days,\" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. \"I don't mind a little bit of a breather. November has been very, very interesting.\" Neil Jones, head of FX sales for financial institutions at Mizuho, said he expected the risk-on moves to hold. \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over and don\u2019t think the foreign exchange market will become completely skeptical,\" he said. \"We need more clarity in terms of the distribution, quantities, timeline, and to whom,\" Jones said. \"On balance, that optimism will remain for now.\" The dollar had lost around 1.4% this month until Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the U.S. presidential election became apparent over the weekend. The Japanese yen, which had its biggest one-day fall since March after the vaccine announcement, was little changed Tuesday morning in New York at 105.34 yen to the dollar. The yen had initially clawed back some of its from the day before. The Swiss franc gained marginally, with the dollar rising 0.1% to 0.915 francs after Monday's 1.5% gain. \"Following a euphoric market reaction such as that the question that now arises is whether it was justified or possibly exaggerated,\" wrote Commerzbank FX and EM analyst You-Na Park-Heger in a note to clients. Euro-dollar was broadly flat at $1.1813. In the previous session, it rose to as high as $1.192, but went no further, which Mizuho's Jones said could be due to the European Central Bank having signalled its awareness of the downsides of rapid euro strength. \"The market is a little bit concerned about repeat verbal intervention in the euro around the 1.20 area so I think sellers maybe dropped their offers down lower than that 1.20, thinking that that might be the limit of the upside,\" Jones said. The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - was off nearly 0.3% versus the dollar, giving back its jump in the immediate aftermath of the vaccine news.. The New Zealand dollar was off 0.1% and poised to end its streak of seven consecutive session of gains . China's offshore yuan, which has been gradually strengthening since May, was flat on Tuesday after hitting 2.5-year highs versus the U.S. dollar on Monday..

Footage posted by the National Health Service (NHS) showed boxes containing doses of the vaccine being delivered to Croydon University Hospital in south London and being stored in a special, securely locked fridge.  \u201cThis is just so exciting. It\u2019s a momentous occasion,\u201d said Louise Coghlan, joint chief pharmacist at the Croydon health service. \u201cTo know that they are here and we are much the first in the country to actually receive the vaccine, and therefore the first in the world, is just amazing. I\u2019m so proud.\u201d  The first doses are set to be administered on Tuesday, with the NHS giving top priority to vaccinating the over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents.  Britain gave emergency use approval for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech last week - jumping ahead in the global race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history.  In total, Britain has ordered 40 million doses. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.  About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Initial doses that have arrived from Belgium are being stored in secure locations across the country, where they will be quality checked, the health ministry said.  The rollout coincides with a crucial and perilous moment in negotiations between Britain and the European Union on a post-Brexit trade agreement.  A status quo transition period will end on Dec. 31 and a no-deal scenario would lead to major disruptions in the movement of goods between Britain and EU countries such as Belgium.  The Observer newspaper reported on Sunday that, under UK government contingency plans, tens of millions of vaccine doses could be flown to Britain by military aircraft to avoid delays at ports caused by Brexit.  The government declined to comment on the Observer report. Farming and environment minister George Eustice, asked on Sky News about concerns of Brexit-related disruption and whether the Observer report was true, said there would be no disruption.  \u201cA huge amount of work has gone on to maintain the flow of goods at the border in the event of there being a no-deal Brexit and we\u2019ve also got contingency plans in place, including a government-procured ferry that\u2019s on standby and of course the option, should it be needed, to use air freight too,\u201d he said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  QUEEN TO BE INOCULATED  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge. For that reason, it will first be administered in 50 hospitals.  NHS England has written to community doctors, telling them to get ready to start giving vaccinations from Dec. 14. Groups of local doctors will operate more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country, the government said.  Boxes of the vaccine contain five packs of 975 doses, but special regulatory approval is needed to split them up. A senior medical official has said that while he was hopeful it would be possible to split the packs and deliver straight to care homes, it was not guaranteed.  With high levels of vaccine scepticism worrying public health experts, the Times and Mail on Sunday newspapers reported that Queen Elizabeth, 94, and her husband Prince Philip, 99, would \u201clet it be known\u201d when they had received the shot.  The queen is highly admired in British society, and her public backing for the vaccine would be a powerful message to counter anti-vaccination misinformation circulating online.","60":"FILE PHOTO: A logo for Pfizer is displayed on a monitor on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 29, 2019.

It had previously said the meeting could be as late as Dec 29.  While EMA\u2019s mandate is to issue recommendations on new medical treatments, the European Commission has the final say on approval and typically follows EMA\u2019s advice.  EMA said its expert meeting was brought forward after the companies had provided more data, as requested, and the EU Commission would fast-track its procedures to rule on approval \u201cwithin days\u201d.

The statement was also signed by the health ministers of Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and EU neighbour Switzerland.  TOUGH CHRISTMAS  Rising infection rates and tighter lockdown measures in many European nations have added to the pressure on the EMA to act as quickly as possible and cast a shadow over the Christmas celebrations.  The EMA added any approval would come with a safety monitoring plan, manufacturing controls, an investigation plan for use in children and binding obligations by the manufacturers to provide more efficacy and safety data.  Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada on Dec. 9 and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Dec. 11.

Liam McBurney\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  Canada is the third country after Britain and Bahrain to give the green light to Pfizer Inc\u2019s vaccine, developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE.  Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in parliament it was \u201ca good day for Canadians\u201d.  \u201cWe will see 30,000 vaccines begin to arrive next week with many more on the horizon, but ... we\u2019ve got a tough winter to get through,\u201d Trudeau said.  Canada is in the midst of a virulent second wave of the pandemic, with several areas of the country imposing new health restrictions, weighing down what had been a clear rebound after the first wave.  General inoculations for all Canadians will begin in April after priority populations are taken care of, the government said in a vaccination plan also released on Wednesday.  The nation is now \u201cwell-positioned to immunize 100% of the population in 2021,\u201d the plan said, while a separate table distributed by the Health Ministry said immunization could be completed by the end of September.  \u201cIt is going to be good for Canada and the world economy once the vaccinations start rolling out in a meaningful fashion,\u201d said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corp in Toronto.  Toronto\u2019s stock market has rallied about 12% since the end of October and the commodity-linked Canadian dollar has climbed to a 2-1\/2-year high against its U.S. counterpart as investors bet that the rollout of vaccines would boost the global economy next year.  The vaccine, which the regulator said was \u201csafe, effective and of good quality,\u201d was approved under an interim, accelerated drug review system very similar to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s emergency use authorizations.  It comes a day before a panel of advisers to the FDA is set to review and recommend whether the U.S. agency should authorize use of the Pfizer vaccine.  On Tuesday, British citizens became the first in the world to get the shots outside of clinical trials following last week\u2019s UK approval.  In a large, late-stage trial, the vaccine was shown to be 95% effective at preventing illness, far better than originally anticipated.  However, on Wednesday Britain\u2019s medicine regulator advised that people with a history of significant allergies not get Pfizer\u2019s vaccine after two people reported adverse reactions on the first day of its rollout.  Responding to questions on the allergic reactions, Health Canada officials said that is always a risk with vaccines and that they will monitor developments. They only are recommending that people who have previously had adverse reactions to any of the vaccine\u2019s ingredients not take it for now.  \u2018HISTORIC MOMENT\u2019  The province of Saskatchewan said on Wednesday it expected to receive enough doses for 1,950 people by Tuesday, intended first for healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients.  Quebec expects to have received 55,000 doses of the vaccine by Jan. 4, the premier of the predominantly French-speaking province, Francois Legault, said.  Legault also said he is weighing new restrictions and stepping up enforcement of current ones.  Alberta will begin vaccinations on Wednesday, with health care workers getting the first 3,900 doses, Health Minister Tyler Shandro said.  British Columbia will also have about the same number of doses as Alberta next week, but did not specify when it would begin vaccinating people. The province said it expects to vaccinate 400,000 people by the end of March.  As of Tuesday, Canada had reported 429,035 total cases, an increase of 5,981 on the day before, and 12,867 deaths.  \u201cToday\u2019s decision from Health Canada is a historic moment in our collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and is a major step towards returning to normalcy in Canada,\u201d Cole Pinnow, president of Pfizer Canada, said in a statement.  Canada has a firm order for 20 million doses of the vaccine, enough to inoculate 10 million people, with options to buy up to 56 million more. Pfizer will ship its vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage, to warehouses across Canada.  For the most part, provincial and territorial health systems will administer the shots, for free. They will have final say over how to use scarce early supplies in their jurisdictions.  Priority groups who will get vaccinated first include some healthcare workers, long-term care residents and employees, the elderly and Indigenous populations, according to federal guidelines.  Regulators have received rolling applications for three other experimental vaccines, from Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.  The Moderna vaccine is farthest along, having completed pivotal trials showing it to be 94.1% effective at preventing illness and 100% at preventing severe COVID-19.  Officials have said they expect to receive 6 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines before the end of March. Each vaccine requires two doses given about three weeks apart.  FedEx Corp and Innomar Strategies, a Canada-based unit of U.S. drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp, have been hired to provide logistical support on vaccine delivery.","65":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday that final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective, adding it had the required two-months of safety data and would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days.  The final analysis comes just one week after initial results from the trial showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing similar effectiveness.  MARKET REACTION: Equity markets strengthened slightly on the news. Europe\u2019s STOXX 600 and U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures both hit session highs. However, the moves were small compared to the jump after Pfizer\u2019s previous announcement. The reaction in European government bonds and in currencies was muted.  Pfizer shares were 2.6% higher in U.S. morning trade at $36.98 and U.S.-listed shares of partner BioNTech SE were up 3% at $89.61.  COMMENTS  PROFESSOR ARTUR SUMMERFIELD, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, HEAD OF IMMUNOLOGY, SWISS INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY  \u201cWith mRNA technology, the obvious advantage is that great quantities of vaccine can be produced quickly, without the use of cell cultures and other potentially toxic substances.  \u201cGenerally, the results published so far show that there\u2019s a good antibody reaction, as well as a good cellular immune response.

STEPHEN EVANS, PROFESSOR OF PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE & TROPICAL MEDICINE  \u201cThis ... is very good news indeed. There are now rather more data accrued with, it is said, no serious side effects.  \u201cIt seems there is some evidence that in older adults...there is also very good efficacy with minimal side effects.

The detail on achieving 94% protection in the elderly participants in the trial is particularly excellent news.  \u201cWe will need to wait and learn over time how long the protection lasts, and to see whether this vaccine can also prevent transmission \u2013 meanwhile, this vaccine does look likely to have a strong role immediately once it is approved in protecting health workers and the vulnerable from disease.\u201d  LUCIO ROVATI, CEO, ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, ITALY  \u201cThese percentages are very high and extremely promising. Remember for caution that this effectiveness refers to only one month after the first vaccination. We still do not know how long the protection will last, but other new data on \u2018immunological memory\u2019, which vaccines could improve, bodes well.  \u201cIt\u2019s very positive also the fact that the tolerability is good.\u201d  ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE, UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH  \u201cWe can be fairly confident now that the RNA (vaccine approach) is looking good...That\u2019s also good for the Imperial College vaccine, which is an RNA vaccine.

REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  Privately-held BioNTech will receive $120 million upfront plus up to $305 million depending on certain development achievements as well as tiered royalties on futures sales in the double-digit percentage range, the two companies said in a statement on Thursday.  Mainz-based BioNTech, valued at $2.3 billion in a January financing round, is specializing in so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that instruct human cells to produce therapeutic proteins or to launch an immune response.  The emergent field has seen drugmakers such as AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Sanofi partner up with biotech firms.  \u201cmRNA vaccines offer a novel approach to code for any protein or multiple proteins, and the potential to manufacture higher potency flu vaccines more rapidly and at a lower cost than contemporary flu vaccines,\u201d said Kathrin Jansen, the head of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine research and development unit.  Flu jabs are currently produced from chicken eggs based on the previous flu season\u2019s viral strains. The alliance partners hope to offer a vaccine that can be quickly adjusted to the latest viral mutations, which can also be a major advantage in case of a pandemic threat from avian flu.  Pfizer will take over testing on humans and commercialization of BioNTech\u2019s flu vaccines once the German firm, which is Europe\u2019s largest unlisted biotech firm by staff numbers, has completed the first clinical study.  Having raised $270 million from investors early this year, BioNTech is also developing personalized immunotherapies for cancer and is eyeing a future public listing.  The company competes in the race for mRNA therapies with groups such as Massachusetts-based Moderna Therapeutics, Belgium\u2019s eTheRNA and domestic rival CureVac.

Its late-stage 30,000 participant testing began on July 27 in the United States. It finished enrolling participants in October.  - The company slowed enrollment in September to increase the diversity of the trial population. It ultimately enrolled 3,000 Black American participants and more than 6,000 Hispanic participants.  - The vaccine candidate is being tested at 100 clinical research sites in the United States.  - Moderna\u2019s U.S. trial was the first under the government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program and is funded by Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health.

FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York, U.S., April 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  Tibor Klein, 44, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Joan Azrack in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, according to federal prosecutors. He had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud last July.  \u201cWhile Mr. Klein\u2019s conduct was indeed serious, in light of a number of related factors, we are disappointed by the sentence of incarceration,\u201d his lawyer Christopher Bruno said in an email.  Klein, the founder of Valley Stream-based Klein Financial Services, was also sentenced to six months of house arrest and 250 hours of community service, and ordered to forfeit $37,225 and pay a $20,000 fine, according to prosecutors.  The government said Klein was tipped about New York-based Pfizer\u2019s Oct. 2010 takeover of King by Robert Schulman, then a partner at the Hunton & Williams law firm in Washington, D.C., who had represented King in patent litigation since 2009.  Klein then bought King securities for himself, Schulman and clients, and passed the tip to his friend Michael Shechtman, a Florida stockbroker, resulting in more than $400,000 of overall illegal profit, prosecutors said.  Schulman, of McLean, Virginia, was convicted of insider trading last March by a Brooklyn federal jury. He had been a partner at the Arent Fox law firm in Washington, D.C. at the time of his arrest, and was later put on leave.  Shechtman, a former Ameriprise Financial Inc stockbroker, pleaded guilty in Brooklyn in November 2014 to conspiracy, and has cooperated with prosecutors. He has not been sentenced.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed related civil charges against Klein and Shechtman in September 2013. That case was put on hold until the criminal case was resolved.  Although the SEC did not sue Schulman, it alleged that he had become intoxicated on several glasses of wine while dining at home with his wife and Klein in August 2010, and blurted out: \u201cIt would be nice to be King for a day.\u201d  Klein took the hint and bought 60,600 King shares, including 800 for himself and 3,000 for Schulman, on the next trading day, the SEC said.","81":"FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020.

While thousands of individual changes have arisen as the virus mutates on replication and evolves into new variants, only a tiny minority are likely to be important or change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal.  Among coronavirus variants currently most concerning for scientists and public health experts are the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants, which appear to spread more swiftly than others.  British Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said current COVID-19 vaccines would probably still protect people against infection with the new variants, but this would need to be closely monitored.  \u201cIts very unlikely that the current vaccine won\u2019t be effective on the variants ... especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalisation,\u201d Zahawi told Sky News.  \u201cAll manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others, are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant - there are about 4,000 variants around the world of COVID now.\u201d  Ravi Gupta, a professor of microbiology at Cambridge University, said Zahawi had misspoken and was referring to individual mutations, not variants.  \u201cThe number of mutations has little actual relevance as many mutations emerge and disappear continuously,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cScientists are using \u2018variants\u2019 to describe viruses with mutations that are transmitting in the general population \u2013 there aren\u2019t 4,000 of those.\u201d  The so-called British variant, known as VUI-202012\/01 or B.1.1.7., has mutations including a change in the spike protein that the coronavirus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor - meaning that it is probably easier to catch.  \u201cWe have about 50% of the world\u2019s genome sequencing industry, and we are keeping a library of all the variants so that we are ready to respond - whether in the autumn or beyond - to any challenge that the virus may present and produce the next vaccine,\u201d Zahawi said.  VACCINE RACE  The COVID-19 pandemic has killed 2.268 million people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, according to a Reuters tally.  Israel is currently far ahead of the rest of the world on vaccinations per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the United States and then Spain, Italy and Germany.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca are combined in a two-shot schedule. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.  The trial will examine the responses to an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca\u2019s, as well as vice versa, with intervals of four and 12 weeks.  The trial will be the first of its kind to combine a mRNA shot - the one developed by Pfizer and BioNtech - and a adenovirus viral vector vaccine of the type developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca\u2019s shot is separately being trialled in combination with another viral vector vaccine, Russia\u2019s Sputnik V.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccine could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility, and might even increase immunity.  Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said mixing different shots had proven effective in Ebola vaccine schedules, and though the new trial mixed vaccine technologies, it could also work.  \u201cUltimately, it all comes down to the same target - cells making the spike protein - just using different platforms,\u201d he told reporters.  \u201cFor that reason we do anticipate that we\u2019ll generate a good immune response with these combinations.\u201d  Public Health England\u2019s head of immunisation, Mary Ramsay, said there was a lot of precedent for such work, as vaccines against Hepatitis A and B were interchangeable from two different manufacturers, and similar work has been undertaken for human papillomavirus (HPV).","84":"","85":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand have received their first COVID-19 vaccine deliveries and will begin rolling out inoculations in the coming week, while populous cities of Melbourne and Auckland remained locked down following the emergence of new cases.

In New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the first batch of 60,000 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines had arrived and would undergo safety checks before border workers start receiving vaccinations from Saturday.  \u201cThis will be the largest full-scale vaccination campaign in this country\u2019s history,\u201d Ardern said.  \u201cWe have purchased enough vaccines to cover all New Zealanders and to do so for free.

Victoria, Australia\u2019s second-most populous state, reported one new case on Monday, taking the total in the cluster linked to the quarantine hotel to 17. The most recent is the mother of a three-year-old child who tested positive a day earlier.  The leader of Victoria said it was too early to say if the five-day lockdown would end as planned on Wednesday evening. Its over 6 million residents are required to stay home except for essential shopping and work, caregiving and outdoor exercise.  The Australian Open tennis tournament, being held in the state capital of Melbourne until Feb. 21, has barred spectators until the end of the lockdown.  Across the Tasman Sea, Auckland\u2019s nearly 2 million residents were plunged into a new three-day lockdown on Sunday, prompting Australia to suspend a travel bubble with New Zealand.  Auckland\u2019s lockdown is the first in six months for New Zealand, after a hard shutdown early in the pandemic appeared to have largely eliminated local transmission.  New Zealand was ranked the best performing nation among almost 100 in an index by Australia\u2019s Lowy Institute based on containment of the coronavirus.  Australia came in at number 10 as border closures and lockdowns in both countries successfully contained the spread.

That compares to under 29,000 cases and 909 deaths in Australia.","86":"(Reuters) - Student medics, retired doctors, pharmacists and soldiers are being drafted into a European COVID-19 vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale, beginning just after Christmas.  As coronavirus cases continue to rise in a pandemic that has killed nearly half a million Europeans, the EU announced on Thursday that a bloc-wide inoculation campaign would begin on Dec. 27, four days after European authorities are expected to give approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres emptied by lockdown measures will become venues for mass inoculations.  In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will spring up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring.  Faced with a shortage of health professionals able to give the shot, many countries are on a recruitment drive. German states are calling on retired medics and company doctors to join the push, in some cases offering up to 140 euros ($170) an hour.  \u201cThis will probably be the biggest mass vaccination campaign in history, certainly of our century and our generation,\u201d Domenico Arcuri, Italy\u2019s special commissioner for the COVID emergency, told reporters at a launch of national plans.  A phased-in approach means frontline healthcare workers and elderly residents of care homes are being prioritised, with most national schemes not reaching the general public until the end of the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest.  The goal of the 27-member European Union is nonetheless to reach coverage of 70% of its 450 million people. The European Commission, which struggled in the early months of the crisis to persuade national capitals to work together, is calling for the inoculation drive to be coordinated across borders.  \u201cThis is a huge task. So let\u2019s start rapidly with the vaccination together, as 27, on the same day,\u201d Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week.  On Thursday she confirmed the start date for the whole bloc would be Dec. 27. In a sign of the impatience of some member states, Germany had already announced that date on Wednesday.  BOTTLENECK CONCERNS  Britain, which quit the EU this year, was the first country to deploy the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outside of clinical trials, giving it emergency approval two weeks ago. It said nearly 140,000 people received their first shots in the first week of roll-out.  It is introducing a new national protocol allowing midwives, physiotherapists, pharmacists and others to give the shot.  \u201cThis will help ensure we have the workforce needed to deliver a mass COVID-19 vaccination programme, in addition to delivery of an upscaled influenza programme, in the autumn,\u201d a government consultation document said.  National rules vary by country. In France the injection must take place in the presence of a doctor. In Germany it can be administered by someone else as long as the patient can consult a doctor first.  There is a concern social distancing rules and paperwork could create bottlenecks at inoculation venues such as Berlin\u2019s Velodrom sports hall or the Hamburg trade hall.  Some countries face extra hurdles. Portugal is establishing separate cold storage units for its Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira; non-EU member Norway is buying doses from neighbouring Sweden.  Armies in countries including Switzerland and Italy are set to help secure vaccine supplies, while in Germany the Bundeswehr - already involved in contact-tracing - is on standby to help with injections if local regions need it.  With surveys showing many Europeans remain wary of taking a vaccine developed in record time, authorities are accompanying the push with information campaigns.  Stefano Boeri, the architect behind Italy\u2019s primrose-themed pavilions, said the spring flower was picked to \u201cconvey a sign of serenity and regeneration\u201d.  \u201cIf the virus has locked us in hospitals and homes, the vaccine will finally bring us back into contact with social life and the nature that surrounds us.\u201d","87":"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Prime Minister Ana Brnabic received Serbia\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccine shot on Thursday, kicking off a mass inoculation drive with doses developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.

The drugmaker\u2019s chief executive, Albert Bourla, used a visit by the U.S. president to the company\u2019s largest manufacturing facility to announce that he expects to more than double the around 5 million doses per week the company currently provides to the U.S. government.

During the visit to the Michigan plant, Biden challenged the company to deliver even earlier the 300 million doses of the vaccine it has agreed to supply by the end of July, and the company is looking for ways to speed production, Bourla said.  To that end, Pfizer said that by the end of the year it will add manufacturing capacity in Michigan, raw material production capacity both in Michigan and Connecticut, and add production lines to put vaccine into vials in Kansas. It has also engaged two U.S. contract manufacturers to help produce the shots.  Biden also stressed vaccine production standards during the tour, as he encouraged Americans to get vaccinated. \u201cI just toured where it is being made,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes more time to do the check for safety than make that vaccine.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued the guidance on its website after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the way for a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech.  Many employers have said they are considering mandatory vaccines amid a nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases that could lead to some businesses being shut down or limiting their operations.  The EEOC said companies that choose not to have vaccines administered at the workplace can require employees to provide proof that they received a vaccination without violating the Americans with Disabilities Act.  But the law only permits employers to ask workers why they have refused to be vaccinated if the information is \u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity,\u201d the agency said.  Workers who refuse to be vaccinated because of medical conditions or religious beliefs cannot be excluded from the workplace, the EEOC said, unless an employer finds that there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation.  Working from home, wearing a mask or being reassigned to a more secluded work area could all qualify as reasonable accommodations, depending on the circumstances.","106":"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson might be persuaded to take a COVID-19 vaccination on television to show it is safe but he would not have one before those in greater need, his press secretary said on Wednesday.  FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson leaves Downing Street, in London, Britain December 1, 2020. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls  Johnson, 56, who spent time in intensive care earlier this year after contracting COVID-19, has hailed the UK approval of Pfizer Inc\u2019s vaccine as a global win and ray of hope amid a pandemic that has hurt the economy and upended normal life.  But, like other leaders, Johnson cannot be seen to be jumping the queue for the vaccine, ahead of more vulnerable people. However, he wants to illustrate its safety to try to persuade others to take it when it is more widely available.  Asked if the prime minister would take the shot live on television, press secretary Allegra Stratton said she had not asked him directly.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be something he would rule out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think we also know that he wouldn\u2019t want to take a jab that should be for someone who is extremely vulnerable, clinically vulnerable and who should be getting it before him.\u201d  Johnson has said the shots would be voluntary, and a snap YouGov poll found that 20% of Britons were either not confident or not very confident that it was safe. There was support for the health minister Matt Hancock getting a shot live on TV, with 66% backing the idea.  Britain\u2019s government has said the health service will prioritise vaccinations, putting older residents in care homes and their carers first, then all those over 80 and frontline health workers.  Johnson has spoken openly of his struggle with COVID-19 in April, saying he fought for his life and that it was 50-50 whether the doctors were going to put him on a ventilator.  He said his weight was an underlying condition that made his condition worse and has since spoken frequently about his attempts to lose the pounds. Stratton said she did not know whether his weight might put him in a more vulnerable group, adding that he has been exercising more.  Johnson\u2019s spokesman also said it was a matter for Buckingham Palace whether 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth received a vaccination. A palace spokesman declined to comment on whether the queen would get a shot, saying royal medical matters were traditionally kept private.  The queen and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, who would be in the second priority tier for a vaccine, have spent national lockdowns this year with a small number of staff at Windsor Castle to the west of London.

Some countries were believed to be withholding some vaccines for fear of a shortage for the required second dose, meant to be administered three weeks after the first vaccination.  Pfizer said last week it would have to reduce deliveries of the shots to Europe until early February in order to upgrade production capacity for a later output boost.

GLOBAL VACCINE SPRINT  AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna Inc are among the drugmakers seeking advanced approvals for their vaccines, which are increasingly being seen by governments as the only way to stop the pandemic.  AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, called \u201cCovishield\u201d by Serum Institute, has less stringent storage requirements and is expected to be easier to distribute and faster to scale up in low-income countries.  But it is also facing queries from scientists over the robustness of some of its trial data, which showed a 1.5 dose regimen delivered more than 90% efficacy and a full two-dose regimen just 62%, both administered over two stages.  Britain and some other nations have pressed on with plans to roll out the AstraZeneca vaccine, while the Philippines and Thailand secured millions of doses, giving the shot a vote of confidence.  AstraZeneca said two weeks ago that it could launch an additional trial to evaluate the lower dose regimen, but Serum Institute has said it would continue to test only the two full doses as it would delay trials.  Poonawalla has said here the company will first focus on supplying the vaccine in India before distributing it to other countries, pricing it at 1,000 rupees per dose ($13.50) for private markets.  Serum Institute has also said an emergency-use approval could preface a full rollout by February or March.","110":"(Adds details about Pfizer drug, background)  ZURICH, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Novartis has nabbed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s breakthrough therapy designation for its experimental medicine capmatinib as it joins Pfizer in the race to treat a tough-to-treat mutated lung cancer type.

Dozens of drugmakers and research groups have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which has killed more than 1.3 million people, shuttered businesses and left millions out of work around the globe.  Below are the main details of the vaccine and progress on supply deals and potential approvals:  TYPE  - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the new coronavirus, thereby creating immunity.  - mRNA relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines.  - The new technology has not been approved for any vaccines so far; Pfizer and BioNTech have already collaborated to develop influenza vaccines based on mRNA.  DOSAGE AND EXPECTED COST  - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment.  - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay.  PROTECTION DURATION  - BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year. Scientists do not know how long the effect will last.  DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE  - The European Medicines Agency said on Tuesday that if its experts have received enough data from Pfizer about the candidate vaccine against the coronavirus, the agency would complete its reviews by Dec. 29.  - Canada could approve Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u201caround December\u201d, a senior official at Canada\u2019s drug regulator said on Thursday.  - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a \u2018fast track\u2019 status in mid-July.  - The European Medicines Agency said in November Pfizer and BioNTech had submitted data from large-scale trial of their potential COVID-19 vaccine for the agency\u2019s rolling review, but had not yet applied for approval.  - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and it ran clinical trials in April.  - Testing of the vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month.  TRIALS  - Trials are continuing globally in 154 locations, including in Germany, Japan, Brazil and in several locations within the United States in participants aged 12 years and older.

And we\u2019re within weeks of getting it... Could be three weeks, four weeks.\u201d  Earlier this month, top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN that most experts believe a vaccine will be ready by November or December. \u201cIt is conceivable that you can have it by October, though I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s likely.\u201d Other experts say a scientifically credible vaccine will not be available until early 2021.  Trump bristled at tough questions from uncommitted voters and ABC News host George Stephanopoulos during the town hall meeting, arguing that his decision to impose travel bans on China and Europe had saved thousands, if not millions, of lives.  He also defended Americans who have shunned face masks and social distancing guidelines, and said even experts like Fauci had changed their views about those practices during the crisis.  Trump has faced criticism for holding large-scale campaign events in Nevada and other states - events that his adviser Fauci has described as \u201cabsolutely\u201d risky.

Trump said the United States had a number of cases because it did more testing that other countries.

The vaccine was on Monday shown to be 90% effective, based on preliminary trial results, a major milestone in the war against a virus that has killed more than a million people and battered the world\u2019s economy.  Richardson said at an earlier event on Tuesday that even though the German group had received some public-sector funds, the product price would partly reflect the risks taken by its investors.  The company on Tuesday also said it would use special thermal shipping boxes to transport vials once they are taken out of ultra-low temperature storage.  The vaccine, which belongs to a class known as messenger RNA, will have to be shipped and centrally stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said on Monday.The thermal boxes would preserve the ultra-low temperatures for up to 10 days for ambient temperatures of up to 25 degrees Celsius without opening them and up to 15 days if the boxes are opened and then re-iced, BioNTech said in presentation slides.  As previously announced, the vaccine can be kept for up to five days at fridge temperatures.  During the analyst call on Tuesday, Sahin said participants on placebo in a control group could at some point no longer be denied the vaccine when its efficacy is further confirmed.  But for lack of a placebo group, longer-term insight could still be gleaned afterwards by using general infection statistics among the non-vaccinated population as comparison.  \u201cThis might give us indirect evidence ... by comparison of epidemiological data, how this long-term protection could evolve,\u201d he said.","123":"LONDON (Reuters) - Reckitt Benckiser's RB.L decision to drop its pursuit of Pfizer's PFE.N consumer health assets leaves it with a tough job to restore growth to its flat-lining business.  FILE PHOTO: Products made by Reckitt Benckiser stand on a shelf in a store in Brighton southern England, July 21, 2010.REUTERS\/Luke MacGregor  With a deal off the table, investors will turn their attention to Reckitt\u2019s internal challenges, including the integration of Mead Johnson, the ailing baby formula maker it bought for $17 billion last year, and reigniting sales growth.  \u201cThe market has been used to Reckitt being the company that consistently delivered ahead-of-market volume growth and last year they didn\u2019t,\u201d said Reckitt shareholder Steve Clayton at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cThey really need to pick the crown up and get it back on their head.\u201d  Reckitt has forecast 2 to 3 percent like-for-like sales growth for 2018, after no growth in 2017.  The British consumer goods company was in the running for some of the consumer health brands, including painkiller Advil, being sold by Pfizer.  Many investors saw the attractiveness of the assets, but worried about Reckitt\u2019s ability to fund and manage a deal that could have reached $20 billion so soon after buying Mead Johnson.  Following news late on Wednesday that Reckitt had abandoned the auction - after Pfizer rejected its bid for some of the assets - its shares jumped 6 percent as investors breathed a sigh of relief there would be no dilutive issue of equity or new distraction for senior management.  Since October, when Pfizer announced it was exploring options for its consumer health unit, Reckitt\u2019s shares had fallen 21 percent, in part on concerns about a possible deal.  Even after Thursday\u2019s gain, the stock is only trading at 16 times forecast earnings, below its five-year average of 19.  \u201cWe caution on being too optimistic over the prospects of a quick fundamental turnaround of the core businesses,\u201d said Barclays analyst Alex Smith. \u201cIn particular, we still see too many uncertainties around the cost and cultural change required to restore growth and competitiveness.\u201d  FUTURE DEALS  The Pfizer business would have made Reckitt the global leader in consumer health, a category supported by aging populations and growing interest in health and wellness. Becoming a leading player there has been the long-stated strategy of the company\u2019s chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor.  Some analysts praised Kapoor\u2019s financial discipline in walking away from Pfizer, as it did from a deal for Merck in 2014, but Bernstein\u2019s Andrew Wood was disappointed.  \u201cWhen Mead Johnson is fully integrated and RB\u2019s core business is back to health, we think that RB might regret having missed this once-in-a-decade acquisition opportunity for global consumer health leadership,\u201d he said.  With the consumer health market still very fragmented, there will be opportunities to grow in future, but it will be slower.  \u201cEx-Pfizer, these would now either need to be gestated organically, or acquired more painstakingly via sequential bolt-on deals,\u201d Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said.  Yet, if Pfizer decides to keep its business for now, Reckitt could be in a better position in a few years\u2019 time.  \u201cIf the sale falls through altogether and they get another couple of years to sort the balance sheet out, maybe it will be an opportunity in the future,\u201d Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Clayton said.","124":"LONDON (Reuters) - Margaret Keenan, the 90-year-old grandmother who became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine outside of a trial in Britain on Tuesday, has a message for others: \u201cgo for it\u201d to beat the devastating disease.  An early riser, Keenan, from Northern Ireland, received the Pfizer-BioNTech shot at her local hospital in Coventry, central England, at 0631 GMT, a week before she turns 91.  A video showed her being wheeled out of the ward while nursing staff clad in protective gear lined the corridor to applaud and cheer, an echo of moving video clips released through the year when COVID-19 survivors left hospital.  \u201cI say go for it, go for it because it\u2019s free and it\u2019s the best thing that has ever happened,\u201d Keenan told reporters as cameras flashed and television reporters asked questions.  \u201cIf I can do it, well, so can you,\u201d she told any doubters.  Known as Maggie to her friends, Keenan said she had stuck by the rules and spent most of the year on her own as the \u201cdevastating\u201d pandemic took hold.  The vaccine means she can start to look forward to spending time with her family and friends again.  Britain is the first Western country to start immunising its population in what has been hailed as a turning point in the battle to defeat the disease. It is the worst-hit country in Europe with more than 61,000 deaths.  \u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous at all,\u201d Keenan said, before discussing plans for her birthday.  Video footage showed the former jewellery shop assistant wearing a light blue mask, a grey cardigan and a blue T-shirt with a penguin in snow and the message \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d.  She received the shot in her left arm from nurse May Parsons, who has worked in Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) for 24 years.  \u201cWE WILL BEAT THIS TOGETHER\u201d  The mass inoculation will fuel hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has crushed economies and killed more than 1.5 million.

British Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Stephen Powis, medical director for NHS England, said they had both found it emotional watching the vaccine programme rollout. Hancock wiped away tears on live television.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  An 86-year-old British woman who will also receive the shot on Tuesday was choked with emotion as she recounted on the radio how she had had to grieve for her husband alone after he died with the disease.  She is looking forward to going to the shops and taking the bus again.  Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.  About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care home residents and carers, the over-80s and some health service workers the top priority to get them.

VIH\/SIDA  A partir de 2017, la mitad de todas las personas que viven con el VIH en todo el mundo est\u00e1n recibiendo tratamiento antirretroviral, tambi\u00e9n conocido como TAR (here).

Si bien las vacunas suelen ser virus inactivados o debilitados, \u201cel VIH inactivado no fue eficaz para provocar respuestas inmunitarias en los ensayos cl\u00ednicos\u201d y \u201cuna forma viva del VIH es demasiado peligrosa para usar\u201d.

A diferencia del SIDA, causado por virus de inmunodeficiencia humana, o COVID-19, causado por un nuevo coronavirus conocido como SARS-CoV-2, el c\u00e1ncer no suele ser causado por virus o bacterias, que es contra lo que las vacunas protegen al cuerpo (here).  \u201cNo existe una causa \u00fanica para el c\u00e1ncer\u201d, se\u00f1ala Stanford University Healthcare. En cambio, los cient\u00edficos creen que es la interacci\u00f3n de muchos factores juntos lo que produce c\u00e1ncer. Los factores involucrados pueden ser caracter\u00edsticas gen\u00e9ticas, ambientales o constitutivas del individuo\" (here).  Sin embargo, existen varios virus que pueden aumentar el riesgo de padecer ciertos tipos de c\u00e1ncer, como el virus de Epstein-Barr (EBV), el virus de la hepatitis B (VHB), el virus de la hepatitis C (VHC), el virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH), el virus del herpes humano. 8 (HHV-8), virus del papiloma humano (VPH) y virus de la leucemia de c\u00e9lulas T humanas (HTLV-1) ( here , here ).  La vacuna contra el VPH puede ayudar a reducir el riesgo de c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino y la vacuna contra la hepatitis B puede ayudar a reducir el riesgo de c\u00e1ncer de h\u00edgado (here).  Las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n peri\u00f3dicas, la pr\u00e1ctica de sexo seguro y no compartir jeringas o agujas son medios recomendados de prevenci\u00f3n de los otros virus mencionados.  En cuanto a las bacterias, la Sociedad Estadounidense del C\u00e1ncer dice que la infecci\u00f3n de est\u00f3mago a largo plazo con la bacteria Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) puede causar \u00falceras que pueden conducir al c\u00e1ncer con el tiempo (here).

Como consigna aqu\u00ed (here) Scientific American, los cient\u00edficos han estado buscando una cura para el resfriado com\u00fan desde la d\u00e9cada de 1950, cuando los rinovirus se identificaron por primera vez como una causa principal.  Con al menos 160 cepas diferentes de rinovirus solamente, \u201chacer frente al resfriado no es tanto buscar una soluci\u00f3n a un problema como tratar de dise\u00f1ar una llave maestra para abrir cientos de cerraduras diferentes a la vez\u201d, dijo Peter Barlow, inmun\u00f3logo en la Universidad Napier de Edimburgo en Escocia, a Scientific American.  LA VACUNA COVID-19  La vacuna COVID-19 apunta al SARS-CoV-2, el virus que causa la enfermedad (here).  Investigaciones iniciales sugieren que hay al menos seis cepas de SARS-CoV-2, pero que la tasa de mutaci\u00f3n es baja y el virus muestra poca variabilidad, lo que vuelve m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil desarrollar una vacuna ( here , here ).  En noviembre del 2020, las farmac\u00e9uticas AstraZeneca (here), Moderna (here) y Pfizer-BioNTech (here) anunciaron resultados exitosos de ensayos finales para sus respectivos candidatos a vacuna COVID-19. Los datos finales del ensayo de vacunas mostraron que las vacunas COVID-19 producidas por Pfizer-BioNTech y Moderna tuvieron una eficacia superior al 90% sin efectos secundarios graves ( here , here ).  Estados Unidos ha autorizado hasta la fecha dos vacunas contra el virus, una desarrollada por Pfizer Inc y su socio alem\u00e1n BioNTech SE, aprobada el 11 de diciembre, y otra de Moderna Inc, que recibi\u00f3 la luz verde el 18 de diciembre.  TIEMPO DE DESARROLLO DE LA VACUNA  En comparaci\u00f3n con el VIH, el c\u00e1ncer y el resfriado, la tasa de infecci\u00f3n por COVID-19 y el impacto econ\u00f3mico inmediato en la econom\u00eda mundial ciertamente contribuyeron a la velocidad del desarrollo de la vacuna (here).

Las vacunas deben pasar por una serie de etapas antes de ser aprobadas (here).  Ha habido un gran esfuerzo global para unir recursos con el fin de acelerar el desarrollo y la producci\u00f3n de la vacuna COVID-19 (here).  En abril de 2020, la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y sus socios lanzaron el Acelerador de acceso a herramientas COVID-19 (ACT) (here) , que reuni\u00f3 a gobiernos, cient\u00edficos, empresas, sociedad civil, fil\u00e1ntropos y organizaciones de salud mundial para apoyar la desarrollo y distribuci\u00f3n de pruebas, tratamientos y vacunas.  Como explica la OMS, en el caso de COVID-19, inversiones financieras y colaboraciones cient\u00edficas sin precedentes han hecho posible que algunos pasos en la investigaci\u00f3n y el desarrollo sucedan \"en paralelo\". Por ejemplo, algunos ensayos cl\u00ednicos est\u00e1n evaluando m\u00faltiples vacunas al mismo tiempo, aunque los est\u00e1ndares cl\u00ednicos y de seguridad se mantienen a pesar de la aceleraci\u00f3n de los procesos (here).

The New York-based drugmaker announced in July it would separate the Upjohn unit, which sells off-patent branded drugs, and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.O, allowing Pfizer to focus on its more profitable newer medicines.  Mylan will be able to leverage a strong base in Asia through Upjohn, whose headquarters Pfizer had shifted to China, a prime market for the older branded drugs with high name recognition such as Lipitor.

The blood clot preventer had sales of $1.01 billion in the quarter, above consensus estimates of $935 million. Prevnar sales of $1.49 billion topped Wall Street estimates of $1.39 billion.  The company expects mid-single-digit operational revenue growth post-2020 through 2025, Bourla said.  Two of Pfizer\u2019s U.S. rivals also reported first-quarter results on Tuesday.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, Allergan said the \u201cprimary basis\u201d for the claims against it was the alleged improper marketing and sale of Kadian, form of morphine, in the years before it gained rights to the painkiller in late 2008.  \u201cBut now that more than a thousand lawsuits seek to impose liability for that very marketing and sale, Pfizer has rejected any responsibility to indemnify Allergan,\u201d alleged Allergan Finance LLC, the subsidiary that filed the lawsuit.  Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment.  Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Drugmakers including Allergan, Purdue Pharma LP and Endo International Plc are facing a wave of lawsuits by state and local governments accusing them of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing.  At least 1,021 lawsuits are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, who has scheduled the first trial for March.  Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers pursuing the cases have compared them with the litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to 1998\u2019s $246 billion settlement.  In its complaint, Allergan said the bulk of the lawsuits it faces seeking to hold it responsible for playing a role in the opioid crisis primarily relate to improper marketing of Kadian and involve allegations dating back to the mid-1990s.  The drug at that time was owned by Alpharma Inc, which King Pharmaceuticals acquired in 2008, the same year King sold the rights to Kadian to Actavis. In 2016, Actavis acquired Allergan and took on the company\u2019s name.  Sale of rights to Kadian was a condition of winning U.S. antitrust approval for King\u2019s $1.6 billion acquisition of Alpharma. Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals in 2010.  Allergan argued that Pfizer under the terms of an agreement Actavis signed with King in 2008 was required to indemnify it for any damages arising out of the pre-2009 marketing and sale of Kadian.  But Allergan said that Pfizer, which has not been named as a defendant in the vast majority of lawsuits, has rejected its claim for indemnification.

Officials and healthcare professionals in France, Germany and Switzerland all pointed to yields short of six doses, adding to frustrations in countries already lagging vaccination campaigns in nations such as Britain and the United States.  The losses add up: For 200,000 vials of the two-shot vaccine, 600,000 people can be inoculated at six doses per vial, compared with 500,000 at just five.  The difficulties could also hinder Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s new production target of 2 billion COVID-19 shots in 2021, up from 1.3 billion previously.  The higher production forecast assumes health teams can draw that sixth dose from vials where this is permitted, thus stretching supplies.  In France, authorities acknowledge vials contain more than five doses, but early on advised health workers to aim for five. Some French experts said dose-maximising syringes were lacking.  In Switzerland, some officials said five doses had emerged as standard, given the challenges of yielding more of a vaccine they describe as thick and hard to handle.  \u201cFive doses from a vial has proven itself a reliable method,\u201d said Rolf Wirz, spokesman for the cantonal crisis management team in Basel-Land, in northwestern Switzerland.  Confusion over Pfizer\/BioNTech vial volumes emerged in December, when U.S. hospital pharmacists realised that preparing the vaccine, by mixing it with saline solution, yielded enough liquid for at least six 0.30 ml doses.  They initially threw the extra dose away, since vials were labeled for five.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration quickly updated its doses per vial guidance, with the European Medicine Agency following suit on Jan. 8.  Asked for comment, BioNTech said its 2 billion dose target was based on six doses per vial in those regions and countries where the practice is allowed by the regulator.  FIVE OR SIX?  France\u2019s health ministry originally aimed for five doses, but recently boosted its target to six per vial.  Even so, one French expert raised fears of shortages of small 1 ml syringes - designed to maximise vaccine extraction - as an obstacle.  \u201cThis is essential if we want to reach immunity targets quickly and before the new variants hit Europe even more,\u201d said Eric Billy, an immuno-oncology researcher. \u201cWe may have syringes, but we do not have the right ones.\u201d  The health ministry said, in response to those concerns, that it aimed \u201cto ensure that medical equipment is delivered that can allow for such extraction\u201d.  Germany offers a mixed picture: In the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, officials ordered 20.5 million 1 ml syringes and said they had enough to extract six doses.  In eastern Thuringia, however, Health Minister Heike Werner said doctors were finding that obtaining the sixth dose was only possible with about half the Pfizer\/BioNTech vials delivered.  Other nations are having greater success.  In Britain, officials forecast wastage of 10%, but said less was actually being discarded, helped by early recognition that extra doses were possible.  \u201cWe discovered we\u2019re able to get more out of the vials,\u201d said Mary Ramsay, Public Health England\u2019s immunisation head.  Danish authorities are even drawing a seventh dose, boosting optimism they\u2019ll exceed a two-month, 250,000-person inoculation goal.  In the Netherlands, pharmacists initially predicted first-round vaccinations would cover 33,000 doctors and nurses.  \u201cIt turned out to be 39,000 because they could get a sixth dose,\u201d said Kirstin Schimmel, a hospital pharmacist in Leiden, adding some hospitals using special syringes got seven doses.  Swiss regulator Swissmedic also advises a sixth Pfizer\/BioNTech dose is possible with \u201cappropriate syringes and careful handling\u201d.  Still, several Swiss cantons told Reuters they averaged less than six doses per vial. \u201cWhen possible, we draw six,\u201d said a cantonal health department spokeswoman in Zurich. \u201cFive remains the standard. The vaccine is thick and very challenging to handle.\u201d (Reporting by John Miller in Zurich, Matthias Blamont in Paris, Alistair Smout in London, Caroline Copley in Berlin, Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt, Francesco Guarascio in Brussels. Editing by Douglas Busvine and Mark Potter)","143":"(Repeats Thursday story with no change to text)  ZURICH, Nov 12 (Reuters) - This week has seen a flurry of good news from COVID-19 vaccine developers, with Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE trumpeting early data indicating their mRNA candidate is more than 90% effective.  A Russian project came out a day later, touting 92% efficacy for the Sputnik V candidate, named after the Soviet-era satellite, based on a smaller data set.  HOW DO MANUFACTURERS ARRIVE AT EFFICACY NUMBERS?  In Pfizer\u2019s case, it waited until 94 volunteers in its late-stage clinical trial of more than 43,500 people - half got the vaccine, the other half got a placebo - tested positive after developing symptoms.  For 90%-plus efficacy, no more than eight people among those who tested positive had received the vaccine, with the rest having received the placebo.  \u201cRoughly speaking, it\u2019s probably around eight to 86 cases in the treated and placebo groups,\u201d David Spiegelhalter, a Cambridge professor of risk and an expert in statistics, told Reuters.  \u201cYou don\u2019t need a lot of fancy statistical analysis to show that this is deeply impressive. It just hits you between the eyes.\u201d  In Russia, Sputnik V-developer Gamaleya Institute reached its preliminary 92% efficacy figure based on 20 illnesses in 16,000 volunteers as its late-stage trial progresses. It aims to reach 40,000 people.  Of the 16,000 people, about quarter got the placebo.  \u201cIt suggests that there is some effect, but it\u2019s insufficient to estimate the magnitude of it,\u201d Spiegelhalter said.  HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST GET SICK IN BIG VACCINE TRIALS?  Some experts say that, ideally, 150 to 160 people in a trial of tens of thousands of participants must get sick before making a reliable assessment of a vaccine\u2019s efficacy. That\u2019s a bit of a rule of thumb, though, open to interpretation.  \u201cThere is no such regulatory standard requiring X number of events for making a reliable decision,\u201d the government-funded Swiss Clinical Trial Organisation said. \u201cThe amount of (infections) has to be seen in relation to the disease and its risk profile. It\u2019s rather a case-by-case evaluation.\u201d  Typically, regulators strive to have at least 95% certainty that the trial read-out is not the result of random variations with nothing to do with the tested compound.  For trial sponsors there is safety in numbers as a large enough trial can ensure that 95% reliability hurdle is cleared.  But the larger the underlying clinical benefit, the fewer trial participants needed to create that clarity.  In Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s trial, they planned a final analysis when 164 people had become sick, with multiple, pre-planned interim analyses along the way. They skipped an analysis at 32 patients, and once they were ready to release a look at the 62-person mark, 94 had come down sick.  Details from the Russian trial are unclear, without access to its protocol.  HOW DO THESE RESULTS STACK UP TO OTHER DRUGS, OR VACCINES FOR OTHER ILLNESSES?  In normal drug trials, for diseases like terminal cancer, benefits of new medicines may be less apparent, with survival benefits of just a few months sometimes revolutionary for patients at death\u2019s door.  For vaccines, however, marginal protection is inadequate, and the World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy in trials, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants at least 50%.  The 90% efficacy reported in the Pfizer and Russian trials beats those, and appears to exceed that of typical flu vaccines, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate reduce the risk of sickness by 40%-60%.  For other shots, the CDC estimates the efficacy of a two-shot measles vaccine at 97%, and a two-dose chicken pox vaccine at 90%. Two doses of polio vaccine are 90% effective, rising to nearly 100% with a third.  CAN WE EXPECT EFFICACY RATES TO HOLD UP AS TRIALS ADVANCE?  Pfizer acknowledged on Monday that its final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. Still, Spiegelhalter said the study\u2019s design seems likely to generally hold up, based on the 94 sick participants.  \u201cIn this case, the effect is so huge, even if there is a little bit of fallback - if the effects become slightly smaller over time - that is very unlikely to be significant.\u201d  WHAT ABOUT REAL-WORLD EFFICACY, SHOULD THE VACCINES BE APPROVED?  The interim data is promising, since it appears to demonstrate that a vaccine can be effective in preventing COVID-19.  The jump to mass vaccinations, however, presents new hurdles, in particular for an mRNA vaccine like Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s that must be stored and shipped at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94\u00b0F).  Moreover, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires two doses, ideally 21 days apart. If people do not stick to the timetable, it may affect the vaccine\u2019s efficacy.  Protection against the mumps, for instance, drops from nearly 90% to 78%, if people don\u2019t get a follow-up shot.  Swiss epidemiologist Marcel Tanner, president of Switzerland\u2019s Academies of Arts and Sciences and one of the government\u2019s top COVID-19 science advisers, expects possible variations in efficacy among older people, whose immune systems wane with time, or those with immune disorders.  \u201cEfficacy says, \u2018Does it work?\u2019 Effectiveness says, \u2018Can it be applied? Can you carry the efficacy to the people?\u2019\u201d Tanner said. \u201cBut no question: 90% efficacy, at that stage, is a pretty good result.\u201d","144":"FILE PHOTO: The Chief Economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, listens from the audience at an event at the Bank of England in the City of London, London, Britain April 27, 2018.

The bloc will pay less than $19.50 per shot, a senior EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug\u2019s development.  The official requested anonymity as the terms of the agreement are confidential.  The United States agreed to pay $19.50 per shot for 100 million doses, a smaller volume than the EU. But it has an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately, and the price it will pay is unclear.  BioNTech signalled this week that order size would impact the per-dose price in the developed world and said it would differentiate pricing between countries or regions for its potential vaccine.  The EU official said the EU had agreed a price that was closer to $20 than to $10 but declined to give a precise figure.  Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment on the pricing. A spokesman for the EU Commission, which negotiates vaccine agreements on behalf of EU states, also declined to comment.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  In June, the European Investment Bank, the EU\u2019s financial arm, granted a 100-million-euro ($118 million) loan to BioNTech for the development and manufacturing of its COVID-19 vaccine, which was followed in September by another 375-million-euro funding by Germany\u2019s research ministry.  \u201cWith this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio, most of them in advanced trials phase,\u201d the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said, announcing the Pfizer deal.  The EU has already signed supply deals with AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson for their experimental COVID-19 shots, and is talking with Moderna, CureVac and Novavax to secure their vaccines.  Under the EU\u2019s deals with vaccine makers, the bloc offers a non-refundable down payment to companies in exchange for the right to book doses which EU states could buy at a pre-agreed price if the vaccine is approved as effective and safe by the EU drug regulator.  The Commission did not disclose the down payment made to Pfizer and BioNTech.  \u2018NO COPY PASTE\u2019 ON LIABILITY TERMS  The prices agreed by the EU in previous deals with vaccine makers have partly been influenced by liability terms, which could cause large additional legal costs if inoculated people developed unexpected conditions because of the shots.  Asked about liability clauses in the Pfizer contract, which have been a bone of contention between EU negotiators and drugmakers, the EU official said conditions were different from those the EU agreed with other companies, and also different from those Pfizer had with the U.S. government.  There was \u201cno copy paste\u201d on liability terms from previous contracts, the official said.  French drugmaker Sanofi, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline as a partner, has agreed with the EU a price of about 10 euros ($11.8) per dose and did not get any liability waiver, while AstraZeneca would pay claims only up to a certain threshold if something goes wrong with its vaccine in exchange for a price of 2.5 euro per dose, an official told Reuters in September.  Bad side-effects after a vaccine is approved are rare but are considered more likely in this emergency because of the unprecedented speed with which vaccines are being developed.  The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.","151":"FILE PHOTO: Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read leaves after appearing at a commons science committee hearing at Portcullis House in London May 14, 2014.

Read, 66, helped Pfizer weather patent expirations of several blockbusters, including cholesterol drug Lipitor, through dealmaking, expansion in emerging markets and cost cuts.  The drugmaker has since eschewed large, transformative deals because of confidence in the strength of its pipeline.  In July, Pfizer announced plans to spin off its off-patent branded drugs business and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.O, a move that will help the company focus on its innovative drugs that generate more profit.

Under the new agreement, Pfizer will deliver at least 70 million doses by June 30 and the rest no later than July 31, the company said on Wednesday, bringing the total number of doses to 200 million for a total price of about $4 billion.  The purchase price amounts to $19.50 per shot and is slightly higher than the $18.90 per dose that Reuters has reported the European Union has agreed to pay. The shot has been authorized for use in EU and the United States.  The U.S. deal comes after growing concern that the government had not done enough to secure doses of one of the two authorized vaccines, made more pressing amid a COVID-19 surge that has left hospitals struggling to find beds for the sick.  Pfizer\u2019s two-dose vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, is being rolled out across the United States after the shot won emergency use authorization earlier this month. The country has also authorized a vaccine from Moderna Inc.  Pfizer and the government have said that they had been negotiating the terms of the agreement, with the company indicating it was trying to work out how to deliver the doses in the second quarter.  Pfizer and BioNTech have said they expect to produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021, but executives at the German biotech have said they were trying to boost manufacturing. Governments around the world are scrambling to get enough supplies of the vaccine to tame the pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people globally and crushed economies.  \u201cThis new federal purchase can give Americans even more confidence that we will have enough supply to vaccinate every American who wants it by June 2021,\u201d U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.  \u201cSecuring more doses from Pfizer and BioNTech for delivery in the second quarter of 2021 further expands our supply of doses across the Operation Warp Speed portfolio.\u201d  Pfizer said last week it may need the U.S. government to help it secure some components needed to make the vaccine. While the company halved its 2020 production target due to manufacturing issues, it said last week its manufacturing is running smoothly now.  The government also has the option to acquire up to an additional 400 million doses of the vaccine.  More than 600,000 Americans have received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The first wave of shots have so far gone to healthcare workers and nursing home residents, as well as some top government officials.

In the meantime, the league remains focused on keeping players safe, recommending that they continue to mask and keep physical distance, he said.  The league will also continue its deep testing protocols, Sims added.  According to the league and the National Basketball Players Association, almost 9% of players tested positive before training camps opened earlier this month.

Across the whole of the United Kingdom, 1.3 million doses have been deployed.  The day after second vaccinations began, health officials said they would prioritise giving as many people as possible a first shot of a COVID-19 vaccine to offer some protection over the rollout of booster shots.  That means second shots will now be given up to 12 weeks after people receive their first shots, prompting criticism from some scientists, and frustration from people who have seen appointments cancelled.  While AstraZeneca\u2019s shot was tested with different intervals between doses, Pfizer has said there is no data to demonstrate the efficacy of its first dose after 21 days.

For transport to and at the site of administration it can be kept for up to five days at fridge temperatures, Sahin said, adding he was confident logistics would work very well.  \u201cBy December we expect more data (on the molecular stability), and if those results allow us to keep the vaccine in a fridge for longer than five days, maybe two weeks, that would again simplify things.\u201d","172":"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) chief said on Tuesday it hopes to have a COVID-19 vaccine by year-end and that Pfizer\u2019s experimental remedy is \u201ca very promising one\u201d, with more expected.  But the vaccine, based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, comes with special challenges as it needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below - equivalent to an Antarctic winter.

The results showed the drug in combination with, or as a follow-on treatment to, platinum-based chemotherapy could not achieve the primary goal of progression-fee survival in patients.

FILE PHOTO: An employee in personal protective equipment (PPE) removes vials of AstraZeneca's COVISHIELD, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine from a visual inspection machine inside a lab at Serum Institute of India, in Pune, India, November 30, 2020. Picture taken November 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas  India manufactures more than 60% of all vaccines sold across the globe, and while its $40 billion pharmaceutical sector is not yet involved in the production of the expensive Pfizer Inc and Moderna shots, the nation will play a pivotal role in immunizing much of the world.  Indian companies are set to produce eight, more affordable vaccines designed to fight COVID-19, including AstraZeneca's Covishield, called the \"vaccine for the world here\" by its developers.  \u201cThere are many vaccines being produced in countries around the world but there\u2019s only one nation that has the manufacturing capacity to produce sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of citizens in every country, and that\u2019s India,\u201d said Australia\u2019s ambassador to India, Barry O\u2019Farrell, after touring vaccine manufacturing sites in India with many other diplomats.  Serum Institute of India (SII), the world\u2019s biggest vaccine maker, has already stockpiled more than 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot, even as it awaits emergency-use approvals from both British and Indian authorities.  SII plans to make a total of 400 million doses of Covishield by July and is setting up new production lines to roll out roughly one billion shots a year.  Pharmaceutical packager Schott Kaisha, meanwhile, is stepping up production of vaccine vials and Deutsche Post\u2019s DHL is working out how best to distribute the shots within the country and around the world.  \u201cBecause of the large volumes coming out of India and of course the affordable vaccines, there is no other country that will contribute more towards ending the pandemic than India,\u201d SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters at the company\u2019s sprawling campus in the western city of Pune. Here, automated machines fill and seal thousands of vials with the AstraZeneca shot every hour before they are moved to a vast, high-ceiling cold room.  But much of India\u2019s vaccine production could be, at least initially, for domestic use.  With nearly 10 million infections, the world\u2019s second-highest after the United States, India\u2019s government is likely to order a huge chunk of the vaccines for its 1.3 billion people.  CALCULATED RISK  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has yet to specify how much India will require, but his government has said some vaccines may be approved in the next few weeks and that it was \u201ccommitted to partnering with all interested countries in vaccine-related efforts\u201d.  Poonawalla said he expects to sell hundreds of millions of doses at home. Even as immediate local demand is met, nearly half of its production would go overseas, the company has said.  India\u2019s Bharat Biotech, which has also sought emergency approval for its government-backed vaccine candidate, is in discussions with more than 10 countries in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe to sell its product.  Russia, meanwhile, has signed deals with Indian companies to make the country the production and export hub for its Sputnik V vaccine, starting with more than 100 million doses a year.  Many companies in India\u2019s vaccine supply chain are laying out investments without deals in hand.  \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a calculated risk,\u201d said Rishad Dadachanji, a director at Schott Kaisha that is in supply talks with around 10 vaccine makers at home and abroad.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  It is increasing its annual manufacturing capacity by 300 million to 1.5 billion vials by November.  Executives at rival firms SGD Pharma India and Piramal Glass said they were expanding their production base, or re-allocating manufacturing lines to focus on vials.  SGD plans to add 100 million units to its current capacity of 350 million glass vials, while Piramal says it can double its specialised vial capacity at just a month\u2019s notice \u201cto meet any unforeseen demand.\u201d  SYRINGES AND COLD STORAGE  Others that are likely to benefit from an expected surge in demand are: pharmaceutical firms Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Cadila Healthcare and Hetero; logistics company FedEx; cold chain storage specialist Snowman Logistics and Hindustan Syringes & Medical Devices, among others.  Hindustan Syringes says it will increase capacity by 42% to 1 billion units by the first half of next year. It has already shipped some 140 million syringes that disable themselves after one use for the global vaccine distribution program COVAX.  But because the Indian government has not yet signed any contracts with vaccine suppliers, some ancillary companies have been left guessing what kind of products they should prepare for as specifications may vary from vaccine to vaccine.  Vial maker SGD\u2019s managing director, Sardar Akshay Singh, warned that a last-minute rush to secure vaccines for India could hit exports - similar to the way officials stalled shipments of masks and sanitizers early in the pandemic to meet local demand.  \u201cWe have been feeding the government a lot of information but they\u2019ve not come up with a plan so far,\u201d said Sunil Nair, CEO of India\u2019s biggest cold chain operator, Snowman.  The company\u2019s ongoing expansion will nevertheless double its vaccine handling capacity to 200 million doses by March.  It operates some 500 trucks fitted with containers refrigerated by Carrier Global, has vendors on standby if more are required, and says it can deliver vaccines from production site to inoculation centres within hours thanks to its countrywide reach.  SII, which also has COVID vaccine tie-ups with U.S. biotech firm Codagenix, Novavax and Austria\u2019s Themis, has scaled back production of shots for other diseases and is readying more cold rooms, buying more trucks and hiring more workers.  For DHL, the world\u2019s largest courier and logistics company, vaccine transportation work has already begun in India. It recently brought in Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine for trials and says it will play a crucial role in exporting vaccines, and distributing them within the country.  \u201cThe next 12-24 months are going to be significantly exciting and there\u2019s going to be a lot of capacity issues, but I think it\u2019s a positive headache to have,\u201d DHL Express India head R.S. Subramanian said.","178":"Varios usuarios de redes sociales replicaron el 28 de diciembre un supuesto comunicado en el que la unidad mexicana de la cadena estadounidense de tiendas Walmart anunciaba que iba a ofrecer la vacuna de la farmac\u00e9utica estadounidense Pfizer durante toda esa jornada a aquellos que quisieran comprarla, a un precio de 20 d\u00f3lares (400 pesos mexicanos).

COVAX ROLLOUT  The WHO has backed the COVAX global vaccines programme which seeks to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines and to date has seen 189 countries join.  The WHO\u2019s chief scientist said she hoped half a billion vaccine doses would be available for distribution by the COVAX scheme in the first quarter of 2021, with an initial plan to vaccinate the 20% of populations at highest risk, including health workers and people aged over 65.  \u201cThe goal is to get at least 2 billion doses by end of 2021 which will be enough to vaccinate 20% of the populations of countries that are part of COVAX,\u201d chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told the news conference.  This would be enough to \u201cbring to an end the acute phase of the pandemic\u201d by reducing mortality and the impact on health systems, she said.  COVAX is co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). The United States has not signed up to the scheme, having secured bilateral deals.","189":"(Reuters) -  FILE PHOTO: A man wears a protective mask as he walks past the New York Stock Exchange on the corner of Wall and Broad streets during the coronavirus outbreak in New York City, New York, U.S., March 13, 2020.

Hopes of a strong \u201cV\u201d or even a \u201cU\u201d -shaped recovery faded after a second wave of infections forced major economies to lock down again, setting them up for a double-dip \u201cW\u201d growth path.  Upcoming readings on Chinese and U.S. industrial output will show whether a speedy economic rebound is still possible. But even if a vaccine rollout happens sooner than expected, pandemic damage won\u2019t be easily undone. W, V, or whatever the shape of recovery, central bank stimulus will stay in place.

Pfizer\u2019s encouraging update on its COVID-19 vaccine sent 10-year borrowing costs to the highest since March and drove the yield curve to its steepest in more than two years. Those moves have since been offset by the resurgent coronavirus and doubts the Federal Reserve will permit yields to rise too far.  Demand at the Treasury\u2019s Nov 12 sale of $27 billion in 30-year bonds was below this year\u2019s average. Unexceptional results at the upcoming $27 billion in 20-year bonds could become another factor pushing yields higher.

On Thursday Nov 19, the central bank must show that its policymaking really has changed as much as President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s recent moves suggest. What it means is that new central bank chief Naci Agbal has no choice but to deliver what markets want -- a 400-575 basis points interest rate hike.  Anything below 350 may seen as a cop-out. More importantly, any rate hike needs to stick -- and for that investors need to see proof Erdogan has overcome his oft-stated hostility to high borrowing costs.

With debt running at three times annual GDP, this market is prone to letting off steam. This time, as monetary reins tighten and the pandemic impact starts to show, companies such as property developer Evergrande and BMW\u2019s state-backed parent Huachen Automotive Group are in the crosshairs.  China's new 'three red lines' indebtedness rules may to a degree help alleviate solvency concerns. But the latest jitters and the extent of government support may give pause to investors thronging to the world's second-biggest bond market.

European companies are expected to report a 23.8% year-on-year decline in Q3 earnings, compared to 50.8% tumble in Q2, according to Refinitiv I\/B\/E\/S data. But the U.S. Q3 profit drop is expected at just 7.8%.  That\u2019s because of the larger European exposure to cyclical sectors such as travel or luxury or banks, which are more closely tied to the state of the economy.  The upside is that a credible vaccine could help Europe Inc roar ahead. Indeed, recent vaccine news induced investors to up forecasts for Europe to 30% for the first 2021 quarter -- double the S&P500's rate.

FILE PHOTO: Vials of AstraZeneca's COVISHIELD, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, are seen before they are packaged inside a lab at Serum Institute of India, Pune, India, November 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas\/File Photo  Once front-runners in a global race to develop a vaccine, the AstraZeneca and University of Oxford partnership has been overtaken by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States.  The following are details of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine effort.  TYPE OF VACCINE  - Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine is a recombinant viral vector vaccine, meaning a virus is used as a means of delivering the vaccine.  - It uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus that encodes instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to generate an immune response and prevent infection.  DOSAGE, PROTECTION DURATION AND STORAGE  - AstraZeneca has said the UK authorisation was for a two dose regime.  - Two regimens are being tested: one in which recipients get two full doses, and another with half a dose followed by a full dose.  - The half-dose first regimen was found to be 90% effective in a subset of trial subjects. The success rate was 62% with the originally planned two full doses, based on interim data.  - In December, Oxford said the vaccine has a better immune response when a two full-dose regime is used, citing data from early trials.  - Immune response could last at least a year.  - The vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant, and studies are under way to fully probe the impact of the mutation.  - The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions for at least six months, making it logistically easier to transport than Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.  - AstraZeneca aims to supply millions of doses in the first quarter to Britain and is working with the UK government for first vaccinations to begin early in the new year.  EXPECTED DOSAGE PRICE  - Pricing in Britain is unknown so far.  - Italy\u2019s health ministry said in June the vaccine would cost about 2.5 euros ($2.80) per dose in Europe.  - AstraZeneca has said it will be able to manufacture the vaccine at a few dollars per dose.  - Pricing in Latin America is not expected to exceed $4 per dose.  - Serum Institute of India has said it would price the vaccine at $3 per dose for India and other emerging economies.  - Sources told Reuters it could cost $4 to $5 per dose in Bangladesh.  - Costs in other regions have not yet been disclosed.  - AstraZeneca has said it would not profit from the vaccine during the pandemic, but a report from the Financial Times in October showed the company can declare when it considers the pandemic to have ended in its deals for the vaccine.  - AstraZeneca will look to profit from wealthier countries at the \u201cappropriate time\u201d.  TESTING AND DATA  - Trials combining the vaccine with Russia\u2019s Sputnik V will start by the end of the year, and Russia wants to jointly produce the new vaccine if it is proven to be effective.  - Vastly divergent performance with different dose regimens has called for more clarity on the vaccine\u2019s efficacy which averaged 70.4%, well below vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, but above the 50% threshold set by many regulators.  - Serum Institute of India will continue to test a two full dose regimen of the vaccine.  - AstraZeneca had to pause global trials on Sept. 6 after an unexplained illness in a participant.  - Trial of the vaccine in the United States resumed in October after other countries had ended their pause.  - AZD1222 produces an immune response in both old and young adults, and also led to lower adverse responses among the elderly, AstraZeneca said in October.  - The vaccine also accurately follows genetic instructions programmed into it by its developers, according to an analysis by independent scientists.  - Brazil said in October that a trial volunteer had died.  - A source told Reuters the Brazilian trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 vaccine, although the death was reported to be a suicide.  - In July, data from early-stage trials published in The Lancet showed the vaccine was safe and produced an immune response.  DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE  - The lead developer had said in July the vaccine could be rolled out by year-end, but the delivery and testing timeline has since been pushed back.  - Data read-out submitted to regulators across the world to seek approval.  - Experts have predicted a safe and effective vaccine could take 12-18 months to develop, even at the record speeds.  TARGET DOSES\/GLOBAL CAPACITY OF SUPPLY  - More than 3 billion doses are planned.  - The company will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, and 700 million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.  - AstraZeneca is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and refrigerate it when the vaccine gets closer to approvals.  TIE-UPS  - Even before studies showed any signs of efficacy, AstraZeneca had signed several supply and manufacturing deals around the world.  - It also joined forces with IQVIA to speed up testing.  - AstraZeneca has been granted protection from future liability claims related to the vaccine by most of the countries with which it has struck supply agreements, a senior executive told Reuters in July.","194":"(Reuters) - German biotech BioNTech and U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc on Monday said data from an early-stage trial of their experimental coronavirus vaccine showed that it prompted an immune response and was well-tolerated, similar to results seen in prior early test.  In the study conducted in Germany on 60 healthy volunteers, the vaccine induced virus-neutralizing antibodies in those given two doses, in-line with previous results from an early-stage U.S. trial.  BioNtech\u2019s U.S. shares rose 5%, while Pfizer\u2019s stock was marginally higher at $36.44.  Under expedited development plans, the companies have said they expect to begin a trial later this month with up to 30,000 subjects with the aim of demonstrating the vaccine\u2019s efficacy.  A safe and effective vaccine against the novel coronavirus is seen as essential to ending a pandemic that is still raging and has claimed more than 600,000 lives worldwide.  In the German study, the vaccine also generated a high level of T cell responses against the coronavirus. T cells, a type of white blood cell, are an important component of the immune system\u2019s attack against foreign invaders, such as viruses.  \u201cToday\u2019s data includes the first evidence of the vaccine generating a T-cell response, which could be critical in order for patients to develop durable immunity to the novel coronavirus,\u201d said Mizuho analyst Vamil Divan.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Trial subjects experienced no serious side-effects from the vaccine, though some reported flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions.  The results come as separate results were released for two other experimental COVID-19 vaccines on Monday.  AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine being developed with Oxford University researchers appeared to be safe and produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials. Another vaccine being developed by CanSino Biologics Inc and China\u2019s military research unit also appeared to be safe and induced immune responses in most recipients.  More than 150 potential coronavirus vaccines are in various stages of development around the world, with 23 candidates already being tested in people, according to the World Health Organization.  Separately on Monday, Britain signed deals to secure 30 million doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine, as well for additional doses from French group Valneva.","195":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including Pfizer Inc, Sanofi SA, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc plan to raise U.S. prices on more than 300 drugs in the United States on Jan. 1, according to drugmakers and data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors.  FILE PHOTO: Customers wait in the pharmacy department at a Target store in the Brooklyn borough of New York June 15, 2015. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  The hikes come as drugmakers are reeling from effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has reduced doctor visits and demand for some drugs. They are also fighting new drug price cutting rules from the Trump administration, which would reduce the industry\u2019s profitability.  The companies kept their price increases at 10% or below, and the largest drug companies to raise prices so far, Pfizer and Sanofi, kept nearly all of their increases 5% or less, 3 Axis said. 3 Axis is a consulting firm that works with pharmacists groups, health plans and foundation on drug pricing and supply chain issues.  GSK did raise prices on two vaccines - shingles vaccine Shingrix and diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine Pediarix - by 7% and 8.6%, respectively, 3 Axis said.  Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc hiked prices on 15 drugs, including Austedo, which treats rare neurological disorders, and asthma steroid Qvar, which together grossed more than $650 million in sales in 2019 and saw price hikes of between 5% and 6%. Teva hiked prices for some drugs, including muscle relaxant Amrix and narcolepsy treatment Nuvigil, as much as 9.4%.  More price hikes are expected to be announced on Friday and in early January.  In 2020, drugmakers raised prices on more than 860 drugs by around 5 percent, on average, according to 3 Axis. Drug price increases have slowed substantially since 2015, both in terms of the size of the hikes and the number of drugs affected.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The increases come as pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer are playing hero by developing vaccines for COVID-19 in record time. The hikes could help make up for lost revenue as doctors visits and new prescriptions plummeted during the global lockdown.  Pfizer plans to raise prices on more than 60 drugs by between 0.5 % and 5%. Those include roughly 5% increases on some of its top sellers like rheumatoid arthritis treatment Xeljanz and cancer drugs Ibrance and Inlyta.  Pfizer said it had adjusted the list prices of its drugs by around 1.3% across all products in its portfolio, in line with inflation.  \u201cThis modest increase is necessary to support investments that allow us to continue to discover new medicines and deliver those breakthroughs to the patients who need them,\u201d spokeswoman Amy Rose said in a statement, pointing in particular to the COVID-19 vaccine the company developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE.  It said that its net prices, which back out rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and other discounts, have actually fallen for the last 3 years.  France\u2019s Sanofi plans to increase prices on a number of vaccines 5 percent or less and will announce more price increases later in January, spokesperson Ashleigh Koss said.  None of the company\u2019s price increases will be above the expected growth rate of U.S. health spending of 5.1 percent, she said.  Slashing U.S. prescription drug prices - which are among the highest in the world - was a focus of U.S. President Donald Trump, after making it a core pledge of his 2016 campaign. He issued several executive orders in late 2020 meant to cut prices, but their impact could be limited by legal challenges and other problems.  A federal judge earlier this month blocked a last-minute Trump administration rule aimed at lowering drug prices that was set to be implemented at the beginning of the year. It was challenged by drug industry groups including PhRMA, the nation\u2019s leading pharmaceutical trade group.  President-elect Biden has also vowed to reduce drug costs and to allow Medicare, a U.S. government health insurance program, to negotiate drug prices. He has support from Congressional Democrats to pass such legislation, which the Congressional Budget Office has said could cost the industry more than $300 billion by 2029.","196":"March 12 (Reuters) - Biogen Inc said on Monday it would buy Pfizer Inc\u2019s experimental treatment for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia in a deal whose value could near $600 million.

Biden\u2019s administration will purchase 100 million doses each of the vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, and Moderna Inc, increasing the overall total doses to 600 million, with delivery expected by summer.  The previous purchase target was 400 million doses.  Each vaccine requires two doses per person to be fully effective, suggesting the new purchases would build up enough of a stockpile to inoculate most of the country\u2019s 331 million people. The vaccines are not approved for use by most children.  \u201cThis is a wartime effort,\u201d Biden said in the White House State Dining Room under a painting of President Abraham Lincoln, who led the Union to victory in the U.S. Civil War.  Pfizer is confident it can deliver the extra doses in the time frame specified by Biden, spokeswoman Sharon Castillo said.  Moderna declined to comment.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The new purchase target, along with promises to get more vaccine to local authorities, raises the bar for a Democratic president who took office last week with vows to repair what he said was a disastrous emergency response by his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.  Biden said he would hike the amount of the vaccine going to local governments to 10 million doses per week for the next three weeks, up from 8.6 million currently. The news was welcomed by governors, who said they needed even more doses.  \u201cWe appreciate the administration stating that it will provide states with slightly higher allocations for the next few weeks, but we are going to need much more supply,\u201d Republican Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said in a statement after being briefed on a call by Jeff Zients, the administration\u2019s COVID-19 response coordinator.  \u201cI urge President Biden to take every imaginable step within his power to ramp up production without delay.\u201d  OBSTACLES AHEAD  Considerable challenges remain, ranging from faster-spreading virus variants, supply shortages and public fears about taking the vaccine. Biden\u2019s administration has tried to address the latter problem by getting senior officials vaccinated in public. Vice President Kamala Harris took her second and final Moderna-manufactured shot on Tuesday at the National Institutes of Health.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Biden has asked Congress for a $1.9 trillion relief package to increase testing and vaccine distribution, but the proposal has been met with Republican resistance over the price tag and the inclusion of some measures not directly related to virus control.  Senate Democrats will approve the stimulus even without the support of Republicans, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday.  The administration has also faced extensive questions after sending mixed messages on issues such as when the population would be fully vaccinated.  On Monday, Biden said he believed it was possible to have 150 million doses of the vaccine administered in his first 100 days in office, an aspiration his press secretary, Jen Psaki, said was not an official adjustment of the current target of 100 million doses over that same time period.  The pandemic, which has killed over 420,000 Americans, is currently infecting more than 173,000 people daily and has left millions out of work.  \u201cCases will continue to mount,\u201d Biden warned. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get in this mess overnight. It\u2019s going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be equally clear: We\u2019re going to get through this.

Pfizer executives said the company began actively pursuing Array last month after it released positive clinical data showing that Braftovi and Mektovi in combination with Eli Lilly and Co\u2019s Erbitux helped reduce the risk of death from colorectal cancer by 48% compared to the standard of care in patients with a gene mutation known as BRAF V600E.

British drugmaker AstraZeneca, working with the University of Oxford, expects to report late-stage trial data on its COVID-19 immunisation, another frontrunner, before year-end.  \u201cWhat we have seen in Phase I and Phase II - whether it is Pfizer or AstraZeneca with our Oxford vaccine - is that if you are able to generate neutralising antibodies and a good T-cell response that you can make the virus less hostile,\u201d Dobber said.  \u201cThe efficacy shown earlier today is incredibly promising and I really hope that more vaccine producers will showcase more or less the same results sooner rather than later,\u201d he added.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech results were hailed by many as a gamechanger, including U.S. President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden, who have both taken very different approaches to tackle the pandemic and general healthcare.  Dobber\u2019s message to Biden and his administration was this: \u201cEmbrace innovation, be critical, but embrace innovation ... Let\u2019s find a dialogue and let\u2019s not fight too much about the political colour.\u201d  Biden on Monday said a coronavirus vaccine approval process must be guided by science, warning that a vaccine likely will not be available for months.  Dobber also added that he foresees a strengthening of the Affordable Care Act under Biden, who has been very vocal of the benefits of the program implemented in 2010 when he was vice president in the Obama administration.","220":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Monday\u2019s potential breakthrough in the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine has left governments scrambling to meet the logistical challenge of distributing hundreds of millions of doses once it becomes available in coming months.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Interim trial data showed the experimental vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Germany's BioNTech 22UAy.DE was 90% effective, spurring hopes of an end to a pandemic that has cost more than a million lives and crashed the world's major economies.  With the two groups expecting to produce some 50 million doses by the end of the year and 1.3 billion doses next year, assuming regulatory approval, German Health Minister Jens Spahn, said the vaccine was a \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d.  Both the United States and the European Union have agreements to secure hundreds of millions of doses of the drug, but authorities will need sophisticated planning and logistics to ensure they are distributed effectively.  BioNTech said it was planning to price the two-shot regimen below \u201ctypical market rates\u201d and would differentiate pricing between countries or regions.  But the vaccine must be shipped and centrally stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, putting it out of reach for the moment of many poor countries in Asia and elsewhere which lack the necessary refrigeration equipment.  Needing temperatures matching an Antarctic winter, it is likely to need centralized vaccination locations, Swiss health experts said on Tuesday.  \u201cThe exciting news yesterday (Monday) of a possible effective vaccine becoming available presages significant cold chains challenges for African countries by the type of vaccine that that is,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional director for Africa, told a ministerial assembly. \u201cWhich will need to be factored into the support to be provided.\u201d  Thermal boxes would preserve the ultra-low temperatures for up to 10 days for ambient temperatures of up to 25 Celsius without opening them and up to 15 days if the boxes are opened and then re-iced, BioNTech said in presentation slides.  As previously announced, the vaccine can be kept for up to five days at fridge temperatures.  \u2018TOO MANY UNKNOWNS\u2019  U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said on Tuesday the United States, which has a $2 billion contract for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, could receive 20 million doses per month starting at the end of this month if Pfizer moves as quickly as expected to secure regulatory approval.  For its part, the European Commission, which is negotiating with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, is expected to sign off on a deal on Wednesday to secure 300 million doses of the vaccine.  Britain, which expects to have 10 million doses of the vaccine available by the end of the year, asked the National Health Service to be ready to deploy any COVID vaccine from the start of December.  European logistics specialists said they were capable of meeting the challenge of ultra-cold storage.  \"Distribution will not fail because of logistics,\" Frank Appel, chief executive of Germany's Deutsche Post DWPGn.DE, told journalists. The group said it was already talking to pharmaceutical companies and governments on the details, including the need for cooling.  Deutsche Post said its contract logistics division operates in more than 180 locations worldwide, tailored to the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, where sensitive medical products can be stored and packaged at different temperatures.  With Germany expecting to receive 100 million doses of the vaccine, authorities in Berlin also expect to draw on the military to help manage storage. A government source in Italy said the army was also likely to be called on to help manage storage and distribution.  Some Europeans however injected a dose of caution into the general euphoria about the vaccine.  \u201cI think it\u2019s good news if it\u2019s effective, but I think it\u2019s very difficult because it\u2019s very early,\u201d nursing assistant Maite Flores, 64, from Madrid told Reuters.  \u201cI\u2019m fully vaccinated, and so are both of my children.

For something to be squeezed out this fast, without knowing long-term effects, is difficult to go with,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cThere\u2019s too many unknowns at this point.\u201d","221":"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States and China will be key focuses for the consumer healthcare venture being formed by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, as the companies look to build on strong existing positions in those markets.

The venture, to be 68 percent owned by GSK, will become a stand-alone company within three years of closing the deal, and McNamara will lead it.  \u201cThe U.S. and China are really two of the key value drivers of the deal because it\u2019s where Pfizer has critical mass and a significant amount of their key brands,\u201d he said in an interview, noting the new entity will be the No.1 player in the United States and No.2 in China. \u201cU.S. and China are must-win markets.\u201d  The consumer health sector, which spans vitamins, non-prescription medicines and other drug store purchases, is buoyed by ageing populations, a growing interest in health, wellness and self-care, and growing middle classes.

The new, yet-to-be-named company will have annual sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.9 billion) and more than 7 percent of the global consumer health market, with brands also including Centrum vitamins and Sensodyne toothpaste.  That puts it ahead of rivals Johnson & Johnson, Bayer and Sanofi.  Pfizer\u2019s Centrum is already the leading multivitamin in China, while Caltrate is the No.2 calcium supplement in what is one of the world\u2019s most calcium-deficient populations, McNamara said.  He said vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) would be a major focus, alongside oral care and over-the-counter pain medicine, and respiratory treatments like cold and flu tablets.  \u201cIt gives us the presence globally but it really strengthens our China position,\u201d he said about VMS.  GSK has said it is aiming to make divestments worth about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in 2019\/2020, but McNamara declined to comment on them.

Romania got only 50% of its planned volume for this week, the other half being allocated gradually by the end of March, with deliveries returning to normal starting next week, Deputy Health Minister Andrei Baciu told Reuters.  It was a similar situation in Poland which on Monday received 176,000 doses, a drop of around 50% from what was expected, authorities said.  The Czech government was bracing for the disruption to last weeks, slowing its vaccination campaign just as the second dose of vaccinations get under way.  \u201cWe have to expect that there will be a reduction in the number of open vaccination appointments in the following three weeks,\u201d Health Minister Jan Blatny told reporters on Thursday, with Pfizer deliveries falling by about 15% this week and as much as 30% for the following two weeks.  Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have declined to comment on the cuts beyond their statement last week, which announced cuts to deliveries as they ramp up manufacturing in Europe.  Some countries reckon they can handle it. Norway has an emergency stockpile and will continue administering doses as planned, the government\u2019s public health body said.  The U.S. drugmaker has told Bulgaria and Poland it will replace missing doses, top officials said.  But Denmark\u2019s Serum Institute said its 50% loss of shots this week would lead to a 10% shortfall for the first quarter.  With governments across the region still reeling from the surprise cuts, officials say the reductions are undermining their efforts to inoculate their citizens and tame the pandemic which has killed more than 2 million people.  On Wednesday, Italy threatened legal action against Pfizer.  In Hungary, where the authorities gave the go ahead for the use of Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca and Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccines ahead of the EU drug regulator, a senior official called on Brussels to try and ensure deliveries from Pfizer and other vaccine makers would stick to schedule.  \u201cWe would be happy if the (European) Commission could take steps as soon as possible to ensure that Pfizer and other manufacturers would change deliveries,\u201d Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas said.

Keytruda has been Merck\u2019s most important growth driver with its domination of the lucrative lung cancer space, and shows no sign of slowing as it produces positive clinical data and adds approvals for different types of cancer.

Here are some questions and answers about the cases and what they might mean.  WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?  UK officials said there have been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. Anaphylaxis can cause throat swelling, breathing trouble and difficulty swallowing, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system, which the UK National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening.  WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE VACCINE, ACCORDING TO UK REGULATORS?  British regulators initially responded by saying anyone with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food should not take the shot. An adviser to the group later said it was \u201ctweaking\u201d advice in part to say a food allergy was not a risk.  Late on Wednesday, the UK regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not get the vaccine.  Pfizer had excluded people with a history of significant adverse reaction to vaccines or its vaccine\u2019s ingredients from late-stage trials.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT PROSPECTS FOR U.S. AUTHORIZATION?  U.S. regulators are expected to consider emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine soon after a Thursday meeting of advisers.  Moncef Slaoui, who is spearheading the U.S. government\u2019s vaccine development efforts, said on Wednesday he expected the British allergic reactions would be considered in the U.S. authorization process and that people with known severe allergic reactions probably should not take the vaccine until more was understood.  WHAT DO DOCTORS SAY?  Some praised UK regulators\u2019 caution, while others said broad restrictions were not warranted by available evidence.  \u201cFor the general population, this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  What would be wise, he said, would be \u201cfor anyone who has known severe allergic reaction such that they need to carry an EpiPen to delay having a vaccination until the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified.\u201d  Mayo Clinic virologist Gregory Poland, who has advised U.S. regulators, described Britain\u2019s early reaction as \u201coverdoing it,\u201d pointing to the initial response about food allergies, which he said \u201chave nothing to do with this.\u201d  \u201cI would have said, \u2018If you\u2019ve had anaphylactic-level reactions to vaccines, we want to know about that so we take extra care,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t immunize you. But I would do it in a more controlled setting.\u201d  Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, praised the way the reactions had been handled. \u201cThe fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that the monitoring system is working well,\u201d he said.  Mitchell Grayson, director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio, voiced concern over how the issue might reduce interest in vaccinations. \u201cI\u2019m worried the whole event will cause millions of people to choose not to get vaccinated because of what they heard,\u201d he said.  HOW COMMON ARE SEVERE OR SIGNIFICANT ALLERGIES?  \u201cIn the UK in 2012 there were around seven hospital admissions per 100,000 people for severe allergies. This included different triggers such as foods, drugs and insect stings,\u201d said Louisa James, a expert in immunology at Queen Mary University of London. Fatalities remain very rare and have not increased even as hospital admissions have risen in many countries.","237":"(Adds analyst comment, table, byline; updates prices; changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields soared on Monday as news of a successful vaccine from Pfizer Inc currently in its late stage fueled optimism that the world's largest economy would emerge from a pandemic-induced recession. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to its highest since June and was on track for its biggest one-day jump since March. The U.S. yield curve, an indication of risk appetite, hit its steepest level since March, with the spread between 2-year and 10-year notes rising to 77.8 basis points. Pfizer said on Monday its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on initial data from a large study. The news, potentially a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed over 1 million people, roiled the world's economy and upended daily life, sparked a sell-off in safe-haven bond markets in the United States and Europe. \"This sell-off in Treasuries is more vaccine-related,\" said Ellis Phifer, market strategist at Raymond James in Tennessee, noting that President-elect Joe Biden's victory in last week's election has already been discounted by the market. Two days after clinching victory over Republican President Donald Trump, Democrat Biden is set to give remarks in Wilmington, Delaware, about his plans to address the pandemic that has killed more than 237,000 Americans and to rebuild the economy. \"It seems like the balance of power is working more in favor of markets, meaning more of a balance of power than true blue sweep,\" Phifer said. In mid-morning trading, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were last up at 0.937%, from 0.82% late on Friday. U.S. 30-year yields last traded up 1.725%, from Friday's 1.598%. On the front end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields stood at 0.176%, up from 0.155%. The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities hit -0.743, the highest since mid-July. It was last at -0.765%, compared with -0.836% last Friday. U.S. inflation break-evens, the bond market's gauge of investors' inflation outlook, also rose. The yield spread between 10-year TIPS and 10-year Treasury notes was at 1.72%, the highest level since late October.

FILE PHOTO: Dry ice storage boxes are pictured at CryoCarb, a dry ice facility that could help supply dry ice to the area to keep the Pfizer coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine cool, in Beloit, Wisconsin, U.S., December 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Nicholas Pfosi\/File Photo  The vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE could be authorized for emergency use as soon as this week and must be transported and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (minus 94\u00b0F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or dry ice.  More than a dozen U.S. states, including Washington, New Mexico, Mississippi, Louisiana and Indiana, told Reuters they are rushing to secure dry ice to replenish suitcase-sized shipping containers from Pfizer. Once opened, if being used as temporary storage by a vaccination center, the vaccines can last a total of 30 days with re-icing every five days, Pfizer said.  The company said it believes there is sufficient dry ice supplies to serve the needs of all 50 states without serious constraints.  \u201cThis is the most challenging vaccination program ever attempted. (It) will be especially complicated in rural and remote communities,\u201d said Dr. Kelly Moore, an advisor to Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine program and associate director at the Immunization Action Coalition.  While the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak was originally centered around densely populated areas in the U.S. Northeast, the coronavirus is now rampaging across the country, hitting small towns and rural areas with limited resources particularly hard. Rural areas account for about 60 million people, less than one fifth of U.S. population.  The Pfizer vaccine could soon be followed by another from Moderna Inc that can be kept in a standard freezer.  Officials in states including Texas and Arkansas see Moderna\u2019s vaccine as the main solution for rural areas, but many state and hospital officials are planning to receive supplies of the Pfizer vaccine and expressed concerns about logistics involved.  Pfizer sends its vaccine in pizza box-sized minimum lots of just under 1,000 doses, along with a dry ice refill to last a total of five days.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  After the added time it takes getting vaccines to rural communities, \u201cis that sufficient time for them to turn around and vaccinate folks?\u201d asked Soumi Saha, vice president of advocacy at Premier Inc, which coordinates purchases for thousands of U.S. hospitals and health systems.  \u201cAre they going to say, \u2018Hey, you don\u2019t even have enough people, you\u2019re just gonna waste it\u2019?\u201d she added. \u201cDoes that mean that you have these vacuums throughout the country where people don\u2019t even have access, because of that concern?\u201d  Batesville, Indiana-based Margaret Mary Health, midway between Cincinnati and Indianapolis, has plans to prevent vaccine waste or spoilage as it prepares to inoculate healthcare workers over its 1,400-square-mile (3,626 square kms) area from two sites, including a drive-through at a local fire department.  It has multiple dry ice and deep freezer providers lined up to prevent mishaps, and will schedule vaccination appointments, with a backup list so no-shows do not lead to waste.  \u201cIf we take it out of the cooler, it\u2019s going into someone\u2019s arm,\u201d said Margaret Mary Chief Executive Tim Putnam.  VULNERABILITY IN DRY ICE SUPPLIES  With the optional dry ice refill of 23 kilograms (50.7 pounds) arranged with Pfizer and delivery company United Parcel Service Inc, vaccine recipients are on their own.  Many states are already scheduling dry ice deliveries. Gehm and Sons in Akron, Ohio, has a deal to provide Ohio with 15,000 pounds (6,804 kg) a week of dry ice pellets for 55 cents a pound, including delivery.  Dry ice is made from carbon dioxide. The Compressed Gas Association trade group said it expects current dry ice production capacity to meet an estimated 5% increase in carbon dioxide demand from vaccines.  However, some dry ice suppliers said it is challenging to plan for the vaccine rollout because much is unknown about how much dry ice will be needed.  \u201cThere\u2019s going to be spots in other parts of the country that there\u2019s vulnerability or weakness in supply,\u201d said Steve Atkins, executive vice president of gases at nexAir in Memphis, Tennessee.  Many ethanol plants - a major source of carbon dioxide - were shuttered early in the pandemic. Despite improvement, carbon dioxide production from ethanol plants remains about 25% below this time last year, according to the Renewable Fuels Association.  Grant Hagberg\u2019s Indiana dry ice company is fielding calls from mostly local hospitals. Dry ice manufacturers and distributors \u201care few and far between,\u201d said Hagberg, general manager.","239":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Scientists will meet on Thursday to advise South Africa\u2019s government on its next steps after a study suggested the dominant local coronavirus variant may reduce protective antibodies from Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine by two-thirds.  FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of the displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The laboratory study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is another worry for the country hardest-hit by the pandemic on the African continent after it placed AstraZeneca vaccinations on hold earlier this month.  Although its implications on the real-world efficacy of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine are not yet clear, the study comes after clinical trial data on the AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Novavax vaccines showed reduced efficacy against the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant, first identified late last year.  South Africa has been counting on the Pfizer shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, to step up its vaccination programme after administering the first J&J doses on Wednesday.  It is considering swapping or selling its AstraZeneca doses, after a small local trial, where participants were on average 31 years old, showed the vaccine offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the 501Y.V2 variant.  Officials are more confident about the J&J shot because it was shown to be effective against severe illness in the local leg of a large global trial.  The study published on Wednesday took into account all key mutations of the 501Y.V2 variant. A paper published in late January assessed the impact of only three key mutations of the variant.  Scientists say that because the new study\u2019s findings come from a laboratory, it is not easy to extrapolate what they might mean in the real world.  Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control, said it was \u201cfar from proven\u201d that the Pfizer vaccine would be less effective against the 501Y.V2 variant. He said cellular immunity - as well as antibodies - was important in protecting against the virus and that scientists did not know the level of neutralising antibodies needed for immunity.  \u201cOur scientists will be meeting to discuss it (the study) and they will advise the minister,\u201d health ministry spokesman Popo Maja said.  Barry Schoub, chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on vaccines, said the committee would discuss the study alongside information on other vaccines.  Asked to comment on the findings, he said: \u201cThe Pfizer vaccine is enormously effective at 95%, so even if there is quite a significant reduction there still will be quite a bit of remnant efficacy left.  \u201cIt is very likely that it will protect to a reasonable extent, certainly against severe illness and mild to moderate to some extent,\u201d he said.  \u201cSTRONG ENOUGH\u201d  Richard Mihigo, an immunisation official at the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa office, told a news conference the antibody response to the variant in the Pfizer study was \u201cstrong enough\u201d.  Linda-Gail Bekker, co-lead investigator of the South African arm of J&J\u2019s global trial, said she would recommend rolling out the Pfizer vaccine but monitoring it in the same way as the J&J shot, which is being administered in an \u201cimplementation study\u201d targeting up to 500,000 health workers to further test it.  Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday South Africa was expecting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine initially and about 7 million doses by June.  A spokesman for regulator SAHPRA said Pfizer\u2019s registration application was under review and declined further comment.  South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million cases and about 48,500 deaths, has recorded almost half the COVID-19 fatalities and over a third of confirmed infections in Africa. It lagged richer Western nations in launching its immunisation campaign.  The government plans to vaccinate 40 million people - two-thirds of the population.","240":"ZURICH\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Novartis AG and Pfizer Inc are teaming up to develop treatments for a liver disease many drug companies believe will become a hugely lucrative market, as it is tied to the obesity and diabetes epidemics.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Swiss and U.S. drugmakers announced on Monday that they will collaborate to develop combination therapies involving medicines they have been working on separately to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH.  Though hardly a household name, the progressive fatty liver disease with no approved treatments is poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020. [reut.rs\/2HojtnT]  NASH, which is closely associated with obesity and diabetes, is emerging as a major global health concern, especially among populations with increasingly fatty diets. Unchecked, it can lead to advanced cirrhosis and liver failure.  Drugmakers like Pfizer, Novartis, Gilead Sciences Inc and Allergan PLC see the potential $20 billion to $35 billion market, according to some estimates, as a source of future growth. Several small companies that have been focused on NASH treatments are well ahead of Pfizer and Novartis in their efforts, including Intercept Pharmaceuticals and France\u2019s Genfit.  While studies have shown increased exercise and altering dietary patterns can be a first-line of defense against the disease, Eric Hughes, who heads Novartis\u2019s hepatology development program, has seen first hand the need for pharmaceutical options.  \u201cAs a physician, I told everyone about exercise, lifestyle changes and diet,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cAnd I was lucky if I got 5 percent that even listened to me.  \u201cThis is an epidemic of 38 million people in the U.S., and to treat all those people who are advanced in their disease requires therapy,\u201d Hughes added.  The companies will test Novartis\u2019s tropifexor in various combinations with three experimental Pfizer medicines, with the idea of attacking different aspects of NASH, said Morris Birnbaum, Pfizer Internal Medicine\u2019s chief scientific officer.  \u201cThe way this disease develops is, first you get fat in the liver, and then for reasons which nobody understands, the fat provokes an inflammatory response ... and then lastly, you get scarring and fibrosis,\u201d Birnbaum said. The combination therapy would target all three stages of the disease, he said.  Pfizer\u2019s drugs are aimed at steatosis, or fat accumulation in the liver. Novartis\u2019s molecule fights inflammation and fibrotic scarring.  The collaboration is not exclusive. Novartis\u2019s 2017 partnership with Allergan testing tropifexor with an Allergan drug will continue, Hughes said.  It is too early to predict when NASH patients might receive combination Pfizer-Novartis treatments, Hughes said.  But the deal shows there is still an appetite for tackling chronic conditions that affect millions of people at a time when many drugmakers, including Pfizer and Novartis, have increasingly directed resources to treatments for rare diseases that can command extremely high prices.","241":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s medical regulator on Friday approved Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for use, the health ministry said, adding that it had agreed to purchase an additional 10 million doses as it eyed a spring rollout of the shot.  Three COVID-19 vaccines have now been approved for use in Britain, with Pfizer\/BioNTech\u2019s shot and one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca already being administered.  The Moderna shot is not expected to play a part in the first stage of Britain\u2019s vaccine rollout, which needs to see 2 million vaccinations a week being given for the next six weeks in order to hit a target of inoculating high priority groups by mid-February.  Instead, supplies will begin to be delivered to the UK from the spring once Moderna expands its production capability.  \u201cWe have already vaccinated nearly 1.5 million people across the UK and Moderna\u2019s vaccine will allow us to accelerate our vaccination programme even further once doses become available from the spring,\u201d health minister Matt Hancock said.  Britain now has 17 million doses of Moderna\u2019s vaccine on order, after waiting for trial data before making a commitment, putting it behind the United States and the European Union in the queue for the shot.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine was 94% effective in preventing disease in late-stage clinical trials, and it has already been given regulatory approval for use in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Israel.  The United States began rolling out the Moderna vaccine in late December, while the company has said the process will get underway in the EU next week.  \u201cWe appreciate the confidence shown by the UK MHRA in COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna with this decision,\u201d said Stephane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, referring to the medicines regulator.  Britain initially prioritised securing doses from Pfizer and AstraZeneca and was the first country to approve those vaccines, but has spread its bets and secured doses of 7 different vaccine candidates in all.  Britain is attempting to vaccinate the elderly, the vulnerable and frontline workers - around 15 million people - by mid-February, to ease a new strict lockdown imposed after a spike in cases to daily records.  Although Moderna\u2019s vaccine will not help meet that initial target, it will help ease supply constraints that Hancock has cited as being a limiting factor in the rollout.  \u201cThis is excellent news and a further crumb of comfort amid the huge levels of COVID-19 currently circulating around the UK,\u201d said Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health at the University of Southampton.  \u201cWhen these Moderna vaccines arrive, they will help to ease any bottlenecks or delays in the administration programme.\u201d","242":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will take up its option to buy up to 100 million more doses of Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine after turning down an opportunity in July for a much bigger deal, according to EU officials and an internal document.  FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The plan comes after some of the vaccine candidates ordered by the EU faced unexpected delays in clinical trials, forcing the bloc and other wealthy nations to rely for now on shots from fewer manufacturers than initially planned.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech shot, the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by Western drugs regulators, is being rolled out in countries including Britain and the United States, and is expected to be approved for use in the EU next week.  The European Commission decided on Tuesday to exercise its option to buy up to 100 million additional doses under an existing contract with Pfizer and BioNTech, a spokesman for the EU executive told Reuters on Thursday. Under the same contract it has already ordered 200 million doses.  \u201cWe want to be sure to get more doses because there is big demand,\u201d the spokesman said.  An EU official said talks were underway over how many of the extra 100 million doses might be taken.  Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment. BioNTech declined to comment.  Under the EU contract, the two firms have committed to rapidly deliver 200 million doses after regulatory approval for 15.5 euros ($18.8) apiece, EU officials told Reuters in November.  The extra 100 million doses would be supplied at the same price, but with the timetable to be negotiated, EU officials said.  Pfizer and BioNTech have said they can produce about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021, but they are trying to expand manufacturing capacity as global demand surges.  DECLINED ORDER  The discussions to order more Pfizer shots, even before the first shipments have arrived, underscore the pressure on the EU to secure more supplies to tackle a pandemic that has already killed 470,000 Europeans and is picking up pace in winter.  That contrasts with EU negotiators\u2019 more relaxed stance in the summer, when the pandemic was waning and the bloc was sealing supply deals with multiple vaccine makers.  At a meeting with EU diplomats in July, a Commission official said the EU had declined an offer of 500 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech because it was too expensive, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows.  The Commission and BioNTech declined to comment on this. Pfizer did not reply to a request for comment.  With a population of 450 million, the bloc is now relying only on the 200 million Pfizer shots it has already ordered for its first vaccinations, which could start around Christmas.  In January, the EU is also expected to approve the shot developed by Moderna, but it has an initial order of just 80 million doses, with an option for 80 million more. The Commision this week has also decided to take up that option immediately, the EU spokesman said.  Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses per person.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccines for the EU are produced at a plant in Belgium, but the factory is currently also supplying the United States, Britain and Canada.  \u201cWe have millions of doses ready (..) for distribution, depending on regulatory approval,\u201d a spokesman for the plant told Reuters, when asked whether shipments to countries outside the EU could temporarily reduce supplies to the bloc.  In total, the EU has booked nearly 1.3 billion vaccines in deals with Pfizer\/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca\/Oxford, Sanofi\/GSK and CureVac, and has options to buy another 660 million.  But clinical tests of the vaccines being developed by AstraZeneca and Sanofi have suffered delays, and CureVac has not yet begun large-scale trials.  Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca could submit applications to EU regulators by March, the head of the EU drugs regulator said last week.

The dose interval for the Pfizer vaccine in Britain was changed from 21 days to \u201cat least 21 days\u201d on Wednesday, and for both vaccines, the second dose was advised to be given up to 12 weeks later.  \u201cThis approach will maximise the benefits of both vaccines,\u201d a health ministry spokesman said.  \u201cIt will ensure that more at-risk people are able to get meaningful protection from a vaccine in the coming weeks and months, reducing deaths and starting to ease pressure on our NHS.\u201d  Pfizer, sounded more cautious on the prospect of shifting the schedule of the second dose of the vaccine, noting it had not been evaluated on different dosing schedules.  \u201cThere are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days,\u201d it said in a statement, adding the implementation of alternative schedules should be closely monitored.  \u201cWhile decisions on alternative dosing regimens reside with health authorities, Pfizer believes it is critical... to ensure each recipient is afforded the maximum possible protection, which means immunisation with two doses of the vaccine.\u201d  Britain has said the new strategy still means everyone will receive a second dose within 12 weeks of the vaccine.  AstraZeneca has said that the MHRA\u2019s approval of a two-dose regime, with 4-12 weeks between the first and second dose, was the \u201cbest vaccination strategy\u201d for the shot. [L8N2JA2FF]  The government said it would also not recommend one vaccine over another for different cohorts of the population, even though data on the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine\u2019s efficacy in older people is currently limited.  Munir Pirmohamed, chair of the Commission on Human medicines expert Working Group on COVID-19 vaccines, said only a small amount of data on efficacy in older people was available because of the way the trial was designed.  \u201cFrom the data that was available, there was indication that the vaccine was effective in older people as well,\u201d he said.  Oxford vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said more data would be made available, especially regarding efficacy in older adults, but that starting inoculations while some questions were unanswered was important.  \u201cWe are in a pandemic situation,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cThe MHRA have determined that we have a safe vaccine, a highly effective vaccine, and the one that we need to start using now to control this pandemic.\u201d","244":"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Malaysia on Saturday said it expects to receive the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccine jointly developed by Pfizer and BioNTech in February, according to a report by national news wire Bernama.

The government will take the advice of the Health Ministry regarding the percentage of people who need to be vaccinated,\u201d Mohamed Azmin was quoted as saying by Bernama.  Pfizer and their German partners BioNTech have supply deals with several countries including the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain.  They expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of vaccines in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, with 48 in human trials, the WHO says.","245":"FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

Lopez Obrador said the plan to vaccinate older adults in remote areas will rely on vaccines from Chinese company CanSino Biologics, in part because it requires a single shot and is easy to store. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine needs to be kept in special ultra-cold freezers.  Mexico has sought to order 35 million CanSino vaccines, with about 8 million arriving by March, officials say, though Mexico\u2019s regulator has yet to approve its use.  Mexico\u2019s vaccination drive would be carried out in 10,000 community centres serving small and remote towns and focusing on adults above 60 years of age. Medium sized towns and large cities would follow, Lopez Obrador said.  More than 127,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Mexico, which has the world\u2019s fourth highest death toll.  Mexico has several vaccine agreements, including with AstraZeneca and the World Health Organization-backed COVAX scheme set up to deliver vaccines to developing countries.","248":"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic has allowed the squeezing of an extra dose from COVID-19 vaccine vials supplied by Pfizer and BioNTech, taking advantage of a reserve amount put into the vials by the maker, the Health Ministry said.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis asked the European Commission earlier this week to allow use of the extra amount as European Union countries ramp up vaccination campaigns that began just after Christmas.  Italian regulators have already approved the drawing of six doses, overriding guidance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the bloc as a whole.  BioNTech said on Monday it was in discussion with regulators on whether a sixth dose could be approved. Responding, the EMA said it had asked the company to submit data showing that six doses can be reliably extracted.  The EMA said it expected the company to submit a request for change in the coming days, which the responsible committee would assess rapidly.  \u201cIf the (committee) finds that six doses can be extracted reliably, it will recommend a change to the current terms of the authorisation,\u201d the EMA said.

The Czech Health Ministry said in a ruling dated Dec. 29 that, in divergence from the vaccine\u2019s EU registration, it was temporarily allowing extraction of the extra dose, on condition that the regular volume of each dose was strictly observed.  It said that the extra dose must be available in an individual vial, meaning that material from more that one vial cannot be mixed.  The Czech Republic reported a record high 16,329 daily new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the Health Ministry said on Wednesday.

Located 65 km (40 miles) from Seoul and boasting temperatures frostier than an Antarctic winter, the facility would be the best, perhaps only, place in South Korea suitable for bulk storage of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, says company CEO Kim Jin-ha.  \u201cAs soon as we heard about the Pfizer vaccine, we started getting ready... other options wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Kim told Reuters, adding that the warehouse\u2019s use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to keep temperatures cool trumped electricity.  Warehouses which use electricity would have difficulty maintaining the -70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) required by the vaccine for storage and carry the risk of the temperature rising during a power blackout, he said.  The company, which is backed by Goldman Sachs and SK Holdings Co Ltd, has been in talks with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency since early November and while nothing is yet decided, expectations are high it will land a contract.  The agency has asked Korea Superfreeze to provide plans and cost estimates for storing and distributing vaccines, including how it would handle a scenario where vaccines would be shipped to 260 different locations, Kim said.  South Korea has arranged to buy 20 million doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The country also has deals for 20 million doses each for the vaccines developed by Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc\/Oxford University and for another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson.  In total, that would be enough to inoculate 34 million people in a country of 51.8 million and shipments are expected to begin no later than March.  Kim said, however, it was not clear to him if the agency would tap the company for vaccines other than Pfizer\u2019s which have less onerous cold storage requirements. Moderna\u2019s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20 C while AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine needs only normal fridge temperatures.  To accommodate Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, Korea Superfreeze is planning a dedicated passageway and elevator so there is no interference from outside temperatures. Once it confirms it has a contract, it will begin construction which may take 2-3 months.  The warehouse also has 220 closed-circuit cameras that monitor resting cargo round the clock, Kim said.  He added that South Korea and Japan were the only countries with LNG-powered facilities which can offer storage at these temperatures and that the warehouses in Japan were much smaller and more remotely located due to earthquake risks.  All in all, the Korea Superfreeze rooms capable of storing goods at -70 C add up to 1,600 square metres (17,222 square feet). But just how much of that will be needed remains unclear as the company has not yet ascertained how big the containers carrying the vaccines will be and how much will be shipped to South Korea at a time.  Kim said, however, that some regular customers of the storage facilities might have to be inconvenienced.  \u201cFor the tuna and other goods that are being kept here at -60 degrees, we\u2019re going to have to ask their permission, compensate them for it and clear them out of here.\u201d","253":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday, calling the start of the nation\u2019s vaccination programme a \u201cmassive step\u201d that will enable it to return to normal.

FILE PHOTO: A logo for Pfizer is displayed on a monitor on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid\/File Photo  Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten was one of the pharmaceutical executives who attended a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to discuss possible vaccines and treatments for the fast-spreading virus on Monday.  He had said then that the company was working on developing an anti-viral therapy to help patients who already have contracted the virus. But he said on Thursday that Pfizer was considering joining companies like Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi SA and Moderna in the race to develop a vaccine to inoculate healthy patients.  Dolsten said that Pfizer, which already collaborates with BioNTech on the development of mRNA-based vaccines for influenza, is also interested in the company\u2019s efforts in coronavirus.  \u201cWe will share some of our thoughts with BioNTech also on what they do on COVID-19 and evaluate whether there are things that could merit to do together,\u201d he said.  BioNTech has been considering using its mRNA platform to develop a vaccine for coronavirus since earlier this year, BioNTech chief executive officer Ugur Sahin told Reuters in an interview last month.  An mRNA-based vaccine, which uses synthetic messenger RNA to help the body immunize itself against a virus, can potentially be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines.  Moderna, which also focuses on mRNA-based therapies, has already developed an experimental coronavirus vaccine using a similar method to BioNTech. Moderna plans to begin clinical trials of its vaccine later this month.  ANTIVIRALS  Dolsten also gave more details about the company\u2019s efforts to develop potential anti-viral treatments for the virus, which are currently being screened by a third-party company to see how it performs against the virus in a laboratory setting.  Pfizer said these compounds could potentially be used in conjunction with another antiviral treatment being developed by Gilead Sciences called remdesivir, which is further along in the development process.  Pfizer\u2019s compounds use a different mechanism of action than Gilead\u2019s to attack the virus, Dolsten said, with Pfizer\u2019s looking to attack the protease segment of the virus.  The protease \u201cis one of the best drug targets in the viral sector,\u201d Dolsten said. \u201cIt has been one of the most effective for HIV and HCV and our analysis confirmed that the COVID-19 protease target was very similar to one we had been working on for another virus.\u201d  He declined to say what virus the compounds had been originally developed to fight.  Gilead\u2019s drug is focused on a target called the polymerase, Dolsten said. He said there were opportunities for Pfizer\u2019s compounds - if they are successful - to work in combination or sequentially with Gilead\u2019s.  \u201cIn other viral studies when you hit the two different mechanisms, you see a far better outcome, a much bigger cure rate than if you just work on a similar target,\u201d he said.  Gilead CEO Daniel O\u2019Day said on Wednesday that remdesivir is in late stage clinical trials in both China and the United States. He said the company should know \u201cin the next couple of months\u201d whether the drug helps treat patients with the coronavirus.","257":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N has agreed to spin off its off-patent branded drugs business and combine it with generic drugmaker Mylan NV MYL.O, a move that leaves Pfizer with its more profitable innovative drugs, including cancer treatment Ibrance and pneumonia vaccine Prevnar.  The move, which brings blockbuster treatments Viagra and Lipitor under one umbrella with Mylan's EpiPen, is part of a years-long effort by Pfizer to split into three parts - innovative medicines, lower margin off-patent drugs facing generic competition and consumer healthcare. Pfizer agreed in December to combine its consumer health business with GlaxoSmithKline Plc's. GSK.L  The combined company, which will get a new name, is expected to have 2020 revenue of $19 billion to $20 billion, with free cash flow expected to be more than $4 billion.  The pharmaceutical industry has been under intensifying pressure from lawmakers, including President Donald Trump, to keep prices down for U.S. consumers, which has limited profits and led to recent deals, such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co's BMY.N plan to buy Celgene Corp CELG.O and AbbVie Inc's ABBV.N acquisition of Allergan Plc AGN.N.  The new company, to be based in the United States and incorporated in Delaware, will be led by Michael Goettler, president of Pfizer\u2019s Upjohn unit, which sells Pfizer\u2019s older drugs that have lost patent protection.  Upjohn will issue $12 billion of debt at or before the separation, with proceeds going to Pfizer. Pfizer said it plans to use that cash to pay down its own debt.  Mylan said Chief Executive Heather Bresch, who took the helm in 2012 and faced intense political pressure over the high price of EpiPen, will retire after the deal closes. Mylan Chairman Robert Coury will become executive chairman of the new company.  \u201cWe think it is clear Mylan needed to do something to change direction,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst David Maris said, adding that the deal is also recognition that Pfizer wanted out of generics.  Pfizer\u2019s older drugs business has a much higher operating margin than Mylan\u2019s, Maris added.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Mylan, which had a market value of $9.5 billion prior to Monday\u2019s announcement, last year said it would review its business as it grapples with lower prices of generic drugs and declining sales of its EpiPen emergency allergy treatment.  In 2015, Mylan fended off a takeover attempt from rival Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.TA that would have valued the company at around $40 billion. Based on Monday's share price, the company is worth around $11 billion. EpiPen sales fell sharply after Mylan was heavily criticized for steep price hikes on its device that delivers a life-saving shot epinephrine to treat severe allergic reactions. Bresch was called to testify before Congress in 2016, as the controversy put Mylan at the center of the ongoing U.S. debate over the high cost of prescription medicines.  Mylan\u2019s shares have lost about a third of their value in 2019 through Friday\u2019s close. The stock was up more than 12.9% at $20.84 on Monday, while Pfizer slipped 2% to $42.23.  Graphic: Mylan shares - tmsnrt.rs\/2ykeLFF  STREAMLINED PFIZER  Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and his predecessor Ian Read have been saying for more than a year that the company would eschew large, transformative deals because of confidence in the strength of its pipeline.  But if the Mylan and GSK deals both close, the company will have shed two large businesses to tighten its focus on newer, patent-protected innovative medicines.  Pfizer CFO Frank D\u2019Amelio said on a conference call that the streamlined company will grow sooner and faster beginning in 2020 than it would have otherwise.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Under terms of the agreement, Pfizer shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Mylan shareholders the rest. Each Mylan share will be converted into one share of the new company under the all-stock deal.

REUTERS\/Kim Hong-ji  Its cautious approach comes as the country of almost 52 million people battles surging COVID-19 infections that health authorities say threaten to overwhelm the medical system.  Other countries are moving ahead to grant emergency use approval for the vaccines in a bid to contain virus transmission. Britain began rolling out Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, and the United States and India have launched regulatory reviews on some vaccine candidates.  The South Korean government has arranged to buy 20 million doses each from AstraZeneca Plc, Pfizer Inc, and Moderna Inc, and another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Janssen, enough to cover up to 34 million people, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told a briefing.  Additional doses for 10 million people would be procured through the World Health Organization\u2019s global vaccine project, known as COVAX, he added.  Despite the current surge in cases, South Korea\u2019s relative success in tamping down previous waves meant the government did not need to rush a vaccine, Park said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see the need to hurriedly begin vaccination without ensuring that the vaccines\u2019 risks have been verified,\u201d he said.  Shipments would begin no later than March, and vaccinations may start in the first half of next year depending on factors such as observations in other countries about their safety, the spread of COVID-19 and public demand, the health ministry said.  \u201cWe had initially planned to secure vaccines for 30 million people but decided to purchase more, as there is uncertainty over the success of the vaccine candidates and the competition is intense among countries for early purchases,\u201d Park said.  The government allocated an additional 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to next year\u2019s budget for vaccines.  The first vaccines would likely go to medical workers, elderly and medically vulnerable people, and social workers.  The government will seek to set up new storage to ensure the vaccines are kept at the right temperatures, with the Pfizer product required to be refrigerated at minus 70 Celsius degrees (minus 94 Fahrenheit degrees).  WAVE OF INFECTIONS  The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 594 new COVID-19 infections as of midnight Monday, bringing the country\u2019s total to 38,755, with 552 deaths.  South Korea\u2019s previous two waves of infections were largely focused around a handful of facilities or events, while the new surge is being driven by smaller, harder-to-trace clusters in and around the densely populated capital city of Seoul.  Vice Health Minister Kang Do-tae said the government had been unable to trace the origin of 26% of all cases.  \u201cIf social distancing is not implemented properly, outbreaks in the greater Seoul area would lead to greater transmissions nationwide,\u201d Kang told a meeting of health officials according to a transcript from the health ministry.  Health authorities predicted daily cases would hover between 550 and 750 this week, and could rise as high as 900 next week.  If such predictions are accurate, Kang said the country\u2019s health system may collapse.  \u201cThere could be a dangerous situation where it becomes difficult not only to treat COVID-19 patients but also to provide essential medical services,\u201d he said.","260":"A medical worker fills a syringe with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at the CHIREC St Anne-St Remi Clinic in Brussels, Belgium January 27, 2021.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  The financial hub of the United Arab Emirates began the first phase of the vaccination campaign last week, targeting \u201cpriority groups\u201d, including those 60 and older, people with chronic medical conditions, those with disabilities and frontline workers.  In contrast with the UAE\u2019s capital Abu Dhabi, which rolled out a vaccine made by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) to the general public, Dubai followed Saudi Arabia, which earlier this month became the first Arab country to use the Pfizer vaccine.  \u201cWe are targeting to vaccinate approximately 70% of the population of Dubai by the end of 2021. We want to reach the herd immunity that is required,\u201d Farida al-Khaja, chairwoman of Dubai\u2019s steering committee for COVID-19 vaccinations, told Reuters.  Khaja said a second phase would kick off in April and would be open to all citizens and residents.  Dubai, which in 2019 had a population of over 3.3 million, has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, which hurt its key tourism, real estate and trade sectors.  The UAE\u2019s health ministry has registered the Pfizer-BioNTech shot for emergency use, but none of the other emirates has so far announced plans to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, for which data has shown 95% efficacy.  Asked about coordination between the UAE\u2019s seven emirates, Khaja said: \u201cThere is a (national) vaccination campaign in the UAE and all the emirates are covering their vaccine programmes.\u201d  The UAE was the first country outside China to roll out the Sinopharm vaccine to the public and said earlier this month it had 86% efficacy, citing a review of an interim analysis of late-stage clinical trials.  Its phase III clinical trials in the UAE included 31,000 volunteers from 125 nationalities.  Neither the UAE nor Sinopharm has released detailed data from the study. The UAE announcement did not say what, if any, side effects it identified, how many participants have become ill or how many volunteers were given the vaccine or a placebo.  The Sinopharm vaccine is now available to anyone living in the UAE who wishes to receive it, including at a field hospital in Dubai set up by the federal government.  Emaad Alvi, a senior at Cornell University who is also a resident of Dubai, received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.  \u201cThe reason I chose to get the vaccine ASAP is because I\u2019m asthmatic and I have trust in the doctors and I think the vaccine should be fine,\u201d he said.","262":"(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.  FILE PHOTO: A vial and sryinge are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer and Biontech logo in this illustration taken January 11, 2021. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  South African variant may resist current antibody treatments  The variant of the new coronavirus identified in South Africa can resist, or \"escape,\" antibodies that neutralize earlier versions of the virus, scientists have found. It \"exhibits complete escape\" from three classes of monoclonal antibodies manufactured for treating COVID-19 patients, and it shows \"substantial or complete\" resistance to neutralizing antibodies in blood donated by COVID-19 survivors, the scientists reported on Tuesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Similarities between the South Africa variant and another variant identified in Brazil suggest the Brazilian variant will show similar resistance, they added. Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study, noted that these were laboratory tests, and it would be unwise to extrapolate the findings to humans at this point. \"The data do raise the possibility that the protection gained from past infection with COVID-19 may be lower for re-infection with the South African variant,\" he said. \"The data also suggest that the existing vaccines could be less effective against the South African variant.\" He called for large studies among populations where the variant is common. (bit.ly\/3sLeIgP)  Pfizer\/BioNTech shot likely protects against UK variant  The COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE is likely to protect against the more infectious variant of the virus discovered in Britain and now spreading around the world, according to laboratory tests. Researchers took blood samples from 16 people who had received the vaccine and exposed the blood to a synthetic virus, or pseudovirus, that was engineered to have 10 mutations found in the UK variant. The antibodies that had developed in response to the vaccine effectively neutralized the pseudovirus, according to a report posted on Tuesday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. \"This makes it very unlikely that the UK variant will escape from the protection provided by the vaccine,\" said Jonathan Stoye, a virus scientist at Britain's Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. Similar experiments are needed with the more concerning variant first found in South Africa, he suggested. AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc and CureVac NV are also testing whether their respective vaccines will protect against the fast-spreading variants. (bit.ly\/35X6Wa4; reut.rs\/3p1TCZz)  Immune system will remember how to make COVID-19 antibodies  People who have recovered from COVID-19 can likely mount a fast and effective response to the virus if they encounter it again because their immune system's \"B cells\" will remember how to make the antibodies needed to fight it, a new study shows. Researchers tracked 87 COVID-19 survivors for six months and found that while levels of antibodies to the virus may decline over time, the number of memory B cells remains unchanged. The antibodies produced by these cells are more potent than the patients' original antibodies and may be more resistant to mutations in the spike protein the virus uses to break into cells, they said. For example, they found, the antibodies could recognize and neutralize at least one of the mutations in the South African variant of the virus that has caused concern among health experts. Even if antibody levels fall, B cells will remember how to make them when necessary, according to study leader Michel Nussenzweig of Rockefeller University, whose findings were reported on Monday in Nature. If this is true at six months, as in this study, it is safe to assume it is probably still true for longer periods, he added. People who have recovered from COVID-19 \"may become infected but the immune system will be prepped to fight off the infection,\" Nussenzweig said. (go.nature.com\/3nWtwWo)  Mortality higher when ICUs are packed with COVID-19 patients  The more full an intensive care unit (ICU) is with COVID-19 patients, the higher the mortality rate among those patients, new data suggest. When researchers tracked outcomes of 8,515 COVID-19 patients admitted to 88 U.S. Veterans Affairs hospitals in 2020, they found that survival rates improved between March and August. Throughout the study period, however, the risk of death was nearly double when at least 75% of ICU beds were filled with COVID-19 patients, compared to when they accounted for no more than 25% of ICU beds. COVID-19 mortality \"increases during periods of peak demand,\" said Dr. Dawn Bravata of the Richard L Roudebush VA Medical Center in Indianapolis who co-led the study published on Tuesday in JAMA Network Open. \"The more the public can do to avoid infections, the better,\" she added. In addition, Bravata said, \"facilities within a healthcare system or within a geographic region should collaborate to triage critically ill patients with COVID-19 to sites with greater ICU capacity to reduce strain on any one facility.\" (bit.ly\/3oYfWDa; bit.ly\/35VHpOk)  Open tmsnrt.rs\/3a5EyDh in an external browser for a Reuters graphic on vaccines and treatments in development.","263":"FILE PHOTO: A healthcare worker prepares a Pfizer coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 7, 2021.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  The claim originated in a Nov. 15 tweet from a user known as \u201cThe Disruptive Physician\u201d with the handle @DocEvenhouse (here). Facebook and Instagram sharing screenshots of the tweet can be found here , here and here .  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FRONTRUNNERS  There are currently three COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners: one made by AstraZeneca, one made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and one made by Moderna. As reported here by the Washington Post, AstraZeneca says that its vaccine candidate, developed by Oxford University, is up to 90% effective in clinical trials. Pfizer and Moderna have reported vaccines that are 95% effective.  The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus (here).  Meanwhile, both the Pfizer and Moderna candidates rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus ( here , here ). Each uses synthetic genetic material that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines (here).  Each candidate has different storage temperature requirements.  The AstraZeneca vaccine can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute - especially in poor countries (here).  The Moderna vaccine is stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), but can be kept for a month at normal refrigerator temperatures (here).  Referenced in the social media posts, the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below - equivalent to an Antarctic winter (here). As reported here by Sanjay Mishra, project coordinator for the \"COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium\" at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and published on The Conversation, the vaccine will degrade in five days if kept at regular refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing.  WHY SO COLD?  The Disruptive Physician\u2019s claim that \u201cany vaccine that needs to be shipped and stored at -80 degrees isn\u2019t a vaccine\u201d is false. As Mishra explains here , the biggest challenge in developing an mRNA vaccine is \u201cits inherent instability, because it is more likely to break apart above freezing temperatures.\u201d  Likening the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines\u2019 storage temperatures to \u201cfreezing food to keep it from spoiling,\u201d Margaret Liu, a board member of the International Society for Vaccines who specializes in genetic vaccines, told NPR that lower temperatures slow down the pace of chemical reactions, like the enzymes that break down RNA (here). Since the manufacturers do not disclose their specific formulations, it is not yet clear why Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines require different storage temperatures.  Business Insider explains here that it is possible Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u201ccould be fine at temperatures above that, but scientists were in such a rush to create the vaccine that they don't know for sure.\u201d  MRNA VACCINES DO NOT CAUSE \u201cGENETIC MANIPULATION OF HUMANS\u201d  The posts\u2019 claim that the Pfizer vaccine is designed for \u201cgenetic manipulation of humans on a massive scale\u201d has no basis in fact. As Mishra clarifies here , the synthetic genetic material contained in an mRNA vaccine does not mean a patient\u2019s DNA is changed or passed onto their offspring. Instead, the molecule \u201cguides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days.\"  The Reuters Fact Check team previously fact-checked false social media claims that a COVID-19 vaccine involving the injection of the virus\u2019s genetic code would genetically modify humans, visible here .  Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at Cornell University\u2019s Alliance for Science group (here), debunked the idea that such a vaccine could genetically modify an organism. Lynas told Reuters that no vaccine can genetically modify human DNA.  \u201cThat\u2019s just a myth, one often spread intentionally by anti-vaccination activists to deliberately generate confusion and mistrust,\u201d he said. \u201cGenetic modification would involve the deliberate insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a human cell, and vaccines simply don\u2019t do that.\u201d  Dr. Paul McCray, Professor of Pediatrics, Microbiology, and Internal Medicine at the University of Iowa (here), previously explained to Reuters via email how a COVID-19 vaccine using a DNA or RNA vector would work:  As is the case with a vaccine that uses an inactivated (dead) virus, \u201cthe only modification to the host is to stimulate them to make antibodies and T cells that will prevent infection with the virus or kill any infected cells to prevent or reduce disease severity. This is what happens if you get a virus infection naturally, but the vaccine takes the risk of serious disease out of the equation.\u201d  VERDICT  False. Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate is stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius because of the mRNA vaccine\u2019s inherent instability \u2013 the very cold temperature slows down the chemical reactions that break apart RNA. Though both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain synthetic genetic material, they do not genetically modify humans receiving them.  This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

That compared with flu vaccines, in which such reactions occur at a rate of 1.3 per 1 million shots.  The severe reactions are still \u201cexceedingly rare,\u201d they said, stressing the need for people to get vaccinated when the shots become available to them, given the threat of death and serious disease from the coronavirus that has already claimed more than 357,000 lives in the United States alone.  The CDC said it is monitoring allergic reaction incidents closely and plans to post weekly updates on its website.  The agency is also urging that venues that deliver the vaccine be prepared not only to recognize serious allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, but be trained on how to treat them and recognize when individuals need to be referred to hospitals for additional care.  CDC officials said 28 people who received the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech had severe allergic reactions. They also noted one case of anaphylaxis, which can cause throat swelling and breathing difficulty, after an individual received Moderna\u2019s vaccine.  Officials attributed the difference largely to the fact that the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was authorized earlier than the Moderna shot, and said the precautions apply to both.  A study published on Wednesday in the CDC\u2019s weekly report on death and disease looking at cases between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23, identified 21 cases of anaphylaxis after the administration of 1,893,360 doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine. Of these, 71%occurred within the first 15 minutes after vaccine administration.  Britain\u2019s medical regulator has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food, should not be given the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.","274":"(Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday entered into a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for the supply of up to 300 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine candidate, as it tries to catch up with the United States and United Kingdom to secure supplies of experimental vaccines.

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - It turns out preventing Covid-19 is a bigger deal for markets and the global economy than the drawn-out election of a new U.S. president. News that a vaccine in the works from Pfizer and BioNTech may be over 90% effective gave stocks and government bond yields an injection of adrenalin on Monday. The prospect of a return to normality is a potent market stimulant.  European stocks popped higher, and E-Mini S&P 500 Futures traded up nearly 4%. Shares of oil groups like Royal Dutch Shell and BP, heavily dependent on a rebound in economic activity, surged over 10%. AMC Entertainment, the U.S.-listed global cinema operator under huge pressure from pandemic-related closures, saw its stock jump more than 70% at one stage in pre-market trading.  The optimism is understandable. It\u2019s hard to overstate how good the vaccine looks based on Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s statement. That level of effectiveness is sufficiently high to snuff out the pandemic via herd immunity. It is also high enough to hint that having only one of two planned doses may offer decent protection, which might allow more people to be inoculated sooner.  Manufacturing capacity presents the biggest challenge. Pfizer reckons it can make perhaps 50 million doses this year and up to 1.3 billion next year, only enough for about a sixth of the world\u2019s population. There\u2019s likely to be a tussle over which countries and demographic groups will get first dibs. Although capacity will ramp up quickly for any successful remedy, the pandemic won\u2019t simply evaporate as soon as regulators give a vaccine the nod.  Meanwhile, Pfizer has yet to release all its clinical data, and vaccines can be tricky things. The company says no serious safety concerns have emerged, but it\u2019s still collecting information. Pfizer\u2019s drug also needs to be stored at ultra-low temperatures that most doctors\u2019 offices can\u2019t provide.  Dozens of rival vaccines are in the works and many rely on more conventional medical technology and distribution methods. Pfizer\u2019s success probably means others have a shot at working as well. Once readily available, though, enough people need to get inoculated. Fewer than two-thirds of Americans say they would, for example, according to a recent Ipsos poll. Increasing that number is just one challenge for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden. Investors may find it pays not to get carried away by good scientific news.","276":"(Reuters) - Drugmakers and research centers around the world are working on COVID-19 vaccines, with large global trials of several of the candidates involving tens of thousands of participants well underway.  FILE PHOTO: The word \"COVID-19\" is reflected in a drop on a syringe needle in this illustration taken November 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 1.34 million lives worldwide:  Who is furthest along?  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX.O22UAy.DE released final late-stage trial data on Wednesday that showed their shot was 95% effective at stopping COVID-19, the highest efficacy rate so far.  The companies are the first to publish final Phase III efficacy and safety data and plan to apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the United States within days.  On Monday, another U.S. pharmaceutical company, Moderna Inc MRNA.O, released interim data showing that its vaccine worked in a large, late-stage clinical trial with a 94.5% efficacy rate.  Interim late-stage trial results for Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine published on Nov. 11 showed the shot is 92% effective.  The next data release will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N says it is on track to deliver data this year.  What happens in these trials?  The companies are testing their vaccines against a placebo - typically saline solution - in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.  What were pharma companies waiting for to release data?  The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with the coronavirus, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data.  Early in the trials, infection rates were low. With a surge in infections around the globe in October and November, trial participants became infected more quickly.  Pfizer\u2019s final results were based on 170 cases within its trial involving more than 43,000 participants.  Moderna conducted its interim analysis after 95 participants developed COVID-19 while Russia\u2019s examination was conducted after 20 volunteers developed the disease.  AstraZeneca said two weeks ago that a slowdown in infections during the summer is delaying data analysis for its UK trial.  How well are the vaccines supposed to work?  The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy in trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants at least 50% - which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The European Medicines Agency has said it may accept a lower efficacy level.  When will regulators rule on safety and efficacy?  Pfizer\/BioNTech plan to submit an EUA application in the United States within days. Moderna aims to file an application in the coming weeks once it has the two months of safety data on half the trial participants, as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That should happen in the second half of November.  That means an FDA decision is unlikely before December.  Regulators for Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada are considering data as it becomes available. It is not clear when companies will submit efficacy data or when the agencies would make a decision.  Could these be the first widely available coronavirus vaccines?  Yes, although China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people.  At least four Chinese vaccines are far along including those from China National Biotec Group [CHNAPF.UL] (CNBG), CanSino Biologics 6185.HK and Sinovac Biotech SVA.O.  Sinovac said on Wednesday mid-stage trial results showed its CoronaVac vaccine triggered a quick immune response but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who had recovered from the disease.  CNBG has said to expects early trial data as soon as November.  Russia has also given the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute to 10,000 members of the general population considered at high risk of contracting the virus.","277":"LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - There are around 4,000 variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 around the world now so all vaccine manufacturers including Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc are trying to improve their vaccines, a British minister said.  \u201cIts very unlikley that the current vaccine won\u2019t be effective on the variants whether in Kent or other variants especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalisation,\u201d Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi told Sky.  \u201cAll manufacturers, Pfizer-Biontech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant - there are about 4,000 variants around the world of Covid now.\u201d (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge and Andy Bruce)","278":"FILE PHOTO: A member of medical staff holds a phial of the Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine jab, at Guy's Hospital, on the first day of the largest immunisation programme in the British history, in London, Britain December 8, 2020.

U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were up 6 basis points as job data was expected to increase pressure on Washington to pass a new round of stimulus to help the coronavirus-battered economy.  A bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus aid plan gained momentum in the U.S. Congress on Thursday as conservative lawmakers expressed their support and Senate and House of Representatives leaders huddled. \u201cThe U.S. yields jumped and German government bonds are up a bit in sympathy, but way less than one could have expected,\u201d Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING in London, said.  German benchmark 10-year bond yields were up 0.5 basis point to -0.54%.  Still, up 4.5 basis points this week, German 10-year yields recorded their biggest weekly rise since Pfizer announced three weeks ago that its vaccine was highly effective.  Bets that the vaccine would prove key in helping the global economy had pushed safe-haven 10-year Bunds after Pfizer\u2019s announcement to their worst session since March.  Italy\u2019s 10-year yield was last up 3 basis points at 0.59%, after having nearly touched record lows in early trade. .  Some headlines are likely to have contributed to Friday\u2019s mixed market sentiment.  European Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said the EU would push on with its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.14 trillion) financial package to revive the bloc\u2019s economy even if Hungary and Poland continue trying to veto the project.  Meanwhile Hungary and Poland dug in their heels in a dispute with the European Union over efforts to link the disbursement of funds with rule-of-law provisions, dashing tentative hopes that a compromise could soon be agreed.  However, the news had little impact on southern European borrowing costs, which have been mostly driven by expectations of additional stimulus at the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting next Thursday.  Some investors are focused on a Fitch Ratings review of Italy that is due out later on Friday.  In April Fitch cut Italy\u2019s credit rating to one notch above junk at BBB- and has been more proactive than other rating agencies in downgrading sovereigns during the COVID-19 crisis. But analysts don\u2019t expect it to take action now that EU and ECB policy support is firmly in place.","281":"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc on Thursday sued Pfizer Inc to require its rival to cover any damages it is forced to pay as a result of hundreds of lawsuits claiming Allergan deceptively marketed an opioid it acquired from a company Pfizer bought.  FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, Allergan said the \u201cprimary basis\u201d for the claims against it was the alleged improper marketing and sale of Kadian, a form of morphine, in the years before it gained rights to the painkiller in late 2008.  \u201cBut now that more than a thousand lawsuits seek to impose liability for that very marketing and sale, Pfizer has rejected any responsibility to indemnify Allergan,\u201d alleged Allergan Finance LLC, the subsidiary that filed the lawsuit.  Pfizer in a statement said Allergan\u2019s claims related to a drug it never sold and arise from a contract with King Pharmaceuticals Inc, which Pfizer acquired in 2010.  \u201cWe will review Allergan\u2019s suit and respond accordingly,\u201d Pfizer said.  Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Drugmakers including Allergan, Purdue Pharma LP and Endo International Plc are facing a wave of lawsuits by state and local governments accusing them of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing.  At least 1,021 lawsuits are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland. The first trial is set for March.  Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers pursuing the cases have compared them to the litigation by states against the tobacco industry that led to a $246 billion settlement in 1998.  In its complaint, Allergan said most of the lawsuits it faces seeking to hold it responsible for playing a role in the opioid crisis primarily relate to improper marketing of Kadian and involve allegations dating back to the mid-1990s.  The drug at that time was owned by Alpharma Inc, which King Pharmaceuticals acquired in 2008, the same year King sold the rights to Kadian to Actavis. In 2016, Actavis acquired Allergan and took on the company\u2019s name.  Sale of rights to Kadian was a condition of winning U.S. antitrust approval for King\u2019s acquisition of Alpharma.  Allergan argued that Pfizer under the terms of an agreement Actavis signed with King in 2008 was required to indemnify it for any damages arising out of the pre-2009 marketing of Kadian.  But Allergan said Pfizer has rejected its claim for indemnification.

FILE PHOTO: Syringes are seen in front of displayed Biontech and Pfizer logos in this illustration taken November 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  The head of the medicines regulator, June Raine, said no corners had been cut. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it had received the first data on the vaccine in June and carried out a rigorous rolling analysis to international standards before giving its approval.  Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the jab are needed per person to gain immunity.  Below are details on the manufacturing and storage process, and the British vaccination programme:  MANUFACTURING PROCESS:  - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below.  - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days.  - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius).  - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites.  BRITISH ROLLOUT:  - Britain will start vaccinating people early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Belgium. The speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine, Britain said.  - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year.  - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.  - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the jab.  - 50 hospitals are set up across England and waiting to accept the vaccine, vaccination centres are being set up now, and in time local health centres known as general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists will provide the jab in the community if they have those capabilities.  - The community element is likely to take on a larger role if a rival vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is approved, because it does not need such cold storage and is easier to deliver.","283":"FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020.

Pfizer said last week it would until early February reduce deliveries to Europe of the shots developed with its partner BioNTech while it upgraded production capacity.  Camilla Stoltenberg, head of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, said the company had given varying guidance, but normal supplies were expected to resume by mid-February.  \u201cPfizer has informed us of adjustments to the weekly deliveries over the coming weeks, and up to the second week of February. These adjustments of weekly shipping vary in size, and lie between 1% and 15% per week,\u201d she told Reuters.  Pfizer and BioNTech did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  EMERGENCY STOCKPILE  The country of 5.4 million has given first vaccine doses to nearly 55,000 people, mainly residents of care homes, and primarily the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  The non-European Union country is part of the bloc\u2019s vaccination purchase programme via Sweden, which is buying more than it needs and passing on doses.  \u201cWhen we get delays at short notice it is demanding on our logistics. All the time we need to have extra capacity,\u201d Stoltenberg said.  However, deliveries to municipalities would run as scheduled for the next few weeks, including second doses, she stressed.  From the start of the programme, Oslo decided to establish an emergency stockpile of 60,000 doses - a move it received criticism at home for.  \u201cSo we can compensate for a few weeks for the delays in deliveries. But this can only last for so long,\u201d said Stoltenberg.  \u201cThis is also an issue for the countries who have decided to use all the vaccines doses immediately and expect Pfizer\/BioNTech deliveries to be reliable.\u201d (Additional reporting by Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)","285":"WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - White House chief of staff Mark Meadows urged U.S. Food and Drug Administration head Stephen Hahn to authorize Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine by Friday and quipped that he should prepare to resign if not, a senior administration official said on Friday.

The drug is one of 17 being tested on humans in a frantic global race to find a vaccine the world is counting on to end a pandemic that has infected 10.5 million people and killed more than half a million so far.  The potential treatment is the fourth early-stage COVID-19 drug to show promise in human testing, along with projects involving Moderna, CanSino Biologics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.  BioNTech said testing of two dosages of its BNT162b1 drug on 24 healthy volunteers showed that after 28 days they had developed higher levels of COVID-19 antibodies than typically seen in infected people.  The higher of the two doses - both administered via two injections within three weeks of one another - was followed by a short fever in three out of four participants after the second shot.  A third dosage, tested at a higher concentration in a separate group, was not repeated after the first shot because of injection pain.  \u201cThese first trial results show that the vaccine yields immune activity and causes a strong immune response,\u201d said BioNTech\u2019s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin.  He said larger trials were being prepared to show whether this translates into protection against a real infection.  No COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for commercial use. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis last year found that about one in three vaccines in the first stage of testing later gains approval.  BioNTech, which listed on the U.S. Nasdaq in October, said the data demonstrated that BNT162b1 could be administered in a dose that was well tolerated with only temporary side effects.  PEER REVIEW  Early-stage human trials of vaccines are designed to measure certain antibodies and other immune markers in the blood as an indicator of the body\u2019s readiness to fight an infection that then requires further validation.  The pharmaceutical industry is eager to launch larger follow-up trials to see how vaccinated participants react to real infections over longer periods.  BioNTech and Pfizer will now pick the most promising of four experimental vaccines for a trial involving up to 30,000 healthy participants, which is likely to begin in the United States and Europe in late July, if it gets the regulatory green light.  If it eventually gets marketing approval, the companies are gearing up to make up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and another 1.2 billion doses by the end of 2021 at sites in Germany and the United States.

FILE PHOTO: Vials of AstraZeneca's COVISHIELD, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, are seen before they are packaged inside a lab at Serum Institute of India, Pune, India, November 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas\/File Photo  Once front-runners in a global race to develop a vaccine, the AstraZeneca and University of Oxford partnership has been overtaken by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States.  The following are details of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine effort.  TYPE OF VACCINE  - Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine is a recombinant viral vector vaccine, meaning a virus is used as a means of delivering the vaccine.  - It uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus that encodes instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to generate an immune response and prevent infection.  DOSAGE, PROTECTION DURATION AND STORAGE  - AstraZeneca has said the UK authorisation was for a two dose regime.  - Two regimens are being tested: one in which recipients get two full doses, and another with half a dose followed by a full dose.  - The half-dose first regimen was found to be 90% effective in a subset of trial subjects. The success rate was 62% with the originally planned two full doses, based on interim data.  - In December, Oxford said the vaccine has a better immune response when a two full-dose regime is used, citing data from early trials.  - Immune response could last at least a year.  - The vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant, and studies are under way to fully probe the impact of the mutation.  - The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions for at least six months, making it logistically easier to transport than Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.  - AstraZeneca aims to supply millions of doses in the first quarter to Britain and is working with the UK government for first vaccinations to begin early in the new year.  EXPECTED DOSAGE PRICE  - Pricing in Britain is unknown so far.  - Italy\u2019s health ministry said in June the vaccine would cost about 2.5 euros ($2.80) per dose in Europe.  - AstraZeneca has said it will be able to manufacture the vaccine at a few dollars per dose.  - Pricing in Latin America is not expected to exceed $4 per dose.  - Serum Institute of India has said it would price the vaccine at $3 per dose for India and other emerging economies.  - Sources told Reuters it could cost $4 to $5 per dose in Bangladesh.  - Costs in other regions have not yet been disclosed.  - AstraZeneca has said it would not profit from the vaccine during the pandemic, but a report from the Financial Times in October showed the company can declare when it considers the pandemic to have ended in its deals for the vaccine.  - AstraZeneca will look to profit from wealthier countries at the \u201cappropriate time\u201d.  TESTING AND DATA  - Trials combining the vaccine with Russia\u2019s Sputnik V will start by the end of the year, and Russia wants to jointly produce the new vaccine if it is proven to be effective.  - Vastly divergent performance with different dose regimens has called for more clarity on the vaccine\u2019s efficacy which averaged 70.4%, well below vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, but above the 50% threshold set by many regulators.  - Serum Institute of India will continue to test a two full dose regimen of the vaccine.  - AstraZeneca had to pause global trials on Sept. 6 after an unexplained illness in a participant.  - Trial of the vaccine in the United States resumed in October after other countries had ended their pause.  - AZD1222 produces an immune response in both old and young adults, and also led to lower adverse responses among the elderly, AstraZeneca said in October.  - The vaccine also accurately follows genetic instructions programmed into it by its developers, according to an analysis by independent scientists.  - Brazil said in October that a trial volunteer had died.  - A source told Reuters the Brazilian trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 vaccine, although the death was reported to be a suicide.  - In July, data from early-stage trials published in The Lancet showed the vaccine was safe and produced an immune response.  DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE  - The lead developer had said in July the vaccine could be rolled out by year-end, but the delivery and testing timeline has since been pushed back.  - Data read-out submitted to regulators across the world to seek approval.  - Experts have predicted a safe and effective vaccine could take 12-18 months to develop, even at the record speeds.  TARGET DOSES\/GLOBAL CAPACITY OF SUPPLY  - More than 3 billion doses are planned.  - The company will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, and 700 million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.  - AstraZeneca is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and refrigerate it when the vaccine gets closer to approvals.  TIE-UPS  - Even before studies showed any signs of efficacy, AstraZeneca had signed several supply and manufacturing deals around the world.  - It also joined forces with IQVIA to speed up testing.  - AstraZeneca has been granted protection from future liability claims related to the vaccine by most of the countries with which it has struck supply agreements, a senior executive told Reuters in July.","294":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  * FTSE 100 flat, FTSE 250 down 0.4%  Dec 2 (Reuters) - London-listed shares were muted on Wednesday as fears about a no-deal Brexit overshadowed news that the UK had become the world\u2019s first country to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the shot are needed per person to gain immunity.  Below are details on what the government, companies and health service have said about the manufacturing and storage process, logistics of the rollout, who gets the vaccine and where they will get it.  MANUFACTURING PROCESS:  - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below.  - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days.  - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius).  - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites.  LOGISTICAL DETAILS:  - Pfizer dispatched initial volumes of vaccine from Belgium, which arrived at secure locations in Britain by the weekend. Around 800,000 doses are expected to be available in the first week of rollout.  - After arriving, there is a post-delivery quality assurance process to ensure the vaccine\u2019s quality and integrity has been maintained through transit, which can take 12-24 hours.  - Each box is then opened and unpacked manually, with temperature data downloaded from each box.  - There are five packs of 975 doses per box. Only sites with the right regulatory licence can split the vaccine packs, which limits where they can be sent in the first instance.  WHICH PEOPLE GET IT WHEN?  - Britain has said the speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine.  - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year.  - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.  WHERE WILL PEOPLE GET IT?  - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the vaccine.  - At first, the vaccine will be available from around 50 \u201cHospital Hubs\u201d, where shots will be defrosted and then prepared.  - Over 1,000 local vaccination centres, operated by groups of general practitioners (GPs), will then open. The health service has asked doctors to be ready to begin vaccinations from Dec. 14.  - When there is more vaccine and it is possible to split the packs up, the government has said it plans bigger vaccination centres and smaller arrangements through local pharmacies.

This website uses personal Facebook testimonies from family members and friends of the deceased (bit.ly\/3tGsgL1, bit.ly\/3tGbewu), and in some cases, news reports (bit.ly\/3jvQRxn).

REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  The U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday that the civil settlement resolves allegations that Pfizer improperly used the Patient Access Network Foundation as a conduit to cover co-payment obligations of patients taking three Pfizer drugs.  Pfizer\u2019s actions enabled the New York-based drugmaker to boost prices and revenue, violating the federal False Claims Act in a scheme that ran from 2012 to 2016, the department said.  The False Claims Act bans drugmakers from offering anything of value to induce Medicare patients to buy their drugs.  The accord resulted from an industrywide probe led by the office of U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Boston of drugmakers\u2019 support of patient assistance charities.  \u201cKickbacks undermine the independence of physician and patient decision-making, and raise healthcare costs,\u201d Chad Readler, the acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, said in a statement.  Pfizer said the settlement was not an admission of liability, but reflected its \u201cdesire to put this legal matter behind it and focus on the needs of patients. The company believes all individuals deserve access to medicines prescribed by their physicians.\u201d  The largest U.S. drugmaker also entered a five-year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Drugmakers are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in Medicare, the government health plan for older Americans, but may donate to independent non-profits that provide such assistance.  Pfizer was accused of working with a third party specialty pharmacy, Advanced Care Scripts, to move patients taking its kidney cancer drugs Sutent and Inlyta to the foundation, rather than provide the drugs for free to qualified patients.  The government also said Pfizer worked with the foundation to create a fund for patients taking its heart drug Tikosyn, and coordinated the fund\u2019s opening with a price hike.  Advanced Care Scripts became part of CVS Health Corp CVS.N in 2015. \"We are not aware of any allegation of wrongdoing by ACS,\" a CVS spokesman said.

The Calcalist article quoted Professor Eitan Friedman, the head of Israel\u2019s Helsinki Committee, who initially responded to the claims on Facebook here . He said the vaccinations themselves did not constitute a clinical trial but confirmed the committee had been investigating the types of data being sent to Pfizer about vaccinated citizens. This was said to be for the purposes of future research.  An English translation of his remarks was provided by Israel\u2019s business newspaper Globes. In a report here the newspaper translates Friedman\u2019s remarks as follows: \u201cWe are currently checking if the agreement is according to regulations protecting privacy in clinical trials and we will issue an official announcement on our conclusions.  \u201cWe are responsible for protecting the medical privacy of Israel\u2019s citizens and as part of this work we are examining the agreement and if it protects the rights of citizens.

The vaccine is not a clinical trial and we call on everyone that doesn\u2019t have a contraindication to go and get vaccinated. We want to make sure as the Helsinki Committee that the rights and privacy of the State of Israel are being protected even if clinical research is being conducted, then it should be appropriate research.\u201d  The Israeli Ministry of Health also commented on the issue to the newspaper (here). It said in a statement: \u201cWe are talking about a vaccine that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EU's European Medicines Agency (EMA) and from that point of view there is no clinical trial here which requires the Helsinki Committee.

Despite the nation\u2019s dire shortage of foreign exchange, the government expects to sign the deal for supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this week, Health Minister Hamad Hassan told Reuters on Monday.  The minister initially put the value of the deal at $18 million, but he clarified on Wednesday that this figure was still being negotiated.  Officials previously said Lebanon was in talks to secure 1.5 million shots of the vaccine.  The first payment of $4 million \u201cwas secured\u201d in a meeting with the central bank and outgoing prime minister.  \u201cWe removed this obstacle,\u201d the minister said, adding that the first batch of vaccines was expected to arrive eight weeks after the signing.  Lebanon has also signed up to join COVAX, a global scheme backed by the World Health Organization to provide vaccines to poorer countries.  Lebanon\u2019s latest two-week lockdown to curb a surge in infections ended this month. The authorities have struggled to enforce coronavirus restrictions in a country where half the nation has slipped into poverty.  As hospitals have filled up, Hassan said Lebanon aimed to add 200 more intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the next two months, raising the total to 700.  He urged U.N. agencies and non-governmental organisations to help secure more vaccines for Lebanon, where refugees make up at least a quarter of the population.  \u201cProtecting all the communities living in Lebanon ... should be part of the same plan,\u201d he said.","308":"FILE PHOTO: Syringes to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine are seen at a nursing home in Burgbernheim, Germany December 28, 2020.

Purchases were at the fastest rate since the middle of April, when Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to end their volume war, causing funds to buy 122 million barrels (tmsnrt.rs\/3f8LIJE).  For the most part, portfolio managers last week purchased crude and products to close out previous bearish short positions (+89 million barrels) rather than initiating new bullish long positions (+25 million).  Buying was broadly spread across Brent (+36 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (+23 million), U.S. gasoline (+18 million), U.S. diesel (+15 million) and European gasoil (+22 million).  In almost all cases, except U.S. gasoline, buying was concentrated on repurchasing of previous short positions rather than opening new long ones.  Pfizer\u2019s announcement increased the probability of a business cycle upturn and a resumption of international passenger aviation next year, weighted towards the second half.  It therefore eased some of the extreme pessimism that had swept across the market in the second half of October and early November, as the number of coronavirus cases accelerated worldwide.  Even after the short-covering rally, however fund positioning remained cautious, reflecting concern about the time it will take to deploy a vaccine and the possibility for a virus-driven winter recession in the meantime.

The National Health Service (NHS) confirmed to Reuters that in a weekly webinar with NHS England on Thursday, clinicians were told they could use the sixth dose \u201cat their discretion\u201d.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told Reuters it was aware of the advice from NHS regarding the use of any surplus, and that the regulator had raised no objections.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had said on Wednesday that extra doses from vials of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine can be used after reports of vaccine doses being thrown away by pharmacists due to labelling confusion.  The Pfizer vials are supposed to hold five doses, according to the labelling, but media reports said pharmacists had found a way for a sixth or even a seventh dose. Without clear approval from the manufacturer, the extra dose had to be discarded.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech shot, the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by Western drugs regulators, is being rolled out in countries including Britain and the United States, and is expected to be approved for use in the European Union next week.  Pfizer, on Friday, said it had applied for an approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in Japan.

There are now rather more data accrued with, it is said, no serious side effects.  \u201cIt seems there is some evidence that in older adults...there is also very good efficacy with minimal side effects.

The detail on achieving 94% protection in the elderly participants in the trial is particularly excellent news.  \u201cWe will need to wait and learn over time how long the protection lasts, and to see whether this vaccine can also prevent transmission \u2013 meanwhile, this vaccine does look likely to have a strong role immediately once it is approved in protecting health workers and the vulnerable from disease.\u201d  LUCIO ROVATI, CEO, ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, ITALY  \u201cThese percentages are very high and extremely promising.

The region of 450 million people is trying to catch up with the United States and Britain, which have already started vaccinations using the Pfizer shot.  The European Union is due to receive 12.5 million doses by the end of the year, enough to vaccinate 6.25 million people based on the two-dose regimen. The companies are scrambling to meet global demand and aim to make 1.3 billion shots next year.  The bloc has secured contracts with a range of drugmakers besides Pfizer, including Moderna and AstraZeneca, for a total of more than two billion vaccine doses and has set a goal for all adults to be inoculated during 2021.  With surveys pointing to high levels of hesitancy towards the vaccine in countries from France to Poland, leaders of the 27-country European Union are promoting it as the best chance of getting back to something like normal life next year.  \u201cWe have a new weapon against the virus: the vaccine. We must stand firm, once more,\u201d tweeted French President Emmanuel Macron, who tested positive for the coronavirus this month and left quarantine on Christmas Eve.  \u201cCompletely painless,\u201d Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos said after getting his vaccination in a hospital in Athens.  COOLING CONCERNS  The distribution of the shot presents tough challenges as the vaccine uses new mRNA technology and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112\u00b0F).  In Germany, the campaign faced delays in several cities after a temperature tracker showed that about 1,000 shots may not have been kept cold enough during transit.  BioNTech said it had responded to queries from German districts on whether the shots could still be used but declined to specify what it had told them. Pfizer referred Reuters to its German partner for comment.  The Pfizer shots being used in Europe were shipped from its factory in Puurs, Belgium, in specially designed containers filled with dry ice. They can be stored for up to six months at Antarctic winter temperatures, or for five days at 2C to 8C, a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals.  In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers - a symbol of spring - sprouted in town squares as the vaccination drive kicked off.

Branka Anicic, an 81-year-old resident of a care home in Zagreb, became the first person to get a shot in Croatia. \u201cI\u2019m happy I will now be able to see my great-grandchildren,\u201d she said.

German pilot Samy Kramer celebrated the vaccination campaign by tracing out a giant syringe in the sky. He flew 200 km (125 miles), following a syringe-shaped route that showed up on internet site flightradar24.  \u2018FIRST MAN ON THE MOON\u2019  The vaccination drive is all the more urgent because of the concern around new variants of the virus linked to a rapid expansion of cases in Britain and South Africa.  \u201cWe know that the pandemic won\u2019t just disappear as of today, but the vaccine is the beginning of the victory over the pandemic, the vaccine is a \u2018game changer\u2019. We have always know that, and today is the first day of this new phase,\u201d Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Over the past week, cases of the UK variant have been detected in Australia, Hong Kong and in several European countries, mostly recently Sweden, France, Norway and Portugal\u2019s island of Madeira. So far, scientists say there is no evidence to suggest the vaccines developed will be any less effective against the new variants.  While Europe has some of the best-resourced healthcare systems in the world, the sheer scale of the effort means some countries are calling on retired medics to help while others have loosened rules for who is allowed to give the injections.  Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres left vacant by lockdown restrictions will become venues for mass inoculations.  Vaccinations also started in Norway, which is not a member of the bloc but part of the EU\u2019s drive.  \u201cI feel like a historical figure ... almost like the first man on the Moon,\u201d said care home resident Svein Andersen, 67, as he received the country\u2019s first shot in the capital Oslo.  After European governments were criticised for failing to work together to counter the spread of the virus in early 2020, the goal this time is to ensure that there is equal access to the vaccines across the region.  But even then, Hungary on Saturday jumped the gun on the official roll-out by administering shots to frontline workers at hospitals in the capital Budapest. The Netherlands said it will not start vaccinating until Jan. 8.  Slovakia also went ahead with some inoculations of healthcare staff on Saturday and in Germany, a small number of people at a care home were inoculated a day early too.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to waste that one day that the vaccine loses shelf life,\u201d Karsten Fischer, from the pandemic staff of the Harz district in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt, told broadcaster MDR.","316":"(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc and partners have delivered the first COVID-19 vaccines to 141 of 145 locations targeted by the U.S. government for the first day of a nationwide rollout on Monday, a Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman said.

The company said it is still looking for options for the lower-margin, non-core consumer healthcare business that makes products ranging from painkiller Advil to lip balms and is worth about $15 billion.  \u201cGiven the lack of urgency, management is being rational about its divestiture,\u201d BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said, adding the new structure will help Pfizer maintain its options for the business.  The news comes a day after Pfizer deferred drug price increases for no more than six months, following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.  Starting 2019, Pfizer\u2019s new units would be Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare.  The company is currently split into two units - Innovative Medicines, which includes the consumer business, and Essential Health which houses legacy drugs such as Viagra.  \u201cThis design gives us a sharper focus on diverse patients in diverse markets,\u201d Albert Bourla, chief operating officer, said.  The innovative medicines business will include biosimilars and a new hospital business unit, and together with the consumer healthcare business, will account for about three-quarters of the company\u2019s revenue. Pfizer\u2019s 2017 annual revenue was $52.55 billion.  The established medicines unit would now include a majority of the company\u2019s brands such as soon-to-be off-patent neurological disease treatment Lyrica as well as some generic drugs.  The restructuring will allow the company to evaluate its businesses better and could result in selling or spinning off its off-patent drugs, Wall Street analysts said.  While the company expects the business to generate sustainable moderate revenue growth after Lyrica goes generic, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said the reorganization would allow the established medicines unit to have more autonomy.  \u201cWe believe the potential for Pfizer to ultimately sell or spin the business likely remains on the table over time,\u201d Divan said.  Pfizer shares were trading marginally down at $37.27 in early trading.","327":"BUCHAREST\/PRAGUE\/SOFIA (Reuters) - Pfizer has slashed in half the volume of COVID-19 vaccines it will deliver to some EU countries this week, government officials said on Thursday, as frustration over the U.S. drugmaker\u2019s unexpected cut in supplies grows.

Hendrik Schmidt\/Pool via Reuters\/File Photo  Romania got only 50% of its planned volume for this week, the other half being allocated gradually by the end of March, with deliveries returning to normal starting next week, Deputy Health Minister Andrei Baciu told Reuters.  It was a similar situation in Poland which on Monday received 176,000 doses, a drop of around 50% from what was expected, authorities said.  The Czech government was bracing for the disruption to last weeks, slowing its vaccination campaign just as second doses get under way.  \u201cWe have to expect that there will be a reduction in the number of open vaccination appointments in the following three weeks,\u201d Health Minister Jan Blatny told reporters, with Pfizer deliveries falling by about 15% this week and as much as 30% for the following two weeks.  Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have declined to comment on the cuts beyond their statement last week, which announced cuts to deliveries as they ramp up manufacturing in Europe.  Some countries reckon they can handle it. Norway has an emergency stockpile and will continue administering doses as planned, the government\u2019s public health body said.  The U.S. drugmaker has told Bulgaria and Poland it will replace missing doses, top officials said.  But Denmark\u2019s Serum Institute said its 50% loss of shots this week would lead to a 10% shortfall for the first quarter.  Italy, meanwhile, is threatening legal action against Pfizer, with COVID-19 special commissioner Domenico Arcuri saying on Thursday that the country has been told to expect a 20% cut next week after reducing this week\u2019s supply by almost 30%  UNDERMINING EFFORTS  With governments across the region still reeling from the surprise cuts, officials say the reductions are undermining their efforts to inoculate their citizens and tame the pandemic which has killed more than 2 million people.  Adding to the upheaval are worries about supplies of special syringes needed to extract six doses from each vial of Pfizer\u2019s shot.  Europe\u2019s disease surveillance agency warned on Thursday that three variants of the coronavirus that emerged in Britain, South Africa and Brazil will lead to more COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths.  In Hungary, where the authorities gave the go ahead for the use of Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca and Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccines ahead of the EU drug regulator, a senior official called on Brussels to try and ensure deliveries from Pfizer and other vaccine makers would stick to schedule.  \u201cWe would be happy if the (European) Commission could take steps as soon as possible to ensure that Pfizer and other manufacturers would change deliveries,\u201d Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas said.

Results are trickling in, and they are promising.  More than half of eligible Israelis - about 3.5 million people - have now been fully or partially vaccinated. Older and at-risk groups, the first to be inoculated, are seeing a dramatic drop in illnesses.  Among the first fully-vaccinated group there was a 53% reduction in new cases, a 39% decline in hospitalizations and a 31% drop in severe illnesses from mid-January until Feb. 6, said Eran Segal, data scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.  (Graphic: Trends in COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations in Israel following vaccination - )  In the same period, among people under age 60 who became eligible for shots later, new cases dropped 20% but hospitalizations and severe illness rose 15% and 29%, respectively.  Reuters interviewed leading scientists in Israel and abroad, Israeli health officials, hospital heads and two of the country\u2019s largest healthcare providers about what new data shows from the world\u2019s most efficient vaccine rollout.  The vaccine drive has provided a database offering insights into how effective the vaccines are outside of controlled clinical trials, and at what point countries might attain sought-after but elusive herd immunity.  More will be known in two weeks, as teams analyse vaccine effectiveness in younger groups of Israelis, as well as targeted populations such as people with diabetes, cancer and pregnant women, among a patient base at least 10 times larger than those in clinical studies.  \u201cWe need to have enough variety of people in that subgroup and enough follow-up time so you can make the right conclusions, and we are getting to that point,\u201d said Ran Balicer, chief innovation officer of HMO Clalit, which covers more than half the Israeli population.  Pfizer is monitoring the Israeli rollout on a weekly basis for insights that can be used around the world.  As a small country with universal healthcare, advanced data capabilities and the promise of a swift rollout, Israel provided Pfizer with a unique opportunity to study the real-world impact of the vaccine developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech  But the company said it remained \u201cdifficult to forecast the precise time when herd protection may start to manifest\u201d because of many variables at play, including social distancing measures and the number of new infections generated by each case, known as the reproduction rate.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Even Israel, in the vanguard of the global vaccine drive, has lowered expectations of emerging quickly from the pandemic because of soaring cases.  A third national lockdown has struggled to contain transmission, attributed to the fast-spreading UK variant of the virus. On a positive note, the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot appears to be effective against it.  \u201cWe\u2019ve so far identified the same 90% to 95% efficacy against the British strain,\u201d said Hezi Levi, director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry.  \u201cIt is still early though, because we have only now finished the first week after the second dose,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to say anything about the South African variant.\u201d  WHICH ARM?  Israel began its vaccination programme Dec. 19 - the day after Hanukkah - after paying a premium for supplies of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  Four days later, the more contagious UK variant was detected in four people. While the vaccine is preventing illness in older people, the variant now makes up about 80% of new cases.  Finding themselves in a race between the vaccine and the new variant, Israel began giving shots to those over 60 and gradually opened the programme to the rest of the population.  Every detail was digitally tracked, down to in which arm the patient was jabbed and what vial it came from.  One week after receiving the second Pfizer dose - the point at which full protection is expected to kick in - 254 out of 416,900 people were infected, according to Maccabi, a leading Israeli healthcare provider.  (Graphic: COVID-19 infections among vaccinated people - )  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Comparing this against an unvaccinated group revealed a vaccine efficacy of 91%, Maccabi said.  By 22 days after full vaccination, no infections were recorded.  Israeli experts are confident the vaccines rather than lockdown measures brought the numbers down, based on studying different cities, age groups and pre-vaccine lockdowns.  The comparisons were \u201cconvincing in telling us this is the effect of the vaccination,\u201d said Weizmann Institute\u2019s Segal.  With 80% of senior citizens partially or fully vaccinated, a more complete picture will begin to emerge as soon as this week.  \u201cAnd we do expect further decline in the overall cases and in the cases of severe morbidity,\u201d said Balicer, of HMO Clalit.  VACCINES AND TRANSMISSION  There may be early signs that vaccinations are tamping down virus transmission in addition to illness  At Israel\u2019s biggest COVID-19 testing centre, run by MyHeritage, researchers have tracked a significant decrease in the amount of virus infected people carry, known as cT value, among the most-vaccinated age groups.  This suggests that even if vaccinated people get infected, they are less likely to infect others, said MyHeritage Chief Science Officer Yaniv Erlich.  \u201cThe data so far is probably most clear from Israel. I do believe that these vaccines will reduce onward transmission,\u201d said Stefan Baral, from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Maryland.  DIMINISHING RETURNS  It is unclear whether Israel will be able to keep up its world-leading vaccination pace.  \u201cWhen you vaccinate fast and a lot, you eventually get to the hardcore - those who are less willing or harder to reach,\u201d said Boaz Lev, head of the Health Ministry\u2019s advisory panel.  The vaccination pace is seen even more crucial with the British variant\u2019s rapid transmission.  \u201cIn the race between the UK variant spreading and the vaccinations, the end result is that we are seeing a kind of plateau in terms of the severely ill,\u201d said Segal.  The big question is whether vaccines can eradicate the pandemic.  Michal Linial, a professor of molecular biology and bioinformatics at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University, said data from past decades suggests viruses become endemic and seasonal.  She predicted this coronavirus would become far less aggressive, perhaps requiring a booster shot within three years.  \u201cThe virus is not going anywhere,\u201d she concluded.","331":"(Reuters) - Global equity funds took in $44.5 billion in the week to Wednesday, the biggest ever on record, following the U.S. election outcome and Pfizer\u2019s encouraging news on its coronavirus vaccine, BofA Research said on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: Syringes are seen in front of displayed Biontech and Pfizer logos in this illustration taken November 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Pfizer and German partner BioNTech said this week their experimental COVID-19 vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage, is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results.  COVID-19 has killed over a million people and battered the world\u2019s economy. Just under 33,000 people have died in Colombia, which held more than five months of national quarantine earlier this year.  \u201cColombia is working on the development of ultra-freezing in five cities,\u201d Health Minister Fernando Ruiz said in a statement. \u201cNevertheless, the mechanism that Pfizer is using for these vaccines includes ultra-frozen delivery until the point of application.\u201d  The vaccine, stored in \u201cspecialized boxes\u201d, can be used for an average of between 10 and 20 days once it reaches its application location, the statement added.  The government and Pfizer held a meeting to discuss freezing and transport, which will be supplied by the company, the ministry said.  Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously said it has detailed plans and tools to support vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring.  Colombia, which provides 22 vaccines free of charge and will include COVID vaccinations under the same scheme, said last month ultra cold-storage vaccines could present distribution challenges.  Immunizing remote populations in the Andean nation\u2019s mountains and jungles sometimes requires transportation by river or on horseback, journeys that could prove difficult if extremely low temperature storage is needed.  Officials have raised similar concerns for countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America grappling with tropical heat, remote communities and lack of infrastructure. Even wealthier nations like Japan and South Korea say storage will be logistically complex.  Colombia initially wants to vaccinate 15 million people - more than a fifth of its population - who are older than 60, have pre-existing conditions or work in healthcare.  The global COVAX initiative will provide for 10 million people and the country is seeking the remainder in talks with drugmakers.  \u201cCOVAX is committed to delivering vaccines from the second half of 2021.

Justifying the decision to prioritise those without a history of COVID-19, the ministry said reinfection within six months was \u201cexceptional\u201d.  A major British study published last week found 99% of participants who previously tested positive retained antibodies for three months, while 88% still had them after six months.  \u201cIf vaccine is in short supply and they are confident that they can reliably and confidently identify previously infected people, there is some rationale to this,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at Britain\u2019s University of Edinburgh.  People older than 55 or those with health risks that make them vulnerable to reinfection would be exempted from the delay, the ministry said.  So far, healthcare professionals are the only people under 55 being inoculated, under Spain\u2019s vaccine strategy.  With its third wave receding, Spain\u2019s 14-day infection rate dropped to 493 cases per 100,000 people on Tuesday, down from around 900 just two weeks ago.  The death toll climbed by 643 to 63,704, while the health ministry reported 18,114 infections, bringing the overall tally to 3.02 million.  As authorities begin to inoculate a broader section of society with the recently approved AstraZeneca shot, Madrid\u2019s regional government said it would convert stadiums and other big venues into vaccination centres.  Elsewhere in Europe, several Italian epidemiologists have said it is useless to vaccinate those who have already been infected, but Rome has not taken any decision on whether to administer jabs to recovering patients.  France\u2019s public health agency believes there is no need to inoculate people who developed a symptomatic form of the disease, although those patients can still take a shot three months after the onset of symptoms.

India, the world\u2019s biggest vaccine-making country, wants to start inoculating its citizens next month and is also considering emergency use authorisation applications for vaccines made by Pfizer Inc and local company Bharat Biotech.  Getting vaccines to the world\u2019s second-most populous country with one of the highest infection rates will also be a big step in the battle against the pandemic.  The AstraZeneca-Oxford shot is considered vital for lower-income countries and those in hot climates because it is cheaper, easier to transport and can be stored for long periods at normal fridge temperatures.  India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) first reviewed the three applications on Dec. 9 here and sought more information from all the companies, including from Serum Institute of India (SII), which is making the AstraZeneca shots.  SII, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, has now provided all the data, the two sources said.

Both sources said Indian health officials were in direct contact with their British counterparts over the AstraZeneca shot and that there were \u201cstrong indications\u201d an approval would come by next week.  The expected approval comes after data from AstraZeneca\u2019s late-stage trials in the UK and Brazil released earlier this month showed the vaccine had efficacy of 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose.

In the late stage trial of Bavencio, the drug could not be shown to improve survival in lung cancer patients that had previously undergone unsuccessful chemotherapy, Merck said.  Bavencio, or avelumab, is already approved in two smaller cancer types. It competes against other immunotherapy cancer drugs such as Merck & Co\u2019s Keytruda, Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s Opdivo, which are both approved for certain types of lung cancer patients, among various other tumor types.  The class also includes Roche\u2019s Tecentriq and AstraZeneca\u2019s Imfinzi.  Merck said the results of the late-stage trial, called Javelin Lung 200, may have been skewed by an unusually high number of patients in the comparable control group on chemotherapy that were allowed to switch to a rival immunotherapy because their disease had worsened further.  Merck KGaA\u2019s shares traded 0.8 percent lower at 1622 GMT, shortly before the market close, little changed from before the news broke.  Separately, Merck and Pfizer are testing Bavencio in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients that have no prior treatment, seen as the bigger market opportunity, but results are not expected before the European summer of 2019.  \u201cWe are confident of the role of Bavancio to play in the lung cancer market,\u201d said Luciano Rossetti, the head of research and development at Merck\u2019s pharmaceuticals division.  Improvements in survival versus the control group were, however, seen in a subgroup of patients with moderate or high levels of a genetic marker called PD-L1 in their tumors, but those findings were not statistically significant.  PD-L1 also describes the way in which some tumors manage to evade attacks from the body\u2019s immune system. The current class of immunotherapy drugs are design to thwart that disguise mechanism.  Detailed results from the trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress.

He said the company has 15 potential blockbuster medicines in the pipeline that could be launched by 2022.  Pfizer also sees opportunities to significantly expand sales of prostate cancer drug Xtandi for treating less advanced patients, and arthritis drug Xeljanz for ulcerative colitis.

It did not raise its full-year earnings or revenue forecasts.  Despite strong growth, sales of oral rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz and blockbuster breast cancer treatment Ibrance missed expectations largely due to inventory stocking issues but are likely to rebound, analysts said.  Injected arthritis drug Enbrel was hit by competition from cheaper biosimilars outside the United States. Vaccines and other older drugs, such as Lyrica, Premarin and Celebrex all fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates.  Ibrance sales rose 37.4 percent to $933 million, while analysts looked for $956.6 million. Xeljanz sales totaled $326 million, missing the Wall Street outlook by about $72 million.  Total revenue rose 1 percent to $12.91 billion, while analysts expected $13.13 billion.  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said he expected stronger international sales, given favorable foreign exchange rates.  \"If you remove the FX tailwind it would have been a much more substantial miss,\" he said, adding that it was disappointing Pfizer did not raise its 2018 forecasts after rivals, such as Merck & Co MRK.N and AbbVie ABBV.N, raised their outlooks after reporting first-quarter results.

A day after top U.S. health officials announced plans to begin vaccinating Americans as early as mid-December, British regulators granted emergency use approval to the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc along with Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE .  Dr. Jose Romero, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said U.S. officials will be watching closely to see what they can learn from the British experience with a vaccine that requires extreme refrigeration.  \u201cI\u2019m personally interested to see how well they can deliver it and how their transport systems, the dry-ice trays that hold this vaccine, function in the real world,\u201d Romero told CNN.  \u201cDoes it keep the vaccine cold? Are there any issues involved in getting the vaccine out from a central point into the public sector? We can learn from that and adjust our plans as necessary,\u201d Romero said.  The vaccine still faces regulatory hurdles in the United States.  A Food and Drug Administration panel of outside advisers will meet on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of the Pfizer vaccine. Moderna\u2019s vaccine candidate is expected to be reviewed a week later, and others are under development.  While some U.S. health officials described a timeline that assumed FDA authorization would come within days of the Dec. 10 meeting, the head of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Dr. Peter Marks, told patient advocacy groups last week that it might take \u201ca few days to a few weeks.\u201d  FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, likewise, has said the process could take longer, and the vaccine calls for two separate injections given three weeks apart.  \u201cIt does take two doses to get the full 95% efficacy, but there\u2019s a possibility that some patients will derive protection after one dose, so the vaccine can start having an immediate impact,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Trump administration and a member of the Pfizer board of directors, told CNBC television.  With many Americans still refusing to follow basic public health guidance on wearing masks and avoiding crowds, a vaccine could be crucial to arresting a raging pandemic that killed 10,000 people and infected 1.1 million last week alone in the United States.  Another 2,624 new U.S. deaths were reported on Tuesday, raising the cumulative death toll above 270,000 since the pandemic began. More than 13 million have been infected.  A record 96,000 COVID-19 patients were reported in U.S. hospitals on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, at a time when exhausted healthcare professionals are short-staffed with many of their colleagues falling sick.  Dr. Tom Mihaljevic, president of the renowned Cleveland Clinic, told MSNBC television on Wednesday that his hospital had three and a half times as many coronavirus patients now as it did in April during the first wave of the outbreak.  \u201cThe hospitals are full,\u201d Mihaljevic said. \u201cVirus is currently everywhere.\u201d  He also cautioned against further spread over the year-end holidays, after millions of Americans defied official warnings and traveled for Thanksgiving last week.  \u201cThis pandemic is spreading in families,\u201d Mihaljevic said. \u201cWhen people get together with people they know under their own roof, then that is when the guard comes down.

Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies, now likely will not raise drug prices until after the 2018 midterm elections in November.

Pfizer raised list prices on around 40 medicines earlier this month. Those include Viagra, cholesterol drug Lipitor and arthritis treatment Xeljanz, according to Wells Fargo. List prices do not include rebates and discounts drugmakers may offer.  The Trump administration has not yet taken significant action to lower drug prices. Azar has said lowering prices long term will take years because of the complexity of the healthcare system.  Trump rolled out a blueprint in May on how his administration planned to lower drug prices. Trump said in May that some drug companies would announce \u201cvoluntary, massive\u201d price decreases in two weeks, though none have materialized yet.  Pharmaceutical company shares rose after Trump unveiled his drug pricing blueprint.

Last month, Moderna also began a study to test its vaccine, which uses a similar technology as the Pfizer vaccine, in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18.","362":"BEIJING, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Chinese state media outlets have run a series of articles criticising Western COVID-19 vaccines in the past week, including Pfizer\u2019s, while touting China-made vaccines as safer and more accessible.  The reports have come as China\u2019s vaccines, which are being rolled out to countries including Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey, have faced criticism in the West for insufficient data disclosure.  The Global Times, a tabloid published by the People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, has published more than ten reports in the past week critical of vaccines and inoculation schemes in the West.  About half of them have referred to reported deaths of some highly frail patients in Norway after being inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccine developed Pfizer and its partner BioNTech.  In a Jan. 15 editorial, the Global Times accused mainstream U.S. and British news outlets of \u201cdeliberately downplaying the deaths\u201d and \u201cusing propaganda power to promote the Pfizer vaccine and smearing Chinese vaccines.\u201d  \u201cThose major Western media will immediately hype any unfavourable information about Chinese vaccines and try to amplify their impact on public psychology,\u201d it said.  Norwegian authorities have not established a causal link between the deaths and vaccination and said on Jan. 18 they were not changing their policy on using the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  Liu Xin, an anchor with CGTN, China\u2019s English-language state TV channel, on Jan. 16 tweeted screenshots of an unverified report of 10 deaths after vaccinations in Germany.  \u201cCan\u2019t independently verify but it\u2019s concerning,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWhat about following it up? Hello??? @BBCWorld @CNN @AP @Reuters.\u201d  A Global Times report on Tuesday cited Chinese experts saying Australia should consider halting regulatory procedures for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine until the investigation of the deaths is over.  It also said Australia should purchase Chinese-developed vaccines, \u201cwhich are relatively safer due to their mature technology\u201d.  The Global Times has also argued that Chinese vaccines are cheaper and easier to transport, and portrayed Pfizer as an unreliable supplier, sacrificing need in other countries to prioritise supply for the United States.  Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.  The U.S. drugmaker said last week it was temporarily slowing supplies of its COVID-19 vaccine to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output.  Final stage clinical trials showed the vaccine was 95% effective, with no major safety concerns. (Reporting by Beijing Newsroom and Yew Lun Tian.

No state has purchased vaccines directly from the producer. Cuomo\u2019s letter did not state how many doses he was seeking or how he would pay for it.  Outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration had promised to administer 20 million vaccinations by the end of 2020 but only about 10.6 million people had received one or more doses as of last Friday.

Data showed U.S. factory activity slowed for a second straight month in April, weighed down by shortages of skilled workers and rising capacity constraints, but strengthening global demand continued to support manufacturing.  The Institute for Supply Management survey also showed a jump in raw material costs, with steel and other prices increasing due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.  U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the Trump administration was prepared to levy tariffs on China if an American delegation heading to Beijing did not reach a settlement on trade imbalances.  The news came after Trump on Monday extended a temporary reprieve from metal tariffs for the EU, Canada and Mexico until June 1, just hours before they were due to come into force.

Here are some questions and answers about the cases and what they might mean.  WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?  Two UK health care workers with a history of significant allergic reactions reported anaphylactoid reactions and are recovering well.  Anaphylactoid reactions are allergic reactions that share some of the characteristics of anaphylaxis but are less severe, said UK Drug Safety Research Unit Director Saad Shakir. Anaphylaxis can cause throat swelling, breathing trouble, and difficulty swallowing, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. UK authorities did not describe symptoms further.  WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE VACCINE, ACCORDING TO UK REGULATORS?  British regulators initially responded by saying anyone with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food should not take the shot. An adviser to the group later said it was \u201ctweaking\u201d advice in part to say a food allergy was not a risk.  Pfizer had excluded people with a history of significant adverse reaction to vaccines or its vaccine\u2019s ingredients from late stage trials.  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT PROSPECTS FOR U.S. AUTHORIZATION?  U.S. regulators are expected to consider emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine soon after a Thursday meeting of advisers.  Moncef Slaoui, who is spearheading the U.S. government\u2019s vaccine development efforts, said on Wednesday he expected the British allergic reactions would be considered in the U.S. authorization process and that people with known severe allergic reactions probably should not take the vaccine until more was understood.  WHAT DO DOCTORS SAY?  Some praised UK regulators\u2019 caution and others said broad restrictions were not warranted by available evidence.  \u201cFor the general population, this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  What would be wise, he said, would be \u201cfor anyone who has known severe allergic reaction such that they need to carry an EpiPen to delay having a vaccination until the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified.\u201d  Mayo Clinic virologist Gregory Poland, who has advised U.S. regulators, said Britain\u2019s response was \u201coverdoing it,\u201d pointing to the initial response about food allergies, which he said \u201chave nothing to do with this.\u201d  \u201cI would have said, \u2018If you\u2019ve had anaphylactic-level reactions to vaccines, we want to know about that so we take extra care,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t immunize you. But I would do it in a more controlled setting.\u201d  Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, added: \u201cThe fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that the monitoring system is working well.\u201d  Mitchell Grayson, director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio, voiced concern over how the issue might cut interest in vaccinations. \u201cI\u2019m worried the whole event will cause millions of people to choose not to get vaccinated because of what they heard,\u201d he said.  HOW COMMON ARE SEVERE OR SIGNIFICANT ALLERGIES?  \u201cIn the UK in 2012 there were around seven hospital admissions per 100,000 people for severe allergies. This included different triggers such as foods, drugs and insect stings,\u201d said Louisa James, a expert in immunology at Queen Mary University of London. Fatalities remain very rare and have not increased even as hospital admissions have risen in many countries.

The vaccination drive kicked off at the weekend, with health workers and residents of care homes across the bloc among the first to get the Pfizer and BioNTech shots, which must be kept at ultra-cold temperatures.  There were initial hiccups: officials in southern Germany said on Monday they would dump around 1,000 doses after finding they had not been properly chilled. Temperature controls also caused a delivery delay in Spain.  In Italy, meanwhile, some politicians complained that Germany - the EU\u2019s largest member state and home to BioNTech - may be getting more than its fair share of shots.  The teething troubles are an early test of the EU\u2019s decision to procure vaccines jointly, which has left the bloc lagging the United States, Britain, Israel and Switzerland in approving and administering the first vaccines.  The EU is due to receive its first 12.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by New Year\u2019s Day, with distribution of 200 million doses across its 27 member countries to be completed by next September. The vaccine course requires two doses.  Talks are under way to agree on the delivery of an optional further 100 million doses under the contract sealed with the two companies, the EU says.  The EU has sealed agreements with other drugmakers besides Pfizer, including Moderna and AstraZeneca, for more than two billion doses in total. It wants to inoculate all adults by the end of next year.  KEEPING COOL  As well as being the first COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered across the EU, the Pfizer shot is also particularly tricky to handle. For long-term storage it needs to be deep frozen at around minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit). It can be defrosted for a few days before being used, but even then must be kept chilled.  In southern Germany, officials said they would not use some shots after temperature trackers showed they may not have been kept cold enough.  \u201cThere were doubts as to whether the cold chain was maintained at all times,\u201d said Christian Meissner, district administrator in the Bavarian town of Lichtenfels. \u201cBioNTech said that the vaccine was probably okay, but \u2018probably okay\u2019 is not enough,\u201d he told Reuters TV.  In Spain, the delivery of a new batch from Pfizer was held up by a day to Tuesday due to an issue with temperature controls that has now been resolved, Health Minister Salvador Illa said.  Maria Asuncion Ojeda, a resident at Madrid\u2019s Ballesol Parque Almansa nursing home, was still delighted to be an early recipient of the Pfizer vaccine.  \u201cI wanted to do it because it\u2019s the only way we can solve this problem,\u201d the 87-year-old said on Monday, a day after Spain began vaccinating care-home residents and their staff.  FAIR SHARES  The EU is distributing the jointly procured vaccines on a pro-rata basis to the 27 member states based on their populations, while European countries have also made their own deals to buy extra doses separately.  In Italy, some politicians said Germany appeared to be getting more than its fair share, at least during the highly symbolic initial rollout.  \u201cThe accounts don\u2019t add up,\u201d Italian virologist Roberto Burioni said on Twitter, pointing to reports in Germany that first-day deliveries had totalled 150,000 doses while other EU countries got just 10,000.  An official familiar with vaccine distribution in Germany said that each of the 16 German federal states had received 10,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine ahead of the weekend start of the inoculation drive.  An Italian journalist asked about the supplies at a German government news conference. An official from the German health ministry replied that Berlin had signed a separate deal for 30 million extra doses of the Pfizer vaccine.","369":"July 6 (Reuters) - Mission Therapeutics:  * MISSION THERAPEUTICS SAYS RAISES $15 MILLION AND EXPANDS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH PFIZER  * HAS RAISED $15 MILLION IN EQUITY INVESTMENT; ROUND WAS LED BY EXISTING INVESTOR PFIZER VENTURES  * MISSION, PFIZER HAVE EXPANDED THEIR RELATIONSHIP BY ENTERING INTO EVALUATION AND OPTION AGREEMENT FOR DUB TARGET VALIDATION  * PFIZER TO ACCESS SPECIFIC DUB INHIBITORS FROM CO\u2019S PLATFORM, TEST THESE COMPOUNDS IN PHENOTYPIC SCREENS TO VALIDATE PROMISING DRUG TARGETS  * PFIZER WILL THEN HAVE OPTION TO NEGOTIATE TARGET EXCLUSIVITY FOR EACH OF DUBS OF INTEREST  * AGREEMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY OF MISSION\u2019S OWN LEAD DUB PROGRAMS, SUCH AS USP30 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","370":"Dec 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and partners have delivered the first COVID-19 vaccines to 55 locations nationally, or about one third of the 145 locations targeted to receive doses by early afternoon on Monday, U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said on a call with reporters.

Together with Pfizer Inc's PFE.N vaccine, which is also more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available this year.  The vaccines, both developed with new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), represent powerful tools to fight a pandemic that has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million.  Unlike Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, Moderna\u2019s shot can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, which should make it easier to distribute, a critical factor as COVID-19 cases are soaring, hitting new records in the United States and pushing some European countries back into lockdowns.  \u201cWe are going to have a vaccine that can stop COVID-19,\u201d Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview.  Moderna\u2019s interim analysis was based on 95 infections among trial participants who received the vaccine or a placebo. Only five infections occurred in volunteers who received the vaccine mRNA-1273, which is administered in two shots 28 days apart.  \u201cThe vaccine is really the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert said. He urged Americans not to let their guard down and to continue washing hands and being vigilant about social distancing.  Even with fast authorization, the vaccines will not come in time for most people celebrating the U.S. Thanksgiving and end-of-year holidays, when families and friends come together - just the types of gatherings public health officials warn against.  Moderna expects to have enough safety data required for U.S. authorization in the next week or so and expects to file for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the coming weeks.  The company's shares, which have more than quadrupled this year, jumped 8%, while European and U.S. stocks rose. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX rose 1%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX climbed 1.3%. [MKTS\/GLOB]  Shares in Pfizer and its partner BioNTech BNTX.O, whose vaccine must be transported at far colder temperatures, fell 4.3% and 16.4% respectively, while Britain's AstraZeneca AZN.L, which has yet to release any results from its late-stage vaccine trials, was down 1%.  (For graphic on U.S. biotech shares: )  SEVERE CASES  Moderna\u2019s data provide further validation of the promising but previously unproven mRNA platform, which turns the human body into a vaccine factory by coaxing cells to make virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and attacks.  Moderna expects the vaccine to be stable at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48\u00b0F) for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20C.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccine must be shipped and stored at -70C, the sort of temperature typical of an Antarctic winter. It can be stored for up to five days at standard refrigerator temperatures, or for up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The data from Moderna\u2019s trial involving 30,000 volunteers also showed the vaccine prevented cases of severe COVID-19, a question that still remains with the Pfizer vaccine. Of the 95 cases in Moderna\u2019s trial, 11 were severe and all 11 occurred among volunteers who got the placebo.  Moderna, part of the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program, expects to produce about 20 million doses for the United States this year, millions of which the company has already made and is ready to ship if it gets FDA authorization.  \u201cAssuming we get an emergency use authorization, we\u2019ll be ready to ship through Warp Speed almost in hours,\u201d Hoge said. \u201cSo it could start being distributed instantly.\u201d  The 95 cases of COVID-19 included several key groups who are at increased risk for severe disease, including 15 cases in adults aged 65 and older and 20 in participants from racially diverse groups.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cWe will need much more data and a full report or publication to see if the benefit is consistent across all groups, notably the elderly, but this is definitely encouraging progress, said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  The trials were designed to measure whether the vaccines stop people from getting sick rather than whether they prevent transmission, which remains to be tested.  \u201cIt is likely that vaccines that prevent symptomatic disease will reduce the duration and level of infectiousness, and thus reduce transmission, but we don\u2019t yet know if this effect will be large enough to make any meaningful difference to the spread of the virus within communities,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh.  ROLLING REVIEW  Most side effects were mild to moderate. A significant proportion of volunteers, however, experienced more severe aches and pains after taking the second dose, including about 10% who had fatigue severe enough to interfere with daily activities while another 9% had severe body aches. Most of these complaints were generally short-lived, Moderna said.  \u201cThese effects are what we would expect with a vaccine that is working and inducing a good immune response,\u201d said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.  The U.S. government, faced with the world\u2019s highest known number of COVID-19 cases, could have access next year to more than 1 billion doses from Moderna and Pfizer, more than needed for the country\u2019s 330 million residents.  The Trump Administration has mainly relied on the development of vaccines and treatments as its response to the pandemic. Moderna has received nearly $1 billion in research and development funding from the U.S. government and has a $1.5 billion deal for 100 million doses. The government has an option for another 400 million doses.  The company hopes to produce between 500 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, split between its U.S. and international manufacturing sites, depending in part on demand.  Europe's health regulator said on Monday it had launched a real-time \"rolling review\" of Moderna's vaccine, as it has done for vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca AZN.L. Brussels also said it was in talks with Moderna about securing doses.  Other countries such as China and Russia have already begun vaccinations. Russia licensed its Sputnik-V COVID-19 vaccine for domestic use in August before it started large-scale trials. It said on Nov. 11 that its vaccine was 92% effective based on 20 infections in its large trial.","377":"OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday said the whole nation was frustrated by how slowly provinces are vaccinating people against the coronavirus and promised Ottawa would help speed the pace of inoculations.

Trudeau said the campaign had to be carried out as quickly as possible.  \u201cAll Canadians, including me, are frustrated to see vaccines in freezers and not in people\u2019s arms,\u201d he told reporters.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue working closely with the provinces ... to support them as they need it in terms of getting more vaccines out to vulnerable populations and front line workers as quickly as possible,\u201d he added.  Canada has recorded a total of 16,074 deaths and 611,242 cases of coronavirus and the new number of daily cases continues to set records.  Around a third of cases have been found in Ontario, the most populous province, where Premier Doug Ford said doses were running out.  \u201cOur message to the federal government (is) - just keep these vaccines coming,\u201d he told Toronto reporters.  Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, told Ottawa media that \u201cthe next months are going to be really difficult\u201d and said Canada had detected nine cases of a new variant of the virus first found in Britain.  Discovery of the variant prompted Canada to slap a ban on flights from Britain. The measure expires on Jan. 6, and Trudeau said Ottawa had not yet decided whether to extend it.","378":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Pfizer Inc\u2019s oral drug, tafamidis, to treat a rare and fatal heart disease called transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, the U.S drugmaker said.  FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly  Pfizer, which has touted tafamidis as a potential blockbuster product, set a list price of $225,000 a year for the medicine, which would be sold under the brand name Vyndaqel. It is the first approved medicine for the disease in the United States.  Analysts are forecasting annual sales to exceed $1 billion in 2024, according to Refinitiv data.  The FDA also approved another oral formulation of tafamidis under the brand name Vyndamax, with a recommended dose of either Vyndaqel 80 mg once-daily, taken as four 20 mg capsules or Vyndamax 61 mg once-daily, taken as a single capsule.  \u201cThere were three factors we took into consideration on this price: the transformative nature of this compound, the population ... and the third would be our capacity to ramp up diagnosis over time,\u201d Paul Levesque, head of rare disease at Pfizer, said in a phone interview.  Quickly reaching more than 30 percent of a rare disease population with a new drug is very rare, Levesque said.  Pfizer believes there are about 100,000 people in the United States with the condition, the vast majority undiagnosed. Only about 2,000 to 5,000 patients are currently diagnosed with the progressive heart disease globally.  The company has been in talks with insurers and is confident the drug will be reimbursed at the $225,000 price, he said.  The drug, which received FDA breakthrough status in May, reduced the risk of death for patients with the disease by 30 percent when compared with placebo in clinical trials.  In 2012, tafamidis was rejected by the FDA as treatment for a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease called familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). But it is approved in 40 other countries for that disease.  Vyndaqel currently sells for about $100,000 a year outside the United States as a treatment for FAP. It was approved in Japan for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy in May at a price of around $750,000 a year that was set by a government body, Pfizer said.  As the disease primarily affects an older population, a significant percentage of U.S. patients will likely be on the government\u2019s Medicare program.  For those Medicare patients unable to afford potentially high copays on the medicine, Pfizer said it will have a program to make Vyndaqel available through patient assistance programs.  Pfizer believes there could be 400,000 to 500,000 patients in developed markets around the world and said the current rate of those diagnosed may be as low as 0.5 percent to 1 percent.  Pfizer said that the frequency of adverse of effects in patients treated with the drug was similar to those on placebo.  Both Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc have approved medicines that treat a similar disease called hereditary TTR amyloidosis, also caused by a buildup of transthyretin protein in the body. Those drugs cost around $450,000 a year.  Pfizer has touted tafamidis as one of its \u201c15 in 5\u201d - 15 experimental treatments in development, each with at least $1 billion annual sales potential that the drugmaker hopes to launch over a five-year period.  Shares of Pfizer were flat at $41.39 on Monday morning.","379":"LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother from Britain, has become the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine outside of a trial following its clinical approval.

On Dec. 11, the FDA said it authorized the use of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which was shown to be 95% effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial ( here ).  FDA\u2019S FINDINGS  According to the FDA\u2019s briefing document dated Dec. 10 here , Bell\u2019s palsy was reported in four vaccine participants and none in the placebo group, out of the 44,000 total participants of the late-stage vaccine trial ( here ).  But the FDA stated that \u201cthe observed frequency of reported Bell\u2019s palsy in the vaccine group is consistent with the expected background rate in the general population, and there is no clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time.\u201d Still, the agency recommended surveillance of this condition once the vaccine is distributed into larger populations.  Reuters previously clarified other claims around the side effects of the Pfizer vaccine here .  BELL\u2019S PALSY  As explained by Johns Hopkins Medicine here , Bell\u2019s palsy is an episode of facial muscle weakness or paralysis, that \u201cusually resolves on its own and causes no complications.\u201d  While its cause is unknown, it is thought to be caused by \u201cinflammation affecting the body\u2019s immune system\u201d. It is associated with the body\u2019s response to viral infection, and with other conditions such as diabetes.  The symptoms of the condition, which include headache and pain, twitching or weakness in one side of the face, begin suddenly and it usually worsens within the next 48 hours, leading to the face drooping and a lopsided smile ( here ).  Some posts on social referring to the FDA\u2019s findings claim that Bell\u2019s palsy is a permanent condition ( here ). Experts note that in most cases, the weakness is temporary and significantly improves within weeks, \u201cwith full recovery in about six months\u201d ( here ).  The FDA briefing states that one of the four cases \u201cwas reported as resolved with sequelae within three days after onset\u201d.

FILE PHOTO: Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson arrives to attend a Cabinet meeting at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in London, Britain December 1, 2020. REUTERS\/Henry Nicholls  Johnson, 56, who spent time in intensive care earlier this year after contracting COVID-19, has hailed the UK approval of Pfizer Inc\u2019s vaccine as a global win and ray of hope amid a pandemic that has hurt the economy and upended normal life.  But, like other leaders, Johnson cannot be seen to be jumping the queue for the vaccine, ahead of more vulnerable people. However, he wants to illustrate its safety to try to persuade others to take it when it is more widely available.  Asked if the prime minister would take the shot live on television, press secretary Allegra Stratton said she had not asked him directly.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be something he would rule out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think we also know that he wouldn\u2019t want to take a jab that should be for someone who is extremely vulnerable, clinically vulnerable and who should be getting it before him.\u201d  Johnson has said the shots would be voluntary, and a snap YouGov poll found that 20% of Britons were either not confident or not very confident that it was safe. There was support for the health minister Matt Hancock getting a shot live on TV, with 66% backing the idea.  Britain\u2019s government has said the health service will prioritise vaccinations, putting older residents in care homes and their carers first, then all those over 80 and frontline health workers.  Johnson has spoken openly of his struggle with COVID-19 in April, saying he fought for his life and that it was 50-50 whether the doctors were going to put him on a ventilator.  He said his weight was an underlying condition that made his condition worse and has since spoken frequently about his attempts to lose the pounds. Stratton said she did not know whether his weight might put him in a more vulnerable group, adding that he has been exercising more.  Johnson\u2019s spokesman also said it was a matter for Buckingham Palace whether 94-year-old Queen Elizabeth received a vaccination. A palace spokesman declined to comment on whether the queen would get a shot, saying royal medical matters were traditionally kept private.  The queen and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, who would be in the second priority tier for a vaccine, have spent national lockdowns this year with a small number of staff at Windsor Castle to the west of London.  They are planning to stay there over Christmas, rather than travelling to Sandringham in eastern England as they traditionally do.","384":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s medicines regulator said on Wednesday that final late-stage trial results from Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate were very encouraging, adding it would need to see the full data before making an assessment of the shot.

The U.S.-listed shares of the German firm climbed about 10%, while Pfizer\u2019s stock rose about 2% before the bell.  The companies are in a global race with Moderna Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and others to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, which has claimed over 568,500 lives globally, according to a Reuters tally.  There are no approved vaccines for COVID-19, and the United States and other countries have poured billions into their development as they seek to secure a safe and effective vaccine.  The fast track status could potentially make Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine candidates, BNT162b1 and BNT162b2, eligible for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u2018priority review\u2019, under which the agency aims to decide on an approval within six months.  Moderna Inc, which is developing a potential vaccine using similar technology as Pfizer\/BioNTech, won the same status for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate in May.  BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 are the most advanced of the at least four vaccines being assessed by the companies in ongoing trials in the United States and Germany.  Earlier this month, the companies said the testing of two dosages of BNT162b1 on 24 healthy volunteers showed that after 28 days they had developed higher levels of COVID-19 antibodies than typically seen in infected people.  The companies said they expect to start a large trial with up to 30,000 participants as soon as later this month, upon regulatory approval.  They also expect to make up to 100 million doses by the end of this year and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by 2021-end, if the vaccine is successful.","387":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech SE 22UAy.F said on Tuesday they have begun delivering doses of their experimental coronavirus vaccines for initial human testing in the United States.  The U.S. drugmaker and German partner said if the vaccine proves to be safe and effective in trials, it could potentially be ready for wide U.S. distribution by the end of the year, shaving several years off the typical vaccine development timeline.  The vaccine, which uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, has the potential to be among the first vaccines against the virus that has infected more than 1 million people in the United States and killed some 68,000.  There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the new coronavirus, though some drugs are being used on patients under an emergency use authorization.  The U.S. study is part of a broader, global program already underway in Germany, where BioNTech is based. Dosing there began last month.  Moderna Inc MRNA.O is using similar technology for its vaccine being developed along with the U.S. government. Phase I testing of that vaccine candidate has also begun, with mid-stage trials planned in the current quarter.  Pfizer said last week it hopes to receive emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as October, and could distribute up to 20 million doses by the end of 2020, with an eye toward producing hundreds of millions of doses next year.

Using synthetic mRNA technology can enable the vaccine to be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines, the companies said.  Pfizer said last week it expects to make safety data on the vaccine available by late May.  The trial will initially aim to test different dosing regimens of four potential vaccine candidates on around 360 healthy volunteers divided into a younger cohort and a group of seniors.  The trial will expand to more subjects after researchers determine which compounds and dosing regimens are most effective, said Kirsten Lyke, a director at the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, which is participating in the trial.  Doses have already been administered to some volunteers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  Pfizer plans to expand the trial to sites across the United States in early July, and may ultimately enroll more than 8,000 participants, a company spokeswoman said.  If successful, the U.S. clinical trial would be one of the fastest ever progressions of a vaccine from early stage studies to regulatory approval, compressing a development process that often takes as much as a decade to just over 9 months.  \u201cThis is the equivalent of doing phases one, two and three of a typical clinical trial but all compressed into the May through October time frame,\u201d Lyke said.  BioNTech is producing the vaccine for the trials in its European manufacturing facilities. Pfizer is investing in developing its own manufacturing capacity for the vaccine, and is preparing sites in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Belgium to begin producing it.  Both companies will jointly commercialize the vaccine, if approved.","388":"FILE PHOTO: A medical worker prepares a syringe of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in France, January 12, 2021.

The application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) comes just days after Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.DEBNTX.O reported final trial results that showed the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 with no major safety concerns.  Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla confirmed the application had been made in a video posted on the company\u2019s website on Friday afternoon.  The FDA said on Friday it would hold a meeting of the advisory committee on Dec. 10 at which members would discuss the vaccine. The agency declined to predict how long its review would take, although both Pfizer and U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar have said the FDA could authorize the vaccine in mid-December.  Pfizer\u2019s shares closed up 1.4% and BioNTech shares ended 9.6% higher in New York, as the possibility of a vaccine soon raised hopes for the end of a pandemic that has claimed more than a quarter of a million lives in the United States and over 1.3 million worldwide.

Pfizer has said it expects to have 50 million vaccine doses ready this year, enough to protect 25 million people.  The final trial data showed the vaccine provided a similar level of protection across different ages and ethnicities - an encouraging result as the disease disproportionately hurts the elderly and minorities.  Of the 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19 in Pfizer\u2019s trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received only a placebo, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective, far higher than originally expected. The U.S. FDA had set minimum bar for efficacy of 50%.  Pfizer said nearly 42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants in the Phase 3 study have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds.  \u201cFiling in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine,\u201d Bourla said in a statement.  Moderna Inc MRNA.O is expected to be the next company to seek a U.S. emergency use nod for a COVID-19 vaccine. An initial analysis of data from its late-stage trial showed the vaccine was 94.5% effective. Final results and safety data are expected in the coming days or weeks.  Both the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work using a new technology to trigger an immune response known as synthetic messenger RNA that can be produced at scale much more quickly than traditional vaccines.  Of dozens of drugmakers and research institutions racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data is expected to come from AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L, which is working with the University of Oxford, in November or December.  Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said it expects to have data needed to seek U.S. authorization for its experimental vaccine by February.","390":"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) chief said on Tuesday it hopes to have a COVID-19 vaccine by year-end and that Pfizer\u2019s experimental remedy is \u201ca very promising one\u201d, with more expected.  But the vaccine, based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, comes with special challenges as it needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below - equivalent to an Antarctic winter.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated the United Nations agency\u2019s call for an equitable distribution of vaccine doses once they are available.  Pfizer said on Monday that its COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective as it disclosed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test.

Earlier on Monday, President Jair Bolsonaro said that the government will offer COVID-19 vaccines to all Brazilians free of charge, once health regulator Anvisa gives it scientific and legal approval.

He expects Anvisa to approve it, regardless of the political storm between Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria over competing vaccines.  \u201cI want to think that no political problem is bigger than people\u2019s lives,\u201d Covas said in an interview with GloboNews.

Doria has frequently clashed over the vaccine with Bolsonaro, an aggressive China critic who has baselessly dismissed the Sinovac candidate as lacking credibility.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 - news which lifted global markets with a wave of risk appetite, which subsided somewhat overnight before re-igniting on Tuesday.  The dollar rose after the announcement. Although the dollar is a safe-haven, and so typically falls on positive news, analysts said the move was caused by investors quitting long positions in other major safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.  The dollar edged up slightly and stayed close to the previous session\u2019s highs, as market participants tempered their initial pro-risk reaction, in light of uncertainty about how or when a vaccine could be rolled out.  Neil Jones, head of FX sales for financial institutions at Mizuho, said he expected the risk-on moves to continue.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s over and don\u2019t think the foreign exchange market will become completely skeptical,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt will not write off the prospect of a vaccine \u2013 even though we need more clarity in terms of the distribution, quantities, timeline, and to whom,\u201d he said. \u201cOn balance, that optimism will remain for now.\u201d  At 1229, the dollar was at 92.792 against a basket of currencies, slightly up on the day.  The dollar has lost around 1.4% this month as Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the U.S. presidential election provided a major boost to market sentiment.  The Japanese yen, which had its biggest one-day fall since March after the vaccine announcement, clawed back some of its losses but was still relatively weak at 105.155 at 1220 GMT.  \u201cFollowing a euphoric market reaction such as that the question that now arises is whether it was justified or possibly exaggerated,\u201d wrote Commerzbank FX and EM analyst You-Na Park-Heger in a note to clients.  \u201cEven if the news of a vaccine could be a game changer, we urge caution, as the massive euphoria could be followed by some disenchantment,\u201d she said.  Euro-dollar was broadly flat on the day at $1.1815. In the previous session it rose to as high as $1.192, but went no further, which Mizuho\u2019s Jones said could be due to the European Central Bank having signalled its awareness of the downsides of rapid euro strength.  \u201cThe market is a little bit concerned about repeat verbal intervention in the euro around the 1.20 area so I think sellers maybe dropped their offers down lower than that 1.20, thinking that that might be the limit of the upside,\u201d Jones said.  The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - was broadly flat on the day versus the dollar, as its jump in the immediate aftermath of the vaccine news proved short-lived.  The New Zealand dollar was up 0.2%, in its seventh consecutive session of gains.  The Norwegian crown, which also benefited from the vaccine news, extended its gains versus the euro on Tuesday, up 0.4% on the day at 10.644.  China\u2019s offshore yuan, which has been gradually strengthening since May, hit new 2.5-year highs versus the U.S. dollar on Monday but eased some gains on Tuesday, up 0.2% on the day at 6.6028 at 1228 GMT.

Merck\u2019s has yet to begin human studies of its experimental vaccine, lagging the leading candidates.  Executives from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc testified that they will price their respective potential vaccines at no profit while the pandemic rages on.  Gerberding and a representative from Moderna did not comment on the price they have in mind for their vaccines at the hearing, which focused on efforts to develop a safe, effective and widely accessible vaccine against COVID-19, which has claimed 600,000 lives globally.  Pfizer Inc has said the company intends to make a profit from its potential coronavirus vaccine if approved. However, Pfizer Chief Business Officer John Young, testified: \u201cWe recognize that these are extraordinary times and our price will reflect that.\u201d  Unlike rivals Moderna and AstraZeneca, Pfizer has not received funding from the United States for its vaccine development.  Lawmakers questioned whether Pfizer had declined government funding so it could price the vaccine at a profit.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t access federal funding solely for the reason that we wanted to move the vaccine faster to the clinic,\u201d Young said.  AstraZeneca said its vaccine would be provided at no profit under its agreement with the United States for allocation of some 300 million doses.  More than 150 coronavirus vaccines using a variety of technologies are in development globally, with some two dozen already in human trials. The aim is to produce vaccines that can end the pandemic by protecting billions of people from infection or severe illness. Whether any will succeed or be available by the U.S. government\u2019s stated goal of having one by late this year remains far from clear.  \u201cSpeed is important,\u201d Gerberding said of the vaccine development, \u201cbut we will not compromise scientific efficacy, quality, and above all, safety, despite the sense of urgency we all feel.\u201d","396":"PARIS\/BERLIN (Reuters) - European officials warned against COVID-19 complacency on Thursday and said measures to control a surge in infections as winter approaches must continue despite hopes that new vaccines can bring the pandemic under control.

REUTERS\/Carl Recine  This week\u2019s announcement by Pfizer Inc of a potentially effective vaccine spurred optimism that an end to months of crisis could be in sight, sending financial markets soaring and fuelling public longing for a nearly normal Christmas.  But health authorities and leaders across the region urged people to continue complying with lockdowns as it became clear that vaccines would not come soon enough for many COVID-19 sufferers and shrinking economies.  \u201cIt would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now,\u201d French Prime Minister Jean Castex told a news conference, warning that, despite signs of a slowdown in infections, gains were fragile. France has the highest number of cases in Europe.  \u201cThe pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously,\u201d Castex said, adding that lockdown measures imposed at the end of October would continue until at least Dec. 1.  Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech will only be able to produce enough vaccine this year to treat 25 million people, if approval is secured - not nearly enough to ease the winter strain on health systems.  In Italy, which reported 623 deaths on Wednesday and passed 1 million cases, and in Germany, which has also seen infections climb back to levels seen earlier in the crisis, officials said any return to normal would take time.  \u201cWe really must grit our teeth for a couple more months,\u201d said Lothar Wieler, head of Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.  The dire situation facing Italy, the country at the centre of the first wave of the pandemic, was underlined by a video on social media showing a corpse sprawled in a hospital lavatory, after the patient apparently died while waiting for a test.  EUPHORIA FADES  After achieving a degree of control over the pandemic with blanket lockdowns earlier in the year, governments across the region have now imposed new restrictions to try to curb a fresh surge in infections, but have yet to see improvements of the required scale.  \u201cInfections went down fast last week, but we need to make more progress,\u201d Ernst Kuipers, head of the Dutch national hospital association LNAZ, told reporters. \u201cWe keep stressing the importance of following the rules.\u201d  As the euphoria that followed Pfizer\u2019s announcement faded, European shares slipped back from their eight-month highs, with poor economic data from Britain adding to doubts about the rebound from the brutal slump caused by the first lockdowns.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Its economy lost steam in September, hardening expectations that it will shrink again as 2020 ends.  Britain passed 50,000 COVID-19 deaths this week, and the 33,470 new cases registered on Thursday were its highest daily tally to date.  \u201cDealers are starting to realise that, even though a drug has a very high success rate in late-stage trials, the process of obtaining approval and getting it rolled out could take a long time,\u201d said David Madden, analyst at CMC Markets UK.  As the crisis has ground on and jobless numbers have risen, public support for countermeasures has fractured. There have been protests in several countries, and observance of bans on public gatherings or requirements to wear masks or avoid social contact can be patchy.  The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said countries should not pin all their hopes on rapid vaccination.  \u201cWe may be tired of COVID-19 but it is not tired of us,\u201d Tedros told the Paris Peace Forum, an annual event focused this year on fostering global cooperation to beat the pandemic.  \u201cEuropean countries are struggling, but the virus has not changed significantly, nor the measures to stop it.\u201d","397":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will deploy its vast election machinery to deliver 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the most vulnerable people in the next six to eight months through conventional cold chain systems, the expert leading the initiative said on Friday.

REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas\/File Photo  The government has lined up cold storage facilities with temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48\u00b0F), said V.K. Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for COVID-19 that advises India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Paul said these preparations meet the requirements of what he said were the four emerging candidates in the race for India\u2019s vaccine.  \u201cThe four that I can see, including Serum, Bharat, Zydus, and Sputnik need normal cold chain. I see no problem for these vaccines,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  Serum Institute of India, the world\u2019s largest vaccine maker, is already mass producing and stockpiling AstraZeneca\u2019s Covishield shot, while Indian biotech players Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila are developing their own vaccine candidates.  And last month, Indian pharmaceutical player Hetero inked a deal with Russia\u2019s RDIF to manufacture over 100 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine per year in India.  The government expects the first approvals \u201cvery soon\u201d from the independent drug regulator for emergency use, he said.  \u201cI am hoping at the earliest because we are ready.\u201d  The government, however, was yet to have formal talks on pricing and had no firm purchase orders, he said.  \u201cThe Indian companies know the government will give a fair and reasonable price.\u201d  SUPPLIES AND STORAGE  At present, Indian regulators are considering three vaccines for emergency use authorisation, including those from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech.  But, Pfizer\u2019s limited stockpiles and its extreme storage condition requirements at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, would likely limit its use in India, which lacks such infrastructure.  \u201cIn a theoretical scenario, where there is no vaccine with conventional cold chain requirement, minus 70 degrees Celsius capacities will have to be created, and we will do so,\u201d Paul said.  Paul said the government is also in talks with Moderna, which also has requirements for ultra-cold storage.  India does not anticipate supplies from either Pfizer or Moderna until the second half of next year, said Paul.  \u201cWe would like to work with them (Moderna) to make that vaccine available in India, and (ensure) that vaccine is also manufactured in India - for us and for other countries. This is the call we have given to Pfizer also and we are in touch with them as well.\u201d  Paul said India may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator.  \u201cAs of now, it is a norm or standard operating procedure that any vaccine marketed in India should have human study results from the Indian subjects,\u201d he said.  India has the world\u2019s second highest caseload of coronavirus behind the United States, but its death rate has been far lower.  Still, Paul said the immediate task was to protect lives and the government had prepared a plan to administer vaccines to 300 million people - or 600 million doses at two jabs each - in the first part of the programme.  This would be made up of 260 million people above the age of 50, an estimated 10 million below the age of 50 with serious co-morbidities and 30 million frontline workers, who have borne the brunt of infections.  \u201cThe way it looks as of now, optimistically, it appears possible to cover the above population of 300 million in six to eight months\u2019 time.\u201d","398":"Nov 10 (Reuters) - Croda International Plc said on Tuesday it has entered into a deal with Pfizer Inc to supply additives for manufacturing its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, sending the shares of the UK-based specialty chemical company to a record high.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.  Following are reactions to the news.  Scientists\u2019 reactions  ---------------------  ALEXANDER GINTSBURG, DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW\u2019S GAMALEYA INSTITUTE WHICH DEVELOPED RUSSIA\u2019S MAIN VACCINE CANDIDATE, SPUTNIK V  \u201cWe welcome the progress shown by our foreign colleagues in the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus. The more vaccines are available in the world, the better people will be protected.  \u201cPeople at high risk of infection - primarily medical workers - are already being actively vaccinated in our country. Production is being scaled up and new production sites are joining the process. In the near future we expect to publish interim results of the post-registration trial of the vaccine Sputnik V, the so-called Phase III trials. I am sure that its effectiveness level will also be high.\u201d  CLEMENS WENDTNER, CHIEF PHYSICIAN OF INFECTIOLOGY AND TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEAD OF THE SPECIAL UNIT FOR HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS LIFE-THREATENING INFECTIONS, MUNICH SCHWABING CLINIC, GERMANY  \u201cThis is remarkable, as many ongoing vaccination studies on COVID-19 currently only assume a success rate of at least 50%. In addition, it should be emphasized that a sharp end point has been defined - infection yes or no. Alternatively, with less high expectations of a vaccine, already attenuated disease courses, so-called mitigated courses, could be considered a success. In addition, the mRNA vaccination appears to be effective after only four weeks, which means that one does not have to wait long for protection.\u201d  WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, UNITED STATES  \u201cThis is a hint that these mRNA vaccines are likely to work, and there\u2019s at least one other. And they\u2019re likely to be safe, at least from this trial. So that\u2019s highly encouraging. The other thing that\u2019s highly encouraging is that science can now create a vaccine in a relatively short amount of time and test it, which gives a lot of hope for the future when these things happen again.\u201d  ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL, BRITAIN  \u201cThis vaccine needs to be stored at -80c. This could create major logistical challenges for mass treatment outside major urban areas and in low or middle income countries.\u201d  \u201cHowever, overall this is a huge step forwards in the fight against COVID-19. We will need to see whether updated versions of this vaccine are needed to protect people against new strains of the virus which might emerge in future.\u201d  RICHARD HATCHETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CEPI COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS  \u201cThese are hugely positive and encouraging interim results and are testament to the ingenuity and skill of the scientific community in advancing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. We commend Pfizer\/BioNTech on this historic interim result and the speed at which they have advanced through clinical development.  \u201cWe believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio.\u201d  PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, BRITAIN  \u201cThis news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general.  \u201cOf course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.\u201d  ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, BRITAIN  \u201cAt face value, this is exceptionally good news: a vaccine that is 90% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 and with millions of doses available by the end of the year.  \u201cHowever, the full data set on which the claim is based has not yet been released and so we don\u2019t know exactly what has been found.\u201d  LAWRENCE YOUNG, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK, BRITAIN  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to interpret the interim analysis, but it does appear very encouraging.\u201d  \u201cIn this... preliminary analysis there is a significant reduction in the COVID-19, and I interpret that to mean that ... individuals are not developing disease, but it doesn\u2019t tell us anything about whether people are getting infected or not.\u201d  JOHN MOORE, PROFESSOR AT WEILL CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE, NEW YORK CITY  \u201cI can see nothing problematic.\u201d  As for what this means for other vaccines, Moore said: \u201cModerna\u2019s is likely to work as well given the similar design and performance, and Novavax also, as it seems more potent. It\u2019s harder to judge about the other candidates.\u201d  MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, BRITAIN  \u201cThis cautiously sounds like an excellent result from the phase 3 trials, but we should remain a little cautious. The provisional findings are made available in a press release, and the study is ongoing. However, if the final results show an effectiveness of anywhere near 90% with response in elderly and ethnic minority populations, that is an excellent result for a first generation vaccine.  \u201cThis has been seen before \u2013 the rapidly-produced ebola vaccine generated very high levels of effectiveness and exceeded all expectations. Equally, billions of dollars and numerous clinical trials have struggled to produce any form of vaccination against HIV. Science can be unpredictable.\u201d  AZRA GHANI, CHAIR IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON  \u201cThese new results represent the first demonstration of substantial efficacy of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19 disease which is very welcome news. It is important to bear in mind that these are early results based on a relatively small number of cases. In addition, the efficacy estimate is based on seven days of follow-up of participants following the second dose; further data in the coming weeks and months will provide a better picture of longer-term vaccine efficacy.\u201d  WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES EXPERT AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, UNITED STATES  \u201cThe efficacy data are really impressive. This is better than most of us anticipated. I would have been delighted with efficacy of 70% or 75%. 90% is very impressive for any vaccine. The study isn\u2019t completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.\u201d  IAN JONES, PROFESSOR OF VIROLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF READING, BRITAIN  \u201cOf all the vaccines currently in development the BioNtech product always looked like the most bang-per-buck as it is entirely focused on the part of the virus that binds to the human cell, the receptor binding domain.  \u201cThe only things we will not know for some time is the longevity of the response in all age groups, but assuming antibody titres are high that should be at least as good as any other vaccine currently in trial.\u201d  JOHN BELL, REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHO SITS ON THE UK GOVERNMENT\u2019S VACCINE TASKFORCE, TOLD BBC RADIO:  \u201cI\u2019m really delighted with this result for no other reason than it shows you you can make a vaccine against this little critter. As you know, there are many pathogens where we\u2019ve tried for decades and never managed to get a vaccine, you know, malaria, HIV.\u201d  \u201cDistribution of this is going to be challenging, and there\u2019s a lot of complexities associated with that. But... that\u2019s not the headline here. The headline is, we\u2019ll solve those things if we need to. But... it rolls the pitch for other vaccines because I can\u2019t see any reason now why we shouldn\u2019t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease.  \u201cOur (Oxford\u2019s) first interim analysis is also likely to be available in the very near future, and by that I mean weeks, not months. So, I\u2019m pretty optimistic that given this result, we\u2019ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well.\u201d  \u201cWhen you look at the immunological responses you get from the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine and the ones from the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and indeed even the Moderna vaccine. They all look about the same. So, I\u2019m optimistic that that probably reflects similar levels of efficacy.\u201d  FLORIAN KRAMMER, PROFESSOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, USA  \u201cThese are fantastic results. The efficacy could be higher than expected, and this probably means that - at least in the U.S. - there will be an application for approval very soon. Of course, it would be better to see age-specific data, but I suspect that these will be published soon. Frankly, this is the best news I have received since Jan. 10.\u201d  MARYLYN ADDO, HEAD OF TROPICAL MEDICINE SECTION, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER EPPENDORF (UKE), HAMBURG, GERMANY  \u201cThese are interesting first signals, but again they are only communicated in press releases. Primary data are not yet available and a peer-reviewed publication is still pending. We still have to wait for the exact data before we can make a final assessment. At present, there are still few details about the exact data, for example regarding different age groups and in which groups the 94 cases occurred exactly.\u201d  BERND SALZBERGER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL REGENSBURG, GERMANY  \u201cIn the Pfizer\/Biontech press release, the Phase II\/III placebo-controlled observer-blinded study with the vaccine BNT162b2 reported a vaccine efficacy of over 90%. Although only a few events - a total of 94 cases - have been observed in the study so far, this is a very good result. No serious side effects have been reported - overall a very positive result, which will probably lead to an early approval.\u201d  GERD FAETKENHEUER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, CLINIC I FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL COLOGNE, GERMANY  \u201cThese are great and promising data. It is incredible that in such a short period of time this progress with the development of a vaccine and clinical trials within a few months has been achieved. The results on efficacy and safety so far are excellent.  \u201cI think this will have a major impact on our handling of the pandemic and I hope that large quantities of the vaccine will be available quickly. The researchers involved can only be congratulated\u201d.  DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON  In terms of the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201cit\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s not \u2018overnight success\u2019 good news\u201d.  Altmann cautioned that this and other potentially successful vaccines would still need to be approved and delivered to people across the world, and this will still take many months.  He added, however: \u201cI always felt optimistic, and my optimism remains strong.\u201d  Government reaction  -------------------  ITALIAN HEALTH MINISTER ROBERTO SPERANZA  \u201cToday\u2019s news about the anti-COVID vaccine is encouraging. But caution is still needed. Scientific research is the real key to overcoming the emergency. In the meantime, we must never forget that the behaviour of each of us is essential to bend the curve.\u201d  SWITZERLAND\u2019S HEALTH MINISTRY  \u201cWe welcome every advance made by the global efforts to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine. The federal government is working intensively to as quickly as possible to give the Swiss people access to a safe and effective vaccine. We\u2019ve signed two contracts already, with Moderna and AstraZeneca, and we\u2019re currently in negotiations with additional, promising vaccine makers.\u201d  Corporate reaction  ------------------  LUCIO ROVATI, CEO OF ITALY\u2019S ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, WHICH IS WORKING WITH TAKIS BIOTECH ON A COVID-19 VACCINE  \u201cThis is important news. Nothing that was not expected. Anyway, great, great. The problem remains that the data is limited in duration, 28 days after the first inoculation. The problem will be to see how long the coverage lasts. But in any case it is already very important to know that there is an effective vaccine, also because it seems a vaccine well tolerated in the medium term. At the end of November data at two months will be available, as required by regulatory agencies, and so at the end of November (the vaccine) could already be approved.\u201d  QUENTIN VIVANT, SPOKESMAN FOR FRENCH DRUGMAKER SANOFI  \u201cCongratulations to our Pfizer colleagues. We feel energized to move on and bring more vaccines to the world to fight against this pandemic.\u201d  Market reaction  ---------------  RUSSELL SILBERTSON, CO-HEAD OF DEVELOPED MARKET FX & RATES AT ASSET MANAGER NINETY ONE  \u201cIf the bearish view embedded in markets was that there was no effective vaccine any time soon priced in, clearly that needs significant repricing now.  \u201cYou couple (this morning\u2019s news) with the sheer weight of all the stimulus in markets, and that\u2019s a very strong economic upside scenario.\u201d  NIKESH PATEL, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, KEMPEN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LONDON  \u201cThis is the first news that allows governments to start planning ahead to when economies can properly start to reopen from lockdowns. That gives them more visibility and concreteness about what fiscal policy they can take.  \u201cMonetary policy can only go so far at this point and it needs to be a fiscal response for a real recovery and this kind of news is great as it allows governments to make that fiscal response without fear of endless support.\u201d  NEIL WILSON, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT MARKETS.COM  \u201cWhilst we are not there yet, news that this vaccine could be highly effective is the best thing markets could hope for. Public health officials will remind us there is a long road ahead, and many challenges will be faced along the way, but there is an enormous sense of optimism today \u2013 light at the end of the tunnel. Let\u2019s just hope the vaccine deniers won\u2019t get in the way, but 2021 just got a lot brighter.\u201d  KENNETH BROUX, FX STRATEGIST AT SOCIETE GENERALE  \u201cThe COVID-19 vaccine news adds to the positive risk tone in stocks and underpins high beta currencies vs the U.S. dollar. Any positive news on a vaccine is good news for the world economy and offers perspective for rebound\/normalisation in 2021 growth.\u201d  CARSTEN BRZESKI, GLOBAL HEAD OF MACRO, ING  \u201cThe bigger driver of the economic outlook is from the outside factors. Right now that means the development of a vaccine, which is why we are following news on this front closely.\u201d  \u201cThe base case we have already is that we are likely to get a vaccine by year-end and that it will be rolled out. So we do see news like this as positive. The worrying sign would be if we get negative news say on testing, that would hurt how we view the economic outlook.\u201d","400":"Following the announcement on Dec. 1 that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had been approved for use in the UK (here), a Facebook user has misleadingly suggested that plans are in place to give the vaccine to children and pregnant women.

Given the lack of evidence, JCVI favours a precautionary approach, and does not currently advise COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy,\u201d the report says.  \u201cWomen should be advised not to come forward for vaccination if they may be pregnant or are planning a pregnancy within three months of the first dose.  \u201cData are anticipated which will inform discussions on vaccination in pregnancy. JCVI will review these as soon as they become available.\u201d  In earlier information for healthcare practitioners, published by Public Health England in November 2020, advice reads: \u201cAlthough the available data do not indicate any safety concern or harm to pregnancy, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. Vaccination should be postponed until completion of pregnancy.\u201d  Regarding children, in its Dec. 3 document, the JCVI says: \u201cFollowing infection, almost all children will have asymptomatic infection or mild disease. There is very limited data on vaccination in adolescents, with no data on vaccination in younger children, at this time. The committee advises that only those children at very high risk of exposure and serious outcomes, such as older children with severe neuro-disabilities that require residential care, should be offered vaccination.\u201d  This is reiterated the earlier Public Health England guidance (here, page 11).  The Facebook post also alleges that Pfizer has not provided the ingredients list for the vaccine. This is not correct; the ingredients are listed in this government information leaflet for UK recipients of the vaccine (here, p. 4).  The post makes various other allegations about testing and side effects of the virus, which are not within the scope of this check.  VERDICT  Partly false. The Facebook post is correct that at the time of publishing the Pfizer vaccine had not been tested on pregnant women or young children. However, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has not advised vaccinating these groups, and neither did earlier information from Public Health England. The JCVI says it will review new data as it is released.  This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

REUTERS\/Issei Kato  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS added 0.26% for its second straight day of gains.  The index has risen in eight of the last 10 sessions amid a rally in risk assets buoyed by hopes of a coronavirus vaccine and expectations of a so called \u201cblue wave\u201d, which would see the Democrats claim victory in November\u2019s elections.  Boosting overall sentiment, drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Friday it could have a coronavirus vaccine ready in the United States by the end of this year.  Japan's Nikkei .N225 climbed about 1% while South Korea's KOSPI and Australian shares .AXJO were up 0.7% each.  New Zealand .NZ50 was a tad lower after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern won a second term at elections over the weekend, having risen over the week in anticipation of such a result.  E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 ESc1 jumped 0.5% in early Asian trading after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday she was optimistic legislation on a wide-ranging coronavirus relief package could be pushed through before the election.  But with her negotiating partner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in the Middle East until Tuesday, such a timeframe would seem to be overly optimistic, analysts said.  Investors are also concerned about rising coronavirus cases to help curb the spread of the disease.  Global coronavirus cases rose by more than 400,000 for the first time late on Friday, a record one-day increase as much of Europe enacts new restrictions to curb the outbreak.  Investors now await China\u2019s third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP), monthly production and retail sales due later in the Asia morning.  \u201cChinese growth has bounced back well from its early COVID-19 losses and this data will be key to identify how the economy has progressed,\u201d said Steven Dooley, chief strategist at Western Union Business Solutions.  Later in the week, key events include minutes of Australia\u2019s central bank meeting, the final U.S. presidential debate and global manufacturing indicators.  Action in currencies was muted with the U.S. dollar, usually perceived as a safe-haven asset, =USD flat at 93.696 against a basket of six major currencies. [USD\/]  The euro EUR= was also unchanged at $1.1715.  Sterling traded near two-week lows at $1.2925 after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told businesses to get ready for a no-deal Brexit in case negotiations with the European Union fail to produce a free trade agreement.  \u201cEU-UK trade talks are flirting with collapse,\u201d ANZ economists said.  \u201cUK Prime Minister Johnson said the UK needs to prepare for a no-deal outcome, as both sides cannot agree on a Canada-style FTA. Talks resume in London on Monday, but without the political willingness to shift ground, there is little the negotiators can achieve.\u201d  In commodities, Brent crude futures LCOc1 added 5 cents to $42.98 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLC1 climbed 5 cents to $40.9 a barrel.

The MSCI World index was up 0.1% at 1013 GMT, just shy of the previous session\u2019s record high.  After opening lower, European shares crawled back into the black, with the STOXX 600 index up 0.3%, tracking overnight gains in Asia where China stimulus hopes helped MSCI\u2019s broadest regional gauge rise 0.7%.  U.S. stock futures also pointed to firmer open on Wall Street, up 0.2%, after soft U.S. retail sales data, a rise in COVID-19 cases and uncertainty over fresh stimulus measures in the world\u2019s largest economy had sapped sentiment.  While the release of two successful coronavirus vaccine trial data over the last week had buoyed markets, the still-high infection rate globally had acted to trim gains, said Jane Shoemake, London-based fund manager at Janus Henderson.  \u201cPeople can see light at the end of the tunnel now and the markets clearly responded to that, but it\u2019s not going to go up in a straight line because we\u2019ve still got to get through the winter... (and) that is going to continue to temper some of the exuberance people feel.\u201d  Concern about the still-high infection rate in the United States acted to crimp dollar demand, with the greenback sliding against a basket of currencies to its lowest since Nov. 9.  That had followed weak retail sales data overnight and comes as hopes for fresh U.S. stimulus remain hampered by political gridlock, pinning near-term hopes on action from the U.S. central bank.  Strong corporate earnings in the third quarter also continued to underpin the positive stock market sentiment, said analysts at Barclays, with firms \u201cconfident on the outlook and in control of costs\u201d, they said in a note to clients.  \u201cThis reinforces the case for a strong earnings rebound and pick-up in corporate activity in 2021, as the cyclical recovery unfolds.\u201d  Cormac Weldon, Head of U.S. Equities at UK asset manager Artemis said while the overall picture for investors was brighter, the recovery was likely to be uneven.  \u201cLow inventories and the need to manufacture and distribute goods are likely to be the first drivers of the recovery, with the re-emergence of consumer demand adding a powerful second phase.\u201d  With stocks still well supported, other risk markets also took heart, with U.S. crude futures and Brent crude futures both up just over 1%, bolstered by hopes OPEC will delay a planned increase in production.  Safe haven gold, meanwhile, was down 0.3% at $1,872.6 an ounce, with U.S. gold futures also slightly lower.  In Europe\u2019s debt markets, Germany saw its benchmark 10-year government bond yield fall to its lowest since Pfizer announced its COVID-19 vaccine update a week and a half ago.  \u201cYields continue to grind lower as more warning signs flash about the near-term outlook,\u201d said Benjamin Schroeder, senior rates strategist at ING.  \u201cEuro zone spreads appear to have eyes only for QE (quantitative easing), shrugging off volatility and EU setbacks,\u201d he said, referring to news this week that Hungary and Poland have blocked the adoption of the 2021-2027 budget and recovery fund by European Union governments.","403":"FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the logo for Corning Inc. at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., November 18, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  (Reuters) - Glass maker Corning Inc GLW.N said on Tuesday it would receive $204 million from the U.S. government to boost the manufacturing capacity of its vials that will be used to store coronavirus vaccines and treatments.  Companies developing coronavirus vaccines, such as AstraZeneca AZN.L and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up the production of a vaccine.  Billions of vials will be needed for vaccines of the new coronavirus, with world leaders looking towards treatments as a way to re-open stalled economies.  Corning's funding comes a day after the U.S. government awarded $143 million to privately-held SiO2 Materials Science to boost the production of its vials and syringes. (bwnews.pr\/37eauUA)  Corning said it will provide priority access of its vials to companies that have tied up with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) for developing treatments and vaccines.  The funding from BARDA will go towards scaling up production of the company\u2019s \u2018Valor Glass\u2019, which is designed to minimize contamination and could potentially speed up manufacturing processes.  The company signed a long-term agreement in May with Pfizer Inc PFE.N, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, for the glass vials. Pfizer said they would be used for some existing sterile injectable drugs and a range of new products.","404":"FILE PHOTO: A man walks past Pfizer's world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved its lung-cancer treatment for patients with a specific gene mutation who had been previously treated for an aggressive form of the disease.  The treatment, Lorbrena, is designed to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer in patients with a mutation of the ALK gene, who have relapsed after being treated with ALK inhibitors, such as Pfizer\u2019s Xalkori.  While many patients respond to initial ALK inhibitor therapy, they typically eventually experience disease progression and are faced with limited options due to resistance to existing treatments.  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult to treat. About 3 to 5 percent of NSCLC tumors are ALK-positive, and is often found in non-smokers.  Lorbrena, known chemically as lorlatinib, received an accelerated approval, Pfizer said. Its continued approval may depend on verification of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.","405":"Dec 8 (Reuters) - A panel of independent advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will meet on Sunday to review data on Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, the health agency\u2019s meeting agenda showed on Tuesday.  The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will vote here on whether to recommend the vaccine for public distribution and who should receive it, based on data available on the its effectiveness and safety.  Sunday\u2019s meeting will follow a meeting by outside experts to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Dec. 10, who will discuss whether to authorize Pfizer\u2019s shot for emergency use.  Pfizer last month said its vaccine\u2019s two-dose regimen was 95% effective against COVID-19 and had no major safety issues. The drugmaker is set to present this data to the ACIP on Friday.  The FDA released documents on Tuesday saying Pfizer vaccine\u2019s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for the authorization.  The CDC sets the U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules based on recommendations from ACIP.  The panel\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations will include specifics about which age groups should receive the vaccine, the number of doses needed, gap between doses and precautions.  The committee last week voted for healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities to receive the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States.  A meeting of advisers to the FDA is scheduled for Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna Inc\u2019s vaccine candidate, which is also being reviewed for emergency use in the United States.","406":"Jan 7 (Reuters) - European countries rolling out the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be flexible on the time between the first and second doses, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for the region said on Thursday.  The WHO\u2019s Hans Kluge said it was important to strike a balance between making the most of limited supplies of vaccines and protecting as many people as possible.  \u201cIt is important that such a decision represents a safe compromise between the limited global production capacity at the moment, and the imperative for governments to protect as many people as possible while reducing the burden of any subsequent wave on the health systems,\u201d Kluge told a media briefing.","407":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A spurt higher in Treasury yields has investors wondering whether this time, the momentum will keep going.  FILE PHOTO: The United States Department of the Treasury is seen in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  Investors rotated out of Treasuries, a popular safe-haven asset, and into sectors that could benefit from an economic upswing such as bank stocks and high-yield credit after Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective. That sent the benchmark 10-year yield to its highest since March, edging close to 1%, and the yield curve sharply steeper.  Previous moves higher in yields, however, have petered out as the Federal Reserve\u2019s near-zero interest rate policy has kept Treasury trading in a tight range.  Some investors say this time may be different.  \u201cThis was the \u2018vaccine\u2019 moment the rates market had waited for,\u201d said analysts at ING. The \u201cbig difference here from previous moves is that we won\u2019t need to take this back.\u201d  Higher Treasury yields can translate into higher borrowing costs and thus can slow growth. But the boost can also help savers and retirees who may rely on fixed income.  Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance, said if people actually start getting vaccinated and COVID-19 case counts drop, \u201cI would expect the Fed to start thinking about changing their 2023 outlook to 2022 or maybe even the last half of 2021 to start raising rates.\u201d  The eurodollar curve from 2022-2024, a proxy for the market\u2019s expectation of rate hikes, surged on Monday, noted Michael Purves, head of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. That was striking, he said, as it suggested a vaccine \u201cmay in fact be much more important in disrupting the Fed\u2019s \u2018zero forever\u2019 policy than fiscal stimulus might ever be.\u201d  Still, there is skepticism that the move higher in yields would be sustained in the long run. There remains the possibility of gridlock in Washington that might hold up the passage of a stimulus bill. What\u2019s more, it isn\u2019t clear how long it might take for a vaccine to be approved by regulators and then rolled out.  \u201cI still believe we are range-bound and will drift lower in yields over the next year,\u201d said Scott Burg, chief investment officer at hedge fund Deer Park Road.  That was seen to some extent in derivatives trading on Monday with bets on the TLT exchange-traded fund, which tracks longer-dated Treasuries, according to Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Investment Group.  There had been TLT bets \u201cboth ways\u201d on Monday, he said, including a buyer of a call spread \u201clooking for TLT higher and yields lower, saying that this is an over-reaction and things are not going to progress as quickly as the market is all of a sudden thinking.\u201d  That was a contrast to last week, when traders pulled out of bearish bets that long-dated Treasury yields would rise, when it seemed clear Joe Biden had won the presidency but that his Democratic party would face a divided Congress. That drove volume in put options on TLT to the highest since June 2019 on Wednesday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert.  The prospect of gridlock in Washington is one argument for little movement on fiscal policy, and therefore, little movement in U.S. Treasury yields, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors.  While a divided Congress is still likely to pass a coronavirus stimulus bill, investors say the amount may be smaller than was expected if there had been a broad Democratic victory.  \u201cThe election result seems like it will take between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion out of fiscal stimulus. So that\u2019s going to push pretty heavily on the Fed,\u201d said Ablin.  Purves said the risk to the market is if Congress coalesces around a lower fiscal package thinking that a vaccine is around the corner, but ultimately vaccine news disappoints. That would make the rotation trade into more economically sensitive assets more vulnerable.  \u201cLet\u2019s see if we get follow-through on this rotation and Treasury sell-off,\u201d said Purves. \u201cWe have our doubts.\u201d","408":"Here are the top stories and upcoming coverage plans for Reuters text service as of 10 p.m. GMT\/6 a.m. SGT.

FILE PHOTO: Vials labelled \"COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine\" and a syringe are seen in front of the Pfizer logo in this illustration taken February 9, 2021. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Data analysis in a study by the Israeli Health Ministry and Pfizer Inc found the Pfizer vaccine developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech reduces infection, including in asymptomatic cases, by 89.4% and in syptomatic cases by 93.7%.  Findings of the pre-published study, not yet peer-reviewed, but based on a national database that is one of the world\u2019s most advanced, were first reported by the Israeli news site Ynet late on Thursday and were obtained by Reuters on Friday.  Pfizer declined to comment and the Israeli Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  A separate study by Israel\u2019s Sheba Medical Center published on Friday in The Lancet medical journal found that among 7,214 hospital staff who received their first dose in January, there was an 85% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 within 15 to 28 days with an overall reduction of infections, including asymptomatic cases detected by testing, of 75%.  More research is needed to draw a definitive conclusion, but the studies are among the first to suggest a vaccine may stop the spread of the novel coronavirus and not just prevent people getting ill.  Michal Linial, a professor of molecular biology and bioinformatics at Jerusalem\u2019s Hebrew University, said the findings were a big step towards answering one of the most important questions in combating the pandemic.  \u201cWhether it is 75 or 90 percent reduction doesn\u2019t matter - it is a big drop in transmission,\u201d Linial said. \u201cIt means that not only is the individual vaccinated protected, the inoculation also provides protection to his or her surroundings.\u201d  The researchers said further study was needed on asymptomatic transmission among people fully vaccinated because they are less likely to be tested for COVID-19.  Vaccine developers have also said more research was needed on transmissibility. In December, Germany\u2019s BioNTech said it would take three to six months more study.  \u2018DYNAMIC VIRUS\u2019  Leading the world in its vaccination roll out, Israel\u2019s universal healthcare and advanced data capabilities have provided a nationwide database that can offer insights into how effective the vaccines are outside controlled clinical trials.  The Health Ministry\/Pfizer study analysed data collected between Jan. 17 and Feb. 6, looking at individuals who had been fully vaccinated, after receiving their second Pfizer shot.  To date more than 30%, or 2.8 million of Israel\u2019s nine million population have received both doses.  Sheba\u2019s study found that just the first dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine was 85% effective, potentially fuelling a debate over the recommended two-dose schedule.  Canadian researchers in a letter published this week suggested that the second Pfizer dose be delayed given the high level of protection from the first shot to increase the number of people getting vaccinated.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in December data from those trials showed the vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients before they received the second shot, but more data would be needed to assess the potential of a single-dose shot.  Pfizer has said alternative dosing regimens of the vaccine have yet to be evaluated and that the decision resided with the health authorities.  Another caveat is that the cohort studied at the hospital were \u201cmostly young and healthy,\u201d Sheba epidemiologist Gili Regev-Yochay said.  Unlike with Pfizer\u2019s clinical trial, \u201cwe don\u2019t have many (staff) here aged over 65,\u201d she told reporters. But she also said the Sheba study took place during a surge in coronavirus infections in Israel, which flooded hospitals with new cases.  Pfizer declined to comment on the data, saying in a statement it was doing its own analysis of \u201cthe vaccine\u2019s real-world effectiveness in several locations worldwide, including Israel\u201d.  Both studies\u2019 findings compared with overall efficacy of around 95% in a two-dose regimen 21 days apart. The Health Ministry\/Pfizer researchers found the vaccine to be effective against the British coronavirus variant that makes up about 80% of Israel\u2019s confirmed cases.  Eran Kopel, an epidemiologist at Tel Aviv University said the Sheba study was important, but it focused on one hospital and a relatively small group of people, so \u201cone could not draw clear-cut epidemiological conclusions from it\u201d.  The Health Ministry\u2019s data was encouraging, he said, but further research and regular surveys were needed.  \u201cThe vaccinations are a very good tool but this is hardly the end. This is a dynamic virus that has surprised the scientific world with its fast pace of change and variety,\u201d he said.","410":"Oct 6 (Reuters) - Europe's health regulator said on Tuesday it has started a rolling review of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech , days after it launched a similar review of AstraZeneca's vaccine.

Spain started vaccinating people on Sunday.  He expected around 70% of the country\u2019s population to be immunized by the end of the summer.  The delay in Spain comes after the vaccination campaign in Germany faced delays in several cities after temperature trackers showed that about 1,000 vaccine doses made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech may have not been kept cold enough during shipment.  In a presentation this month, BioNTech had said that once removed from the freezer, the vaccine could be stored for up to five days at 2-8C and for up to two hours at temperatures up to 30C, prior to use.  The cool boxes designed by Pfizer are fitted with GPS trackers so the companies can deal with potential storage issues en route.  The vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112\u00b0F) before being shipped to distribution centres in specially designed cool boxes filled with dry ice.","412":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The distribution of an initial 200 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech across the European Union will be completed by September, a spokesman for the EU Commission said on Monday.

Talks are underway on delivery of a further 100 million doses which are optional under the contract sealed with the two companies, the EU spokesman said, confirming an earlier report from Reuters.  The timetable for the additional doses is unclear.  Pfizer\u2019s spokesman said the option for another 100 million doses had not been concluded.  The EU spokesman said most supply contracts agreed by the EU with COVID-19 vaccine makers foresee the majority of deliveries completed by the end of next year.  The EU has signed advance purchase agreements with Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Sanofi and CureVac for a total of nearly 2 billion doses.

The latest development comes after an independent data monitoring committee said in May a similar trial comparing Ibrance plus an endocrine therapy to a standalone endocrine therapy to treat early-stage breast cancer was unlikely to meet the main goal.  Ibrance is already approved in the United States to treat certain adult patients with advanced breast cancer which has spread to other parts of the body. The drug has not yet been approved for treating early stages of the disease.

Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE said last month their coronavirus vaccine\u2019s two-dose regimen was 95% effective against COVID-19 and had no major safety issues and asked the FDA for emergency use authorization.  The vaccine\u2019s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for emergency use authorization, FDA staff said in documents released ahead of a Thursday meeting of outside experts to the FDA who will discuss whether to recommend the Pfizer shot for people aged 16 and older.  Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in research note the documents were \u201cvery simple and straightforward, which we think will lead to approval imminently.\u201d  The agency typically follows the recommendations of its advisory panels but is not required to do so. It is not clear how many days or weeks the FDA will take to make a decision, but states are prepping for vaccine deliveries in mid-December.  The documents were released on the day Britons began getting the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine, the world\u2019s first recipients outside of clinical trials.  \u201cThere are no surprises here. The efficacy and the safety is consistent with what we heard and what we hoped for.

PROTECTION AFTER ONE SHOT  Data from the trial showed that the vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients even before they received the second shot, the FDA said. The effect became most pronounced about 14 days after people received the first shot.  The agency\u2019s staff noted that more data would be needed to assess the potential of a single-dose shot. It said that the efficacy after dose 1 and before dose 2 was around 52 percent.  A two-dose vaccination was highly effective in preventing confirmed cases of COVID-19 at least seven days after the last dose, FDA staff said.  The FDA staff also said that available data, while limited, suggested the people who had been previously infected with the new coronavirus could benefit from vaccination. Very few cases of confirmed COVID-19 occurred among participants with evidence of infection prior to vaccination, though more of those that did were in the placebo group than the vaccine group, the staff said.  FDA staff also said that the trial, which was designed to look at effectiveness against COVID-19, did not produce data to answer the question of if it also stopped infection.  In terms of safety, the FDA staff said there was currently insufficient data to make conclusions about the safety of the vaccine in people below 16 years of age, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems.  There were a total of six deaths in the 44,000 person trial, with two deaths among those who got the vaccine and the rest in those who received a placebo, the documents showed. All deaths represent events that occur in the general population at a similar rate, FDA staff said.","422":"(Repeats without changes)  ANKARA, Dec 26 (Reuters) - BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said his company would be open to cooperating with others as it looks to increase production capacity for its COVID-19 vaccine developed with Pfizer and was considering opening an office in Turkey.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The government has faced growing public pressure over their COVID-19 vaccine procurement plans as the country reported its second-highest daily tally of cases on Wednesday.

The Pfizer and Janssen deals are part of a government plan to buy enough doses from four drugmakers and the global COVAX initiative, backed by the World Health Organization, that will allow immunisation of at least 85% of South Korea\u2019s population of 52 million.  The government had already signed a deal with AstraZeneca Plc, which will be shipped as early as January next year, and is in final talks with Moderna Inc to sign a deal in January to secure 20 million doses.  Health authorities will start a public vaccination programme as early as February next year, which will be completed around November, before the start of the flu season, Yang Dong-gyo, a senior official at the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), told a briefing.  The government had allocated an additional 1.3 trillion won ($1.2 billion) to next year\u2019s budget for vaccines.  The KDCA reported 985 new coronavirus cases as of Wednesday midnight, bringing the nation\u2019s tally to 53,533, with 756 deaths.  South Korea has ramped up testing to more than 55,000 people a day, compared with roughly 16,000 a day in September, to track down cases from unknown origin and asymptomatic cases.  Authorities have shut down all ski resorts and winter tourist spots and banned gatherings of more than four in a bid to stop the spread during the Christmas and New Year holidays.  Asia\u2019s fourth largest economy won international plaudits earlier this year when it quickly tamped down outbreaks with aggressive, high-tech contact tracing, but officials acknowledged over-confidence that left them straining to contain a third wave.","424":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump walks from Marine One as he arrives on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., July 18, 2018.

Pfizer is facing criticism across Europe over its surprise move to temporarily delay vaccine shipments to countries that fear disruptions could throw their inoculation campaigns into disarray.  The company told Italy last week that it was cutting its deliveries by 29%. On Tuesday, it said it was not in the position to make up the 29% shortfall next week and that it was planning a further \u201cslight reduction\u201d in deliveries, Arcuri said.  \u201cAs a result, we discussed what action to take to protect Italian citizens and their health in all civil and criminal venues,\u201d Arcuri said in a statement late on Tuesday.  \u201cIt was unanimously decided that these actions will be taken starting in the next few days.\u201d  He did not elaborate.  The Pfizer vaccine requires two injections, given around 21 days apart, to prime the immune system well enough to fight off the coronavirus.  Pfizer\u2019s move was having a serious impact on vaccination plans drawn up by local authorities, the governor of the northern Emilia Romagna region said.  \u201cDue to the reduction in doses, many regions have been forced to slow down or even suspend new vaccinations to ensure administration of the second dose to those who had already received the first,\u201d Stefano Bonaccini told Reuters in an email.  A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment on Wednesday over Italy\u2019s legal threat and criticism regarding delivery delays beyond its statement on Friday about supply cuts.  The drugmaker said last week it was temporarily slowing supplies of its coronavirus vaccine to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output.  Pfizer, which is trying to deliver millions of doses at a breakneck pace to curb a pandemic that has already killed more than 2 million people worldwide, said the changes would \u201cprovide a significant increase in doses in late February and March\u201d.  According to an Italian source, Rome is now trying to assess whether Pfizer is acting under force majeure, or circumstances beyond its control.  If not, the drug group could be accused of breaching the contract it has signed with the European Union on state members\u2019 behalf, the source said.  One possibility could be for Rome to call on the European Union to present a lawsuit to a court in Belgium\u2019s capital, Brussels, the source said.  \u201cRegional authorities will stand by the government in any necessary action but I sincerely hope this eventuality will not occur,\u201d Bonaccini said.","426":"SANTIAGO (Reuters) -Chile, the first country in South America to begin vaccinating against COVID-19, started innoculations on Thursday after receiving its initial 10,000 doses from Pfizer-BioNtech.

The Palestinian territories are expected to receive 37,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech starting in mid-February through COVAX, while Tunisia is due to receive 93,600 doses, said Rick Brennan, emergency director for the WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean region. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended per person.  The WHO set up COVAX along with the GAVI vaccine alliance to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccinations globally.  However, there was a \u201cvery significant gap\u201d between the planned vaccine rollout in wealthy countries and those that are lower-income or affected by conflict, Brennan said in an interview. The WHO\u2019s Eastern Mediterranean region includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as Middle Eastern states.  \u201cUntil the pharmaceutical companies and the wealthier countries fully resource COVAX, which is the mechanism that we have set up to distribute the vaccines to the poorer countries, those countries are going to be left behind,\u201d he said in an interview.  \u201cThe availability and the finances aren\u2019t at the level yet that they need to be. We\u2019re well short,\u201d he added.  Lags in vaccine provision for poorer countries increased the risk of the spread of coronavirus variants that could be more easily transmissible and harder to treat, said Brennan.  After approving the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the WHO is working to assess other, cheaper vaccines that could be supplied through COVAX. It is hoping to start vaccinations in all countries globally by early April and vaccinate high risk populations by the middle of the year.  \u201cWe expect that there will be a modest volume of Pfizer through COVAX because of its expense, but it\u2019s kick-starting the process,\u201d said Brennan.","432":"Oct 13 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will enroll participants as young as 12 in its large, late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial to understand how it works in a wider age group.

Pazuello said on Tuesday that Brazil had signed a letter of intent to receive 70 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Pfizer starting in January. He added that the government had lined up 300 million doses in total via agreements from several vaccine manufacturers.  In his Wednesday comments, Pazuello said that the nation should have received doses from AstraZeneca PLC and Pfizer by January. In Sao Paulo state, Governor Joao Doria said on Monday he plans to start vaccinations using Sinovac Biotech Ltd\u2019s Coronavac vaccine on Jan. 25. That vaccine is currently undergoing late stage trials run in Brazil by the Butantan Institute, a biomedical center in the state.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the prevision? Fifteen million (doses) of AstraZeneca and we\u2019re projecting 500,000 initial doses of Pfizer in January,\u201d said Pazuello, during a televised interview on CNN Brasil.  \u201cWith regards to Butantan, I still don\u2019t have the numbers for January. If we look at this, it\u2019s quite likely that between January and February, we\u2019ll be vaccinating the Brazilian people,\u201d he said.  While federal health officials have not offered a specific date for the beginning of vaccinations, several have previously said vaccinations were most likely to begin in March.","442":"Healthcare workers chat at a temporary ward set up during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at Steve Biko Academic Hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, January 19, 2021.

The Covid-19 vaccine bubble has been good for smaller biotech firms \u2013 the combined market value of five of them has risen more than $50 billion of late, for example. Now Pfizer is getting in on the act. The pharma giant added $9 billion to its roughly $200 billion valuation on Wednesday morning after the U.S. government placed an initial order of nearly $2 billion for 100 million doses of the vaccine it\u2019s developing with German biotech BioNTech.  The two partners will only be paid once the drug is approved. Even then, the bump to revenue and profit is likely to be modest. Subsequent orders might be bigger and more profitable. But 150 different vaccines are under development, so competition is likely to reduce the price and number Pfizer can sell \u2013 AstraZeneca has said it will price its vaccine at cost during the pandemic.

That was the message from the chief executives who met virtually on Wednesday, as they pressed to extend a waiver on rules governing landing slots. In normal times, carriers are required to use 80% of their slots or forfeit these highly valued assets. European regulators eased the rules during lockdown, but only until October.  Executives including Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith and Kenton Jarvis, CEO of TUI Aviation, say returning closer to normality will take longer. Airlines typically lose money in the winter anyway, but lockdown and fears of catching Covid-19 in the skies have dampened demand further. The airlines, many of which have raised capital or sought government support, have talked of an eventual recovery in passenger numbers. Smith has reassured investors he is ramping up flight frequencies. First, however, carriers need to get through a harsh winter. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME IMPROVEMENT. The end of lockdown has done little to dampen the DIY boom. Consumers who were confined at home tackled home repairs and gardening jobs with such enthusiasm that Kingfisher, the 5 billion pound operator of B&Q in the United Kingdom and Castorama in France, on Wednesday released an unscheduled trading update. Sales soared 25% in June from a year earlier, having increased 15% in May. Online sales, however, were the clear winner as demand for items that can be delivered, such as wallpaper, fences and plants, leapt 225%.  Running a DIY retailer is also getting cheaper. Although Kingfisher had to pay for protective equipment for staff, including barriers and hand sanitiser, its advertising and marketing budget fell as customers needed little encouragement to enter their stores. Kingfisher\u2019s share price rose nearly 10% on Wednesday. The longer consumers\u2019 desire to upgrade and refurbish persists, the happier investors will be. (By Aimee Donnellan)  HOME SICK. Hong Kong is shutting down once again. The financial hub has recorded a spike in Covid-19 cases since July 13, logging over 50 cases daily and a high of 108. Foreign students were blamed for a second wave in March, and now fingers are being pointed at flight crews, sailors and senior executives exempted from quarantine.  The local government has defended the exceptions. Financial services, trade and logistics account for a total of two-fifths of Hong Kong\u2019s economy, and they can\u2019t work well, or at all, unless their staff can move across borders. So authorities are hesitant to impose stricter measures, perhaps with an eye on fellow hub Singapore, which reported a 41% fall in GDP after its own lockdown. But of course a third major outbreak will cancel the benefits of selective relaxation. It is a harrowing warning for what\u2019s ahead of the curve for the many metropolises still trying to flatten it. (By Jamie Lo)  MIND THE GAP. London\u2019s Central Line emptied out in March, as did the coffers of the tube\u2019s parent organisation. Transport for London, chaired by Mayor Sadiq Khan, needed a 1.6 billion pound government bailout back in May. That prompted parallel funding reviews to be launched this week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government and Khan.  There\u2019s a clear opportunity to improve. TfL is one of the few major transport networks in Europe that receives no funding for its operations from the central government. If fares dip, and it can\u2019t borrow to cover the gap, bailouts are likely. It would be simpler for the state to formalise a financial backstop to allow investment to be maintained and ensure trains are clean post-pandemic. Fares may be lower for some time given emptier trains and buses. The state, which has the lowest cost of funding, is the best placed to pick up the bill.

News of Pfizer Inc's vaccine, which the drugmaker is developing with German partner BioNTech, comes after global markets were jolted by the halting of two high-profiled COVID-19 vaccine trials earlier in the week. The MSCI's index for Latin American currencies rose 0.1%, but was headed for weekly declines of more than 1%. Chile's peso rose 1.1%, making gains for the first time in five day after the country's central bank left its benchmark rate steady at 0.5% on Thursday, maintaining its efforts to revive the economy following the coronavirus pandemic. The peso was also supported by strengthening prices of copper, Chile's biggest export, as demand from China continued to improve. Mexico's peso added 0.4%, and was set to outpace its Latam peers for the week. The country's currency has been benefiting from an economic rebound in the United States, its main trading partner. The Argentine peso held steady after the central bank said on Thursday it will lower the benchmark Leliq rate to 36% from the previous level of 37%, while raising the reverse repo rate 3 points to 30%, as part of a wider push to harmonize interest rates. \"The lack of a clear and comprehensive reaction by the authorities to the notorious denachoring in expectations is creating a vicious circle and leading to a fast deterioration in the economic situation in the country,\" emerging markers FX strategists at Citigroup said.

The full scope of Novartis\u2019 $500 million plan, revealed to Reuters in an interview with the company\u2019s gene therapy chief, has not been previously disclosed. It is second only to Pfizer, which has allocated $600 million to build its own gene therapy manufacturing plants, according to filings and interviews with industry executives.  Gene therapies aim to correct certain diseases by replacing the missing or mutated version of a gene found in a patient\u2019s cells with healthy copies. With the potential to cure devastating illnesses in a single dose, drugmakers say they justify prices well above $1 million per patient.  But the treatments are also extremely complex to make, involving the cultivation of living material, and still pose a risk of serious side effects.  Drugmakers say building their own manufacturing plants is a response to rising costs and delays associated with relying on third-party contract manufacturers, which are also expanding to capitalize on demand.  They say owning their own facilities helps safeguard proprietary production methods and more effectively address any concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is keeping a close eye on manufacturing standards.  \u201cThere\u2019s so little capacity and capability at contract manufacturers for the novel gene therapy processes being developed by companies,\u201d said David Lennon, president of AveXis, Novartis\u2019s gene therapy division. \u201cWe need internal manufacturing capabilities in the long term.\u201d  The approach is not without risks.  Bob Smith, senior vice president of Pfizer\u2019s global gene therapy business, acknowledged drugmakers take a \u201cleap of faith\u201d when they make big capital investment outlays for treatments before they have been approved or, in some cases, even produced data demonstrating a benefit.  PUSHING THE LIMITS  The rewards are potentially great, however.  Gene therapy is one of the hottest areas of drug research and, given the life-changing possibilities, the FDA is helping to speed treatments to market.  It has approved two so far, including Novartis\u2019s Zolgensma treatment for a rare muscular disorder priced at $2 million, and expects 40 new gene therapies to reach the U.S. market by 2022.  There are currently several hundred under development by around 30 drugmakers for conditions from hemophilia to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia.  The proliferation of these treatments is pushing the limits of the industry\u2019s existing manufacturing capacity.  Developers of gene therapies that need to outsource manufacturing face wait times of about 18 months to get a production slot, company executives told Reuters.  They are also charged fees to reserve space that run into millions of dollars, more than double the cost of a few years ago, according to gene therapy developer RegenxBio.  As a result, companies including bluebird bio, PTC Therapeutics and Krystal Biotech are also investing in gene therapy manufacturing, according to a Reuters analysis of public filings and executive interviews.  They follow Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc, developer of a gene therapy for hemophilia, which constructed one of the industry\u2019s largest manufacturing facilities in 2017.  REGULATORY SCRUTINY  The FDA is keeping a close eye on standards.  This comes amid the agency\u2019s disclosure in August that it is investigating alleged data manipulation by former executives at Novartis\u2019 AveXis unit.  AveXis had switched its method for measuring Zolgensma\u2019s potency in animal studies. When results using the new method didn\u2019t meet expectations, the executives allegedly altered the data to cover it up, the FDA and Novartis have said.  One of the former executives, Brian Kaspar, denied wrongdoing in a statement to Reuters. Another, his brother Allan Kaspar, could not be reached for comment.  Novartis and the FDA say human clinical trials, which found Zolgensma effective in treating the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy in infants, were not affected. Novartis also says its investments in gene therapy production started long before it became aware of the data manipulation allegations.  But the scandal has highlighted the importance of having a consistent manufacturing process for gene therapies, industry executives say.  According to four of them, the FDA has stressed in recent meetings the need for continuity in production processes all the way from the development of a drug to its commercialization.  By bringing production in-house, drugmakers may avoid pitfalls such as the need to switch to a larger facility if contract manufacturers\u2019 capacity proves limited, executives say.  The FDA is finalizing new guidelines for gene therapy manufacturing, expected at the end of the year.  \u201cManufacturing consistency is always a major concern for the agency,\u201d FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo told Reuters.  Highlighting the pressures on the industry, Sarepta Therapeutics, which largely outsources manufacturing, delayed a clinical trial of its Duchenne treatment in August, telling investors it wanted to avoid any questions from regulators about consistency in producing its therapy at commercial scale.  ENOUGH GROWTH FOR ALL?  \u201cBetween the trade secrets, the cost schedules and the time lag, it makes a whole lot of sense, if you can do it, to build out your own facilities and more and more gene therapy companies have started to do that,\u201d said Krish Krishnan, chief executive of Krystal Biotech Inc.  Krystal, which is developing therapies for rare skin diseases, has built one manufacturing facility and plans to invest more than $50 million in a new one it will start constructing in December.  MeiraGTx, which focuses on gene therapies for eye conditions, estimates it is currently spending roughly $25 million a year on manufacturing, including process development.  Despite such moves, however, contract manufacturers like Lonza and Thermo Fisher are confident their businesses will continue to grow due to the strength of demand.  Thermo Fisher has told investors its Brammer gene therapy manufacturing division, acquired in May, could soon earn $500 million in revenue a year, double its projected 2019 earnings.  Lonza CEO Marc Funk is also optimistic.  \u201cDemand in gene therapy has increased,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe believe this is going to continue in the coming years.\u201d (Reporting by Carl O\u2019Donnell in New York and Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Tomasz Janowski, Michele Gershberg and Mark Potter)","447":"Syringes to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine are seen at a nursing home in Burgbernheim, Germany December 28, 2020.

Health workers started inoculating the most vulnerable with the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, with the country a test case for the world as it contends with distributing a compound that must be stored at -70C (-94F).  Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 in a week, was the first to receive the shot, at a hospital in Coventry, central England.  \u201cIt\u2019s the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of (this) year,\u201d she said.  Pfizer received another boost when the U.S. regulator\u2019s staff raised no new safety or efficacy issues.  The launch of the vaccine, one of three shots that have reported successful results from large trials, will stir hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than 1.5 million people.  Britain, the worst-hit in Europe with over 61,000 deaths, is the first Western nation to begin mass vaccinations and the first globally to administer the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot.  But despite the relief of people receiving the first of the two-dose regimen, they will have to wait three weeks for their second shot, and there is no evidence immunisation will reduce transmission of the virus.  \u201cIt will gradually make a huge, huge difference. But I stress gradually, because we\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t defeated this virus yet,\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he expected millions to be vaccinated by the end of the year, and described the start of the drive as \u201cV-Day\u201d. But he cautioned people should respect social-distancing rules until spring at least, when he hoped the most vulnerable people would be vaccinated.  Britain has ordered enough supplies of the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million. The developers said it was 95% effective in preventing illness in final-stage trials.  Russia and China have both already started giving domestically produced vaccine candidates to their populations, though before final safety and efficacy trials have been completed.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  FIVE DAYS IN A FRIDGE  In Britain, about 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care-home residents and carers, the over-80s and some health workers prioritised. Hancock said he had a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d Britain would take delivery of another batch of the vaccine next week.  \u201cI know we\u2019re absolutely bursting at the doors with COVID patients, so I more than anybody want it to happen quickly,\u201d said Ami Jones, a hospital intensive-care consultant from Wales who received the jab before going to work.  Britain is relatively small with good infrastructure. Yet the logistical challenges in distributing the vaccine, which only lasts five days in a regular fridge, mean it will first go to dozens of hospitals and cannot yet be taken into care homes.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Bigger tests could await the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot, as well as one from Moderna, which was found to have a similar level of success in trials and is based on the same mRNA genetic technology that requires such ultra-cold storage.  Transport and distribution could prove more difficult in hot countries and bigger nations such as the United States and India, which have been worst-hit by COVID-19 and are expected to approve the shot for emergency use in the coming days or weeks.  South Korea, which has coped relatively well with the pandemic, sounded a note of caution, saying it would not hurry vaccine rollouts, partly to give it time to observe potential side-effects in other countries. Vaccinations may start in the first half of 2021, the health ministry added.  The third vaccine with trial success, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because it is cheaper and can be transported at normal fridge temperatures.  But AstraZeneca and Oxford have more work to do to confirm whether their vaccine can be 90% effective, a peer-reviewed paper in The Lancet showed on Tuesday, potentially slowing its rollout. Late-stage trials found it had average efficacy of 70.4% in peer-reviewed data. [nL8N2IO4AN]  A SHOT FOR SHAKESPEARE  Britain approved the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use less than a week ago, and is rolling it out ahead of the United States and European Union, with which Britain will finally part ways at the end of this year.  The Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31, and there is the possibility of chaos at ports afterwards, so military aircraft are on standby to step in.  In total, Britain has ordered 357 million doses of seven different COVID-19 vaccines.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine is being imported from Belgium, while initial supplies of the AstraZeneca\/Oxford shot are being shipped from Europe.  Amid the gravity of the pandemic, the vaccination on Tuesday of one William Shakespeare, an 81-year-old man from Warwickshire in England, was greeted with humour on social media.  Twitter users joked about \u201cThe Taming of the Flu\u201d and \u201cThe Two Gentlemen of Corona\u201d. Some asked whether Margaret Keenan was patient 1A, and Shakespeare \u201cPatient 2B or not 2B?\u201d","450":"WILMINGTON, Del.\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Joe Biden hailed Pfizer Inc\u2019s progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine on Monday but urged Americans to wear masks because it may not be widely available for many months, as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration tried to claim credit.  Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective here as it disclosed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test. That was major progress in the quest for a vaccine to combat a pandemic that has killed more than 237,000 Americans, thrown millions more out of work and contributed to Trump's defeat in last Tuesday's election.  The drugmaker developed its vaccine outside of the White House\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program, although the U.S. government placed an initial order in July for 100 million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses for $1.95 billion and can acquire up to 500 million additional doses. Operation Warp Speed pumped billions of dollars into six other pharmaceutical companies intended to accelerate development of a COVID-19 vaccine.  Pfizer also was one of a number of companies to be part of a public-private partnership launched by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in April to speed COVID-19 vaccine and treatment options.  Vice President Mike Pence on Twitter credited a \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d forged by Trump for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine development progress.  Biden, who said his advisers had been told of the breakthrough on Sunday night, in a statement called Pfizer\u2019s announcement \u201cgreat news\u201d but said it would be \u201cmany more months\u201d before widespread vaccination is available in the United States.  \u201cAs we work toward a safe and effective vaccine, we know the single most effective thing we can do to stop the spread of COVID is wear a mask,\u201d Biden, who made his criticism of Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign, told reporters in Wilmington, Delaware.  The United States has been registering record-high infection numbers in recent days. Mask wearing has become a political issue in the United States, with Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask during the campaign and many conservatives contending masks infringe on their individual freedom.  Biden spoke two days after clinching election victory over Trump, who has not conceded defeat and is pursuing legal challenges to the results while making unsubstantiated claims of fraud.

Not Democratic or Republican lives. American lives,\u201d Biden said, adding that \u201cit won\u2019t be forever.\u201d  Slideshow ( 5 images )  \u201cSo please, I implore you: Wear a mask. Do it for yourself. Do it for your neighbor. A mask is not a political statement, but it is a good way to start pulling the country together,\u201d Biden added.  Biden during the campaign accused Trump of panicking and surrendering to the pandemic. Trump promoted unproven medicines, assailed public health experts, failed to signal empathy or compassion as the death toll mounted and disregarded advice on mask wearing and social distancing, ending up hospitalized in October receiving treatments for COVID-19.  Housing Secretary Ben Carson and David Bossie, the lawyer charged with leading Trump\u2019s post-election legal challenges, became the latest people in Trump\u2019s orbit to test positive for COVID-19, just days after White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows also tested positive.  Biden cleared the threshold of 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency on Saturday after four days of ballot counting.  \u201cThis election is over,\u201d Biden told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric that is designed to demonize one another.\u201d  But senior Republican lawmakers continued to refuse to recognize Biden as the election winner. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump was fully within his rights to look into alleged voting irregularities, and in a Senate speech did not acknowledge Biden as president-elect.  Trump\u2019s re-election team asked for patience on Monday to pursue allegations of voter fraud. \u201cThis election is not over, far from it,\u201d Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters at a briefing in what she said was her capacity as a Trump campaign adviser.  Trump\u2019s campaign filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging Pennsylvania\u2019s mail-in voting system lacked the oversight and verification given in-person voting and seeking an emergency injunction to stop state officials from certifying Biden\u2019s victory in the state.  The Trump campaign and Republicans have brought numerous lawsuits alleging election irregularities. Judges have already tossed cases in Georgia and Michigan.  Trump, apparently intent on settling scores within his administration in the aftermath of the election, announced on Twitter on Monday he had \u201cterminated\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper.  Trump has been talking with his advisers about possibly running for president in 2024, a source familiar with the discussions said.","451":"Dec 21 (Reuters) -  * EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE THE PFIZER-BIONTECH VACCINE ON MONDAY - NYT Source text: nyti.ms\/37Coo4J Further company coverage:","452":"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Two of the South African government\u2019s top advisers on COVID-19 backed Pfizer\u2019s vaccine on Friday, despite a study earlier this week showing that the dominant local coronavirus variant may reduce protective antibodies it triggers.  FILE PHOTO: A South African health worker receives the Johnson and Johnson coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination at the Khayelitsha Hospital near Cape Town, South Africa, February 17, 2021. Gianluigi Guercia\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  The country is counting on the Pfizer shot, developed with German partner BioNTech, to step up its vaccination programme after administering its first Johnson & Johnson doses on Wednesday.  AstraZeneca vaccinations are on hold after a small local trial found the shot offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 variant first identified late last year.  The laboratory study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested that the 501Y.V2 variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer vaccine by two-thirds.  But scientists were quick to caution that because the study\u2019s findings were from a lab it was difficult to judge what they might mean in the real world.  Professor Barry Schoub, chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on vaccines, told Reuters the two-thirds reduction in antibodies mentioned in the study \u201cmeans there is quite a significant remnant neutralising potency, ... we feel Pfizer is still a very good vaccine in our context\u201d.  The advisory committee held its regular weekly meeting on Thursday and discussed the study.  While it has not been established in a clinical trial that the Pfizer vaccine protects against the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant, \u201cwe can have a reasonable extrapolation because it\u2019s such a potent stimulator of the immune system\u201d, Schoub said, adding that authorities would monitor closely those who get the Pfizer vaccine.  Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday that South Africa was expecting 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine initially and about 7 million doses by June.  \u2018WITHIN TOLERABLE LIMITS\u2019  Professor Salim Abdool Karim, another government adviser, said in a separate interview that the reduction in neutralising activity identified in the study was \u201cwithin the tolerable limits of what we can accept\u201d.  Importantly, he said, it was not yet established that antibodies against the spike protein that the virus uses to infect human cells correlate with protection.  \u201cIt is one of many hypotheses that are currently being investigated,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe do not know what it is in these vaccines that\u2019s leading to protection.\u201d  Asked whether he would recommend pausing Pfizer vaccinations for now, he said: \u201cNo, in fact the opposite. This is within our tolerable limits of neutralisation.\u201d  He said there was little point in doing a clinical study to further test the Pfizer vaccine against the local variant because it was already being adapted with a 501Y.V2 insert. \u201cSo if we had to start a clinical study, by the time we get the results they will already have their new vaccine,\u201d he continued.  South Africa, with nearly 1.5 million cases and over 48,000 deaths, has recorded almost half the COVID-19 fatalities and over a third of confirmed infections in Africa.  It lagged richer nations in launching its immunisation campaign.","453":"CHICAGO\/LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday said initial trial results for Pfizer Inc and BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine far outpaced their expectations for protection against a completely new disease, but that many questions remain unanswered.  FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  The drugmakers said their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to become infected with the coronavirus.  The efficacy rate means that the overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine.  The 44,000-volunteer study was initially designed for a first interim analysis of whether the vaccine was working after 32 participants developed COVID-19.  Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer\u2019s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in an interview the companies changed the study plan after discussions with U.S. regulators and ultimately ended up with data on 94 people.  \u201cIt gives you more power and more confidence,\u201d said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. \u201cWhen you triple the numbers and you get a large difference between them, it\u2019s much more likely to be real.\u201d  Others cautioned that many questions remain, including whether the vaccine can prevent severe disease or complications, how long it will protect against infection and how well it will work in the elderly.  They noted that required safety data will not be available until later this month. In addition, Pfizer and BioNTech have yet to submit their data for peer review by other scientists, a key step in determining the quality of the results.  \u2018REALLY ENCOURAGING\u2019 BUT EARLY  \u201cThese are really encouraging but they are the earliest of results possible,\u201d said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The full study is designed to show the vaccine is effective after 164 people fall ill. Pfizer said that may happen in the first or second week of December, when a panel of outside advisors to the Food and Drug Administration reviews the study results and decides whether to recommend authorizing its use.  Gruber said he did not yet have a breakdown of how many of the first 94 infections occurred among Black or Latino participants, two communities hit hard by the disease. He also did he know exactly how many elderly people in the trial got sick. Older people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19.  So far, none of the 94 people in the initial analysis developed severe COVID-19. The FDA initially had requested that the interim data include at least five severe cases, but recently relaxed that requirement, Gruber said.  \u201cIf a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University.  Gruber expects there will be some cases of severe disease before the trial ends.  \u201cBottom line is we\u2019re going to have to use the data we have and the high efficacy to give us confidence that we\u2019re going to prevent severe infection,\u201d he said.  Scientists also want to understand whether the Pfizer vaccine fully prevents people from getting infected with the new coronavirus - a huge advantage in reducing transmission - or if it simply reduces the degree to which they become ill.  \u201cIdeally, we want to be able to completely protect from infection, but I think we all accept that these so-called first generation vaccines are more likely to prevent disease,\u201d said Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain\u2019s University of Warwick. \u201cAnd the subtlety there, which is important, is if you\u2019re infected then you can still transmit the virus.\u201d  Pfizer intends to seek a broad approval for individuals aged 16 to 85, but the FDA and an advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would make decisions about who should be first in line to get the initial doses, which will be scarce.  If Pfizer wins emergency use authorization, Gruber said the company feels ethically bound to inform eligible trial participants who received a placebo that they are not protected against infection, and to offer them the vaccine in hopes of keeping them from dropping out of the trial.","454":"FILE PHOTO: A vial of the Pfizer vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is seen as medical staff are vaccinated at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, Israel December 19, 2020.

The Sheba Medical Center\u2019s findings compare with overall efficacy of around 95% in a two dose regimen 21 days apart for the shot developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech.  The Sheba study, to be published in The Lancet medical journal, comes a day after Canadian researchers suggested that the second Pfizer dose be delayed given the high level of protection from the first shot in order to increase the number of people getting vaccinated.  Their research showed efficacy of 92.6% after the first dose, based on an analysis of the documents submitted by the drugmaker from its late-stage human trials to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December.  The FDA said in December data from those trials showed that the vaccine began conferring some protection to recipients before they received the second shot, but more data would be needed to assess the potential of a single-dose shot.  Pfizer has said alternative dosing regimens of the vaccine have not been evaluated yet and that the decision resided with the health authorities.  Sheba said among 7,214 hospital staff who received their first dose in January, there was an 85% reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 within 15 to 28 days. The overall reduction of infections, including asymptomatic cases detected by testing, was 75%.  Sheba epidemiologist Gili Regev-Yochay cautioned that the cohort studied at the hospital were \u201cmostly young and healthy\u201d.  Unlike with Pfizer\u2019s clinical trial, \u201cwe don\u2019t have many (staff) here aged over 65,\u201d she told reporters. But she also noted that the Sheba study took place during a surge in COVID-19 infections in Israel, which flooded hospitals with new cases.  Pfizer declined to comment on the data, saying in a statement it was doing its own analysis of \u201cthe vaccine\u2019s real-world effectiveness in several locations worldwide, including Israel.\u201d It hopes to use Israeli data to look at the potential of the vaccine to protect against COVID-19 arising from emerging variants, the drugmaker said.

Pfizer initially said deliveries were proceeding on schedule, but then on Friday announced there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost output.  BioNTech said on Friday a facility in Puurs, Belgium, will temporarily see a drop in the number of doses delivered in the coming week, as changes to some production processes were needed to scale up capacity.  The companies will inform the European Commission, EU member states and other countries impacted by the changes about the updated delivery schedules, BioNTech said.  \u201cThis situation is unacceptable,\u201d the health and social affairs ministers of six EU states said in a letter to the EU commission about the Pfizer delays.  \u201cNot only does it impact the planned vaccination schedules, it also decreases the credibility of the vaccination process,\u201d the ministers from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said.  \u201cWhat we want is for Pfizer-BioNTech to restore their deliveries to the agreed schedule,\u201d Lithuanian health minister Arunas Dulkys told Reuters.  Germany, Europe\u2019s largest purchaser of the Pfizer vaccine, called the decision surprising and regrettable, while Canada said it was also affected, because its supplies come from the Belgium factory.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Italy\u2019s COVID-19 special commissioner, Domenico Arcuri, said Pfizer would from Monday cut by 29% deliveries of vaccine shots to the country. The company had not been able to say for how long it would be curtailing its supplies, said Arcuri.  The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Pfizer had reassured her that deliveries planned to the EU in the first quarter would not be delayed.  PROMISED INCREASE  Pfizer, which is trying to deliver millions of doses at a breakneck pace to curb a pandemic that has already killed over 2 million people worldwide, said its changes would \u201cprovide a significant increase in doses in late February and March\u201d.  \u201cWe will be back to the original schedule of deliveries to the European Union beginning the week of Jan. 25, with increased delivery beginning the week of Feb. 15,\u201d BioNTech said in a statement.  The changes will help the companies deliver the fully committed quantity of doses in the first quarter and more in the second quarter, the company said.  A second EU source told Reuters that in a meeting with diplomats on Wednesday an EU Commission official said deliveries would be limited at least until March, with production set to be ramped up in earnest only by September.  Pfizer and BioNTech have contracts with the EU to supply up to 600 million doses this year. They have agreed to deliver 75 million shots in the second quarter and more later in the year. Neither the companies nor the EU have said how many doses are expected in the first quarter.  The EU has also approved the vaccine developed by U.S. biotech firm Moderna, which began deliveries this week.  Moderna has committed to delivering 10 million doses by the end of March and 35 million each in the second and third quarter. Another 80 million doses are also to be delivered this year but without a clear timetable yet.  PRO RATA?  Pfizer and Moderna have not published detailed calendars of deliveries for each EU country.  Pfizer said the information was confidential, while Moderna said: \u201cAt this stage we can only confirm that the doses will be distributed on a pro-rata basis between EU countries.\u201d  But deliveries do not seem to be proceeding evenly.  The German Health Ministry website says the country, with a population of 83 million, will receive nearly 4 million Pfizer doses by the end of January. By contrast, Bulgaria, with a population of roughly 7 million, expects to receive only about 60,000 Pfizer shots in January.  A spokesman for the EU Commission said national timetables partly depended on contracts signed by each state. It is not clear whether all EU governments ordered their full allocation of vaccines, as this information is confidential.  The EU has secured nearly 2.3 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines and candidates from six firms, but most are yet to be approved.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  This is the sixth potential vaccine for which the European Union executive has struck or plans to strike an advance purchase agreement.  The envisaged contract with Germany\u2019s BioNTech and U.S.-based Pfizer would lead to an initial purchase of 200 million doses, with an option to buy a further 100 million, the Commission said after the conclusion of exploratory talks.  All EU members would have the possibility to buy the vaccine and could donate to poorer nations or redirect to other European countries.  EU supply would be produced by BioNTech\u2019s sites in Germany and Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing site in Belgium, with deliveries starting by the end of the year, the companies said in a statement.  They added they were on track to seek regulatory review of their potential vaccine in October and, subject to approval, plan to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.  The proposed agreement with the European Commission would be the largest initial order of doses for Pfizer and BioNTech to date, they said.  The companies are developing a new variety of vaccine based on messenger RNA (mRNA), which makes the human body create viral proteins, prompting the immune system to produce a defensive response.  The Commission reached a first agreement last month with AstraZeneca for at least 300 million doses of its potential vaccine, mirroring moves by the United States and other wealthy states to secure stock of effective COVID-19 vaccines.  It has also concluded exploratory talks with Sanofi-GSK, Johnson & Johnson, CureVac and Moderna to buy upfront their potential COVID-19 vaccines and is in discussions with other manufacturers.","469":"(Adds comment by U.S. president, doctor)  Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it authorized the use of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, with the first inoculations expected within days, marking a turning point in the United States where the pandemic has killed more than 295,000 people.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, which was shown to be 95% effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial.  The FDA said the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older. Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of a first round of 2.9 million doses.  \u201cThe first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours,\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump said in a video posted on Twitter. \u201cI am proud to say we have made sure this vaccine will be free for all Americans.\u201d  The U.S. government has said it will begin distributing the vaccine around the country immediately after FDA authorization and that the first inoculations would happen early next week.  Millions of Americans could begin getting vaccinated this month, especially if a second vaccine from Moderna Inc is quickly approved.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was first approved in Britain earlier this month, and UK residents began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Canada also authorized the vaccine and expects to start inoculations next week.  Mexico and Bahrain have also approved the vaccine.  The FDA authorization, known as an EUA, comes at a time when infections, hospitalizations and deaths are soaring to record levels in the United States, which has failed to mount a coordinated effort to slow the spread of the virus. Earlier this week, the one-day COVID-19 death total topped 3,000, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity, threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems.  \u201cThe EUA was anticipated and it is one step in a sequence of steps that will bring this pandemic to an end,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to feel that there is an EUA tomorrow when I\u2019m taking care of COVID-19 patients. A lot of people will be infected, a lot will be hospitalized and a lot will die before the vaccine is able to have a meaningful impact on spread,\u201d he added.  Others with vaccines in advanced development include Moderna, which could win emergency U.S. authorization as soon as next week, AstraZeneca Plc with Oxford University, and Johnson & Johnson.  BioNTech began developing the vaccine in January, using a technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) that had yet to produce an approved product. The technology uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic part of the new coronavirus, which the immune system learns to recognize as an invader. BioNTech struck a development deal with Pfizer in March.  The vaccine comes with complex distribution challenges as it must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or supplies of dry ice.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine employs the same technology but does not need to be stored at sub-Arctic temperatures.  THE FIRST SHOTS  Pfizer has developed a special shipping container that will be filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling. Many states are concerned about whether there is enough dry ice for shipments to rural areas that lack the specialized freezers, but Pfizer believes there should be sufficient supply.  The U.S. quest for a vaccine has been the central response to the pandemic from a Trump administration that has mostly otherwise left states to fend for themselves. It has said it will have enough to supply all of the 330 million U.S. residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021.  The government has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - through its Operation Warp Speed virus development program and could negotiate for more. The status of those talks are unclear.  Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week that the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down.  The United States has agreed to buy 200 million doses of Moderna\u2019s two-dose vaccine. The government also has supply deals with J&J and AstraZeneca, but authorization of those vaccines are not imminent.  Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said if distribution goes well and enough Americans agree to get vaccinated, relief for a pandemic weary nation may be on the horizon.  \u201cIf we do it efficiently enough by the second quarter of 2021, and by the end of summer or end of third quarter, we may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as we get to the end of 2021, we could approach very much some degree of normality that is close to where we were before.\u201d (Additional reporting by Ann Maria Shibu in Bengaluru, Eric Beech in Washington and Carl O\u2019Donnell in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler, Daniel Wallis, Peter Henderson, Sonya Hepinstall and Raju Gopalakrishnan)","470":"* Ex-Japan Asia shares rises above Nov peak  * U.S. stock futures up, rebounding after Pfizer report hit  * Euro, emerging market currencies at highest since April 2018  * 2020 asset performance tmsnrt.rs\/2yaDPgn  TOKYO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares scaled a record high on Friday on the growing prospect of a large U.S. economic package, while hopes that vaccine rollouts will boost the global economy underpinned investor sentiment.

On top of fiscal support, investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to tweak its guidance of its asset purchase scheme later this month while the European Central Bank looks certain to increase its bond buying next week.  Progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines also led investors to bet a recovery in corporate earnings will accelerate next year, overriding any concerns about the current dire conditions of the pandemic.  The United States topped 14 million known COVID-19 infections with over 100,000 patients hospitalized for the first time. California imposed stay-at-home orders to take effect when intensive care units approach capacity in the coming days.  \u201cStock markets are behaving as if the world has already overcome the disease.

Nevertheless, I don\u2019t think the market is peaking just yet.\u201d  The upbeat mood saw the U.S. dollar lose ground to other major currencies as well as riskier, less liquid ones.  The euro rose to $1.2142, its highest levels since April 2018 while the yen stood at 103.85 per dollar, holding on to its 0.5% gains made the previous day.  The British pound changed hands at $1.3453, having hit a three-month high on Thursday with traders clinging to hopes of a trade deal between the European Union and Britain.  As talks continued to secure a Brexit deal, an EU official said an agreement was closer than ever but a UK government source warned chances for a breakthrough were receding.  The MSCI\u2019s emerging market currency index stood at 2 1\/2-year high, having gained more than 10% from its March trough.  In commodities, oil prices got an additional lift after OPEC and Russia agreed to slightly ease their deep oil output cuts from January by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) even as they failed to find a compromise on a broader and longer term policy.  The increase means the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, a group known as OPEC+, would move to cutting production by 7.2 million bpd, or 7% of global demand from January, compared with current cuts of 7.7 million bpd.

A small ex-Soviet republic sandwiched between Ukraine and EU member state Romania, Moldova has said it plans to receive enough free vaccines through the COVAX scheme to vaccinate 20% of its 3.5 million population.  Later, Chisinau plans to purchase vaccines through COVAX at a reduced price.  In December, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said Bucharest would donate 200,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to Moldova, in a gesture of solidarity following the election of the pro-Western President Maia Sandu.  Chisinau has said it can share vaccines with its breakaway region of Transdniestria, while Tiraspol authorities say the region will use Russia-made vaccines.  Transdniestria nominally seceded from Moldova in 1990, one year before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, fearing the country might shortly merge with Romania, whose language and culture it broadly shares.

Asked why Italy did not follow Germany\u2019s example by procuring vaccine supply over and above its EU allotment, Conte said this was forbidden under the terms of the agreement overseen by the European Commission.  There have been complaints in Italy among commentators and the political opposition that Germany - the EU\u2019s largest member state and home to BioNTech - may be getting more than its fair share of shots.  Most of the three-hour news conference was devoted to tensions in Conte\u2019s ruling coalition in which former prime minister Matteo Renzi, leader of the tiny centrist party Italia Viva, constantly threatens to bring down the government.  Renzi is unhappy with Conte\u2019s plans for using money expected from the European Recovery Fund.

That opens the door for its early use in hard to reach places that might not be appropriate for Pfizer Inc's PFE.N vaccine which needs ultra-cold storage.  Here are details of how it could be distributed.  HOW COLD IS COLD STORAGE?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine is stable for up to six months at a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), about home freezer levels, when shipped and stored.  The company said it expects the vaccine to be stable when kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days, up from an initial projection of 7 days. The vaccine will be distributed in 10-dose vials and can be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours after thawing.  By comparison, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine can be transported and stored for up to 6 months at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F). It can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to five days.  WHEN WILL IT BE SHIPPED, TO WHOM?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine will be distributed by the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program. U.S. health officials have said that at first they are most likely to distribute vaccines to healthcare workers, people who are in nursing homes, first responders and those with health conditions who are high-risk.  Most Americans will be inoculated in May or June, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert.  Under Operation Warp Speed\u2019s distribution plan, the first group of shots will likely be distributed to and administered in closed settings, like hospitals and nursing homes.  After January, as supply increases, those shots will start to be available in pharmacies, doctors offices and clinics as well as mobile clinics, the plan shows.  Health officials have said it will be easier to use Moderna\u2019s vaccine in these settings than Pfizer\u2019s.  HOW WELL DOES THE MODERNA VACCINE WORK?  Moderna on Monday said its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 based on early results from large studies. That is similar to Pfizer\u2019s which the U.S. drugmaker has said is more than 90% effective.

Ankara has so far received 13 million doses of Coronavac, but no BioNTech shots.  Turkey has reported more than 2.6 million cases and nearly 28,000 deaths from COVID-19 since March. In December, it imposed weekend lockdowns, nightly curfews and other curbs in the face of rising cases.  President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday Turkey will begin a gradual return to \u201cnormal life\u201d in March on a province-by-province basis.","480":"(recasts with background on short supplies, adds company no comments)  BRUSSELS, Jan 6 (Reuters) - The European drugs regulator could soon give the go ahead for an extra sixth dose to be extracted from Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine vials, an EU official told Reuters on Wednesday, lifting the number of available shots at a time when supplies are short.  EU countries started inoculating people with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine two weeks ago, after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the shot\u2019s conditional approval under an authorisation which allows five doses to be extracted from each vial.  The agency is now considering whether to give the go ahead for an extra dose to be taken from each vial. The source, who asked to remain anonymous because discussions are not public, said the change to the authorisation could come \u201cvery soon\u201d.  \u201cThe company has submitted a request for change, which is being reviewed by the CHMP (human medicines committee) in the shortest possible timeframe,\u201d an EMA spokeswoman said, noting the agency had prompted Pfizer to submit data on the possible use of six doses per vial.  \u201cIf the CHMP finds that 6 doses can be extracted consistently, it will recommend a change to the current terms of the authorisation to support Member States in their roll-out of the vaccine,\u201d the spokeswoman added.  Pfizer was not immediately available to comment and BioNTech declined to comment.  The change could add a requirement for the use of special syringes that allow the precise extraction of more doses from the same vial, the source said.  \u201cThe responsible people in the member states should order these special syringes (Low Dead Space Syringes) now,\u201d EU lawmaker Peter Liese said, adding they were widely available and could cost as little as 0.09 euros ($0.1) each.  This change in authorisation could allow 20% more doses to be available in the EU under an existing contract with Pfizer, Liese said.  The EU has secured 200 million doses, and has taken up an option for another 100 million. It is also in talks for a new order of 50 to 100 million doses, EU officials told Reuters on Tuesday.  The first 200 million doses are expected to be delivered by September, the EU has said. The bloc has a population of 450 million and each vaccine recipient requires two doses.  On Wednesday the EU also authorised Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, of which it has ordered 80 million doses with the option for an additional 80 million, although it is not clear when deliveries will begin..  EU states could use EU vaccines in different ways from those recommended by EMA, but if they do so they face liability risks.

FILE PHOTO: The exterior of EMA, European Medicines Agency is seen in Amsterdam, Netherlands December 18, 2020. REUTERS\/Piroschka van de Wouw  European Union countries including Germany, France, Austria and Italy have said they plan to start vaccinations from Dec. 27 as Europe tries to catch up with the United States and Britain, where inoculations began earlier this month.  Having secured a green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Commission gave final approval on Monday evening to the EU\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccine.  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said doses would be available for all EU countries, at the same time and on the same conditions.  \u201cToday we add an important chapter to a European success story. We approved the first safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19. More vaccines will come soon,\u201d she said.  Pfizer and BioNTech said here they are ready to immediately ship initial doses of the vaccine, branded in the EU as Comirnaty, to the 27 EU member states.  Vaccine doses for Europe will be produced in BioNTech\u2019s manufacturing sites in Germany, and Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, the companies said.  Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza hailed the approval as \u201cthe news we have been waiting for\u201d.  \u201c(It) opened up a new phase and gives us more strength and confidence\u201d in tackling a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of Europeans, he said.  Preparations for the vaccine roll-out come as the identification of a highly infectious new strain of the coronavirus in Britain caused chaos across the region, with countries shutting off travel ties with the United Kingdom and disrupting trade ahead of the Christmas holiday.  EMA officials said it was highly likely the vaccine would work against the new variant of the coronavirus.  EMA executive director Emer Cooke said it would take a long time to inoculate the 450 million people of the 27 EU countries.  \u201cVaccines alone will not be the silver bullet that will allow us to return to normal lives, but the authorisation of this first vaccine is definitely a major step in the right direction and an indication that 2021 can be brighter than 2020,\u201d she told a news briefing.  VACCINATION DRIVE  Student medics, retired doctors, pharmacists and soldiers are being drafted into a European vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale.  A phased-in approach means frontline healthcare workers and elderly residents of care homes are being prioritised, with most national schemes not reaching the general public until the end of the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest.  The EMA had started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6 in an effort to speed an approval process that usually takes at least seven months.  The EMA clearance, initially granted as conditional marketing approval (CMA), is valid for one year and can be renewed annually. It can be converted into a standard marketing authorisation after further data checks. This would be valid for five years but can be renewed for unlimited validity.  The process took longer than the ultra-fast emergency authorisation given by Britain, the first western country to endorse a COVID-19 shot.  EUROPE\u2019S DRUG TEST  The roll-out will be a test for Brussels\u2019 ability to unify Europe amid political pressure to speed up the process and tame the pandemic which has killed more than 1.6 million people globally.  The EU has ordered 200 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, enough to vaccinate 100 million people, paying 15.50 euros ($18.90) per dose.  It will also buy an extra 100 million with a timetable for delivery still to be negotiated.  EMA officials denied any political interference and defended the speed of the approval process.  \u201cThe focus was exclusively on the science, there were too many involved of the member states who would look into the science as to allow any political whitewashing or adaption,\u201d said Harald Enzmann, chair of EMA\u2019s Human Medicines Committee (CHMP).","482":"June 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * FDA APPROVES BAVENCIO AS FIRST-LINE MAINTENANCE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH LOCALLY ADVANCED OR METASTATIC UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA  * PFIZER INC - FIRST & ONLY FDA-APPROVED IMMUNOTHERAPY TO DEMONSTRATE A SIGNIFICANT OVERALL SURVIVAL BENEFIT IN FIRST-LINE SETTING IN PHASE III STUDY  * PFIZER INC - IN JAVELIN BLADDER 100, BAVENCIO MAINTENANCE TREATMENT EXTENDED MEDIAN OVERALL SURVIVAL BY 50% OVER STANDARD OF CARE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage: (Reuters.Briefs@thomsonreuters.com)","483":"FILE PHOTO: The CVS logo is seen at one of their stores in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  Starting with the elderly and frontline workers, Britain began mass vaccinating its population on Tuesday, part of a global drive that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history.  The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there had been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began.  \u201cAny person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,\u201d MHRA Chief Executive June Raine said in a statement.  \u201cMost people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 outweigh the risks... You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA\u2019s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.\u201d  Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system, which the National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening.  The fuller guidance, clarifying that the main risk was from anaphylaxis specifically, was issued after consulting experts on allergies. The MHRA had initially advised anyone with a history of a \u201csignificant allergic reaction\u201d not to take the shot.  Pfizer and BioNTech said they were supporting the MHRA\u2019s investigation.  Last week, Britain\u2019s MHRA became the first in the world to approve the vaccine, developed by Germany\u2019s BioNTech and Pfizer, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) continue to assess the data.  A top U.S. official said on Wednesday that Americans with known severe allergic reactions may not be candidates for Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine until more was understood about what had happened.  Canada\u2019s health ministry said it would look at the reported adverse reactions in Britain, but said adverse events were to be expected and would not necessarily change the risk\/benefit of the shot, after the country approved the vaccine.  ALLERGIC REACTION  MHRA chief Raine told lawmakers such allergic reactions had not been a feature of the Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials.  Pfizer has said people with a history of severe adverse allergic reactions to vaccines or the candidate\u2019s ingredients were excluded from their late stage trials, which is reflected in the MHRA\u2019s emergency approval protocol.  However, the allergic reactions may have been caused by a component of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilise the shot and is not in other types of vaccines.  Imperial College London\u2019s Paul Turner, an expert in allergy and immunology, who has been advising the MHRA on their revised guidance, told Reuters: \u201cAs we\u2019ve had more information through, the initial concern that maybe it affects everyone with allergies is not true.\u201d  \u201cThe ingredients like PEG which we think might be responsible for the reactions are not related to things which can cause food allergy. Likewise, people with a known allergy to just one medicine should not be at risk,\u201d Turner told Reuters.  The EMA said in an email that all quality, safety and efficacy data would be taken into account in assessing the vaccine, including data generated outside the EU.  In the United States, the FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for an advisory committee meeting on Thursday, saying the Pfizer vaccine\u2019s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for authorization.  The briefing documents said 0.63% of people in the vaccine group and 0.51% in the placebo group reported possible allergic reactions in trials, which Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said was a very small number.  \u201cThe fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well,\u201d he said.  However, Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that the MHRA and NHS had overreacted initially.  \u201cI would not have broadened to the degree they did,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to let the world know about this, and to be aware of it in terms of people who have had reactions like this to vaccines.

Switzerland has ordered a total of about 15 million doses, including from other manufacturers whose products have yet to be approved, after setting aside 400 million Swiss francs ($455 million) to buy shots.

John Maniaci\/UW health\/Handout via REUTERS  (Reuters) -The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.  mRNA vaccines may need more study for treating some cancer patients  COVID-19 vaccines that employ new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to fend off the illness may require further testing before it becomes clear they are safe for cancer patients with solid tumors, cancer treatment experts say. That would include the vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna Inc. The vaccines work by carrying genetic instructions for making a protein from the virus that the immune system learns to recognize and defend against. The mRNA is encased in a microscopic \"packet\" called a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), or liposome, that protects and delivers the fragile molecule into cells. While this technique is new for vaccines, it has long been used to carry cancer drugs into tumors, because tumors easily take up liposomes. This raises the possibility that tumor tissues would capture some of the liposomes carrying the vaccine's mRNA, said Gerard Milano of Nice University in France. The potential for part of the vaccine to become stuck in tumors and the resulting effect on cancer patients \"is an open question to which there is currently no answer,\" Milano said. In a paper published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer, his team calls for \"a careful evaluation of the efficacy of these promising mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered as lipid carriers for patients with solid tumors, including a possible re-appraisal of the dosing for optimal protection of this specific and frail population.\" (go.nature.com\/2JQq4hV)  Solid sewage beats wastewater for tracking COVID-19  Public health officials trying to track the spread of the new coronavirus might be better off looking for its genetic material in solid sewage rather than in wastewater, a new study suggests. For several days in March and April, researchers collected and analyzed wastewater and the solids that settled out of the water at two California sewage treatment plants. They reported on Wednesday in Environmental Science & Technology that concentrations of genetic material from the virus were up to 1,000 times higher in the solids than in the wastewater, making detection more sensitive and accurate for the solid samples. They also analyzed settled solids collected over several months from waste treatment plants in a large urban area and found that concentrations of genetic material on different days correlated with the number of new COVID-19 cases reported on those days. Coauthor Krista Wigginton of the University of Michigan said that compared to extracting the virus from raw sewage, extracting it from solids \"requires fewer steps and essentially the same equipment,\" potentially making it \"a more straightforward and more sensitive approach\" to COVID-19 surveillance. (bit.ly\/3oAL9Ma)  Men worldwide doing worse with COVID-19  A large international study of COVID-19 patients confirms that men are more likely than women to become seriously ill and die of the disease. Researchers pooled data from government websites and the medical literature on more than 3.1 million people infected with the new coronavirus in 46 countries. They found no difference in the proportion of male and female patients who contracted COVID-19. Men, however, were nearly three times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit and 39% more likely to die from COVID-19. In a report published on Wednesday in Nature Communications, the investigators said previous studies have found \"fundamental differences\" in the way men's bodies and women's bodies respond to infections. In people with COVID-19, they write, \"these differences are likely to lead to more effective viral control in females.\" The data has important implications for managing patients and for public health, the researchers said.

SINGAPORE  On Dec. 30, the city-state became the first Asian country to begin inoculation of the Pfizer vaccine, despite one of the lowest fatality rates from the coronavirus worldwide.  It has signed advanced purchase pacts and made early down-payments on vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech Ltd.  It expects to have secured enough vaccines for its 5.7 million people by the third quarter of 2021.  AUSTRALIA  The country has secured about 140 million doses: 53.8 million from AstraZeneca, 51 million from Novavax Inc, 10 million from Pfizer, and 25.5 million from distribution programme COVAX.  It expects delivery of 3.8 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in January and February 2021, and plans to begin inoculations in February.  NEW ZEALAND  Novavax agreed to supply 10.7 million doses, with initial doses to be delivered by mid-2021.  CHINA  China has not announced supply deals with Western drugmakers, which have partnered with private firms in the country instead.  AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine may be approved in China by mid-2021 and is being produced by its Chinese partner Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products Co Ltd.  Additionally, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd plans to buy at least 100 million doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding Co is bringing in Russian vaccine candidate Sputnik V and plans early and mid-stage trials in China.  On Dec. 31, China gave its first COVID-19 vaccine approval to a shot developed by a unit of state-backed Sinopharm, for use by the general public.  Prior to the approval, China had already vaccinated more than 2 million people under an emergency use programme, using three different shots developed by Sinopharm units and Sinovac.  JAPAN  Japan has deals to buy 120 million doses from Pfizer\/BioNTech in the first half of 2021 and to purchase 120 million from AstraZeneca - the first 30 million to be shipped by March 2021. It has also agreed to buy 250 million from Novavax.  Japan is also in talks with Johnson & Johnson, and has a deal with Shionogi & Co Ltd.

The first doses are set to be administered on Tuesday, with the National Health Service (NHS) giving top priority to vaccinating the over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents.  Britain gave emergency use approval for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech last week - jumping ahead in the global race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history.  In total, Britain has ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.  About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week.  Initial doses that have arrived from Belgium are being stored in secure locations across the country, where they will be quality checked, the health ministry said.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine has onerous storage requirements. It needs to be kept at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge.  For that reason, the health ministry said the vaccine would first be administered in 50 hospitals. It said it would take a few hours to defrost each vaccine and prepare it for use.  NHS England has written to general practitioners, telling them to get ready to start giving vaccinations through local doctors\u2019 services from Dec. 14.  Rather than run clinics in individual surgeries, groups of local doctors will operate more than 1,000 vaccination centres across the country, the government said.  Boxes of the vaccine contain five packs of 975 doses, but special regulatory approval is needed to split them up. A senior medical official has said that while he was hopeful it would be possible to split the packs and deliver straight to care homes, it was not guaranteed.

Biden is due to tour Pfizer\u2019s largest manufacturing site and its only facility in the United States making the COVID-19 vaccine at a time when less than 15% of the U.S. population is vaccinated.  The United States has rolled out ambitious vaccination programs in recent weeks that include large sites capable of putting shots into thousands of arms daily, as well as hospitals and pharmacies. But officials are begging for more doses.  The Biden administration has been working to increase the number of doses it sends out to states, cities and pharmacies every week, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden\u2019s top medical adviser, said on Tuesday that demand far outpaced supply at the moment.  The White House said earlier this month it was using the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer get additional equipment fast so that it could keep ramping up production. Biden is expected to discuss that initiative - which officials say is starting to pay dividends - with Pfizer executives during his tour.  Pfizer has not yet delivered to the European Union about 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses that were due in December, EU officials told Reuters.  Jeff Williams, mayor of Arlington, Texas, who met with Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in recent weeks, said his city of 400,000 was ready to vaccinate 40,000 people a day but only had enough supply to administer 3,000 doses.  300 MILLION DOSES  Pfizer is under contract to supply the United States with 300 million doses of the two-dose vaccine it developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE.  The company has said it will provide the U.S. government with 100 million doses by the end of March and another 100 million by the end of May. It has promised the full 300 million doses by the end of July.  As of the end of January, Pfizer had supplied the U.S. government with about 29 million doses of the vaccine. That is about as many doses that had been used by Wednesday, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.  Moderna Inc, which is also producing COVID-19 vaccine domestically, has agreed to supply the United States with 300 million doses of its own two-dose vaccine by the end of July.  Biden told a CNN town hall on Tuesday that everyone who wanted a vaccine should be able to get one by July, but said the recovery from the pandemic that has killed more than 485,000 people in the United States would still take many months.  Globally, Pfizer and BioNTech aim to make 2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine this year. Pfizer\u2019s chief financial officer told Reuters earlier this month that it had recently doubled the size of the batches of its vaccine and increased the number of batches it was producing.  Pfizer is one of the largest employers in the Kalamazoo area, a Democratic-leaning county in the electoral battleground state, which Biden carried in the November election.","510":"MADRID, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Pfizer has postponed the delivery of a new batch of the coronavirus vaccine to Spain by one day to Tuesday due to a logistics hurdle, Health Minister Salvador Illa said on Monday.  \u201cThey (vaccines) will be available tomorrow first thing in the morning in vaccination points,\u201d Illa said in an interview to Cadena SER radio station.

Pregnant women are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and many public health officials have recommended some women in high-risk professions take coronavirus vaccines even without proof they are safe for them.  Last week, the U.S. National Institutes of Health called for greater inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in COVID-19 vaccine research.  Bioethicists, vaccine and maternal health experts have argued for years that pregnant women should be included early in trials of pandemic vaccines so they would not need to wait until long after a successful one emerges.  Nevertheless, pregnant women were excluded from the large U.S. trials used to obtain emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines.  Drugmakers have said they first need to make sure the vaccines are safe and effective more generally. In the United States, regulators require drugmakers to conduct safety studies in pregnant animals before vaccines are tested in pregnant women to ensure they do not harm the fetus or lead to a miscarriage. The companies said those studies revealed no new risks.  Pregnant women in the United States have already received their first doses, the companies said.  The new study will test pregnant women aged 18 and older in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, South Africa, the UK and Spain.  Women will receive the vaccine during weeks 24-34 of gestation, getting two shots 21 days apart - the same regimen used in the larger clinical trial.  Shortly after giving birth, participants who got a placebo in the trial will be given an opportunity to get the actual vaccine, while remaining part of the study, the companies said.","514":"SYDNEY\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - News of an effective vaccine against the novel coronavirus is fueling bets that a global economic recovery will buoy wide swaths of the market that have struggled under nearly nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE expect to seek U.S. authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine, raising the possibility of a regulatory decision as soon as December.  Investors piled into banks stocks, airlines and other economically-sensitive companies that had been battered by months of coronavirus-led lockdowns and travel bans, pushing major U.S. stock indexes to fresh record highs, while havens like gold and the Japanese yen sold off and the U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened.  For months, many investors viewed the development of an effective vaccine against COVID-19, which has killed 1.2 million people globally, as the most important catalyst for healing the global economy and bringing about the next major shift in financial markets.  The prospects of a working vaccine sometime in the next few months could force investors to reevaluate a range of recent bets, from how big of a fiscal stimulus lawmakers may need to provide to whether the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near historic lows for as long as previously expected.  It may also dent the allure of the big technology and momentum stocks, whose revenues have proven durable during the pandemic. Some of those huge stocks, such as Amazon.com AMZN.O, were underperforming on Monday.  \u201cI think this really takes two big uncertainties - the health impact of COVID and the economic impact of COVID - and creates a pathway now that I think investors can see to progress and to the restoration of our health and the economy,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management.  To be sure, obstacles remain before achieving broad protection against the coronavirus.  Pfizer is waiting for more complete safety data before seeking emergency U.S. approval for the vaccine. Should the vaccine be authorized, logistical challenges potentially could undermine distribution while many Americans carry skepticism about vaccines that could prevent widespread inoculation.  \u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead still,\u201d said Nigel Green, the chief executive of deVere Group, in an note to investors. \u201cI would urge investors to remain optimistically cautious and avoid the \u2018buy everything\u2019 mindset.\u201d  Investors have anticipated that an effective vaccine could be a catalyst for industries that have been crippled by economic shutdowns designed to control the coronavirus pandemic. Those include airlines, cruise ships, hotels, casinos, all of which were surging on Monday, in addition to economically-sensitive sectors such as energy, financials and industrials.  Many of those groups fall into the \"value\" segment of the stock market, which had significantly lagged its \"growth\" counterparts this year. On Monday, that trend ran in reverse, with the Russell 1000 value index .RLV recently up over 5%, while the Russell 1000 growth index .RLG gaining only 0.5%.  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, has in recent months been buying the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF IWD.P while reducing exposure to the Technology Selector Sector SPDR Fund XLK.P.  \u201cTechnology has become the de facto, stay-at-home conservative play,\u201d Nolte said. If the vaccine works, \u201cthere\u2019s the opportunity at least for people getting together again, and that is beneficial to a lot of those industries that have suffered through the last six months or so.\u201d  Past rebounds in value have often come at the expense of momentum stocks, according to research from Solomon Tadesse, head of quantitative equities strategy for North America at Societe Generale.  One such move came during a three-month period in 2009, when value stocks notched a 25% gain while momentum names lost about 30%, Tadesse said.  Positive vaccine news, along with a globally synchronized economic expansion and possible legislative gridlock stemming from the U.S. election, \u201cshould mark a breakout point for Value stocks, which have been beaten down due to COVID crisis,\u201d JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note Monday.  Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management in Wisconsin, said ahead of the vaccine news that industrials offered broad exposure to a rebound in confidence in areas from building products to aviation.  Some global investors had also set up plays before Monday that would benefit from a potential shift in market leadership that a vaccine could bring.  Shinji Naito at Japan's SPARX Asset Management, which has $12 billion under management, hopes a vaccine could trigger a payoff from shorts in stocks pumped up by the pandemic, such as some technology firms, while helping long investments such as realtor Tokyo Tatemono 8804.T, he said before Monday's news.","515":"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel received its first shipment of coronavirus vaccines on Wednesday and a distributor predicted the country would have enough for about a quarter of the population by the end of the year.

REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido  It also finalized a plan to develop a coronavirus vaccine in partnership with German drugmaker BioNTech SE 22UAy.F and said the companies hope to produce millions of vaccines by the end of 2020. The companies said they plan to start trials of the vaccine as early as this month.  Data from preclinical studies of a compound that was originally developed to treat SARS - a different coronavirus that caused a major epidemic in 2003 - shows its potential to treat patients with the new coronavirus, Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in an interview.  Pfizer said it will conduct additional preclinical studies of the drug and aims to begin trials in humans in the third quarter of 2020.  In addition, Pfizer said it plans to support studies to determine whether existing Pfizer medicines, including its rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz, may provide benefits for those struggling with the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.  \u201cPfizer has mobilized resources and capabilities to address every single frontier of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Dolsten said.  More than a dozen large drugmakers, including Pfizer, have announced plans in recent months to develop vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus, although few if any are likely to reach patients in time to stem the current outbreak.  Reuters last month was first to report Pfizer\u2019s planned collaboration with BioNTech on a vaccine based on messenger RNA technology.  Pfizer will pay BioNTech $185 million upfront to develop the vaccine, with additional payments if certain milestones are achieved that could boost its total investment to nearly $750 million, the companies said.  Pfizer will help manufacture any eventual product and said it aims produce hundreds of millions of vaccines next year.  The largest U.S. drugmaker also announced a five-point plan for confronting the virus that includes collaborating with outside companies and institutions on the research, development and manufacture of treatments.  Meanwhile, Pfizer will help fund a study into whether Xeljanz, which belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors and also treats the autoimmune disease ulcerative colitis, can help patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19.  Rheumatoid arthritis treatments from other drugmakers that work differently than Xeljanz are also being studied as possible COVID-19 treatments.  Pfizer is also looking into the potential of other drugs that work on the immune system to help coronavirus patients, the company said.  The company is also working with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine on two studies to better understand the relationship between coronavirus and pneumonia, which plays a role in many deaths caused by the virus that attacks the lungs.  Pfizer will also publish a review of research into whether its antibiotic azithromycin, sold under the brand name Zithromax, can play a role in treating COVID-19.  Azithromycin has been used with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine by some doctors after a French study suggested the combination might benefit some COVID-19 patients.","520":"May 8 (Reuters) - Xtalpi Inc:  * XTALPI INC - STRATEGIC RESEARCH COLLABORATION WITH PFIZER TO DEVELOP A HYBRID PHYSICS- AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-POWERED SOFTWARE PLATFORM Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","521":"FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020.

FILE PHOTO: A dose of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination of BioNTech and Pfizer is pictured in this undated handout photo, as Britain became the first western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, in Mainz, Germany. BioNTech SE 2020, all rights reserved\/Handout via REUTERS  The move to grant emergency authorisation to the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine has been seen by many as a political coup for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has led his country out of the EU and faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic.  The decision was made under an ultra-fast, emergency approval process, which allowed the British drugs regulator to temporarily authorise the vaccine only 10 days after it began examining data from large-scale trials.  In an unusually blunt statement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is in charge of approving COVID-19 vaccines for the EU, said its longer approval procedure was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and required more checks than the emergency procedure chosen by Britain.  The agency said on Tuesday it would decide by Dec. 29 whether to provisionally authorise the vaccine from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE .  A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU executive, said the EMA\u2019s procedure was \u201cthe most effective regulatory mechanism to grant all EU citizens\u2019 access to a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d as it was based on more evidence.  Pfizer UK Country Manager Ben Osborn said, \u201cWe have provided complete data packages, the unblinded data, to both regulators. I think what you\u2019re seeing is just the difference in the underlying process and timelines, as opposed to any difference in data submission.\u201d  June Raine, the head of Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said, \u201cThe way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards.  \u201cOur progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review and our rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,\u201d she added.  The EMA started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6, an emergency procedure aimed at speeding up possible approval, which usually takes at least seven months from reception of full data.  The UK regulator launched its own rolling review on Oct. 30, and analysed less data than made available to the EMA.  \u201cThe idea is not to be first but to have a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d Germany\u2019s Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference.  Asked about the emergency procedure used by Britain, he said EU countries had opted for a more thorough procedure to boost confidence in vaccines.  \u201cIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk,\u201d the EMA\u2019s former head Guido Rasi told an Italian radio.  \u201cPersonally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first,\u201d he added.  \u2018PROBLEMATIC\u2019  EU lawmakers were even more explicit in their criticism of Britain\u2019s move.  \u201cI consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way,\u201d said Peter Liese, an EU lawmaker who is a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s party.  \u201cA few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine,\u201d said Liese, who represents the centre right grouping, the largest in the EU Parliament.  Under EU rules, the Pfizer vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but EU countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine at home for temporary use.  Britain is still subject to EU rules until it fully leaves the bloc at the end of the year.  \u201cThere is an obvious global race to get the vaccine on the market as fast as possible,\u201d said Tiemo Wolken, an EU lawmaker from the socialist grouping, the second largest in the Parliament.  \u201cHowever, I do believe that it is better to take the time and make sure that the quality, effectiveness and safety is guaranteed and matches our EU standards.\u201d","527":"March 13 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * PFIZER OUTLINES FIVE-POINT PLAN TO BATTLE COVID-19  * PFIZER - WORKING TO DEVELOP ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES TO HELP INFECTED PATIENTS FIGHT EMERGING VIRUS  * PFIZER INC - WORKING TO ADVANCE OWN POTENTIAL ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES AND IS ENGAGED WITH BIONTECH ON A POTENTIAL MRNA CORONAVIRUS VACCINE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","528":"March 10 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * CMA WELCOMES COURT OF APPEAL JUDGMENT IN PHENYTOIN CASE  * UK\u2019S CMA - TO REVIEW ELEMENTS THAT COURT HAS DECIDED TO REFER BACK TO IT, AS IT MOVES FORWARD WITH ITS CASE AGAINST PFIZER AND FLYNN PHARMA  * UK\u2019S CMA - CONTINUES TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT VERY BIG PRICE INCREASES IMPOSED BY CERTAIN DRUGS COMPANIES FOR SEVERAL OTHER GENERIC DRUGS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","529":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump holds a 'Make America Great Again' cap while arriving to board Air Force One as he departs Florida for campaign travel to North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin at Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida, U.S., November 2, 2020.

REUTERS\/Kevin Lamarque  (Reuters) - The chief adviser for the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed COVID-19 vaccine program, Moncef Slaoui, on Tuesday said efficacy data readouts are expected from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc between next month and December.  Speaking at a symposium conducted by the Johns Hopkins University and the University of Washington, Slaoui said data readouts from leading vaccine developers are expected to come in three waves over the next several months.  The first wave would be coming from Pfizer and Moderna, both of which are developing mRNA-based vaccines for the coronavirus, he said.  Slaoui said efficacy data on one or two vaccines will be available within the next month or two, for which there will be enough doses to immunize 30 million people between November and December.  Commenting on AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine program, Slaoui said while the company\u2019s U.S. study remains on hold, data readouts on the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness may be expected somewhere in late October or November from ongoing studies in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.  \u201cAt that time, we will have very few doses to be able to, if the decision was to approve the vaccine, immunize,\u201d he said, adding that efforts are in place to scale up manufacturing and stockpiling of the vaccine.","541":"(Reuters) -The United States said it authorized the use of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, with the first inoculations expected within days, marking a turning point in a country where the pandemic has killed more than 295,000 people.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, which was shown to be 95% effective in preventing the disease in a late-stage trial. It said the vaccine can be given to people aged 16 and older.  Healthcare workers and elderly people in long-term care facilities are expected to be the main recipients of a first round of 2.9 million doses this month.  BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said the vaccine \u201cwill help to save lives across the United States and could accelerate a return to normality.\u201d  U.S. health authorities, shipping services, hospitals and pharmacies have been readying a nationwide inoculation campaign. Pfizer said it would start shipping immediately and state public health systems have been planning to begin shots as early as Monday.  The government plans to accelerate vaccinations in the coming weeks and months, especially if a second vaccine from Moderna Inc is quickly approved. An advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet on Saturday to make crucial recommendations about whether some groups such as pregnant women and 16-year-olds should be immunized.  The authorization comes as cases are surging in the United States, with thousands of death per day, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity, threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems.  \u201cIt is one step in a sequence of steps that will bring this pandemic to an end,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.  He added: \u201cA lot of people will be infected, a lot will be hospitalized and a lot will die before the vaccine is able to have a meaningful impact on spread.\u201d  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was first approved in Britain earlier this month, and UK residents began receiving the shots on Tuesday. Canada also authorized the vaccine and expects to start inoculations next week.  Mexico, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have also approved the Pfizer vaccine.  U.S. President Donald Trump, in a video posted on Twitter, trumpeted the achievement and blamed China for the pandemic. Critics have said his focus on China was aimed at deflecting attention from his missteps in combating the pandemic.  \u201cThe United States is the first nation in the world to produce a verifiably safe and effective vaccine. Today\u2019s achievement is a reminder of America\u2019s unlimited potential,\u201d Trump said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  COMPLEX CHALLENGES  Others with vaccines in advanced development include Moderna, which could win emergency U.S. authorization as soon as next week, AstraZeneca Plc with Oxford University, and Johnson & Johnson.  BioNTech began developing the vaccine in January, using a technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) that had yet to produce an approved product. The technology uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic part of the new coronavirus, which the immune system learns to recognize as an invader. BioNTech struck a development deal with Pfizer in March.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The vaccine comes with complex distribution challenges as it must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), requiring specialized ultra-cold freezers or supplies of dry ice.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine employs the same technology but does not need to be stored at sub-Arctic temperatures.  Pfizer has developed a special shipping container that will be filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling. Many states are concerned about whether there is enough dry ice for shipments to rural areas that lack the specialized freezers, but Pfizer believes there should be sufficient supply.  U.S. health officials have said they will have enough to supply all of the 330 million U.S. residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021.  \u2018HERD IMMUNITY\u2019  The government has ordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - through its Operation Warp Speed virus development program and could negotiate for more. The status of those talks are unclear.  Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week that the company had offered to sell the United States more doses as recently as last month but had been turned down.  The United States has agreed to buy 200 million doses of Moderna\u2019s two-dose vaccine. The government also has supply deals with J&J and AstraZeneca, but authorization of those vaccines are not imminent.  Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said if distribution goes well and enough Americans agree to get vaccinated, relief for a pandemic weary nation may be on the horizon, with enough immunizations providing safety for the \u2018herd\u2019 of collective society.  \u201cBy the end of summer or end of third quarter, we may actually have enough herd immunity protecting our society,\u201d he said.","542":"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia plans to order Russian and Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines fearing that deliveries ordered under the COVAX scheme for poor countries and from the European Union will be too little too late, officials said on Thursday.

Bosnia has ordered 1.2 million vaccines under the COVAX scheme and nearly 900,000 vaccines from the EU for its two autonomous regions, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic, and expects the first batch to arrive soon, Prime Minister Zoran Tegeltija said. Bosna applied for EU membership in 2016.  The COVAX scheme, led by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance, is due to start rolling out vaccines to poor and middle-income countries in February, with 2 of 3 billion doses expected to be delivered this year.  But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while wealthy nations have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves. Europe has also suffered delays in deliveries from Pfizer.  Bosnia\u2019s central government, over which Tegeltija presides, does not have the authority to order vaccines directly from producers. The two regions also can only make orders through authorised agencies.  Under strong public pressure, the two otherwise rival regions and the central government agreed on Thursday to work together to order directly from Pfizer and the Russian and Chinese producers, Tegeltija told a news conference.  \u201cBearing in mind the delays in deliveries, we have decided to start this very complicated procurement system,\u201d he said.

It shows what progress can be made through science and innovation. The MHRA, the UK drug regulator, will have gone through all the safety data from the trials before approving and will continue to monitor as it is rolled out more widely. The next step will be to get the vaccine to the people who need it the most.\u201d  PROFESSOR ARNE AKBAR, PRESIDENT OF THE BRITISH SOCIETY FOR IMMUNOLOGY:  \u201cIt is only 12 months since the first case recorded case of COVID-19 and in that time, researchers around the world have worked tirelessly to increase our understanding of this new disease and develop safe and effective vaccines.\u201d  \u201cTo achieve this within this timescale is remarkable and the researchers should be applauded.

The market showed a little more appetite for risk-taking, with gains in currencies that rise in times of improving sentiment such as sterling, the New Zealand dollar, and Norwegian crown. Pfizer announced that the final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective, giving relief to a pandemic-weary market . That followed news that Moderna Inc released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing 94.5% effectiveness. That said, the number of reported global daily deaths from the coronavirus stood at 10,816 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest single-day death count. The United States, the worst-affected country worldwide, has reported about 11.38 million infections and 248,574 deaths since the pandemic started. \"A spike in COVID cases is generally good for the dollar and other safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc, but the positive vaccine news roughly counters that,\" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The dollar overall is expected to weaken as global economies improve once the vaccine gets widely distributed and as the Federal Reserve stands ready to provide more easing that should further erode the value of the greenback. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday there was \"a long way to go\" to economic recovery and a retail sales report released by the U.S. Commerce Department showed spending decelerating.

The euro was slightly up on the day at $1.1869 rising, despite Poland and Hungary blocking the European Union's 1.8 trillion-euro ($2.14 trillion) financial package to revive an economy depressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sterling, meanwhile, rose 0.3% versus the dollar to $1.3297 in the wake of a report from the Sun newspaper that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was told by British negotiators to expect a Brussels trade deal early next week, with \"a possible landing zone\" as soon as next Tuesday.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The head of Pfizer Inc in Brazil said on Thursday the drugmaker is negotiating with the South American nation to supply its potential COVID-19 vaccine in the first quarter of 2021.  \u201cWe are working strongly with the Brazilian government to try to fast-track the availability (of the vaccine) in Brazil as fast as possible,\u201d Carlos Murillo said during an online event.  In Brazil, some 3,100 people are participating in a late-stage clinical trial of the experimental vaccine Pfizer is developing with German partner BioNTech.  Pfizer earlier this week said initial data from its late-stage trials showed the vaccine to be more that 90% effective, putting it in the lead among major pharmaceutical companies racing to develop a COVID-19 vaccine to help stop the pandemic that has claimed over 1.2 million lives globally.  The vaccine, however, needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, a potential barrier in developing countries where finding the necessary storage chain could be an obstacle.  Murillo said Pfizer has developed a way to keep the vaccine in good condition using only dry ice.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a simple issue and it does not resolve the logistics, but it changes the paradigm that a country would need an ultrafreezer in each vaccination center, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Murillo said.  The vaccine will be sold with three different price tags, one for affluent countries, one for middle income countries like Brazil and another for low income nations, he said.  So far, Brazil\u2019s federal government\u2019s main bet for a potential coronavirus vaccine is with AstraZeneca Plc, with which it has already signed a supply contract.","553":"April 3 (Reuters) -  * PFIZER IN TALKS WITH P&G ON CONSUMER BUSINESS SALE - CNBC, CITING SOURCES  * PFIZER, P&G FAR APART ON PRICE IN CONSUMER BUSINESS SALE -CNBC, CITING SOURCES  * PFIZER CONSIDERING OPTIONS WITH P&G INCLUDING JOINT VENTURE FOR CONSUMER BUSINESS - CNBC, CITING SOURCES Further company coverage:","554":"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs\/2zpUAr4  * MSCI ex-Japan up 0.5%, Nikkei climbs 1.1%  * Pfizer could have coronavirus vaccine ready by end-2020  * Pelosi optimistic of U.S. fiscal aid before Nov elections  * Currencies tread water, oil slips, gold gains  SYDNEY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Asian markets advanced toward a recent 2-1\/2-year peak on Monday powered by hopes of a U.S. fiscal package and expectations of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year, though gains were held back by weaker-than-expected Chinese economic data.  In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures added 0.25%, German DAX futures were slightly higher while London\u2019s FTSE futures were down 0.07%.  MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.5% for its second straight day of gains, paring back slightly following third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data from China.  The index has risen in eight of the last 10 sessions amid a rally in risk assets buoyed by hopes of a coronavirus vaccine and expectations of a so-called \u201cblue wave\u201d, which would see the Democrats claim victory in November\u2019s elections.  Chinese shares started higher but slipped into negative territory in afternoon trading after China\u2019s third-quarter GDP data rose 4.9%, missing expectations for a 5.2% growth.  In a positive sign, however, separate monthly indicators pointed to an expansion in economic activity.  Industrial output accelerated 6.9% in September from a year earlier, when analysts were looking for a 5.8% gain from a 5.6% rise in August.  Retail sales edged up 3.3% last month from a year earlier against expectations for 1.8% growth.  \u201cThe rebound in Q3 GDP was less strong than expected, but was still a decent 4.9% year on year. September data beat expectations, suggesting a pick-up in momentum towards the latter part of Q3,\u201d said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac in Singapore.  \u201cThe pick-up in momentum was broad based, which bodes well for the Q4 outlook.\u201d  Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 1.1% while Australia\u2019s benchmark index added 0.9%.  Boosting overall sentiment, drugmaker Pfizer Inc said on Friday it could have a coronavirus vaccine ready in the United States by the end of this year.  E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 jumped 0.7% in Asian trading after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday she was optimistic legislation on a wide-ranging coronavirus relief package could be pushed through before the election.  But with her negotiating partner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in the Middle East until Tuesday, such a timeframe would seem to be overly optimistic, analysts said.  Investors are also concerned about rising coronavirus cases. Global coronavirus cases rose by more than 400,000 for the first time late on Friday, a record one-day increase as much of Europe enacts new restrictions to curb the outbreak.  Later in the week, key risk events include minutes of Australia\u2019s central bank meeting, the final U.S. presidential debate and global manufacturing indicators.  Action in currencies was muted with the U.S. dollar, usually perceived as a safe-haven asset, flat at 93.696 against a basket of six major currencies.

FILE PHOTO: A refrigerated truck leaves the Pfizer plant in Puurs, Belgium December 3, 2020. REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  Across the country, state health departments are preparing local hospitals for the first shipments of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorizes it, possibly as early as mid-December.  The first shipment is expected to cover inoculations of 3.2 million people, nowhere near enough for the 21 million U.S. healthcare workers. And government officials said initial shipments would also go to five government agencies including the Departments of Defense, State and the Veterans Health Administration.  The subsequent two weekly vaccine distributions could cover 7 to 10 million people a week, provided a second vaccine - from Moderna Inc - is authorized early in the second half of December, and Pfizer meets its distribution estimates, according to data provided by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the companies. Federal officials have not disclosed exactly how many doses will be in later shipments.  \u201cFor the time being, and the foreseeable future, the demand for vaccines is going to exceed the supply by a lot, even for the highest priority groups that are identified,\u201d said Josh Michaud, Kaiser\u2019s associate director of global health policy.  States have the final word on how to distribute vaccines to their citizens, but federal officials have said that of some 330 million U.S. residents, healthcare workers and those in nursing homes should be considered first for vaccines. Many states told Reuters that was their plan.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not respond to a request to comment. The Pentagon declined comment. HHS cited public comments from a Tuesday press call, in which officials said the first dose allocation will be the start of a steady stream of vaccine deliveries.  SOME BETTER PROTECTED THAN OTHERS  With early supplies limited, the federal government is allocating doses based on state populations, rather than the proportion of the populations at high risk. That means some states\u2019 health workers will be better protected than others.  Alabama for instance, will receive enough vaccine for around 17% of its healthcare workers, while Illinois could cover only 13%, according to data from state officials.  The approach would initially leave out around 190,000 healthcare workers in Alabama and more than 570,000 in Illinois, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data on healthcare workers by state. More than 2 million healthcare workers in California will have to wait as early vaccine supplies are doled out, based on figures provided to Reuters by state officials.  This first stage of the rollout illustrates the complexity of the government\u2019s goal to vaccinate most Americans by mid-2021 to stall a pandemic that has so far claimed more than 273,000 U.S. lives, with hundreds of thousands more deaths projected in the next few months.  U.S. officials maintain they will distribute 40 million doses by the end of the year - enough to inoculate 20 million people - with millions of shots shipping every week, assuming speedy approvals of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  Pfizer, which developed its vaccine with German partner BioNTech SE, told Reuters the United States will receive about half of the 50 million doses it will produce in 2020. Moderna\u2019s vaccine could add at least another 12.5 million doses, federal officials have said.  The CDC expects about 5 million to 10 million doses to be shipped per week in the first weeks of the U.S. vaccine distribution effort.  STATES PLAN FOR SHORTFALL  States meanwhile are preparing for the first distribution to fall short, as hospitals across the country grapple with record numbers of COVID-19 patients and staffing shortages.  \u201cClinical staff are becoming infected, nurses and doctors. It\u2019s creating a workforce crunch and the beds are filling up,\u201d said Alan Morgan, chief executive of the National Rural Health Association, an advocacy group for rural hospitals.  Arkansas\u2019s state epidemiologist Jennifer Dillaha said vaccines are urgently needed to keep up with the surge in patients. \u201cWe want to ensure our hospital capacity as much as possible through vaccination for those healthcare workers who are at highest risk for infection,\u201d she said.  More than half a dozen states including Alabama, California, New Mexico, and Wisconsin, told Reuters the first allocation estimates they have been given would not be near enough to cover all their healthcare workers, let alone other high-priority residents.  The size of initial allocation figures shared with Reuters ranges widely, from around 330,000 in California - the most populous U.S. state - to less than 7,000 in North Dakota, which has 50,000 healthcare workers, according to Kaiser data and figures provided to Reuters by state officials.  That means both states can vaccinate less than 20% of their healthcare workforce with the first shots. New York state will receive 170,000 shots initially, enough for roughly 13% of its healthcare workers.  The U.S. government expects the number of available doses to increase in January to about 60 million to 70 million.  It has made deals for 100 million doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for $1.95 billion and 100 million of Moderna\u2019s for $1.5 billion, with options to buy more. It expects vaccines to be free to most Americans.","557":"","558":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Sanofi is seen at the company's headquarters in Paris, France, April 24, 2020.

The French company will aim to help supply more than 100 million doses of the vaccine this year from its German plant in Frankfurt, CEO Paul Hudson told Le Figaro newspaper on Tuesday.  Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are, like other COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers such as AstraZeneca, struggling to meet the huge demand for shots that are the world\u2019s best bet for overcoming the pandemic.  Last month, Sanofi and Britain\u2019s GlaxoSmithKline said a COVID-19 vaccine they are jointly developing had showed an insufficient immune response in older people, delaying its launch to late this year.  The company has been under pressure since to seek ways of helping with COVID-19 vaccines devised by other drugmakers as the pandemic intensifies again in Europe and elsewhere.  \u201cSince our main vaccine is a few months late, we asked ourselves how we could be of assistance now,\u201d Hudson was quoted as saying.  Sanofi is also working on another COVID-19 vaccine candidate with U.S. firm Translate Bio which uses mRNA technology, similar to the approach of Pfizer\/BioNTech. Phase I trials are expected to start this quarter.

On Thursday they reported data from previous early-stage trials of the vaccine, BNT162b2, that showed it induced similar immune responses and had milder side effects than prior data on another candidate.  Pfizer stock, down 1% this year, has trailed the stellar rises in value of major pharmaceutical companies this year.

Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the jab are needed per person to gain immunity.  Below are details on the manufacturing and storage process, and the British vaccination programme:  MANUFACTURING PROCESS:  - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below.  - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days.  - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius).  - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites.  BRITISH ROLLOUT:  - Britain will start vaccinating people early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Belgium. The speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine, Britain said.  - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year.  - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.  - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the jab.  - 50 hospitals are set up across England and waiting to accept the vaccine, vaccination centres are being set up now, and in time local health centres known as general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists will provide the jab in the community if they have those capabilities.  - The community element is likely to take on a larger role if a rival vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is approved, because it does not need such cold storage and is easier to deliver.","562":"CANBERRA\/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia is on course to begin administering the first COVID-19 vaccines in February, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday, as the country moves to accelerate its inoculation programme as two states try to contain outbreaks.

Australia earlier this week said it expected to begin COVID-19 vaccinations in March.

The most populous state New South Wales, the epicentre of the country\u2019s latest outbreak, on Thursday said it recorded zero local COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours.  Australia has ordered 10 million doses of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine. It has also struck a deal with AstraZeneca PLC that sees the vaccine produced locally.  Morrison said regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine is expected in February.  Once both are approved, Morrison said Australia aims to vaccinate 80,000 people each week. This would then be expanded in the following four to six weeks, and by the end of March 4 million people could be vaccinated.  The acceleration in the COVID-19 vaccination programme comes amid heightened concern about the spread of the virus globally.

Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer\u2019s top viral vaccine scientists, said in an interview that he believes the current vaccine - developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE - is highly likely to still protect against the concerning variant first discovered in South Africa.  \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that primarily because we think that that means that we\u2019re going to need to change that vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily to learn how to change strain, both in terms of what we do at the manufacturing level, and especially what the clinical results are.  \u201cSo if a variant comes along for which there is clinical evidence of escape, we\u2019re ready to respond very quickly,\u201d Dormitzer added.  Dormitzer, chief scientific officer of viral vaccines at Pfizer Vaccines Research and Development, said the company has already made a DNA template for a prototype vaccine and plans to manufacture a batch of that prototype.  The company is proposing to do a Phase I clinical trial of a booster shot of that prototype vaccine that it would test against a booster for the current vaccine.  \u201cThis will be a immunogenicity study where you look at the immune response. And those studies are much, much smaller than the giant efficacy studies,\u201d Dormitzer said.  \u201cIn immunogenicity studies you can look at the immune response of every person in the study. So that enables you to have much smaller, easier studies to run. It\u2019s not as definitive as efficacy data, for sure. But it can be gathered much more quickly,\u201d he explained.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet released a roadmap for how companies should design trials of booster shots.  A laboratory study released on Wednesday suggested that the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine by two-thirds, but it is not clear how much that reduces the shot\u2019s effectiveness against the variant.

That race has intensified as Britain became the first Western country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, clearing a shot from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech and targeting about 800,000 initial doses in early December to vulnerable members of its population. The European Union (EU), which is sticking to a more-formal conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) process that it said ensures a \"full evaluation\" of candidates, could still see deliveries in coming weeks after it set a Dec. 29 deadline to make a decision on the Pfizer\/BioNTec h candidate and Jan. 12 for Moderna's product. The European Commission has secured hundreds of millions of shots to be distributed to member states that request them, as well as to partner nations like Switzerland, while the British government has ordered six different vaccines. But it is a fragmented picture when it comes to planning: Germany is transforming exhibition halls into vaccination centres and has bought ultra-cold freezers for storing vaccines, while the Swiss are relying on their military for logistics and warehousing, before sending shots to its 26 cantons that will ultimately be in charge of inoculations.

Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine is most advanced in Health Canada\u2019s reviews, Supriya Sharma, senior medical adviser at Health Canada, said at a media briefing in Ottawa.  Asked whether any Canadians could receive a shot before the end of the year, Sharma said several things are happening at the same time - regulatory reviews, manufacturing, distribution - which makes it difficult to pinpoint dates.  \u201cI think the general timelines of authorizations around December, and getting the shipments in January, and getting those moving in January are the best (forecasts) we can give at this time,\u201d she said.  Canada is looking at the same data as regulators in the United States and European Union, and has a similar authorization system for use during a public health emergency, Sharma said.  \u201cThe way that the reviews are progressing is that we are expecting to make a final decision on the vaccine around the same time as both the U.S. FDA and the European Medicines Agency,\u201d she said.  The European Medicines Agency is \u201cvery hopeful\u201d it will be able to give a positive scientific opinion before Christmas, its executive director said on Wednesday.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will hold a meeting on Dec. 10 at which members would discuss Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.

The trials, both announced on Monday, are the first late-stage studies supported by the Trump administration\u2019s effort to speed development of measures against the novel coronavirus, adding to hope that an effective vaccine will help end the pandemic.  Moderna stock rose 9%. Pfizer shares rose 1.6% in afterhours trade and its partner BioNTech22UAy.F, which developed the vaccine, rose 4.2%.  Both vaccine candidates rely on a new technology that allows for faster development and manufacturing than traditional vaccine production methods but does not have an extensive track record.  So-called mRNA, or synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), teaches the immune system to recognize and neutralize the coronavirus by mimicking its surface.  Moderna, which has never brought a vaccine to market, has received nearly $1 billion from the U.S. government, which is helping bankroll several vaccine candidates under its Operation Warp Speed program.  Pfizer has an agreement to sell vaccines for 50 million people to the U.S. government for around $2 billion, if the vaccine is effective.

Johnson and Johnson is launching clinical trials in the U.S. this week and could start a larger, late-stage trial as early as September. British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L said it will begin large-scale U.S. trials this summer of its vaccine under development with Oxford University researchers.  \u201cHaving a safe and effective vaccine distributed by the end of 2020 is a stretch goal, but it\u2019s the right goal for the American people,\u201d National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins said in a release announcing the start of Moderna\u2019s large Phase III trial.  Manufacturers are ramping up production while testing is underway in order to respond as soon as possible to virus, which is still spreading rapidly around the world. COVID-19 has killed nearly 650,000 people worldwide and battered economies.  Moderna could have tens of millions of doses ready when and if the vaccine is deemed safe and effective, Collins told reporters on a call.  Pfizer said that if the trial was successful, it could seek regulatory approval as soon as October and supply vaccines for 50 million patients, at two doses each, by the end of the year.  Pfizer aims for about 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021, and Moderna aims for 500 million-1 billion doses a year, beginning 2021, Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said on the call.  The late-stage trials are designed to evaluate the safety of vaccines and determine if they can prevent symptomatic COVID-19.  Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease official, said a readout from the Moderna trial could come by November or even earlier. Fauci said he was \u201cnot particularly concerned\u201d about the vaccine\u2019s safety after seeing data from earlier, smaller trials. He also said he had briefed President Donald Trump about the trial the Oval Office on Monday.  As other companies ready inoculations, the COVID-19 Prevention Network, a U.S. government-funded program formed by the NIH, said it plans to roll out a large-scale clinical trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate with at least 30,000 participants each month through fall.","568":"FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

The company has touted its pipeline, which it believes contains 15 drugs with annual sales potential that could exceed $1 billion launching within the next five years.  Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said shareholders are keen to know how Pfizer plans to bridge the gap until 2020 with products such as breast cancer medicine Ibrance and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz underperforming this quarter.  Both drugs slightly missed analysts estimates in the quarter, with Ibrance sales coming in at $1.03 billion and Xeljanz bringing in $432 million.  Pfizer retreated from some planned price hikes earlier this year under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. Last week, Trump announced a plan to try to reduce what the government pays for some physician-administered prescription drugs by basing Medicare spending for the medications on lower prices paid in other countries.  Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read, who will be succeeded in that role by Chief Operating Officer Albert Bourla in January, said in a phone interview that the plan is \u201cflawed in its conception.\u201d  \u201cIt is effectively importing into an innovative-based society the prices of free riders,\u201d Read said.

Supply problems at facilities making Pfizer\u2019s sterile injectables, as well as competition from cheaper generic medicines in the United States, hit sales at the company\u2019s Essential Health business.  Sales from the unit, which Pfizer plans to reorganize into a new division that sells off-patent medicines and generic drugs, fell 4.4 percent.  The company benefited from a 13.3 percent tax rate on adjusted income, well below the 23.7 percent it paid last year before the U.S. Congress passed a bill that significantly lowered corporate taxes.","572":"NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday that its Chief Executive Albert Bourla plans to testify later this month at a Senate hearing examining rising prescription drug prices.

The mass inoculation will fuel hope that the world may be turning a corner in the fight against a pandemic that has crushed economies and killed more than 1.5 million, although ultra-cold storage and tricky logistics will limit its use for now.  Britain is the worst-hit European country from COVID-19, with over 61,000 deaths, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to turn the tide against the disease by rolling out the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine before the United States or European Union.  Britain approved the vaccine for emergency use less than a week ago, and is rolling it out through its National Health Service (NHS).  \u201cThe deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic,\u201d said NHS chief executive Simon Stevens. \u201cNHS staff are proud to be leading the way as the first health service in the world to begin vaccination with this COVID jab\u201d  In total Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot. As each person requires two doses, that is enough to vaccinate 20 million people in the country of 67 million.  About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week, with care home residents and carers, the over 80s and some health service workers the top priority to get them.  The roll-out provides a test case for Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s distribution networks. The shot must be stored at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge.  While Britain is relatively small and has good infrastructure, the logistical challenges mean it will first be applied in 50 hospitals and cannot yet be taken into care homes.  Pfizer and BioNTech said their shot proved 95% effective in preventing illness in final-stage trials. In all, Britain has ordered 357 million doses of seven different COVID-19 vaccines.  Russia and China have both started giving vaccine candidates to their populations before final safety and efficacy trials have been completed.","574":"FILE PHOTO: A vial and syringe are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer and BioNTech logo in this illustration taken January 11, 2021.

Israel has said it would issue an official app allowing users to link up to their Health Ministry files and show if they have been vaccinated against or recovered from COVID-19, with presumed immunity, in order to gain entry to leisure facilities.  Those to whom neither applies would be able to get a COVID-19 test and, if the result is negative, display it on the app for up to 72 hours of similar access, officials have said.  Initially dubbed \u201cGreen Passport\u201d, the system has been renamed \u201cGreen Pass\u201d in an apparent bid to head off speculation that it would also enable unfettered travel abroad.  \u201cThe estimated date is the 23rd of the month,\u201d Edelstein told Ynet TV. \u201cWe are talking about gyms, hotels, places like that, where using the Green Pass would be both appropriate and practicable.\u201d  \u201cToday - finally, finally - there is an encouraging sign, a small reduction in morbidity,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this vector continues, we will meet all of our commitments.\u201d  Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Kan radio that the app will be ready next week and predicted that 60% of adult Israelis would be eligible for the Green Pass by Feb. 23.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Nearly 90 percent of patients who received the combination therapy were still alive after 12 months compared with about 78 percent of patients who were alive after a year when treated with the older drug Sutent, data showed.  Merck on Monday released interim data from the trial, saying the combination reduced the risk of death by 47 percent compared with Sutent.  The findings add to an arsenal of positive clinical data for Keytruda, which is approved to treat several types of cancer, making it by far Merck\u2019s most important growth driver.  Patients who received the Keytruda\/Inlyta combination also went longer before their disease started to worsen, a measure known as progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was 15.1 months for the combination versus 11.1 months for those treated with Sutent.  Results from the trial of 861 previously untreated patients were presented at a cancer meeting in San Francisco and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The Keytruda\/Inlyta combination, if approved, could provide serious competition for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co\u2019s immunotherapy combination of Opdivo and Yervoy. That therapy, currently considered a gold standard for previously untreated advanced kidney cancer patients, has shown a 67 percent survival rate after two years.  A similar kidney cancer trial pitting Sutent against a combination of Inlyta and the immunotherapy Bavencio, sold by Pfizer and Germany\u2019s Merck KGaA, was also presented at the meeting on Saturday.  The Bavencio combination led to a median PFS of 13.8 months compared with 8.4 months for Sutent.  While full overall survival data was not yet available, at the end of 11.6 months, 37 of 442 patients in the Bavencio arm of the study had died, while 44 of 444 patients in the Sutent group had died after 10.7 months, researchers said.  \u201cBoth combinations are expected to become new standards of care and to be incorporated into future (treatment) guidelines,\u201d Bernard Escudier from France\u2019s Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus said in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Moderna said on Monday its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second developer to report results that far exceeded expectations, after Pfizer and BioNTech said last week their vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective.  The EU has been in talks with Moderna for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine at least since July, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows. Reuters first reported the negotiations in July. A deal might be reached in the coming days, the senior official involved in the talks said, adding that discussions were mostly focusing on the legal wording of the contract, but faced no major hurdles on issues such as price or liability.  The price being negotiated was below $25 per dose, said the official, who declined to be more specific and asked for anonymity as the talks were confidential.  Moderna was not immediately available to comment.  The United States paid Moderna $15 per dose to secure 100 million vaccines in a $1.5 billion deal in August. That was on top of $1 billion in funding for Moderna\u2019s vaccine, effectively bringing the combined price to $25, according to the publicly released terms of the deal.  Washington has an option to buy another 400 million doses for an undisclosed price.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine is administered with a two-shot course.

We have not yet concluded or signed a contract,\u201d Kyriakides told EU lawmakers in a regular hearing on Monday.  A spokesman for the Commission did not respond to questions on price and the timing of a possible deal with Moderna.  On Aug. 24 the Commission, which conducts talks with vaccine makers on behalf of EU states, said preliminary talks with Moderna had been concluded with the aim of signing a contract for the supply of 80 million doses of its vaccine, with the option of buying another 80 million.  Last week, the Commission reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech on the supply of their potential COVID-19 vaccine hours after the companies announced their positive results, EU officials said, adding that the timing was a coincidence.  The formal signing of that contract is expected later this week.  An official told Reuters the EU had agreed to pay less than $19.50 per shot to Pfizer and BioNTech, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug\u2019s development.  The EU has also struck supply deals with AstraZeneca , Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi for their experimental COVID-19 vaccines.  It announced on Monday a new deal with German biotech firm CureVac .

If it weren\u2019t for a $10 billion federal stimulus aimed at rural hospitals nationwide in May, another half dozen small Texas facilities would have closed, estimated John Henderson, the president of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals.  NEEDLES IN ARMS  The Texas Department of State Health Services is tasked with allocating where the vaccine goes. A 17-person expert panel is charged with delivering recommendations on allotments to the state\u2019s health commissioner, Dr. John Hellerstedt, who has the final say on deliveries.  In a Dec. 14 letter sent to rural health advocates, Hellerstedt praised their patience and wrote that a \u201cmore inclusive\u201d strategy of who gets vaccines will begin next week and that the pending approval of the Moderna vaccine would help alleviate rural shortfalls.  Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for state health services, said there were two big reasons why rural areas were left off the initial Pfizer vaccine shipments. The first is that the smallest shipment contains 975 doses, so the state sent it to hospitals who said they had that many health care workers to inoculate.  The second reason is that the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored in special freezers, which larger facilities were more likely to have. But that reasoning irks the doctors in Lamesa as their hospital had purchased one of those freezers in anticipation.  The Moderna vaccine, Van Deusen said, is easier to store and will be able to be shipped with a minimum of 100 doses, meaning it can go to smaller hospitals.  Time is of the essence, said Henderson, of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals.  \u201cYou have one doctor out because of coronavirus in a small town, and that may mean you just lost half of your medical staff,\u201d he said.  Henderson said the state should embrace alternatives - such as having regional medical centers not vaccinate lower-risk staff, and instead earmark some doses for the frontline rural doctors and nurses.  \u2018ANSWERING THE CALL\u2019  It\u2019s difficult to recruit doctors to work in any small town, and those that do are considered the crown jewels of their communities. Many residents interviewed in Lamesa said they were adamant that their medical staff should be protected immediately.  Debbie Aylesworth, 67, credits Sprys and the staff at the Lamesa hospital with keeping her off a ventilator when she had COVID-19 a few months ago. After Aylesworth was exposed to the virus in October, Sprys texted her daily to ask if she was having any symptoms.  If not for Sprys\u2019 insistence, Aylesworth said she likely would have delayed seeking treatment and ended up being far worse off.  \u201cThose doctors are answering the call,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are dealing with the worst of what this pandemic is dishing out, so they should be seeing the benefit of the vaccine.\u201d  Josh Stevens, the mayor of Lamesa, said the area has been as brutalized by the pandemic as anywhere else in Texas.  Making matters worse, he said, is that about 85% of the town\u2019s population is considered part of the essential work force - most working in agriculture along with oil and gas - meaning more of Lamesa\u2019s citizens have been out on the frontlines.  \u201cMost people in Lamesa have had nowhere to hide from this virus, and our doctors have had to deal with that reality,\u201d he said. \u201cThem not being at the front of the line to get a vaccine is a slap in the face for all of rural Texas.\u201d","586":"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will sign a contract within days to buy at least 20 million doses of a COVID-19 candidate vaccine from China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech, the health minister was cited as saying, adding that Ankara was also in talks to buy doses of Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine.

A contract will be signed on this in one or two days,\u201d he said at his ministry\u2019s budget presentation in parliament on Wednesday.  Turkey would become the second buyer of the Chinese vaccine after Brazil.  Preliminary trial results have shown that Sinovac's SVA.O experimental COVID-19 vaccine CoronaVac triggered a quick immune response, but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who have recovered from the virus.  CoronaVac and four other experimental vaccines developed in China are in late-stage trials to determine their effectiveness.  The report follows news this month from Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech 22UAy.DE and from Moderna MRNA.O, as well as from Russia, of experimental vaccines that have been more than 90% effective based on interim data from large, late-stage trials.  Pfizer and BioNTech may secure emergency U.S. and European authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, the drugmakers said on Wednesday.  Koca said Turkey was in talks to buy their vaccine as well, once it obtained its license.  \u201cIf so, the number that can be given to Turkey is 1 million. We have talks right now to gradually go up to 25 million within the year starting from January,\u201d Koca was quoted as saying.  While some countries including Turkey have been conducting tests for Sinovac\u2019s experimental vaccine, Brazil is currently the only country which has agreed to receive doses of it. The Sao Paulo state will start importing 46 million doses this week.

The Clinical Frailty Scale, a widely used system of classification in elderly care, defines degree 8 patients as approaching end of life and typically unable to \u201crecover even from a minor illness\u201d.  The Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a statement posted on Friday and updated on Monday that \u201ccommon adverse reactions may have contributed to a severe course in elderly people who are frail\u201d.  As of Jan. 14, 23 reports of suspected deaths have been submitted to the Norwegian health registry, it said.  \u201cAn evaluation should be carried for each individual patient as to whether the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks of eventual side effects,\u201d the Norwegian agency said.  In Norway, an average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, the medicines agency said.  Germany\u2019s health minister Jens Spahn said at a news briefing on Monday that the country\u2019s vaccine regulator saw no need to revise guidelines and that it was in contact with their Norwegian counterparts.  The safety of vaccines is garnering global public attention after drugmakers developed the shots breakneck speed to curb a pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people.  U.S. and European vaccine developers have pledged to uphold the scientific standards their immunisations will be held against in the race to contain the virus.  Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said there was no evidence so far of a causal link between the deaths of vulnerable patients in Norway and vaccination.  \u201cWe do not yet know, but it would seem that the observed numbers of deaths is not notably above the numbers expected, but this will need to be examined continually in all countries where it can be done,\u201d he said.

The Scandinavian currencies and the Japanese yen were amongst the biggest movers, while the offshore Chinese yuan hit its strongest in 28-months.  A Biden presidency is expected to boost international trade relations and the prospect of a successful coronavirus vaccine is seen as a major tailwind, with global cases continuing to rise.  Simon Harvey, currency analyst at broker Monex Europe, said although markets were already trading with \u201can air of optimism\u201d, Pfizer\u2019s findings, based on initial data from a large study, had boosted risk appetite further.  \u201cAlthough premature to solidify expectations of a widely available vaccine in the coming months, (the news) helped boost global growth expectations which took a substantial knock only weeks ago with second wave concerns,\u201d Harvey said.  That was benefitting higher beta currencies such as the Norwegian and Swedish crowns, boosting oil prices and \u201cunravelling\u201d dollar\/yen, he added.  The dollar stabilised against a basket of currencies having touched a 10-week low of 92.12 and was last up 0.2% at 92.31.  The Swedish crown rose to a 28-month high of 8.5845 versus the U.S. dollar and to a 22-month high of 10.20 against the euro.  Its Norwegian counterpart rose 1.6% against both the dollar and the euro to hit two-month highs against each of 9.0025 and 10.7030 respectively..  The Australian dollar was up 2.4% at 76.85 against the Japanese yen, a seven-week high. The yen also fell 1.6% against the U.S. dollar to 105.  The offshore Chinese yuan was not far behind, hitting a peak of 6.5501 against the dollar and last up 0.3% at 6.5729.  The Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar both rose 0.8% versus the U.S. dollar with the latter hitting a seven-week high and the former a nine-month high.  \u201cThe removal of global uncertainty, a shift to dollar funding, and virus divergence against the U.S. all favour a weaker dollar into the end of the year,\u201d said George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank\u2019s currency analyst.  Saravelos expects the broad trade-weighted dollar to potentially drop by another 3% to 5% into the end of the year with euro\/dollar convincingly breaking 1.20 and dollar\/yen reaching 100.  U.S. dollar selling was being held in check, however, by the virus worries and because incumbent President Donald Trump has made no sign of conceding while fighting legal battles to overturn the result.  The prospect of more gridlock in Washington, with Republicans appearing likely to have retained control of the Senate -- although the final makeup may not be clear until runoff votes in Georgia in January -- means that expectations for a massive U.S. fiscal stimulus package have been lowered, sending bond yields down in anticipation of less borrowing and more quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve.  Euro\/dollar - the most traded currency pair in the world - was up 0.1% on the day at $1.1892.

Scientists and public health officials on Monday welcomed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test as a watershed moment that could help turn the tide of the pandemic if the full trial results pan out.  But reaction from the streets of Rome, London and Madrid, as well as on social media, revealed that hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine extended beyond staunch \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019 as even those who have been vaccinated for other diseases considered skipping this one, for now.  \u201cI think it\u2019s good news if it\u2019s effective, but I think it\u2019s very difficult because it\u2019s very early,\u201d nursing assistant Maite Flores, 64, from Madrid told Reuters.  \u201cI\u2019m fully vaccinated, and so are both of my children.

For something to be squeezed out this fast, without knowing long-term effects, is difficult to go with. There are too many unknowns at this point,\u201d she told Reuters.

While the interim results are encouraging, Pfizer and partner BioNTech still have to disclose safety data for their experimental vaccine before seeking regulatory approval.  Other COVID-19 vaccine developers are in the final stage of testing. In September, drugmakers, seeking to bolster public confidence, pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards even as they work at break-neck speed in a quest for a shot.  Regulators around the world have said speed will not compromise safety, as quicker results would stem from conducting in parallel trials that are usually done in sequence.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  A global poll by the World Economic Forum this month showed 73% of people would be willing to have a vaccine against COVID-19, a four-point fall since August. The World Health Organization says 70% would need to have it in order to break transmission.  Among those not intending to have the vaccine, the most common reasons were worry about possible side effects and the speed with which they were moving through clinical trials.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Ilustration  The move to grant emergency authorisation to the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine has been seen by many as a political coup for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has led his country out of the EU and faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic.  The decision was made under an ultra-fast, emergency approval process, which allowed the British drugs regulator to temporarily authorise the vaccine only 10 days after it began examining data from large-scale trials.  In an unusually blunt statement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is in charge of approving COVID-19 vaccines for the EU, said its longer approval procedure was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and required more checks than the emergency procedure chosen by Britain.  The agency said on Tuesday it would decide by Dec. 29 whether to provisionally authorise the vaccine from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE .  A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU executive, said the EMA\u2019s procedure was \u201cthe most effective regulatory mechanism to grant all EU citizens\u2019 access to a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d as it was based on more evidence.  Pfizer UK Country Manager Ben Osborn said, \u201cWe have provided complete data packages, the unblinded data, to both regulators. I think what you\u2019re seeing is just the difference in the underlying process and timelines, as opposed to any difference in data submission.\u201d  June Raine, the head of Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said, \u201cThe way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards.  \u201cOur progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review and our rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,\u201d she added.  The EMA started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6, an emergency procedure aimed at speeding up possible approval, which usually takes at least seven months from reception of full data.  The UK regulator launched its own rolling review on Oct. 30, and analysed less data than made available to the EMA.  \u201cThe idea is not to be first but to have a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d Germany\u2019s Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference.  Asked about the emergency procedure used by Britain, he said EU countries had opted for a more thorough procedure to boost confidence in vaccines.  \u201cIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk,\u201d the EMA\u2019s former head Guido Rasi told an Italian radio.  \u201cPersonally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first,\u201d he added.  \u2018PROBLEMATIC\u2019  EU lawmakers were even more explicit in their criticism of Britain\u2019s move.  \u201cI consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way,\u201d said Peter Liese, an EU lawmaker who is a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s party.  \u201cA few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine,\u201d said Liese, who represents the centre right grouping, the largest in the EU Parliament.  Under EU rules, the Pfizer vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but EU countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine at home for temporary use.  Britain is still subject to EU rules until it fully leaves the bloc at the end of the year.  \u201cThere is an obvious global race to get the vaccine on the market as fast as possible,\u201d said Tiemo Wolken, an EU lawmaker from the socialist grouping, the second largest in the Parliament.  \u201cHowever, I do believe that it is better to take the time and make sure that the quality, effectiveness and safety is guaranteed and matches our EU standards.\u201d","607":"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Pfizer is encountering difficulty in registering its COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in Brazil due to the level of detail required by the regulator, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said on Thursday.

REUTERS\/Adriano Machado  The health minister\u2019s comments could raise tensions with Pfizer, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States. They will also fuel concerns from critics who argue that Brazil\u2019s vaccine rollout is progressing too slowly, just as the virus roars back to life.  Vaccines are seen as crucial to ending the outbreak in Brazil, its death toll second only to the United States at more than 180,000 people. President Jair Bolsonaro, already under fire for his handling of the pandemic, is one of the world\u2019s most prominent COVID-19 skeptics, and has said he will not take any vaccine.  Addressing lawmakers on Thursday, Pazuello said he spoke with Pfizer\u2019s country manager on Sunday and directed him to meet with officials from health regulator Anvisa. After meeting Anvisa officials, the manager told the health minister that he had expected the emergency use process to be less onerous, Pazuello said.  \u201c\u2018I thought it was simpler, but the agency is very detailed,\u2019\u201d Pazuello quoted the unnamed Pfizer executive as saying.  Pfizer Brazil\u2019s country manager, Carlos Murillo, could not immediately be reached for comment. In a series of statements on Thursday, Pfizer said it could not comment on talks with the government.  Its statements confirmed that Anvisa had made specific requests that required more time. As a result, it said that seeking full regulatory approval for its vaccine - rather than a more onerous emergency use authorization - was the fastest course of action at this time.  It said the Anvisa requirement for specific country data was more onerous than other regulatory agencies, which were happy to analyze the trial information as a whole.  Pazuello said Pfizer had presented a variety of demands in order to close the deal, including a waiver of liability. \u201cWe are thinking of accepting,\u201d Pazuello said of the demands.  In its statements Pfizer said many countries had agreed to waive liability, including in Latin America.  Anvisa confirmed that Pfizer had yet to apply to register its vaccine. It said that information provided by Pfizer was \u201cnot the complete data necessary to judge the safety, efficacy and quality of a vaccine for registration.\u201d  The regulator added that so far no vaccine producer had applied for full registration or approval for emergency use.  A source with knowledge of Pfizer\u2019s position said it was only going to apply for an emergency use authorization once the Brazilian government signed a contract to buy its vaccine.  Brazil\u2019s federal government has repeatedly changed the date by which it expects to start inoculations. After a lull of a few months, infections are rising again sharply, hitting a fresh daily record on Wednesday of 70,000 new cases.  Brazil expects to receive some 24 million COVID-19 vaccines by January, Pazuello said.  He said Brazil expected Pfizer to provide 500,000 of those doses next month, China\u2019s Sinovac to provide 9 million doses and AstraZeneca to provide 15 million doses.  Brazil expects to reach 37.7 million vaccine doses by February, with another 31 million doses arriving in March, the minister added.","608":"FILE PHOTO: A small bottle labeled with a \"Vaccine\" sticker is held near a medical syringe in front of displayed \"Coronavirus COVID-19\" words in this illustration taken April 10, 2020.

Pfizer Inc\u2019s Monday announcement that initial trials showed their experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective sparked cheer across the world, scarred by a pandemic has killed 1.2 million people and infected 50.7 million.  But the Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at temperatures matching an Antarctic winter - a logistical nightmare for India with heatwaves exceeding 50 degrees Celsius (122\u00b0F), few ultra-cold freezers, patchy power and a largely rural population.  \u201cThe new two-shot vaccine from Pfizer has to be maintained at minus 80\u00b0C - nowhere on the planet does the logistical capacity exist to distribute vaccines at this temperature,\u201d said Toby Peters, a professor at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham.  \u201cThis is a new challenge to be urgently managed,\u201d Peters, an expert in cooling technologies who is studying plans to roll out COVID-19 vaccines, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  About 100 drug development teams worldwide are racing to develop coronavirus vaccines, with the hope of distributing them globally on a scale never before witnessed.  The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 70% of the global population must be inoculated to end the pandemic.  India will be critical to this effort - with 8.6 million COVID-19 cases, second only to the United States.  The South Asia nation has been scrambling to secure 500 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by July from various manufacturers, in addition to developing its own government-backed COVID-19 vaccine COVAXIN.  India also plans to manufacture up to 200 million doses of candidate vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and Novavax Inc next year, with funding from the GAVI vaccines alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  COLD CHAIN  India has a strong record on vaccination, with the world\u2019s largest programme distributing 400 million vaccines a year, said Peters.  But nearly half of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates need cold storage as low as minus 80\u00b0C, researchers say, requiring seamless cold chain distribution from manufacturers to airports to remote villages.  \u201cThe success of any COVID-19 vaccination programme will critically depend on robustness of the cold chain,\u201d said Peters.  \u201cThe key challenge for COVID-19 immunisation will likely be the last mile distribution and ensuring that each vaccination site is equipped with both adequate fixed and outreach cooling equipment to maintain efficacy of the valuable ... vaccine.\u201d  He said this would require investment in new cold chain systems and could include innovative approaches like using drones and new mobile rechargeable micro-chillers.  India\u2019s health ministry did not respond to requests for comment.  To ease distribution, Pfizer has announced that it will provide a \u201cdry ice pack\u201d container for its vaccines that is able to maintain a temperature of minus 70\u00b0C for up to 10 days.  Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, head of India\u2019s biopharmaceutical company Biocon Ltd, which developed a drug to treat patients with COVID-19 complications, voiced concerns over storage of the new vaccine.  \u201cThe Pfizer vaccine is unlikely to make its way to India because the ultra-cold chain that it requires ... is something that we may not be in a position to handle,\u201d she told CNBC-TV18 television news.  \u201cWe might be able to deal with such a cold supply chain in some parts of India, in the cities, but certainly it\u2019s not something that will be conducive for India.\u201d  She said it was important to watch out for cheaper alternatives to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, which would not need ultra-cold storage and be better suited to cover wider populations.  OTHER VACCINES  Although vaccines could prove a gamechanger for the pandemic, wealthy nations have already bought up more than half the future supply of leading contenders, Oxfam has said.  While India is in talks with Pfizer, according to the financial daily Mint, the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and Britain have already signed supply deals with the U.S. drugmaker, which aims to make up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  \u201cIndia will not be able to ... get this (Pfizer) vaccine so soon given there are advanced bookings,\u201d said Sunil Nair, head of Snowman Logistics, India\u2019s largest cold chain services company.  But other potential vaccines, such as those from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax Inc, can be stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C, the temperature of a regular refrigerator.  And Randeep Guleria, who is part of the Indian government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine panel, told local media that India\u2019s vaccines would be kept at a temperature of minus 20\u00b0C.  Nair said storage and transport of vaccines at up to minus 30\u00b0C would be \u201cno problem\u201d.  \u201cTo meet the huge demand that we foresee, (we) will need as many vaccine candidates as possible for use across a range of populations and settings,\u201d said Olly Cann, a GAVI spokesman.","610":"Pfizer Inc unit Hospira\u2019s proposed generic version of Endo International PLC\u2019s emergency allergy treatment Adrenalin would infringe two of Endo\u2019s patents, a federal appeals court has ruled, affirming a lower court ruling blocking the generic drug from the market.

Can\u00e9 said that Pfizer had supply agreements in Chile, Mexico and Peru and that there were several other conversations ongoing, including in Argentina, where the government has said it could receive 750,000 doses of the vaccine by December.  Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE have reported final trial results showing the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns.  Can\u00e9 said Pfizer was ready to supply and distribute around 50 million doses of the vaccine, which requires ultra-low temperature storage, before the end of 2020, which would be split between the United States and the rest of the world.  The firm was aiming to supply around 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, he said, adding the vaccine had shown high efficacy across different ethnicities.  Regarding the need for ultra-low temperatures in the supply chain, which creates complications in less-developed regions, Can\u00e9 said it was a matter of speed. A hardier second-generation version could be ready by 2022.  \u201cWe know that it is complicated compared to other vaccines, but we are in the midst of a pandemic situation and we are trying to provide the more efficacious solution in the quickest manner,\u201d he said.

FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  Pfizer said on Tuesday it was deferring its drug price increases on around 40 drugs for no more than six months after Read\u2019s conversation with Trump.  U.S. Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar called Read previously, and the Pfizer CEO asked to speak directly with the president, the source said.  The conversation took place around 4:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday and lasted about 10 to 15 minutes. Trump, in Brussels for a NATO meeting, had arrived at the U.S. ambassador\u2019s residence at about 3:30 p.m. ET.  Trump tweeted about the call at 6:37 p.m. and Pfizer confirmed it soon after.  The call and subsequent price rollback came a day after Trump took aim at Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers for raising prices on some of their medicines, saying in a tweet that they \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d and that his administration would respond.  Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said he was concerned that Trump had struck a \u201csecret, sweetheart\u201d deal with Pfizer and asked for Azar and Pfizer to release details about what was agreed on the calls.  \u201cInstead of proposing meaningful changes that result in lower costs for families and taxpayers, Trump and his Administration are busy scoring cheap PR points that don\u2019t address the fundamental challenges that lead to higher prices every year,\u201d Wyden said in a press release.  Trump rolled out a blueprint in May on how his administration planned to lower drug prices. Later that month, Trump said that some drug companies would announce \u201cvoluntary, massive\u201d price decreases in two weeks, though none have materialized yet.  Pfizer on Tuesday said it would defer price increases that went into effect on July 1 until the end of the year or until the president\u2019s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect - whichever is sooner. The company said it would return drug prices to their pre-July 1 levels as soon as technically possible.  Pfizer, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies, now likely will not raise drug prices until after the 2018 midterm elections in November.  That gives Trump, who made lowering prescription drug prices a top 2016 presidential campaign issue, a short-term victory he can point to in the run-up to the elections, which are being closely watched to see if Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans will be able to maintain control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.","615":"FILE PHOTO: A patient receives the first of two injections with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a surgery in Wolverhampton, Britain December 14, 2020.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  British, then U.S. and European approvals of Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s mRNA vaccine late last year prompted celebrations, only to be followed by early-2021 anxiety as the reality sets in that vaccinating billions across the world will be fraught with unforeseen hurdles.  In Italy, the COVID-19 special commissioner is considering legal action against Pfizer Inc after the U.S. drugmaker and its German partner told the country it was cutting its deliveries by 29%.  German Health Minister Jens Spahn was annoyed at the hiccup, as at least one state pushes back vaccination centre openings as a consequence.  And Switzerland, where ski resort St Moritz has been broadsided by quarantines at luxury hotels for hundreds of workers and guests after infections with a fast-spreading virus variant, lamented its latest Pfizer\/BioNTech delivery this week was skimpier than it had hoped.  Pfizer and BioNTech announced last week that to scale up manufacturing in Europe to deliver many more doses in the second quarter they must first trim production at a Puurs, Belgium, vaccine-making plant.  They aim to be back on schedule by Jan. 25, the companies said.  The reassurances, however, seem to be providing little comfort for countries that want shots sooner rather than later.  \u201cWe discussed what (legal) action to take to protect Italian citizens and their health in all civil and criminal venues,\u201d Italy\u2019s COVID-19 commissioner, Domenico Arcuri, said. \u201cThese actions will be taken starting in the next few days.\u201d  BioNTech declined comment on Wednesday on growing dissent among countries it is helping supply and referred to its statement on Friday about supply cuts.  DELIVERY DISRUPTIONS  The pain is being felt further afield than Europe. On Tuesday, Canada said it would not receive any Pfizer vaccines next week, adding more pain for provinces already complaining about a shortage of supplies.  Providing some hope, as the world struggles to tame a pandemic that has killed more than 2 million people, a study whose authors include BioNTech founders Ugur Sahin and Oezlem Tuereci concluded their vaccine is likely to protect against the more-infection British virus variant spreading worldwide.  Chinese state media have also targeted Pfizer\/BioNTech, and other vaccine makers, in articles questioning their shots\u2019 safety after reports of elderly deaths.  The reports came after Western scientists criticised the insufficient data disclosure in China\u2019s vaccine trials.  Much of Europe\u2019s focus was on disruption in deliveries though.  Adding to those concerns, some nations are failing to regularly get six doses from each vial, as approved by regulators, reducing the number of shots available.  Swiss Federal Ministry of Health vice director Nora Kronig told reporters at a press briefing in Bern delays were due to Pfizer\u2019s temporary closure of a small production line in Belgium as part of measures that would result in boosting total vaccine production volumes at the facility.  \u201cThe delivery that arrived yesterday was reduced,\u201d Kronig said, adding she\u2019s optimistic things will be back on track soon.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had reassurances that we\u2019ll receive (planned deliveries)... during the first quarter.\u201d  Even so, North-Rhine Westphalia, the most populous of Germany\u2019s 16 states with 18 million people, is delaying the opening of new vaccination centres to Feb. 8.  In Britain, the first nation to approve the vaccine, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country\u2019s vaccine programme was on track to hit mid-February targets.

Supplies of the vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) would also arrive Saturday night.  Jordan had said on Jan. 3 it had struck a deal with Pfizer and partner BioNTech to buy 1 million doses of their vaccine and another 2 million doses from the World Health Organization\u2019s COVAX programme, which aims to vaccinate people in poor and middle income countries.  Obeidat has previously said the government intends to rollout a free inoculation programme for more than 20 percent of the country\u2019s 10 million population.  The vaccination programme will prioritise the elderly, those with underlying conditions and health sector workers, the minister said on Saturday.  The government had reached initial understandings with AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson for their vaccines, he added.

FILE PHOTO: The new logo of German biotech firm BioNTech is seen outside the company's headquarters in Mainz, Germany, September 17, 2020. REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach\/File Photo  Speaking at a Financial Times online event, the German biotech firm\u2019s strategy head Ryan Richardson said the price tag of the vaccine, which is co-developed with Pfizer and which has yet to win regulatory approval, would reflect the financial risks that its private-sector investors have incurred.  \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to pursue a balanced approach that recognises that innovation requires capital and investment so we plan to price our vaccine well below typical market rates reflecting the situation that we\u2019re in and with the goal to insure broad-based access around the world,\u201d Richardson said at the FT event.  \u201cI expect there to be differential pricing in certain regions of the world,\u201d he added, declining to elaborate on the different price tags.  The vaccine was on Monday shown to be 90% effective, based on preliminary trial results, a key milestone in the war against a virus that has killed over a million people and battered the world\u2019s economy.  In July Pfizer had agreed with the U.S. government the supply of 100 million doses of its potential vaccine at a price of $39 for a two-dose immunisation, or $19.5 per dose, with the option to sell another 500 million doses under conditions to be negotiated separately.  Later on Tuesday, Richardson signalled that order size would impact the per-dose price in the developed world.  The European Commission will discuss on Wednesday the adoption of a supply contract with Pfizer and BioNTech. The bloc earlier this week said a contract for up to 300 million doses was close to being signed, without providing financial terms.  In the FT briefing, Richardson also said that the two partners\u2019 goal to supply 1.3 billion doses in 2021 would be the result of a ramping-up of efforts well into the second half of next year.  While there would be \u201csignificant supply\u201d during the first half, scaling up output would continue throughout 2021.  BioNTech\u2019s strategy chief stressed that, even though the German group had received public-sector backing, the risks taken by its investors would merit some financial rewards from a future vaccine.  \u201cWe incurred considerable financial risk. We have raised capital in the capital market,\u201d he said.  Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), said at the FT event that the Pfizer and BioNTech project was the only one among the 10 leading vaccine developers that had not received \u201csubstantial public sector financing\u201d.  In June the European Investment Bank, the EU\u2019s financial arm, awarded BioNTech 100 million euros in debt financing for its COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing.  Germany\u2019s research ministry in September granted BioNTech 375 million euros, subject to meeting certain milestones, also to ramp up vaccine development and production.","627":"FILE PHOTO: Small bottles labeled with a \"Vaccine COVID-19\" sticker and a medical syringe are seen in this illustration taken taken April 10, 2020.

Asked why he thought the pharmaceutical companies had been forced to announce reductions, Di Maio said he believed they had simply bitten off more than they could chew.  \u201cWe are activating all channels so the EU Commission does all it can to make these gentlemen respect their contracts,\u201d he said.  No one was immediately available to comment at Pfizer in Italy. AstraZeneca did not immediately reply to an email and voice message.  Also on Sunday European Council President Charles Michel said the EU would use legal means to ensure pharmaceutical companies respect supply contracts for COVID-19 vaccines.  \u201cWe plan to make the pharmaceutical companies respect the contracts they have signed ... by using the legal means at our disposal,\u201d Michel said on Europe 1 radio.  Sky Italia TV cited Pfizer on Sunday as saying the cuts, to the number of vials delivered and not the number of doses, had been due to work to increase capacity at a Belgian plant.  Supplies would return to normal as of next week, Sky cited Pfizer as saying.  On Saturday Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the delays in vaccine supplies were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and amounted to a serious breach of contractual obligations, adding that Italy would use all available legal tools.  Speaking on Italian TV on Sunday Italy\u2019s Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri said the cut in supplies announced by Pfizer and AstraZeneca would put back vaccination of the over-80s in Italy by about four weeks and the rest of the population by about 6-8 weeks.  \u201cThis kind of delay affects the whole of Europe and a good part of the world but I am confident the delay can be made up for further down the road,\u201d he said.  Italy was the first Western country to be hit by the virus last March and has registered 85,461 deaths so far, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth-highest in the world.","640":"June 25 (Reuters) - Aptevo Therapeutics Inc:  * APTEVO THERAPEUTICS - WILL RECEIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM PFIZER RELATED TO SALES OF A RITUXIMAB BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT, RUXIENCE  * APTEVO THERAPEUTICS - ROYALTY TERM RUNS UNTIL SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF FIRST COMMERCIAL SALE OF BIOSIMILAR Source text: (bit.ly\/2Z7O6bX) Further company coverage:","641":"A federal judge has dismissed a proposed class action accusing Baxter International and Pfizer Inc\u2019s Hospira of engaging in an anticompetitive scheme to restrict the output of intravenous saline solutions in order to boost prices.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic degenerative disease that affects one in 3,500 to 5,000 males.  People with the condition lack the protein dystrophin needed to keep muscle cells intact. That can lead to life-threatening damage to the heart, and over time, death, often at a young age.  The study tested two different dosages of the gene therapy in boys ranging in age from 6 to 12-years old. Two months after receiving the one-time therapy, mini-dystrophin expression levels ranged from 10% to 60% of normal, Pfizer said.  Gene therapies use engineered viruses to carry healthy genetic material into a person\u2019s cells to replace faulty or mutated genes that cause a disease or condition.  The higher tested dose appeared to be more effective, according to data presented at the Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy conference in Orlando, Florida.  Pfizer said future trials will use the higher dose, which had triple the concentration of virus with genetic material. The U.S. drugmaker said it also may test an intermediate dose.  Both of the boys who required hospital treatment had received the higher dose.  One had developed a kidney injury. He was hospitalized for 11 days and received two doses of Alexion\u2019s Soliris, but left the hospital with normal kidney function.  The other suffered nausea and vomiting after the treatment and spent two days in a hospital.  Pfizer is racing Sarepta Therapeutics Inc to be first to market with a gene therapy for DMD.  So far, there are just two approved gene therapies in the United States, even though pharmaceutical companies have been pouring money into potentially lucrative treatments that could offer patients with deadly or debilitating conditions a possible one-time cure.  In October, Sarepta said a study of its gene therapy in four patients showed mean micro-dystrophin levels of 74% of normal. But Sarepta and Pfizer used different techniques to measure dystrophin, so the data are not immediately comparable.  Evercore ISI analysts said an investor survey the brokerage conducted indicated dystrophin levels of greater than 40% would likely mean Pfizer\u2019s drug could be competitive.  Sarepta\u2019s older drug, Exondys 51, won U.S. approval to treat some forms of DMD in 2016.

The company had earlier this month announced cuts in enrollment for the vaccine trial from its original plan for 60,000, as higher rates of COVID-19 infections amid a worsening pandemic should generate the data it needs with fewer study subjects.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19.  The dollar -- which is considered to be a safe haven and so typically falls on positive news -- rose after the announcement, as investors quit their long positions in safe currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc.  The safe-haven Japanese yen tumbled to a 20-day low versus the dollar.

Australia has taken a diversified approach to COVID-19 vaccines, with 140 million shots initially on order -- enough for several times the population -- to ensure flexibility.  The country has 53 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s Oxford vaccine on order, of which 50 million will be made domestically by CSL.  It also has 10 million doses ordered from Pfizer-BioNTech, enough for five million people since it requires two shots.  Australia has an arrangement for 51 million doses of an offshore-manufactured vaccine still being trialled by Novavax Inc.  An earlier order for 51 million doses of a vaccine developed by Australia\u2019s University of Queensland, which was to be produced by CSL, was scrapped in December after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis.  *WHY THE LAG?  Australian authorities say most vaccine approvals globally have been on an emergency basis, meaning manufacturers must still commit to handing over safety and efficacy data to regulators once rolled out.  While other countries began issuing emergency approvals in December, Australian officials argue very low local community transmissions mean it can afford to wait until it has enough trial data before approving any vaccines for domestic use.  *WHAT\u2019S THE LATEST WITH APPROVALS?  The Pfizer-BioNTech product is the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive approval for use in Australia. The provisional nod is a more comprehensive approval than those issued for emergency use and means the product can be sold for two years.  The TGA says the approval means Australians can be confident that the review process \u201cwas rigorous and of the highest standard.\u201d  The Australian government expects the TGA to give approval for the AstraZeneca vaccine in the next few weeks, ahead of a rollout that\u2019s expected to start in March.  The Pfizer approval means a rescheduling of Australia\u2019s original vaccine plan.  The country initially committed to underwriting a domestic manufacturing plant for biopharmaceutical giant CSL Ltd to make tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s \u201cOxford\u201d vaccine.  But that vaccine hasn\u2019t received domestic approval yet, leaving a limited order of the Pfizer product, enough for a fifth of the country\u2019s 25 million people, to get the programme started.  *WHAT IS AUSTRALIA\u2019S EXPOSURE TO GLOBAL SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND SHIPPING DELAYS?  Australia says it has been assured delivery of its Pfizer vaccines before rollout begins in late February.  Health Minister Greg Hunt says the government has been notified by AstraZeneca that it is managing a \u201csupply shock\u201d globally, and this will delay delivery of its 3 million offshore-produced doses.  He says Australia will bring forward delivery of its 50 million domestically manufactured AstraZeneca doses, ensuring the programme is unaffected.  *WHAT HAPPENS NOW?  The government has said it wants 80,000 people vaccinated per week. The vaccine is approved for everyone over the age of 16 although a final priority list is still being drawn up and authorities expect to work with hospitals and general practitioners to co-ordinate a rollout.  Health Secretary Brendan Murphy says there is not enough data available to determine the vaccine\u2019s safety for pregnant women so authorities will use a \u201cbest guess\u201d about whether to administer it to them. For elderly and frail patients, \u201cvery careful clinical\u201d decisions would be needed, Murphy said.","659":"LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - BioNTech will send the COVID-19 vaccine it has developed with Pfizer in temperature-controlled boxes to Britain by ferry or plane as it prepares to deliver the shots in the next few days, a senior executive said on Wednesday.  The comments were made by chief business and chief commercial officer of the German biotech Sean Marett in a briefing after Britain approved the vaccine, jumping ahead of the United States and Europe to become the West\u2019s first country to formally endorse a jab it said should reach the most vulnerable people early next week.  Marett said the vaccine can be transported after leaving storage for up to six hours at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius during delivery to facilities including care homes, and it can also last for five days in a normal fridge.  His comments will allay some concerns that the shots need to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, equivalent to the Antarctic winter, which may be difficult for nursing homes and other locations where the shots will be administered first.","660":"(Reuters) - Japan will receive all the COVID-19 vaccines it has purchased for this year from Pfizer and BioNTech, BioNTech\u2019s head said on Tuesday, amid worries that delivery schedules may be disrupted by global wrangling over supplies.

The German biotech startup has led the vaccine race but its shot has been slow to arrive in the European Union because of relatively late approval from the bloc\u2019s health regulator and the small size of the order placed by Brussels.  The delays in rolling out the home-grown vaccine have caused consternation in Germany, where some regions had to halt vaccinations within days of starting an inoculation drive.  \u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look good - a hole is appearing because there\u2019s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine,\u201d BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told news weekly Spiegel.  Sahin founded BioNTech with his wife, Oezlem Tuereci, who is the company\u2019s chief medical officer. Both faulted the EU\u2019s decision to spread orders in the expectation that more vaccines would be approved quickly.  The United States ordered 600 million doses of the BioNTech\/Pfizer shot in July, while the EU waited until November to place an order half that size.  \u201cAt some point it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver so quickly,\u201d Tuereci told Spiegel. \u201cBy then it was already too late to place follow-on orders.\u201d  After publication of the interview, BioNTech said it was in talks with Brussels on boosting output  \u201cWe are in productive discussions with the European Commission on how to make more of our vaccine in Europe, for Europe,\u201d a spokeswoman said.  NEW PRODUCTION  BioNTech hopes to launch a new production line in Marburg, Germany, ahead of schedule in February, with the potential to produce 250 million doses in the first half of 2021, said Sahin.  Talks are also under way with contract manufacturers and there should be greater clarity by the end of January, he added.  Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Twitter that German authorities would do everything possible to enable a swift start in Marburg.  The federal government, which has backed BioNTech with 375 million euros ($458 million) in funding, has resisted calls from opposition leaders to speed production of its vaccine by issuing compulsory licences to other drugmakers.  Another vaccine from Moderna is expected to be cleared by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Jan. 6.  Spahn has also urged the EMA to quickly approve the Oxford University-AstraZeneca shot cleared by Britain. The EU timeline for that treatment remains uncertain.  That vaccine was approved by India\u2019s drug regulator on Friday for emergency use, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  VIRAL VARIANT  Sahin said the BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus, should be able to cope with a new, more contagious variant first detected in Britain.  \u201cWe are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralise this variant and will soon know more,\u201d he said.  Asked about coping with a strong mutation, he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks - though such new treatments might require additional regulatory approvals.  Sahin also said BioNTech would make its vaccine, which requires storage at about minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), easier to handle, adding that a next-generation vaccine could be ready by late summer.

FILE PHOTO: Syringes filled with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine are prepared at the CHIREC Delta Hospital in Brussels, Belgium January 21, 2021. REUTERS\/Yves Herman\/File Photo  Becton Dickinson and Co began scaling up syringe production months in advance of the vaccine rollout, before the U.S. government or its partners knew that a niche type of syringe, known as low dead space, would be needed for getting more shots out of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine vials, an executive told Reuters in an interview.  Becton Dickinson\u2019s government contract includes only limited supply of the niche product, and a new factory that it is developing is focused on other types of syringes, the executive said.  The vaccine made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech , one of two authorized for U.S. emergency use, is shipped in vials initially indicated to hold five doses. Six doses can be drawn with low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use.  If healthcare providers can reliably extract the sixth dose it would allow supplies to be stretched 20% further and could be a financial boost for Pfizer, which is paid per dose.  The U.S. government has begun giving healthcare providers new syringe kits to extract six shots from each vial. It said that three of the low dead space syringes in each six-needle kit would allow extraction, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. A CDC spokeswoman said the new kits would contain a \u201cmajority\u201d of low dead space syringes.  Syringe maker Becton Dickinson has contracted with the U.S. government to provide 286 million syringes for use with COVID-19 vaccines, including around 40 million low dead space syringes, and is fully prepared to deliver on that agreement, said Troy Kirkpatrick, the company\u2019s senior director of public relations.  Low dead space syringes are a niche product and Becton Dickinson had not discussed plans with the U.S. government to substantially boost their output when they began preparing for the vaccine rollout last year, he said.  \u201cWe are ready to support the U.S. government but we are trying to make sure everyone understands that those devices are not something we have infinite capacity to produce and bringing up new lines does take time,\u201d Kirkpatrick said.  The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company is the largest syringe and needle maker in the world, according to 360iResearch, and Kirkpatrick said it has boosted overall production capacity by about 1 billion syringes for 2021, with most of the capacity allocated.  A new production line for syringes will be functional by July but was not designed to produce additional low dead space syringes, he said. Kirkpatrick said Becton Dickinson is also discussing plans with the U.S. government to deploy pre-filled syringes, which negate the need for vials and can help get more out of existing vaccine supplies.  The federal government has contracts with other manufacturers, and it was not immediately clear whether they could supply more of the specialty syringes.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a federal organizer of the vaccination drive, told providers in an email reviewed by Reuters it has started giving healthcare providers packages including both types of needles.  The email said early testing showed that three low dead space syringes used in combination with three standard syringes may yield the sixth dose.  \u201cEvery effort is being made to reconfigure the ancillary kits with syringes that enable the six-dose draw without impacting the availability or slowing the delivery of supplies to jurisdictions,\u201d the email said.  President Joe Biden has described the vaccine rollout so far as a \u201cdismal failure\u201d and said he will use wartime powers to secure more supplies for the campaign, including low dead space syringes, but experts say that such efforts will still run up against production constraints.  Healthcare distributor McKesson Corp is responsible for assembling the accompanying kits of vaccination supplies, including syringes, that are paired with each tray of Pfizer vaccines. The supplies themselves are procured by the U.S. government.  Moderna Inc, which makes the other vaccine authorized for use in the United States, says it puts 10 doses in each of its vials, but New York State public health officials have said providers can extract 11 doses.","668":"Aug 22 (Reuters) - Exact Sciences Corp said on Wednesday Pfizer Inc would share marketing expenses and co-promote the company\u2019s stool screening test for colorectal cancer, in a bid to boost sales of the product.

REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach  Six EU countries described the delay as unacceptable and said it impacted the credibility of the whole vaccination process.  Spooked by a fast-spreading variant first detected in Britain, governments in Europe have imposed tighter and longer lockdowns and curbs. They are pinning hopes on vaccines being rolled out across the continent.  But even when inoculations start en masse, pressure on health systems is not expected to lift for months, or until most people within a population get the shot.  The vaccine developed by Pfizer with German partner BioNTech started being delivered in the EU at the end of December. U.S. biotech firm Moderna began delivering its shot this week.  Yet about one third of the 27 EU governments cited \u201cinsufficient\u201d doses at a video conference of health ministers on Wednesday, a person who attended the virtual meeting told Reuters.  In a letter sent on Friday, six EU governments asked the European Commission to pressure Pfizer-BioNTech \u201cto ensure stability and transparency of timely (vaccine) deliveries\u201d.  \u201cThis situation is unacceptable,\u201d said the letter, seen by Reuters, signed by the health ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.  \u201cNot only does it impact the planned vaccination schedules, it also decreases the credibility of the vaccination process.\u201d  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had spoken to Pfizer and been reassured that scheduled deliveries will be made in the first quarter of 2021.  Pfizer said there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost production.  \u201cAlthough this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,\u201d Pfizer said in a statement.  TURKEY PUSHES AHEAD  The German health ministry said Pfizer has informed the European Union that it would temporarily reduce deliveries due to construction work at its plant in the Belgian town of Puurs.  Belgium said it expected to receive only around half of the planned doses of the Pfizer vaccine in January. Lithuania said it was told this week its supplies would be halved until mid-February.  Pfizer and BioNTech have two contracts with the EU for the supply of up to 600 million doses this year. They have agreed to deliver 75 million doses in the second quarter and more later in the year.  Moderna has committed to delivering 10 million doses by the end of March and 35 million each in the second and third quarter. Another 80 million doses are also to be delivered this year but without a clear timetable yet.  Turkey, not an EU member, said it had vaccinated more than 600,000 people in the first two days of administering shots developed by China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech, among the fastest rollouts in the world.  \u201cWe are an experienced country in implementing nationwide inoculation programmes ... We will win the battle with the pandemic together,\u201d Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted.  Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its programme on Thursday than France had in nearly its first three weeks.  Rising infections are turning up the heat on China to strengthen its own pace of vaccination at home, even as it has been exporting millions of doses of vaccines to countries including Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil.  In the first nine days of January, about 4.5 million doses were given nationwide in China, triple the number given from July to November, Reuters calculations based on official data show. By Jan. 13, more than 10 million doses were given.  Two Chinese firms, Sinovac and Sinopharm, have developed vaccines. Sinopharm shipped more than 10 million doses domestically by Jan 4, while Sinovac delivered more than 7 million doses by Jan 10.  Scattered vaccine shortages cropped up on the front lines of the U.S. battle against the pandemic on Friday, prompting at least one large healthcare system to cancel appointments of people hoping to be inoculated.

Amid record coronavirus infections and deaths, Moderna has already moved vaccine supplies from its manufacturing plants to warehouses operated by distributor McKesson Corp.  Workers on Saturday were packing vaccines into containers and loading them on trucks, U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said during a news conference. Trucks will set out on Sunday and shipments will start reaching healthcare providers as soon as Monday, he said.  Doses of vaccine must travel with security guards, including U.S. Marshals, and will be stored in locked refrigerators. U.S. plans call for at-risk groups such as elderly people in nursing homes and medical workers to receive injections first.  The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an emergency use authorization for Moderna\u2019s vaccine, the second COVID-19 vaccine to receive approval.  Moderna said a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Saturday to recommend its vaccine for use in people aged 18 and older.

States including Oregon and Washington, which are ramping up to get frontline healthcare workers vaccinated as quickly as possible, said their allocation had dropped by as much as 40%.  Perna said he made an error estimating the number of doses that would actually be cleared by regulators for shipment, which was fewer than the number of doses produced.  A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said 7.9 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would be delivered nationally this week.  The Moderna delivery system will have some of the same players as Pfizer\u2019s but will differ in key ways.  Transportation companies UPS and FedEx are giving priority to vaccines on planes and trucks that are moving holiday gifts and other cargo. Their drivers will handle the bulk of the last-mile Moderna vaccine deliveries. They are going directly to vaccination sites, unlike Pfizer\u2019s which was sent to large hubs and redistributed.  \u201cWe added a lot of aircraft, a lot of temporary workers. (Vaccines) are a very small fraction of total volumes,\u201d said Wes Wheeler, a UPS executive in charge of vaccine shipments. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is available in quantities as small as 100 doses and can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators, while the inoculations from Pfizer come in boxes of 975 doses, must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), and can be held for only five days at standard refrigerator temperatures. Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday. A CDC advisory panel on Sunday will consider which groups should get vaccinated next.  Perna said the United States is on track to have enough doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of the year to inoculate 20 million people, as the government projected, but deliveries of those doses may continue into first week of January. Healthcare experts forecast it will take well into 2021 for a significant portion of Americans to be inoculated.  Both vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness in clinical trials that found no serious safety issues.","695":"FILE PHOTO: Moderna's logo is reflected in a drop on a syringe needle in this illustration taken November 9, 2020.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  Gilead is aiming to make enough of the drug by the end of the year to treat more than 2 million COVID-19 patients, and agreed to send nearly all of its remdesivir supply to the United States through September.  But hospital staffers and politicians have complained about difficulties in gaining access to the drug, which is one of only two to have demonstrated an ability to help hospitalized COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials.  There are also fears of shortages outside the United States, and separately on Friday, Britain's Hikma Pharmaceuticals Plc HIK.L said it has started manufacturing remdesivir at its Portugal plant.  Gilead said its manufacturing network for the drug had grown to more than 40 companies in North America, Europe and Asia to add capacity.  Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of U.S. state attorneys general urged the federal government to allow other companies to make Gilead\u2019s remdesivir, to increase its availability and lower the price of the antiviral drug.  Pfizer will provide contract manufacturing services through its McPherson, Kansas, plant, the drugmaker said. It was not immediately clear if Pfizer would supply only for the U.S. market.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent a warning letter to Pfizer in 2017 saying that the process for manufacturing sterile injectable drugs at the Kansas plant was \u201cout of control\u201d and put patients at risk.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Adding to the optimism was news that Pfizer Inc\u2019s experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective, based on initial trials, though Olympics organisers have said their Games do not depend on a vaccine.  Sunday\u2019s event, involving athletes from Japan, China, Russia and the United States, went off largely without a hitch as the Federation International de Gymnastique (FIG) and the Japanese Gymnastics Association (JGA) tested various measures against the novel coronavirus.  All athletes and staff took daily PCR tests during their time in Japan and their movements were heavily restricted.  Likewise, the 2,000 fans allowed into the Yoyogi National Gymnasium on Sunday had their temperatures checked upon entry.  The JGA confirmed on Tuesday that there had been no positive tests among athletes or staff.  FIG President Morinari Watanabe praised the athletes\u2019 attitude and said their confidence had been bolstered.  \u201cWhen they arrived in Japan, you could see fear in their eyes,\u201d Watanabe said,, following a meeting with Tokyo 2020 organisers.  \u201cThey were worried they might be infected and you can see that fear deep into their eyes. But each day that they spent time in Japan, they managed to ease their fears.\u201d  \u201cAt the end of the day you could see the joy in their eyes.\u201d  Watanabe said he had been contacted by organisers of the Paris 2024 Games, who had expressed their encouragement.  Tokyo 2020 organisers also welcomed the news about Pfizer Inc\u2019s experimental COVID-19 vaccine.  \u201cI heard about the vaccine and I think we all felt positive and a sense of relief at this news, all of us at Tokyo 2020 too,\u201d said Games Delivery Officer Hidemasa Nakamura.  However, Olympics organisers have long stressed a vaccine is not needed for next year\u2019s Games to go ahead and Nakamura said the vaccine has not been used yet and so was not part of the preparations.","699":"Social media users have claimed that images of 90-year-old Margaret Keenan, the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine outside of a trial, were first published in a news report in October.

Pfizer, with partner BioNTech SE, and rival Moderna have released trial data showing their COVID-19 vaccines to be about 95% effective at preventing the illness, while AstraZeneca last month said its vaccine was on average about 70% effective.  The companies have said distribution could begin almost immediately after any approval, with governments around the world to decide who gets them and in what order. The following is an outline of the process:  WHEN WILL COMPANIES ROLL OUT A VACCINE?  Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already started manufacturing their vaccines, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be rolled out from early next week in Britain.  This year, Pfizer said it would have enough to inoculate 25 million people, Moderna will have enough for 10 million people and AstraZeneca will have enough for more than 100 million people.  The U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will manage distribution in the United States, with some 20 million people expected to be inoculated by the end of the year.  Some 60 million to 70 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine could be available per month beginning in January and most Americans will have access to shots by mid-2021, the government said on Tuesday.  In the European Union, it is up to each country in the 27-member bloc to start distributing vaccines to their populations.  WHO WOULD GET AN APPROVED VACCINE AND WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES?  Upon authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the CDC has said first in line for vaccinations would be about 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents in long-term care facilities.  The U.S. FDA is set to meet on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend emergency use authorization of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  Essential workers, a group of 87 million people who do crucial jobs that cannot be done from home, are the likely next group. This includes firefighters, police, school employees, transport workers, food and agriculture workers and food service employees.  Around 100 million adults with high-risk medical conditions and 53 million adults over the age of 65, also considered at higher risk of severe disease, are the next priority.  U.S. public health officials said vaccines would be generally available to most Americans in pharmacies, clinics and doctors offices starting in April so that anyone who wants a shot can have one by the end of June.  It is unclear when a vaccine will be available for children. Pfizer and BioNTech have started testing their vaccine in volunteers as young as 12.  WHEN WILL A VACCINE BE AVAILABLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES?  Britain could start a roll-out of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this month. The country had ordered 40 million doses - enough for just under a third of the population.  Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers.  The European Union (EU), Japan, Canada and Australia are all running rapid vaccine regulatory processes.  The EU drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, said it could give conditional marketing approval for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine by Dec. 29 and make a decision on Moderna\u2019s by Jan. 12.  Most countries in the region have said the first vaccines would go to the elderly and vulnerable and frontline workers.  Many of AstraZeneca\u2019s doses this year are expected to go to Britain, where health officials have said that if approved they could begin vaccinating people in December.  Countries say they are buying vaccines via the European Commission\u2019s joint procurement scheme, which has deals for six different vaccines and nearly 2 billion doses.  Delivery timelines vary and most countries are still drawing up plans for distributing and administering shots.  Italy expects to receive the first deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and AstraZeneca\u2019s shot early next year. Spain plans to give vaccines in January.  In Bulgaria, the country\u2019s chief health inspector expects the first shipments in March-April. Hungary\u2019s foreign minister said doses would land in the spring at the earliest.  Germany, home to BioNTech, expects to roll out shots in early 2021 with mass vaccination centres in exhibition halls, airport terminals and concert venues. It will also use mobile teams for care homes.  WHEN WILL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINES?  COVAX, a programme led by the World Health Organization and the GAVI vaccine group to pool funds from wealthier countries and non-profits to buy and distribute vaccines to dozens of poorer countries, has raised $2 billion.  Its first goal is to vaccinate 3% of the people in these countries with a final goal of reaching 20%. It has signed a provisional agreement to buy AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, which does not require storage in specialized ultra cold equipment like the Pfizer vaccine.  It is expected, but not certain, that less wealthy countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, such as India, will receive vaccines at low or no cost under this programme in 2021. Other countries, such as those in Latin America, may buy vaccines through COVAX. Several are also striking supply deals directly with drugmakers.  HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?  Vaccine makers and governments have negotiated varying prices, not all of which are public. Governments have paid from a few dollars per AstraZeneca shot to up to $50 for the two-dose Pfizer regimen. Many countries have said they will cover the cost of inoculating their residents.","702":"(Corrects typographical errors in fifth bullet)  * CSI300 flat, SSEC +0.12%  * Tech shares weigh after Nasdaq drop  * Muted reaction to Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine news  SHANGHAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - China blue-chips were little changed on Tuesday after scaling five-year highs in the previous session, with tech firms capping small gains after U.S. tech shares slumped overnight and as soft inflation figures defied a broader economic recovery in China.  ** At the midday break, China\u2019s blue-chip CSI300 index was up 0.02% and the Shanghai Composite index was 0.12% higher.

John Thys\/Pool via REUTERS  VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania\u2019s president said on Friday the country would receive enough COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate 70% of its population by early July, and that this would achieve herd immunity.  The ambitious supply schedule hinges on vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson being approved for use in the European Union, in addition to the Pfizer shot already being administered, President Gitanas Nauseda said.  \u201cWe received assurances from the European Commission president that Lithuania will be able to vaccinate 70% of population by early summer, because we will receive 4 million vaccines during the first and second quarters,\u201d Nauseda said.  \u201cThe challenge is about to change from vaccine shortages to setting up mass vaccinations, so that we use the time optimally and can fully reach collective immunity (by early July). This is the goal we can set for ourselves,\u201d he told reporters.  The World Health Organization has estimated that 60-70% of a population needs to be vaccinated to break transmission.  However, the concept of herd immunity comes with caveats and big demands of what vaccines might be capable of preventing, and some experts say such expectations are misplaced.  Experts point to various still unresolved factors - such as the rate of the spread of the COVID-19-causing virus, whether vaccines can stop transmission or just stop people getting ill, how many people in a population will accept a vaccine, and whether vaccines offer the same protection to everyone.  Nauseda said Lithuania, a Baltic republic of 2.8 million people, will need to vaccinate 10,000 per day by February and up to 35,000 people per day by April to reach the July target.  Between 1,000 and 4,000 people have received the vaccine daily this week, according to government data.","706":"FILE PHOTO: Vials containing doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine are seen at the Bavarian Red Cross vaccination center, in Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, Germany January 10, 2021.

FILE PHOTO: EpiPen auto-injection epinephrine pens manufactured by Mylan NV pharmaceutical company for use by severe allergy sufferers are seen in Washington, U.S. August 24, 2016. REUTERS\/Jim Bourg\/File Photo  For the past year, Mylan has been struggling to address an ongoing EpiPen shortage that could potentially worsen as thousands of school children with allergies need to restock EpiPen supplies ahead of the school year.  Now, the planned tie-up will bring together two businesses that have long collaborated on making EpiPens. For years, Pfizer has manufactured EpiPen on Mylan\u2019s behalf through its Meridian Medical Technologies unit.  It was not yet clear if the combination will help ease the shortages by simplifying the company\u2019s complex manufacturing processes.  Although Meridian will not be merged with Mylan as part of the transaction announced on Monday, the companies were in talks to transfer Meridian to the newly created generics business, a Pfizer spokeswoman said.  The discussions are still ongoing and there is no guarantee that a deal will be reached, but the parties are aiming to reach a final decision before the close of the larger Pfizer-Mylan deal in 2020, Pfizer said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had some conversations with Mylan about that potentially transferring to Mylan as a supplement to the existing transaction, but nothing has been finalized to date yet,\u201d Frank D\u2019Amelio, Pfizer\u2019s chief financial officer told Reuters.  If the company is transferred to the new Mylan-Pfizer spinoff, it could potentially help streamline a fix to the manufacturing issues that have led to shortages.  \u201cOver the long term, having all EpiPen operations under one unified company would reduce complexity,\u201d said Ashtyn Evans, an Edward Jones analyst.  Meridian, which produces all EpiPens sold globally at a single plant near St. Louis, has been hit by a series of manufacturing problems since at least 2018 that resulted in shortages in the United States and elsewhere. The company said in early July it anticipates further supply shortages over the coming months.  Canada\u2019s national health agency said earlier this month it continued to experience EpiPen shortages as well.  Mylan, a generic drugmaker that came under fire from mothers and politicians over steep EpiPen price hikes, has been facing new competition for its emergency allergy treatment.  Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries TEVA.TA has launched its own EpiPen generic, and other companies including Novartis AG NOVN.S, Kaleo Inc and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc AMRX.N also are in the market with rival products.","708":"FILE PHOTO: A vial of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a surgery in Wolverhampton, Britain December 14, 2020.

Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, has said he will not take any coronavirus vaccine whatsoever.

Yet basic details about the government\u2019s vaccine plans remain sketchy, with regulators yet to approve the AstraZeneca shot Brazil has already bought, and China\u2019s Sinovac vaccine struggling to produce late-stage data.  The federal government waded into an awkward scrap with Pfizer, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States, over what the U.S. firm described as a surprisingly onerous procedure to apply for an emergency use authorization.  In a news conference, Deputy Health Minister Elcio Franco defended the government, saying it was hamstrung by local laws which only allow it to sign vaccine purchase agreements once producers have emergency use authorizations or full authorizations.  He vowed to seek a better dialogue with Pfizer, but said he could not force the company to apply for an emergency use authorizations or a full regulatory application.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of Sanofi is pictured during the company's shareholders meeting in Paris, France, April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Benoit Tessier\/File Photo  Local output of the two human vaccines is a step change for Biovac, a public-private partnership 47.5%-owned by the South African government with long-term ambitions of expanding sales into the continent.  The new production lines follow years of technology transfers and skills upgrades with partners Sanofi and Pfizer in Africa\u2019s largest pharmaceutical market. The companies were tight-lipped about commercial details of the partnership.  \u201cWe start production of (the) hexavalent in Q3 2020,\u201d Morena Makhoana, Biovac\u2019s chief executive said at its state-of-the art facility in Cape Town, referring to the Sanofi vaccine.  The plant, modernized at a cost of around 1 billion rand ($70 million), will produce four million doses of Hexaxim vaccine a year and has capacity to ramp up significantly as it explores new markets in neighboring Namibia, Mozambique and Angola, he said.  South Africa\u2019s government buys about 95% of the total 25 million doses of vaccine supplied annually by Biovac, covering diseases such as tuberculosis, cervical cancer and influenza.  Biovac\u2019s dose of Hexaxim, a six-in-one vaccine for several diseases including diphtheria, tetanus and polio, is the only one in the world that is fully liquid and unlike other versions on the market, Makhoana said, does not have to be mixed before injecting. This makes it easier to administer in remote and resource-poor clinics across Africa, he added.  \u201cOn this particular six-in-one vaccine we are the only tech transfer partner with Sanofi in the world, so we are very proud,\u201d Makhoana told Reuters.  Sanofi said it will continue to invest in South Africa\u2019s vaccine program as it looks to bolster its position.  \u201cSouth Africa, and Africa for that matter, is an emerging market and showing strong growth year-on-year and hence will remain a priority for Sanofi,\u201d Merilynn Matthew, who heads Sanofi\u2019s South African vaccines unit, said.  Around one-in-five African children do not get immunized, with measles alone accounting for 61,000 preventable deaths a year on the continent, according to the World Health Organisation.  SECURITY OF SUPPLY  Biovac, the rest of which is owned by a consortium led by local investment holding firm Immunotek, has also made progress preparing Pfizer\u2019s pneumonia vaccine for infants, Prevnar 13, Makhoana said. It expects full output of 3 million doses to start in the first half of 2021.  Under a five-year agreement signed with Pfizer in 2015, Biovac only packaged labeled syringes but it is now acquiring the formulation and filling processes ahead of the new product line launch.  \u201cSecurity of supply is one big issue and the second is the economic benefits local production brings, while making sure that prices are equally benchmarked and South Africa pays a fair price in line with other middle income countries such as Brazil or Turkey,\u201d Makhoana said.  At the partnership launch four years ago, a cabinet minister said the pneumonia vaccine alone used up 40% of South Africa\u2019s total budget for vaccines, with the government then paying around 185 rand ($13.11) per single dose of imported Prevenar 13. Each infant will eventually need three doses. Pfizer did not provide the current cost of the vaccine.  \u201cThe technology transfer process has enabled significant knowledge transfer, job creation and direct investment,\u201d said Rhulani Nhlaniki, Pfizer\u2019s country manager.

A vial of the Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is seen ahead of being administered at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, Northern Ireland December 8, 2020. Liam McBurney\/Pool via REUTERS  The CDC panel meeting (bit.ly\/36WEmXa) will follow Thursday's meeting of an independent advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that will discuss Pfizer's vaccine data and recommend whether it should be authorized for emergency use. The FDA will have the final say.  Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert and non-voting member of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), said the gap between the two ACIP meetings will allow the FDA time to draft and issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) before the ACIP vote.  That schedule could change, however, if FDA advisers have questions or request more data, he said.  ACIP last week voted for healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities to receive the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States.  Healthcare personnel who have been infected with the coronavirus in the three preceding months, can choose to delay vaccination to let those susceptible to infection receive the shots first, the agency said on its website (bit.ly\/36X5gOJ).  \u201cCurrent evidence suggests reinfection is uncommon during this period after initial infection,\u201d it said.  Pfizer last month said its vaccine\u2019s two-dose regimen was 95% effective at preventing illness from COVID-19 and had no major safety issues. The drugmaker is set to present its data to ACIP on Friday.  The FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for Thursday\u2019s advisory committee meeting, saying the Pfizer vaccine\u2019s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for authorization.  The ACIP panel will have to make recommendations about several groups, including whether the vaccine should be used in adolescents aged 16 to 18, and whether it should be used in pregnant women, who were excluded from Pfizer\u2019s late-stage trial.  Schaffner, who represents the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases on the ACIP panel, said more than 300,000 healthcare workers are women who are pregnant or lactating.  \u201cThis is not trivial,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cThe question will immediately come up at every medical center: \u2018Do you offer those persons the vaccine? And if so, under what circumstance?\u2019\u201d  So far, ACIP discussions have been leaning toward allowing these women to take the vaccine after having received full information on its safety and efficacy, he said, but they have yet to vote on the matter.  The CDC sets U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules based on ACIP recommendations.  A meeting of advisers to the FDA is scheduled for Dec. 17 to discuss Moderna Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which is also being reviewed for emergency use in the United States.","730":"Dec 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it authorized the use of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, with the first inoculations expected within days, marking a turning point in the United States where the pandemic has killed more than 292,000 people.

The deal is expected to be announced on Friday, according to the sources, who declined to be named due to the confidentiality of the agreement.  Details on the size of the deal or the price per dose COVAX would pay were not immediately clear, but the sources said the allotment would likely be relatively small. One source said the reason for the limited volume was that the doses were primarily meant for healthcare workers in the countries that COVAX serves.  BioNTech declined to comment while Pfizer did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for the WHO and the GAVI vaccine alliance, which co-leads the COVAX scheme, also declined to comment.  Senior WHO adviser Bruce Aylward said on Monday the COVAX scheme was in \u201cvery detailed discussions\u201d with Pfizer, which has already committed hundreds of millions of doses this year to several wealthy nations, and expected to be able to include the vaccine in COVAX \u201cvery soon\u201d.  The COVAX scheme is set to start distributing COVID-19 vaccines to poor and middle income countries in February.  Ukraine said earlier on Thursday that its first delievery of COVID-19 vaccine under the COVAX scheme could arrive in the first half on February - with 210,000 doses of either the Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines.  COVAX has said it hopes to deliver more than 2 billion COVID-19 doses across the world this year. In an updated forecast published on Thursday, it said it planned to deliver around 1.8 billion doses in 2021 to 92 poorer countries, covering around 27% of their populations.  The scheme - led by the WHO, the GAVI vaccine alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)- was set up last year amid concerns that poorer nations would lose out while rich countries scrambled to procure COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate their populations.  COVAX has so far secured future vaccine suplies from AstraZeneca, working with Oxford University; the Serum Institute of India (SII) as well as with Sanofi and its partner GSK. It also has a memorandum of understanding over deliveries from Johnson & Johnson.  The Pfizer deal would be COVAX\u2019s second, after the one with AstraZeneca, that covers a product with regulatory approval in some countries.  The additional commitment by Pfizer comes as frustration grows in European countries over the U.S. drugmaker\u2019s unexpected cut in supplies. Pfizer said last week it would reduce deliveries until early February to upgrade production capacity for a later output boost.  The Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is the only shot so far to have WHO emergency use listing approval.  On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the WHO plans to approve several COVID-19 vaccines from Western and Chinese manufacturers in the coming weeks and months as it aims for rapid rollouts in poorer countries.  BioNTech and Pfizer said this month they were aiming to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses this year, up from a previous goal of 1.3 billion.  Their shot is more complicated to transport and store, requiring ultra-cold freezers, which may not be practical for poorer countries with hot climates.","734":"ALMATY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan plans to purchase 100,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, the Central Asian nation\u2019s health ministry said on Monday.

Oil prices soared and pushed up energy stocks while safe-haven U.S. Treasuries sold off after U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said a large-scale trial of their vaccine showed it was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19. Saturday\u2019s news that Joe Biden had won the U.S. presidential election was also a reassuring confirmation of what investors had already been counting on by the end of last week, according to market strategists.  \u201cElection uncertainty is fading into the rearview mirror.

The S&P energy index led gainers among the S&P 500\u2019s 11 major sectors and registered its biggest daily percentage gain in months as investors bet demand would climb again when people become more comfortable with the idea of traveling as the health crisis subsides.  Also, bank shares, often seen as a proxy for the broader economy, soared.  The companies hit hardest by months of travel bans and lockdowns surged. The NYSE airlines index was up 19% while plane maker Boeing Co jumped 15%. Cruise line operator Carnival Corp was up more than 32%.  In contrast, the technology sector and specific companies that had outperformed during the pandemic as they were seen as \u201cstay-at-home\u201d winners were making smaller gains or declining.

REUTERS\/Andreas Gebert  Berlin expects the first COVID-19 vaccines to be available in early 2021 and has given the country\u2019s 16 states a Nov. 10 deadline to detail the addresses of 60 facilities that could serve as delivery centres for manufacturers.  Under the national vaccine strategy, approved by its cabinet last week, Germany has asked the states to identify central vaccination centres which will be supplemented by mobile teams who go into care homes.  The centralised approach underscores the potential logistical challenges facing governments, including limited supplies, multi-dose vials and complex storage requirements.  Some of the most advanced vaccines in human testing are so-called mRNA vaccines being developed by Moderna and the team of BioNTech and Pfizer Inc.  The BioNTech\/Pfizer candidate needs to be stored at temperatures as low as minus 80 degrees Celsius (-112 Fahrenheit). That may give a slight edge to Moderna, whose vaccine is stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), roughly the same as home freezer temperatures.  In smaller, city states such as Hamburg and Bremen, authorities are scouting for central locations that are easy to reach like exhibition halls, where vaccinations could be stockpiled.  \u201cWe are on the lookout for larger locations that are centrally located and spacious. This could well be the airport or trade fair,\u201d a spokesman for Hamburg\u2019s health ministry said, adding no final decision has been taken.  Bigger, more rural states like Baden-Wuerttemberg and Schleswig-Holstein plan to distribute shots from a centralised delivery site into districts and towns, spokespeople for the health authorities said.  Germany has asked the Robert Koch Institute\u2019s vaccine committee to identify which vulnerable population groups should get the shots first, although front-line workers are expected to be a priority.  In a second phase, when more vaccines are widely available in single-dose vials, Germany hopes to administer shots for the broader population at doctors\u2019 practices.  An electronic register will record who has been vaccinated, while an app is being developed to allow people to record potential side effects.  The scale of Germany\u2019s planning contrasts with Italy where authorities intend to use existing infrastructure, including 50,000 general practitioners, 14,000 paediatricians and vaccination centres for local public health offices.  \u201cWith these channels we normally administer around 30 million vaccinations per year to both children and adults, so we believe that this is an adequate infrastructure for the future COVID vaccine as well,\u201d a health ministry spokesman said.

That followed news that Moderna Inc released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing 94.5% effectiveness.  That said, the number of reported global daily deaths from the coronavirus stood at 10,816 on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, the highest single-day death count.

Officials and healthcare professionals in France, Germany and Switzerland all pointed to yields short of six doses, adding to frustrations in countries already lagging vaccination campaigns in nations such as Britain and the United States.  The losses add up: For 200,000 vials of the two-shot vaccine, 600,000 people can be inoculated at six doses per vial, compared with 500,000 at just five.  The difficulties could also hinder Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s new production target of 2 billion COVID-19 shots in 2021, up from 1.3 billion previously.  The higher production forecast assumes health teams can draw that sixth dose from vials where this is permitted, thus stretching supplies.  In France, authorities acknowledge vials contain more than five doses, but early on advised health workers to aim for five. Some French experts said dose-maximising syringes were lacking.  In Switzerland, some officials said five doses had emerged as standard, given the challenges of yielding more of a vaccine they describe as thick and hard to handle.  \u201cFive doses from a vial has proven itself a reliable method,\u201d said Rolf Wirz, spokesman for the cantonal crisis management team in Basel-Land, in northwestern Switzerland.  Confusion over Pfizer\/BioNTech vial volumes emerged in December, when U.S. hospital pharmacists realised that preparing the vaccine, by mixing it with saline solution, yielded enough liquid for at least six 0.30 ml doses.  They initially threw the extra dose away, since vials were labeled for five.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration quickly updated its doses per vial guidance, with the European Medicine Agency following suit on Jan. 8.  Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines are seen at Sao Jose Hospital in Lisbon, Portugal, January 19, 2021. REUTERS\/Pedro Nunes  BioNTech has said its 2 billion dose target was in part supported by an updated 6-dose label on the product.  FIVE OR SIX?  France\u2019s health ministry originally aimed for five doses, but recently boosted its target to six per vial.  Even so, one French expert raised fears of shortages of small 1 ml syringes - designed to maximise vaccine extraction - as an obstacle.  \u201cThis is essential if we want to reach immunity targets quickly and before the new variants hit Europe even more,\u201d said Eric Billy, an immuno-oncology researcher. \u201cWe may have syringes, but we do not have the right ones.\u201d  The health ministry said, in response to those concerns, that it aimed \u201cto ensure that medical equipment is delivered that can allow for such extraction\u201d.  Germany offers a mixed picture: In the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, officials ordered 20.5 million 1 ml syringes and said they had enough to extract six doses.  In eastern Thuringia, however, Health Minister Heike Werner said doctors were finding that obtaining the sixth dose was only possible with about half the Pfizer\/BioNTech vials delivered.  Other nations are having greater success.  In Britain, officials forecast wastage of 10%, but said less was actually being discarded, helped by early recognition that extra doses were possible.  \u201cWe discovered we\u2019re able to get more out of the vials,\u201d said Mary Ramsay, Public Health England\u2019s immunisation head.  Danish authorities are even drawing a seventh dose, boosting optimism they\u2019ll exceed a two-month, 250,000-person inoculation goal.  In the Netherlands, pharmacists initially predicted first-round vaccinations would cover 33,000 doctors and nurses.  \u201cIt turned out to be 39,000 because they could get a sixth dose,\u201d said Kirstin Schimmel, a hospital pharmacist in Leiden, adding some hospitals using special syringes got seven doses.  Swiss regulator Swissmedic also advises a sixth Pfizer\/BioNTech dose is possible with \u201cappropriate syringes and careful handling\u201d.  Still, several Swiss cantons told Reuters they averaged less than six doses per vial. \u201cWhen possible, we draw six,\u201d said a cantonal health department spokeswoman in Zurich. \u201cFive remains the standard. The vaccine is thick and very challenging to handle.\u201d  Aargau initially was yielding five doses, but cantonal officials said careful preparation and growing experience mean six are now increasingly possible.  \u201cThis helps compensate for losses resulting from false preparation, ill-fitting needles and broken and empty vials,\u201d said Michel Hassler, an Aargau spokesman.","758":"FILE PHOTO: People queue to enter a supermarket for last minute Christmas shopping, as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak continues, in Mexico City, Mexico December 24, 2020.

It also said it plans to support studies to determine whether existing Pfizer medicines, including its rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz, may provide benefits for those struggling with the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.  More than a dozen large drugmakers, including Pfizer, have announced plans in recent months to develop vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus, although few if any are likely to reach patients in time to stem the current outbreak.  Pfizer first revealed plans to try to develop an antiviral compound for COVID-19 in March, and later said it was working with BioNTech SE on a potential vaccine based on messenger RNA technology.  It also announced a five-point plan for confronting the virus that includes collaborating with outside companies and institutions on the research, development and manufacture of treatments.  \u201cPfizer has mobilized resources and capabilities to address every single frontier of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in an interview.  Data from preclinical studies shows that a compound that was originally developed to treat SARS - a different coronavirus that caused a major epidemic in 2003 - has the potential to treat patients with the new coronavirus, Dolsten said.  Pfizer said it will conduct additional preclinical studies and aims to begin trials in humans in the third quarter of 2020.  Meanwhile, Pfizer will help fund a study into whether Xeljanz, which belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors and also treats the autoimmune disease ulcerative colitis, can help patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19.  Rheumatoid arthritis treatments from other drugmakers that work differently than Xeljanz are also being studied as possible COVID-19 treatments.  Pfizer is also looking into the potential of other drugs that work on the immune system to help coronavirus patients, the company said.  The company is also working with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine on two studies to better understand the relationship between coronavirus and pneumonia, which plays a role in many deaths caused by the virus that attacks the lungs.  Pfizer will also publish a review of research into whether its antibiotic azithromycin, sold under the brand name Zithromax, can play a role in treating COVID-19.

As a result, annual spending on the capsules by Britain\u2019s National Health Service rose from 2 million pounds in 2012 to about 50 million in 2013. The CMA said at the time that UK prices were many times higher than elsewhere in Europe.  Pfizer, which was fined 84.2 million pounds, used to market the medicine under the brand name Epanutin but sold the rights to Flynn, a privately owned British company, in September 2012.  The Competition Appeal Tribunal said the CMA misapplied the test for unfair pricing, and would send the case back to the CMA for further consideration.  The CMA said it continued to have serious concerns about the very big increases that have occurred for this and several other generic drugs, which have cost the NHS tens of millions of pounds, and the ruling could severely delay other active investigations.  \u201cThe CMA is disappointed with today\u2019s judgment which it is carefully reviewing,\u201d it said.  \u201cIn light of its importance to the NHS and the potential implications for similar cases, the CMA is actively considering whether to appeal.\u201d  Pfizer said it was pleased that the tribunal had overturned the finding that it abused its dominant position \u2013 along with the associated fine.  \u201cOur priority has always been to ensure a sustainable supply of our medicines to UK patients and this was at the heart of our decision to divest this medicine,\u201d it said.","763":"SYDNEY, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Australia expects no changes to the timeline for its COVID-19 vaccine rollout plans, Health Minister Greg Hunt said, after Britain approved Pfizer Inc\u2019s vaccine on Wednesday, the first country to do so.  Britain said it would start inoculating high-risk people from early next week with the vaccine, developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE.  \u201cOur advice remains that the timeline for a decision on approval is expected by the end of January 2021, and our planning is for first vaccine delivery in March 2021,\u201d Hunt said in a statement issued late Wednesday.  Pfizer\u2019s is one of the four COVID-19 vaccines the Australian government has agreed to buy for a total projected supply of nearly 135 million doses. It has already committed to buy vaccines from Novavax, AstraZeneca and CSL Ltd should trials prove successful.  Australia has largely contained the community transmission of the virus but New South Wales (NSW), its largest state, on Thursday reported a new case for the first time in nearly a month after a hotel quarantine worker tested positive.  Five family members of the worker were tested overnight and all returned a negative result for the virus, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told broadcaster Seven News.  The report of the new case comes a day after NSW eased a raft of restrictions at weddings, bars and dancing venues marking the biggest lifting of curbs since March when lockdowns were enforced to slow the spread of COVID-19.  Australia has reported nearly 28,000 cases of COVID-19 and 908 deaths since the pandemic began but estimates there are fewer than 100 active cases remaining, mostly returned travelers from overseas in hotel quarantine.","764":"LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A group of British doctors have written to England\u2019s chief medical officer to tell him to cut the gap between doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine to six weeks from up to 12.  Britain is prioritising giving first doses of COVID-19 vaccine, allowing up to 12 weeks before a second dose, to give the maximum number of people some initial protection.  But Pfizer and BioNTech have warned they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose is given more than 21 days after the first.  The British Medical Association (BMA) said in a statement emailed on Saturday that it has written to the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for England Chris Whitty.  The BMA said it supports giving a second dose up to 42 days after the first dose, but that a longer gap is not in line with World Health Organization guidance.  It therefore urged the CMO to \u201curgently review the UK\u2019s current position of second doses after 12 weeks\u201d.  \u201cThe UK\u2019s strategy has become increasingly isolated from many other countries,\u201d the BMA said.  \u201cBMA members are also concerned that, given the unpredictability of supplies, there may not be any guarantees that second doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be available in 12 weeks\u2019 time.\u201d  Whitty told a media conference on Friday that the longer gap between doses was a \u201cpublic health decision\u201d aimed at vaccinating many more people and based on a belief that the great majority of protection comes from the first jab.  Britain is using two vaccines, one from Pfizer and the other from AstraZeneca.  AstraZeneca has supported the gap between its jabs, saying data showed an 8-12 week gap was a \u201csweet spot\u201d for efficacy.  The Department of Health and Social Care said in an emailed statement that its priority was to protect as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  \u201cThe decision...to change vaccine dosage intervals followed a thorough review of the data and was in line with the recommendations of the UK\u2019s four chief medical officers,\u201d a DHSC spokeswoman said.

The administration has already proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs). Read said he believes the administration wants to get rid of them entirely.  These rebates are rarely passed along to U.S. patients.  Read said Pfizer had discussed the administration\u2019s plan for rebates \u201cin broad terms\u201d with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. The CEO said he does not know how quickly changes to rebate policy could be implemented.  U.S. President Donald Trump has made lowering prescription drug costs for U.S. consumers a top priority. His administration has placed blame on \u201cmiddlemen\u201d such as PBMs - which administer drug benefits for employers and health plans - and health insurers for driving up drug prices by demanding hefty rebates in exchange for broad access to patients.  Read said Pfizer currently receives around 58 percent of its list prices on drugs, suggesting that about 40 percent goes to middlemen. He said ending the rebate system would allow drugmakers to keep price hikes in line with health care inflation.  The largest U.S. drugmaker retreated from planned price hikes on about 40 of its drugs earlier this month, following criticism from President Trump. Read has spoken with Trump and visited the White House since deferring those price increases.  Bowing to intensifying political pressure, several major drugmakers have also announced drug price freezes until the end of the year.  Pfizer shares rose $1.09, or 2.8 percent, to $39.68 in afternoon trading, closing in on near 16-year highs.  Pfizer on Tuesday also reported better-than-expected second quarter profit, but trimmed its full-year revenue forecast due to the strengthening dollar.  Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said investors were encouraged by management optimism about new drugs and long-term growth prospects after prior disappointment that Pfizer had not done a big acquisition.  \u201cThere\u2019s more optimism around the internal pipeline and their ability to expand margins long term,\u201d she said.  FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File Photo  Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 81 cents per share, beating analysts\u2019 average estimate by 7 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Pfizer said it now expects 2018 revenue of between $53 billion and $55 billion, versus its a prior forecast of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion.  It raised both ends of its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast range by 5 cents and now expects $2.95 to $3.05 per share.  Second quarter results were helped by higher-than-expected sales of rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz at $463 million, and by the staying power of its former top-seller Lipitor.  The off-patent cholesterol drug still generated worldwide sales of $521 million.  Total revenue in the quarter rose 4.4 percent to $13.47 billion, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $13.31 billion.","767":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has not yet delivered to the European Union about 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses that were due in December, EU officials said, leaving it about one-third short of the supply it had expected from the U.S. drugmaker.  FILE PHOTO: Vials labelled \"COVID-19 Coronavirus Vaccine\" and sryinge are seen in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, February 9, 2021. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The shortfall is another blow to the EU, which has also been hit by delays in vaccine deliveries from Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc and U.S. biotech Moderna Inc. It had also faced earlier delays with the shot from Pfizer.  The situation raises questions about the rationale of an EU vaccine export control scheme set up in late January to ensure timely deliveries that has not yet been activated, despite the supply shortfalls.  This week, Pfizer delivered to the EU 4.8 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with German partner BioNTech, according to an EU official who is directly involved in talks with the U.S. company.  That takes the total to about 28 million doses of the two-shot vaccine, one of the EU officials and a source familiar with the matter said.  That is still about 10 million doses less than Pfizer had promised to supply since the rollout began late last year, the EU official said.  A second EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers confirmed the shortfall but said the companies had committed to delivering those doses by the end of March.  Pfizer declined to comment, saying schedules of its deliveries were confidential. The executive European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on delivery shortfalls.  EU officials have said Pfizer committed to delivering 3.5 million doses a week from the start of January. This week\u2019s larger delivery suggests the company is increasing supplies to make up for an earlier shortfall.  About 5 million doses will be delivered next week and in the first week of March, one of the officials said.  In mid-January, there was a temporary hiccup in supplies. EU officials said that was largely resolved last month..  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the EU on Dec. 21. The following day, BioNTech said the companies would ship 12.5 million doses to the EU by the end of the month..  Only a portion of those doses due in December have been delivered, the EU officials said.  But the source familiar with the matter said that under the agreement with the EU, 12.5 million doses that BioNTech earmarked in December for the bloc were included in the delivery target for the first quarter of 2021.  It was not immediately clear how the difference in schedules came about, but it highlights the complexity of supply deals as governments around the world scramble to secure shots to curb the pandemic.  The EU has two contracts with Pfizer for the supply of 600 million vaccine doses.  TRADE FLOWS  Although the EU\u2019s own supplies have fallen short, the European Commission has approved all requests for export of COVID-19 vaccines - mostly from Pfizer\/BioNTech - since it set up its mechanism to monitor flows.  In the period between Jan. 30 and Feb. 16, the EU gave the green light to 57 requests for vaccine export to 24 countries, including Britain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a Commission spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  Before the monitoring scheme was set up, the bloc had already exported millions of vaccine doses to Israel, Britain and Canada among others, according to customs data cited in a EU document seen by Reuters.  Israel has inoculated more than 75% of its population, including first and second doses, figures from University of Oxford-based Our World in Data show. The UAE has administered vaccines to around 50% of its population and for Britain it is above 20%. EU countries on average stand at about 5%.  Countries with a high number of inoculations are already vaccinating people not among the most vulnerable, while many of those most in need elsewhere have not received a shot.  The World Health Organization has set the target of inoculating 20% of poor countries\u2019 population by the end of the year.","768":"A social media post has claimed that a document providing information about the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine shows that the jab will be used for depopulation.

The post, seen here, shows a document from the UK government that gives advice about the vaccine to healthcare workers.  Specifically, it shows a section titled \u201cFertility, pregnancy and lactation\u201d, which recommends that the vaccine should not be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding.  \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard about the depopulation vaccine\u201d, the caption of the post reads. \u201cWell here is the proof. This ISNT about covid\u201d. Similar claims can be seen in other social media posts.  While the document is legitimate, and can be seen (here), this does not show that the vaccine is being used for depopulation.  The document recommends that the vaccine should not be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding due to limited trial data, and simply notes that there is an absence of data on fertility effects.  On Dec. 3, The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the UK government, published a report that says: \u201cThere are no data as yet on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy, either from human or animal studies. Given the lack of evidence, JCVI favours a precautionary approach, and does not currently advise COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy\u201d (here).  The UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) previously told Reuters that it does not anticipate any specific safety concerns from the new vaccines, based on reports from clinical trials (here).

In a separate note, Citi said Pfizer\u2019s experimental COVID-19 vaccine being 90% effective exceeded the most optimistic market expectations and that transport and leisure stocks have the most to gain from any vaccine.  European and U.S. airline stocks jumped 20% to 30% on Monday.  Citi said it favored Australian and UK equity markets due to their exposure to business sectors that outperform when nominal yields are rising.  \u201cMore than any fiscal spending package or central bank lending program, a healthcare solution to COVID has the greatest potential to restore economic activity to its full potential, lifting deeply-depressed \u2018social-close\u2019 industries,\u201d said Jeffrey Sacks, Citi Private Bank\u2019s EMEA Investment Strategist.  Citi said U.S. stocks may lag any vaccine-driven rallies in Europe or Asia due to their heavy exposure to the technology sector, which has done well during lockdowns and social restrictions.  UK bluechip index FTSE 100 .FTSE soared 4.7% while the S&P 500 rose 3% on Monday.","782":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it expects to generate $15 billion, or about a quarter of its total revenue this year, from sales of its COVID-19 vaccine co-developed with German partner BioNTech SE.  Sales from the vaccine - on track to be the drugmaker\u2019s top product this year - could top $15 billion if the company signs more supply contracts, it said.  Pfizer aims to make two billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said in an interview that the company wanted to be conservative in its target and is working on numerous initiatives to exceed that output.  \u201cWe\u2019ve increased the batches we run per week, we\u2019ve doubled the output - the yield per batch - we\u2019ve dramatically improved our success rates, we\u2019ve made process improvements to the assembly lines,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Frank D\u2019Amelio said in the interview.  \u201cAll these things are things we\u2019re continuing to examine to see what else we can do to try to produce more doses faster,\u201d he added.  Pfizer also said it expects there could be a long-lasting need for COVID-19 vaccines, to combat new virus variants that emerge and to boost peoples\u2019 waning immune responses.  The company is launching a study to determine whether a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, administered 6-to-12 months after the initial shots, can extend and improve efficacy with more contagious variants circulating in communities around the world. The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine is currently administered as two doses three weeks apart.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said he believes mRNA vaccines like Pfizer\u2019s generate a strong enough immune response to repel the currently circulating variants, and that a booster, rather than a redesigned vaccine, is the right approach for now.  Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he was optimistic that revenue contributions from the vaccine could be sustainable beyond 2021.  Pfizer expects to supply 200 million doses to the U.S. government by the end of May.  To achieve the goal, it will have to deliver an average of around 10 million doses per week, more than double the rate Pfizer and BioNTech delivered to the United States through the end of January, according to Reuters calculations.  The vaccine, which uses synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to prompt an immune response against the virus, was the first shot to be authorized for emergency use in the United States, marking the first regulatory nod for the new technology.  mRNA vaccines and COVID-19 could prove transformative for Pfizer, which is already one of the world\u2019s largest drugmakers, CEO Bourla said. A potential flu vaccine based on the technology could hit the market by 2025, executives said on a conference call.  Pfizer forecast 2021 sales between $59.4 billion and $61.4 billion. The company raised both ends of its full-year adjusted profit forecast by 10 cents and now expects to earn $3.10 to $3.20 per share.","783":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BioNTech is buying a production site for the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Pfizer, aiming to boost output by several hundred million doses next year, and hopes to have the shot ready to file for approval in October.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  It is buying the facility, in the German city of Marburg, from Swiss drugs giant Novartis. The site is part of a complex started in 1904 by pioneering immunologist and Nobel laureate for medicine Emil von Behring, who used the prize money for the investment.  BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said its experimental vaccine could be reviewed by regulators in late October or early November, among the first in the western world.  \u201cA good vaccine should have an immunisation effect of at least 70% to 75% and that is also the yardstick that we have set ourselves in order to have a vaccine that can stop the pandemic in a significant way,\u201d Sahin said.  His remarks were in response to a request to comment on Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, who said in August he would like a vaccine be at least 75% effective.  Germany\u2019s BioNTech and U.S. drugmaker Pfizer have previously said this would be possible as early as late October.  The transaction with Novartis, for which the price tag was not disclosed, is part of a push to prepare for a global roll-out of the pair\u2019s experimental vaccine, based on so-called messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.  The facility in Marburg will be converted to be fully on stream in the first half of 2021 with an annual production capacity up to 750 million doses of the inoculation.  BioNTech and Pfizer were previously aiming to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of this year and an additional 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.  Chief Financial Officer Sierk Poetting said the 2021 output volume target should be increased by several hundred million doses and a precise number would depend on the timing of the production launch and ramp-up speed.  The biotech firm said the facility, with its 300 staff that will join BioNTech, will be one of the largest mRNA manufacturing sites in Europe, alongside two of BioNTech\u2019s existing vaccine production sites.  Pfizer said it had at least four production sites in the United States and Europe.  BioNTech said the infrastructure and qualified staff would allow for a quick retooling to make its mRNA vaccine, but the new site would also support its main cancer drug development programme.","784":"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel\u2019s largest healthcare provider on Sunday reported a 94% drop in symptomatic COVID-19 infections among 600,000 people who received two doses of the Pfizer\u2019s vaccine in the country\u2019s biggest study to date.  Health maintenance organization (HMO) Clalit, which covers more than half of all Israelis, said the same group was also 92% less likely to develop severe illness from the virus.  The comparison was against a group of the same size, with matching medical histories, who had not received the vaccine.  \u201cIt shows unequivocally that Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine is extremely effective in the real world a week after the second dose, just as it was found to be in the clinical study,\u201d said Ran Balicer, Clalit\u2019s chief innovation officer.  He added that the data indicates the Pfizer vaccine, which was developed in partnership with Germany\u2019s BioNTech, is even more effective two weeks or more after the second shot.  Researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science, who have been tabulating national data, said on Sunday that a sharp decline in hospitalisation and serious illness identified earlier among the first age group to be vaccinated - aged 60 or older - was seen for the first time in those aged 55 and older.  Hospitalisations and serious illness were still rising in younger groups who began vaccinations weeks later.  Israel has been conducting a rapid vaccine rollout and its database offers insights into vaccine effectiveness and at what point countries might attain herd immunity.","785":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar was steady on Tuesday and the yen stayed near three-weeks lows, as investors remained optimistic about progress toward a COVID-19 vaccine and the currency markets digested Monday\u2019s big moves.  FILE PHOTO: A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS\/Thomas White\/Illustration  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N and German partner BioNTech SE BNTX.O said on Monday a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 - news which drove renewed appetite for risk that lifted global markets.  The dollar\u2019s rise on Monday of 0.5%, analysts said, was caused by investors quitting long positions in other major safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.  The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies, near its previous session\u2019s highs, as market participants declined to push it further in light of uncertainty about how or when a vaccine could be rolled out.  U.S. Treasury yields held their Monday increases, and the spread between two-year and 10-year notes widened slightly, in choppy trading. Major U.S. and European stock indexes at midday Eastern Time were also holding steady with most of their gains from Monday.  \u201cToday is a little bit of a cool-off from what we\u2019ve seen in this past couple of days,\u201d said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. \u201cI don\u2019t mind a little bit of a breather. November has been very, very interesting.\u201d  Neil Jones, head of FX sales for financial institutions at Mizuho, said he expected the risk-on moves to hold.  \u201cWe need more clarity in terms of the distribution, quantities, timeline, and to whom,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOn balance, that optimism will remain for now.\u201d  The dollar had lost around 1.4% this month until Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the U.S. presidential election became apparent over the weekend.  The Japanese yen, which had its biggest one-day fall since March after the vaccine announcement, was little changed Tuesday at 105.28 JPY=D3 yen to the dollar. The yen had initially clawed back some of its losses from the day before.  The Swiss franc CHF=EBS gained marginally, with the dollar rising 0.1% to 0.914 franc after Monday's 1.5% gain.  \u201cFollowing a euphoric market reaction such as that, the question that now arises is whether it was justified or possibly exaggerated,\u201d wrote Commerzbank FX and EM analyst You-Na Park-Heger in a note to clients.  Possible catalysts for future changes in exchange rates include new talks in Washington on another round of government spending to stimulate the economy, said Trang of Silicon Valley Bank.  \u201cThat\u2019s the next topic that most people will be focusing on in the next six months,\u201d he said.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday afternoon that he did not see a need for a giant coronavirus relief bill. \u201cIt seems to me that snag that hung us up for months is still there,\u201d the Republican told reporters.  Euro-dollar was broadly flat at $1.1823. In the previous session, it rose to as high as $1.192, but went no further, which Mizuho's Jones said could be due to the European Central Bank having signaled its awareness of the downsides of rapid euro strength EUR=EBS.

Pfizer said in November final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine showed it was 95% effective.  Below are the main details of the vaccine, progress on supply deals and potential approvals:  TYPE  - The vaccine, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the new coronavirus, thereby creating immunity.  - mRNA relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines.  - The new technology has not been approved for any other vaccines so far; Pfizer and BioNTech have already collaborated to develop influenza vaccines based on mRNA.  - The vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below  DOSAGE AND EXPECTED COST  - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course.  - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay.  PROTECTION DURATION  - BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin has said he is optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year. Scientists do not know how long the effect will last.  PENDING APPROVALS  - India is accelerating its review of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine to for emergency use, a senior official said on Dec.7.  - Canadian health authorities could approve the vaccine within the next week, medical officials indicated on Dec. 3.  - The European Medicines Agency said on Dec. 1 that if its experts have received enough data from Pfizer about the vaccine, the agency will complete its reviews by Dec. 29.  - Pfizer and BioNTech submitted approval requests for their vaccine candidates to the European drugs regulator on Dec. 1.  - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a \u2018fast track\u2019 status in mid-July, and is expected to give more indications of its use this week.  - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and it ran clinical trials in April.  - Testing of the vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month.  TRIALS  - Trials are continuing globally in 154 locations, including in Germany, Japan, Brazil and in several locations within the United States in participants aged 12 years and older.

The U.S. drugmaker and German partner said if the vaccine proves to be safe and effective in trials, it could potentially be ready for wide U.S. distribution by the end of the year, shaving several years off the typical vaccine development timeline.  The vaccine, which uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, has the potential to be among the first vaccines against the virus that has infected more than 1 million people in the United States and killed some 68,000.  There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for the new coronavirus, though some drugs are being used on patients under an emergency use authorization.  The U.S. study is part of a broader global program already underway in Germany, where BioNTech is based. Dosing there began last month.  Moderna Inc is using similar technology for its vaccine being developed along with the U.S. government. Phase I testing of that vaccine candidate has also begun, with mid-stage trials planned in the current quarter.  Pfizer said last week it hopes to receive emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as October, and could distribute up to 20 million doses by the end of 2020, with an eye toward producing hundreds of millions of doses next year.  \u201cEven going from a few million to 20 million will allow you to protect the epicenters of the virus, and then drive out the virus from our society as we ramp up to hundreds of millions,\u201d Pfizer research chief Mikael Dolsten told Reuters in an interview.  Using synthetic mRNA technology can enable the vaccine to be developed and manufactured more quickly than traditional vaccines, the companies said.  Pfizer said last week it expects to make safety data on the vaccine available by late May.  The trial will initially aim to test different dosing regimens of four potential vaccine candidates on around 360 healthy volunteers divided into a younger cohort and a group of seniors.  The trial will expand to more subjects after researchers determine which compounds and dosing regimens are most effective, said Kirsten Lyke, a director at the University of Maryland\u2019s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, which is participating in the trial.  Doses have already been administered to some volunteers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine.  Pfizer plans to expand the trial to sites across the United States in early July, and may ultimately enroll more than 8,000 participants, a company spokeswoman said.  If successful, the U.S. clinical trial would be one of the fastest ever progressions of a vaccine from early stage studies to regulatory approval, compressing a development process that often takes as much as a decade to just over 9 months.  \u201cThis is the equivalent of doing phases one, two and three of a typical clinical trial but all compressed into the May through October time frame,\u201d Lyke said.  BioNTech is producing the vaccine for the trials in its European manufacturing facilities. Pfizer is investing in developing its own manufacturing capacity for the vaccine, and is preparing sites in Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri and Belgium to begin producing it.  Both companies will jointly commercialize the vaccine, if approved.","790":"FILE PHOTO: A nurse prepares to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at Guy's Hospital in London, Britain December 8, 2020.

The committee is expected to vote sometime after 3:10 p.m. ET (20:10 GMT) on whether the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE, has shown effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 and if its benefits outweigh the risks.  Documents prepared by the FDA ahead of the meeting did not point out any new safety or efficacy issues, raising hopes the vaccine will soon be authorized in the United States. It has already received regulatory green lights from the UK and Canada.  Pfizer has asked for broad authorization for use of its two-dose vaccine in people aged 16 to 85.  Much of the discussion so far has focused less on whether the vaccine should be authorized, and more on how its emergency use would affect the scientific integrity of the ongoing trial and the way other vaccines are studied in the future.  Once the vaccine is cleared, Pfizer has said it has an ethical responsibility to tell participants if the vaccine is available to them outside of the trial. It has asked the FDA to allow it to give the vaccine to volunteers who had been in the placebo group that request it.  The concern, expressed by both the FDA and members of the advisory panel, is that \u201cunblinding\u201d the trial will make it harder to continue collecting data on long-term safety and effectiveness, and would make it more challenging for companies still testing vaccines to conduct blinded trials, in which people do not know if they got the experimental vaccine or a placebo.  \u201cOnce you unblind, you can never go back. We can never collect those data that we need and people want unless you completely redo the whole study,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Poland, a virologist from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who has previously served two terms on the FDA advisory panel.  Dr. Steven Goodman of Stanford University School of Medicine said in a presentation to the panel that offering the vaccine to people who got a placebo could result in them \u201cjumping the line,\u201d by receiving the vaccine before they otherwise would under priorities recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Goodman recommended instead a blinded double crossover design, in which people in the trial who got a placebo would be offered the vaccine, and those who received the vaccine would be offered the placebo. With that approach, everybody eventually gets the vaccine without being tempted to leave the trial to get it elsewhere.  \u2018FDA IS THE GOLD STANDARD\u2019  The panel had yet to take up the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy, but is likely to discuss concerns raised after two vaccine recipients in Britain reported serious allergic reactions after getting their first shot.  The country\u2019s health regulator on Wednesday advised some people with a history of anaphylaxis, an overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system related to medicine or food, to avoid the getting the vaccine.  FDA Commissioner Steven Hahn, ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting, said the agency was carefully reviewing all the data on Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, including potential allergic reactions following the UK warning.  \u201cWe\u2019re working very closely with our UK partners to understand what went on with respect to those allergic reactions,\u201d Hahn said on the \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d program, adding that the vaccine\u2019s label would include details about who the vaccine was recommended for - and who should not get it - if it is ultimately approved.  \u201cFDA is the gold standard for regulatory approval or authorization of medical products,\u201d he added. \u201cIf our career scientists say that the vaccine is safe and effective, I have complete confidence in that decision, and I think the American people should as well.\u201d  The panel is expected to vote on its recommendations toward the end of the meeting, after presentations from the FDA, Pfizer, other public health officials and members of the general public. The FDA is expected to make its authorization decision within days of the meeting.  Pfizer and BioNTech last month said a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness from COVID-19, and detailed data released in the agency\u2019s documents showed the vaccine began showing some protection even before volunteers received a second dose.  The documents also disclosed data on safety including cases of Bell\u2019s palsy among volunteers in the placebo and vaccine groups, though it said the cases in the trial occurred at the same rate as in the general population. Other reactions included fever, fatigue and chills.","794":"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs\/2zpUAr4  * MSCI ex-Japan up 0.26%, Nikkei climbs about 1%  * Pfizer could have coronavirus vaccine ready by end-2020  * Pelosi optimistic of U.S. fiscal aid before Nov elections  * Currencies tread water, oil slightly higher  SYDNEY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Asian markets advanced toward a recent 2-1\/2-year peak on Monday powered by hopes of a U.S fiscal package and expectations of a coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year, though weaker-than-expected Chinese data capped gains.

An independent panel will conduct the first analysis when it reaches 32 infections.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Chief Executive Albert Bourla said after it has enough data for the analysis, it typically takes 5 to 7 days before the company can publicly release the data, meaning it is likely to happen after the election.  U.S. President Donald Trump had said a vaccine could be available before the Nov. 3 election, but in recent weeks his administration has emphasized that one will be ready this year.  Bourla has previously said the company could release data on whether or not the vaccine works as early as this month.  \u201cFor us, the election is an artificial milestone,\u201d Bourla said on a conference call for the company\u2019s earnings. \u201cThis is going to be not a Republican vaccine or a Democrat vaccine. It will be a vaccine for the citizens of the world.\u201d  Pfizer shares were flat at $37.92.  Pfizer hopes to be the first U.S. drugmaker to unveil successful data from a late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trial, ahead of rival Moderna Inc MRNA.O. Pfizer and BioNTech launched their phase 3 study in late July.  The data monitoring board is scheduled to make its first assessment of the vaccine\u2019s performance after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus.  Healthcare investor Brad Loncar said it was difficult to draw a positive or negative conclusion from the fact that the trial has not yet had its first interim analysis.  \u201cI think this means that the overall infection rate is a lot lower than Pfizer initially estimated,\u201d Loncar said.  Dr. David Boulware, professor of medicine at University of Minnesota, said the study\u2019s participants may be more adherent to social distancing guidelines than the general population.  \u201cWho the vaccine trials really need are the people who don\u2019t wear masks, who are going out to bars, who go to crowded events, who are singing in church choirs - those are the high risk people,\u201d he said.  Boulware said that a data monitoring board could still review the data relatively quickly - perhaps in less than a day - once the trial hits its first interim point.  As the pandemic crimps demand for certain Pfizer therapies and damages global economies, investors are keenly focused on seeing the late-stage study data of the vaccine candidate being developed with BioNTech.  The company also said that if the trial is successful, it still expects to file for emergency authorization of the vaccine candidate from U.S. regulators shortly after it has enough safety data in late November. It expects to have manufacturing data ready to submit to those regulators before then.  Pfizer reported quarterly earnings that beat estimates by one cent, helped by lower-than-expected costs. Sales fell 4.3% to $12.13 billion in the third quarter due to a sharp drop in revenue from its off-patent pain drug Lyrica, as well as a $500-million hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding items, Pfizer earned 72 cents per share, beating analysts estimates of 71 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","796":"FILE PHOTO: The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 1, 2016.

An overnight recovery is impossible, let alone overnight growth that exceeds pre-COVID levels.  \u201cThe rally that began in earnest as Biden became the presumed winner of the U.S. presidential election is now the strongest two-week rally during an election contest in history.  \u201cNow that a vaccine can stop COVID-19, the Fed is likely to stop its unlimited support doctrine and this will pull the rug from what\u2019s been supporting gains in equities.\u201d  PAUL CRAIG, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT QUILTER INVESTORS  \u201cThis vaccine is not a silver bullet.

This means the laggards of the past few months, the likes of hospitality and airlines, are up significantly, while the mega-cap tech stocks are flat.  \u201cIndeed, some winners of the pandemic are seeing underperformance now as demand for them is likely to be hit.

The analysis was conducted after 20 participants developed the virus and examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo. That is significantly lower than the 94 infections in the trial of the vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.  \u201cI assume there was political pressure after the press release from Pfizer and BioNTech earlier in the week to now draw level with their own data,\u201d said Bodo Plachter, deputy director of the Institute of Virology at the Mainz University. \u201cWhat is missing for now is an analysis of statistical significance.\u201d  To confirm the efficacy rate of its vaccine, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases.  The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has been backing Sputnik V\u2019s development, said the Russian trial would continue for six months.  Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute which developed the vaccine, said the interim results demonstrated that Sputnik V was effective and mass vaccinations would be rolled out in Russia in the coming weeks.  In later comments, aired by Rossiya-24 state TV channel, he said at least 1.5 million people in Russia were expected to receive the shot by the end of the year. He added that around 40,000 to 45,000 Russians had already been vaccinated.  European stocks and U.S. stock futures extended their gains slightly after Russia\u2019s announcement though the reaction was far more muted than after Pfizer\u2019s results.  China\u2019s Sinopharm, which is running large-scale late-stage clinical trials for two COVID-19 vaccine candidates, said on Wednesday that its data was better than expected, though it did not give further details.  \u2018NOT A COMPETITION\u2019  Successful vaccines are seen as a crucial to restoring daily life around the world by helping end the pandemic that has killed more than 1.26 million people, shuttered businesses and put millions out of work.  However, experts said knowledge about the Russian trial\u2019s design was sparse, making it hard to interpret the data.  Scientists have raised concerns about the speed at which Moscow has worked, giving the regulatory go-ahead for the shot and launching mass vaccinations before full trials to test its safety and efficacy had been completed.  \u201cThis is not a competition. We need all trials to be carried out to the highest possible standards and it is particularly important that the pre-set criteria for unblinding the trial data are adhered to avoid cherry picking the data,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh.  \u201cAnything less than this risks a public loss of trust in all vaccines, which would be a disaster.\u201d  The results are based on data from the first 16,000 trial participants to receive both shots of the two-dose vaccine.  \u201cWe are showing, based on the data, that we have a very effective vaccine,\u201d said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev, adding that it was the sort of news that the vaccine\u2019s developers would talk about one day with their grandchildren.  The so-called Phase III trial of the shot is taking place in 29 clinics across Moscow and will involve 40,000 volunteers in total, with a quarter receiving a placebo shot.  The chances of contracting COVID-19 were 92% lower among people vaccinated with Sputnik V than those who received the placebo, the RDIF said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  That\u2019s well above the 50% effectiveness threshold for COVID-19 vaccines set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The RDIF said data from the study would be published in a leading medical journal following a peer review. The results of the early-stage Russian trials were peer reviewed and published in September in The Lancet medical journal.  Experts said that as with the Pfizer results, it was not yet clear how long immunity would last after taking the Russian vaccine, nor how efficient it would be for different age groups.  \u201cWe certainly need longer-term observations to draw valid conclusions about efficacy and side effects. The same goes for Pfizer\u2019s and BioNTech\u2019s numbers,\u201d said Plachter in Mainz.  As Moscow seeks partners abroad to boost output, China's Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding 600211.SS announced a deal soon after the results to released to make, sell and test the shot in China.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  SPUTNIK V  The Russian drug is named Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race, a nod to the project\u2019s geopolitical importance for Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Russia registered the vaccine for public use in August, the first country to do so, ahead of the start of the large-scale trial in September.  So far, it has inoculated 10,000 members of the public considered at high risk of contracting COVID-19 such as doctors and teachers, outside of the trial.  The vaccine is designed to trigger a response from two shots administered 21 days apart, each based on different viral vectors that normally cause the common cold: human adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad26.  The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.  Russia is also testing a different vaccine, produced by the Vector Institute in Siberia, and is on the cusp of registering a third, Putin said on Tuesday, adding that all of the country\u2019s vaccines were effective.  RDIF said as of Nov. 11 no serious side effects had been reported during the Sputnik V Phase III trial.  Some volunteers had short-term minor adverse events such as pain at the injection site, flu-like syndrome including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache, it said.  In late October, the vaccination of new volunteers was temporarily paused due to high demand and a shortage of doses.  Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister said on Wednesday that the Vector Institute vaccine was expected to start post-registration trials on Nov. 15.  She also said that Russia would produce 500,000 doses of Sputnik V in November, lower than a previous forecast of 800,000 doses given by Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov.  Russia reported 19,851 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours and a record high of 432 deaths. At 1,836,960, its overall case tally is the fifth largest in the world, behind the United States, India, Brazil and France.","811":"June 22 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * PFIZER ANNOUNCES START OF FOUR PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS FOR INVESTIGATIONAL VACCINES  * PFIZER - INITIATION OF TWO STUDIES OF 20VPNC, EVALUATING A FOUR-DOSE SERIES IN INFANTS STARTING AT 2 MONTHS OF AGE  * PFIZER - INITIATION OF ONE STUDY OF RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS VACCINE CANDIDATE, RSVPREF  * PFIZER - INITIATION OF ONE STUDY OF PENTAVALENT MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE CANDIDATE, MENABCWY Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","812":"FRANKFURT\/ZURICH (Reuters) -BioNTech is testing the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with Pfizer against a highly infectious new strain of the coronavirus as it prepares to send 12.5 mln doses to EU countries by the end of year.  The European Union is gearing up for a vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale following regulatory approval for the shot on Monday.  The EU deliveries amount to more than half the 20 million doses expected to be available in the United States before the end of the year, BioNTech\u2019s chief business officer, Sean Marett, told a briefing.  With two shots administered three weeks apart, the supplies are enough to vaccinate 6.25 million people in the bloc.  Preparations for the roll-out come as the identification of a highly infectious new strain of the coronavirus in Britain causes chaos across the region, with countries shutting off travel ties with the United Kingdom and disrupting trade ahead of the Christmas holiday.  BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said the company is testing whether the vaccine is effective against the variant strain and expects results in the next two weeks.  \u201cThere is no reason to be concerned or worried until we get the data,\u201d he said.

Pfizer and BioNTech have said they expect to produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021. Executives at the German biotech company said it is looking for ways to boost output capacity to meet global demand as governments struggle to tame the pandemic that has killed about 1.7 million people globally and crushed economies worldwide.  BioNTech plans to start production in February at its new site in Marburg, Germany, Poetting said.  It has said previously the facility, which it bought in September, would eventually have an annual production capacity of up to 750 million doses.  \u201cWe are scouting every possibility to produce as many vaccines as possible in 2021 and then thereafter,\u201d said Poetting, adding that there was nothing specific to discuss yet.  While the approval by the European Union is a major step in tackling the virus, coming after similar moves by the United Kingdom and the United States, it will take time to inoculate the world.  Sahin estimated that 60-80% of the global population could be vaccinated by autumn next year, as vaccines by other drugmakers like Moderna also get rolled out.  \u201cThis is really important, because this winter we will not have an impact on the infection numbers, but we must have an impact so that the next winter will be the new normal,\u201d he said.","813":"SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand will first administer COVID-19 vaccines to quarantine personnel, front line health workers and airline staff, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said, as the government formally approved its use on Wednesday.

Authorities expect the Pfizer vaccine to arrive in the country by end-March but they had expressed concerns about export curbs.  Pressure has been mounting on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to start inoculations for the country\u2019s 5 million people soon even though New Zealand has virtually eliminated the virus.  With just under 2,000 confirmed cases and 25 deaths since the pandemic began, New Zealand largely escaped the high number of cases and deaths from the virus compared with many other developed countries thanks to border closures and lockdowns.  But the emergence of highly contagious variants abroad and more overseas residents returning home has raised concerns of the virus spreading in the community again.  Ardern\u2019s critics have said New Zealand has fallen behind the rest of the world after promising in November that it would be first in the queue for COVID-19 vaccines.  \u201cWhen the first batch of vaccine arrives, we will be ready to go,\u201d Hipkins said, adding information campaigns will begin next week.

Russia\u2019s vaccine diplomacy has developed goodwill in Latin America after other pharmaceutical companies including U.S.-based Pfizer Inc announced shortfalls in distribution plans.  Lopez Obrador held the call with Putin despite announcing on Sunday that he was himself infected with COVID-19 and was being treated for mild symptoms.  The Mexican leader added in a post on Twitter that he had invited the Russian head of state to visit Mexico.  Lopez Obrador and Putin also discussed training for Mexican medical specialists in Russia, according to a news release from the Russian government.  Mexico has warned about a lack of doctors to accommodate the country\u2019s high infection rate throughout the pandemic, particularly medical specialists. The country has among the lowest number of medical personnel relative to population among countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the government has said.

But with Monday\u2019s announcement, Sputnik V would be by far Mexico\u2019s most-used vaccine over that time, in part because Pfizer cut back on what it had originally committed to Mexico.  Mexico\u2019s health regulator has not yet approved Sputnik V, despite promising a quick process after a senior health official received clinical data during a visit to Argentina.  Argentina has spearheaded Sputnik V\u2019s arrival in Latin America, adopting the vaccine early and administering hundreds of thousands of doses since late last year.  Global vaccine bottlenecks have been exacerbated by many wealthier nations refusal to participate in COVAX, a global vaccine program co-led by the World Health Organization.  The global body seeks to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 doses worldwide this year, with at least 1.3 billion for poorer countries.  But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while richer countries have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves.","816":"(Adds Slovakia, Apollo Global Management, General Electric, SoftBank and Pfizer)  July 11 (Reuters) - The following bids, mergers, acquisitions and disposals were reported by 2000 GMT on Wednesday:  ** U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global has acquired a stake of more than $1 billion in Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group, a stock it considers \u201cmeaningfully undervalued\u201d, the Financial Times reported, citing a letter Tiger circulated to investors.  ** Bangladesh announced two major energy deals, with a total $5.8 billion investment, two involving U.S. firm General Electric.  ** Pfizer Inc announced plans to reorganize into three units, separating its consumer healthcare business that the U.S. drugmaker has been trying to sell since last year.  ** Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC has approached Nexstar Media Group Inc, an operator of television stations that reach nearly 40 percent of U.S. households, to express interest in acquiring it, according to people familiar with the matter.  ** Slovakia has agreed a $1.9 billion deal to buy 14 U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to replace its ageing Russian-made MiG-29s, its defence ministry said.  ** Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox has raised its offer for Britain\u2019s Sky in an agreed deal valuing the pay-TV group at $32.5 billion, seeing off rival bidder Comcast for now.  ** Juneyao Airlines and its parent are investing $1.9 billion for a stake of around 5 percent in state-owned China Eastern Airlines, saying the investment is in line with Chinese policy and will boost Juneyao\u2019s brand abroad.  ** Property manager Scentre Group said it bought a 50 percent stake in a Sydney shopping centre for A$720 million ($533.23 million).  ** Britain\u2019s insurer Aviva Plc said it had exited Spain with the completion of the sale of its stakes in joint ventures Cajamurcia Vida and Caja Granada Vida to Spanish state-owned lender Bankia SA for 203 million euros ($238 million).  ** French state-controlled power group EDF said it was considering its options regarding Britain\u2019s nuclear plants, adding that it wanted to keep a majority stake.  ** Kazakhstan\u2019s antitrust committee said it would allow Kazakhtelecom to buy a 75 percent stake in Kcell ,, the Central Asian nation\u2019s biggest mobile operator.  ** Engineering group Andritz said it agreed to take over 70 percent in Italian machine manufacturer Diatec S.R.L, bolstering its non-woven division.  ** Thyssenkrupp\u2019s supervisory board chairman lashed out at activist investors in an interview following the resignation of Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger last week, saying a breakup of the conglomerate was out of the question.  ** Italian biggest utility Enel is pulling out of a race to buy Terra Firma\u2019s solar power assets in Italy, leaving infrastructure fund F2i to bid alone, two sources close to the matter told Reuters.  ** German postal services group Deutsche Post has hired Goldman Sachs to evaluate options for its electric van business StreetScooter as it seeks to expand the unit and tap an expected surge in demand, people close to the matter said.  ** The owners of Ma\u2019arif for Education & Training, the largest owner and operator of private schools in Saudi Arabia, are in talks about selling the business, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.  ** Israel\u2019s government said it plans to sell its remaining 5.8 percent of Bank Leumi, the country\u2019s second largest lender, within 12 months of approval from lawmakers.  ** Serbia\u2019s RTB Bor copper miner and smelter has drawn interest from 11 companies and the tender could take place this week or next, Belgrade daily Politika reported.  ** Upmarket department store Galeries Lafayette said it will sell Boulanger household appliances and multimedia products in its stores, the latest alliance among brick-and-mortar retailers to compete with online giants like Amazon.

Still, up 3 basis points this week, German 10-year yields were on track for their biggest weekly rise since Pfizer announced three weeks ago that its vaccine was highly effective against coronavirus. Bets that the vaccine would prove key in helping the global economy had pushed safe-haven 10-year Bunds after Pfizer\u2019s announcement to their worst session since March.  Other overnight headlines are also likely to have contributed to Friday\u2019s mixed market sentiment.  The Wall Street Journal reporting challenges in Pfizer\u2019s supply chain for its COVID-19 vaccine played a role in its decision to slash its 2020 production target, which pushed the S&P 500 lower on Thursday.

That opens the door for its early use in hard to reach places that might not be appropriate for Pfizer Inc\u2019s vaccine which needs ultra-cold storage.  Here are details of how it could be distributed.  HOW COLD IS COLD STORAGE?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine is stable for up to six months at a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), about home freezer levels, when shipped and stored.  The company said it expects the vaccine to be stable when kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days, up from an initial projection of 7 days. The vaccine will be distributed in 10-dose vials and can be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours after thawing.  By comparison, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine can be transported and stored for up to 6 months at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F). It can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to five days.  WHEN WILL IT BE SHIPPED, TO WHOM?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine will be distributed by the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program. U.S. health officials have said that at first they are most likely to distribute vaccines to healthcare workers, people who are in nursing homes, first responders and those with health conditions who are high-risk.  Most Americans will be inoculated in May or June, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert.  Under Operation Warp Speed\u2019s distribution plan, the first group of shots will likely be distributed to and administered in closed settings, like hospitals and nursing homes.  After January, as supply increases, those shots will start to be available in pharmacies, doctors offices and clinics as well as mobile clinics, the plan shows.  Health officials have said it will be easier to use Moderna\u2019s vaccine in these settings than Pfizer\u2019s.  HOW WELL DOES THE MODERNA VACCINE WORK?  Moderna on Monday said its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 based on early results from large studies. That is similar to Pfizer\u2019s which the U.S. drugmaker has said is more than 90% effective.  Moderna data also showed the vaccine was capable of helping prevent severe cases of COVID-19, and it represented volunteers from diverse communities.","827":"ZURICH\/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Breakthrough technology that transforms the body into a virus-zapping vaccine factory is poised to revolutionise the fight against COVID-19 but future pandemics and even cancer could be next, scientists say. The initial success of so-called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines in late-stage trials by Moderna as well as Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech is the first proof the concept works.  FILE PHOTO: The word \"COVID-19\" is reflected in a drop on a syringe needle in this illustration taken November 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Both experimental vaccines had efficacy rates above 90% based on interim findings, which was far higher than expected and well above the 50% threshold U.S. regulators insist upon for vaccines.  Now scientists say the technology, a slow-motion revolution in the making since the discovery of mRNA nearly 60 years ago, could speed up the development of new vaccines.  The traditional method of creating vaccines \u2013 introducing a weakened or dead virus, or a piece of one, to stimulate the body\u2019s immune system \u2013 takes over a decade on average, according to a 2013 study. One pandemic flu vaccine took over eight years while a hepatitis B vaccine was nearly 18 years in the making.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine went from gene sequencing to the first human injection in 63 days.  With BioNTech and Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 candidate on a similar trajectory, both could win regulatory approval this year, barely 12 months since the coronavirus first emerged.  Other companies are pursuing the technology such as Germany\u2019s CureVac also has an mRNA vaccine candidate, though has yet to start a late-stage trial and is hoping it will get the green light after July 2021. \u201cWe\u2019ll look back on the advances made in 2020 and say: \u2018That was a moment when science really did make a leap forward\u2019,\u201d said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, which is backed by the Wellcome Trust.  THE LAST LAUGH  Discovered in 1961, mRNA carries messages from the body\u2019s DNA to its cells, telling them to make the proteins needed for critical functions, such as coordinating biological processes like digestion or fighting disease.  The experimental vaccines from Moderna as well as Pfizer and BioNTech use lab-made mRNA to instruct cells to make the coronavirus\u2019s spike proteins, which spur the immune system into action without replicating like the actual virus.Back in 1990, scientists managed to get mice to generate proteins by injecting mRNA, an early sign of the technology\u2019s potential.  But early proponents such as Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian-born scientist and senior vice president at BioNTech, were hampered by obstacles such as mRNA\u2019s instability in the body and its propensity to cause inflammatory responses.  A breakthrough came around 2005 when Kariko, along with colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania, figured out how to deliver mRNA without kicking the immune system into overdrive.  Still, it took another 15 years - and a pandemic that brought the world\u2019s economy to its knees - to reach the cusp of success. Kariko said her years of dogged pursuit once made her the butt of jokes for some university colleagues.  \u201cThe last time they laughed at me and ridiculed me was when they learned that I was going to join BioNTech seven years ago and they realised this company (didn\u2019t) even have a website,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cBut now, they learn of BioNTech and that we can do good things.\u201d  Kariko said her life\u2019s work could pay dividends, not just against COVID-19, but other diseases.  \u201cIt could be easier sailing for the next anti-viral product, a vaccine for influenza and other infectious disease,\u201d said Kariko, whose daughter is a U.S. Olympic gold medalist rower.  CANCER NEXT?  Moderna and BioNTech, for example, are also applying mRNA technology to experimental cancer medicines.  Biontech is testing an anti-melanoma mRNA with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche in a Phase II trial.  Among Moderna\u2019s most advanced projects, besides its COVID-19 vaccine, are mRNA compounds to treat ovarian cancer or Myocardial ischemia, which are also in the second test phase.  None of the potential mRNA cancer therapies have reached the critical large-scale Phase III trials, however, and Kariko acknowledges that cancer presents a bigger challenge.  While a virus is a foreign intruder, cancer cells, however malignant, come from within the body, making them tougher to seek out and expose so they can be attacked.  \u201cSometimes cancer is just caused by gene and chromosome duplication and then everything about it looks normal and the cell is just dividing more than it should,\u201d she said.  For vaccines against infectious diseases, the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s traditional approach has been to whip them up in large bioreactors, a time-consuming, expensive process in facilities that can cost up to $700 million to build.  By contrast, Zoltan Kis, an Imperial College London researcher who models vaccine manufacturing, estimates that one five-litre bioreactor inside a $20 million facility could make a billion doses of some kinds of mRNA vaccines a year.  Drug manufacturer Lonza, enlisted to make ingredients for 400 million doses of Moderna\u2019s vaccine annually at U.S. and Swiss sites, is due to start production this year with manufacturing lines costing $60 million to $70 million each.  \u201cWe are producing mRNA at smaller scales and in smaller facilities when compared to traditional larger-scale equipment and facilities,\u201d Andre Goerke, Lonza\u2019s global lead for the Moderna project, told Reuters. \u201cThe manufacturing ramp-up is quicker and more economical.\u201d  \u2018ULTRA-FAST RESPONSE\u2019  Raymond Schiffelers, of University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, who heads a European Union programme for mRNA therapeutics, said the major advantage of the technology was that vaccine developers could mount an \u201cultra-fast response\u201d.  \u201cWithin weeks, testing can start, a major advantage over conventional vaccines,\u201d he said.  The moment a pathogen\u2019s genomic sequence is known, synthetic mRNAs can be designed that encode key parts of the virus, such as the coronavirus\u2019s potentially lethal spike protein.  Risks and challenges for mRNA remain.  Some candidates must be stored at extremely cold temperatures, making delivery potentially difficult in countries with limited infrastructure. They also may be fragile to transport, Schiffelers said.  BioNTech\u2019s vaccine, for example, must be transported at minus 70 degrees Celsius, though Moderna said on Monday it can ship its candidate in normal refrigerators.  Francis Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), which funded Moderna\u2019s vaccine development, also said mRNA vaccines may not be a silver bullet for flu, since it mutates so swiftly that reaching 90% efficacy is unlikely.  But for COVID-19, Collins said mRNA is likely to be a revolution.  \u201cIt\u2019s clearly several months faster than any of the other methods,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIn a crisis moment, several months really matter.\u201d","828":"FILE PHOTO: A vial and sryinge are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer and Biontech logo in this illustration taken January 11, 2021.

The Pfizer vaccine is produced in Belgium and the European Commission said on Friday it had agreed a plan to control exports of vaccines from the European Union, including to Britain, arguing it needed to do so to ensure its own supplies.  Malaysia\u2019s science minister, Khairy Jamaluddin, said Belgian ambassador Pascal Gregoire gave his assurance that the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s advanced purchase agreement with Pfizer will be fulfilled, upon Pfizer applying for export authorisation.  \u201cWith the assurances of both the EU and Belgian Ambassadors, the COVID-19 immunisation plan is expected to proceed according to plan,\u201d Khairy said in a statement.

A worker passes a line of freezers holding coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine candidate BNT162b2 at a Pfizer facility in Puurs, Belgium in an undated photograph. Pfizer\/Handout via REUTERS  The push reveals a lack of infrastructure to support a super cold vaccine campaign, including equipment to store millions of doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94\u00b0F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46\u00b0F).  Some specialty freezer makers warn of months-long waits for units.  It also marks widespread wariness of the advice from the CDC, which on Aug. 26 urged healthcare providers not to purchase ultra low temperature (ULT) freezers, saying it was working on solutions for Pfizer\u2019s \u201cvery complex storage and handling requirements.\u201d  A CDC spokeswoman on Thursday said the agency expects the first vaccine doses will be in limited quantities and rapidly deployed, reducing the need to store them in specialized freezers.  But the news on Monday that initial results from a pivotal trial of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech 22UAy.F showed it to be more than 90% effective has turned attention to eventual shipping and storage logistics.  That has thrown a spotlight on makers of the niche freezers, including Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N, Luxembourg's B Medical Systems, Helmer Scientific and Stirling Ultracold, who are adding labor and expanding capacity.  \u201cI would estimate that a third of states are purchasing ultra cold storage equipment,\u201d said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit representing state and local public health officials who handle vaccines.  The specialized freezers required by Pfizer\u2019s vaccine can cost $5,000 to $15,000.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Moderna Inc MRNA.O is close to releasing efficacy results for its similar vaccine, which requires an easier to accommodate storage temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4\u00b0F).  At least half a dozen states, including California, Rhode Island and New Mexico, said in published comments to the CDC that they expect to face challenges due to limited supplies of ULT freezers. A similar number told Reuters or said in public filings that they are purchasing units in anticipation of the vaccine rollout.  Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear on Thursday called for federal funding for cold storage and said he hopes other vaccines with less onerous storage requirements get approved.  ON BACK ORDER  Earlier this year, due to lack of a coordinated federal response to the pandemic, states were forced to compete against each other for everything from protective N95 masks for healthcare workers to ventilators and testing equipment.  While demand for ULT freezers is climbing, it has not entered the early pandemic\u2019s ventilator panic phase where \u201cwe had lead times of 18 months,\u201d said Rebecca Gayden, who oversees sourcing of freezers and other capital equipment at Vizient, a purchasing group used by more than 5,000 not-for-profit health systems and affiliates.  Northwell Health, New York state\u2019s largest hospital system, said it has leased around 20 ultra cold freezers for the Pfizer vaccine, and that manufacturers now had waiting lists.  Thermo Fisher said it built up inventory ahead of demand, and is unaffected by capacity crunches.  Some smaller manufacturers, however, acknowledged issues due to the surge in demand. Indiana-based Helmer Scientific said production of new orders has pushed into next year.  Ohio's Stirling Ultracold, which sold a 6,000-dose portable, cooler-sized ULT to North Dakota as well as large freezers for United Parcel Service Inc's UPS.N freezer farms, said delivery waits could now extend up to two months.  George Gerhardt, emergency preparedness program representative for North Dakota, where the virus is now running rampant, said his state started shopping for freezers this summer. \u201cIf we wait till the last day, everybody\u2019s going to want one,\u201d Gerhardt said at the time, before purchasing 10 ULT units.  The Wyoming Department of Health was not so lucky. Its ULT freezer is on \u201cback order\u201d until late December, said public information officer Kim Deti.  Cities and states are searching university labs, hospitals and other facilities for available ULT freezer space.  Philadelphia is spending about $19,000 on two B Medical freezers scheduled to be installed later this month, and is working with local healthcare systems to secure additional capacity.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccine could get regulatory approval within weeks with distribution to begin almost immediately.  It will be transported in dry ice-filled, suitcase-sized containers that can only be opened twice a day and last a maximum of two weeks. Dry ice has also been offered as a potential solution for nations without access to ULT storage in vaccination centers.  \u201cWaste is a major concern,\u201d said Soumi Saha, vice president of advocacy at Premier Inc, which coordinates purchases for thousands of U.S. hospitals and health systems. \u201cDo you turn a patient away because you can\u2019t open it a third time that day?\u201d","832":"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission is in talks with Pfizer and BioNTech on ordering more doses of their COVID-19 vaccine, a spokesman said on Monday, as Germany said it had secured additional shots for itself last September.

A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on whether new talks were under way with the EU.  BioNTech was not immediately available for comment. It told Reuters on Jan. 1 that it was in talks with Brussels on boosting production for Europe.  GERMAN DEAL  The EU\u2019s attempts at securing more doses of the only COVID-19 vaccine it has authorised come amid concern in some capitals that a separate German order for the same shot might compete with broader supplies for the 27-country bloc.  Germany said on Monday that it had agreed with BioNTech last September to supply an additional 30 million doses on a bilateral basis. This was a memorandum of understanding, of which the EU was aware, the Health Ministry said.  That month, Germany announced 375 million euros ($460 million) of funding for BioNTech, a biotech startup based in Mainz, to help speed research and expand production capacity in Germany.  Health Minister Jens Spahn has said national deals were possible with the same vaccine makers once the EU has concluded its own contract and as long as supplies to EU countries were not disrupted.  The bilateral German deal predates by two months the EU contract for the BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine that was signed in November after talks that had been going on at least since July.  A spokesman for the EU Commission said he had no information on Germany\u2019s bilateral deal with BioNTech and declined to comment on whether it was in breach of EU agreements.  He said, however, that EU countries had made a political commitment to avoid parallel negotiations with the same pharmaceutical companies to secure COVID-19 vaccines. This was meant to avoid competition among EU states.  The EU has so far signed six supply deals with vaccine makers which envisage distribution of doses on a pro-rata basis to the 27 member states based on their populations.

The world cheered on Monday when Pfizer Inc announced its shot, jointly developed with BioNTech SE, was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results.  Yet health experts cautioned that the vaccine, should it be approved, was no silver bullet - not least because the genetic material it\u2019s made from needs to be stored at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below.  Such requirements pose a particularly daunting challenge for countries in Asia, as well as in places like Africa and Latin America, where intense heat is often compounded by poor infrastructure that will make it difficult to keep the \u201ccold chain\u201d intact during deliveries to rural areas and islands.  That is a problem for everyone in the world, given the World Health Organization estimates about 70% of people must be inoculated to end the pandemic, and Asia alone is home to more than 4.6 billion - or three-fifths of the global population.  Some Asian countries are prioritising containing the novel coronavirus rather than looking to stockpile vaccines, while others are looking for alternatives to the messenger RNA technology used by Pfizer that requires such ultra-cold storage.  \u201cOn the cold chain requirement of -70 degrees, that is a hefty requirement.

It has signed a deal for 120 million doses, while Australia has secured 10 million doses and China\u2019s Fosun has secured 10 million doses for Hong Kong and Macau.  Japan\u2019s PHC Corp, which supplies medical freezers, told Reuters that demand had shot up 150% this year and that they were increasing production to meet demand.  Kwon Jun-wook, an official at South Korea\u2019s Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), said it wanted to see how vaccination progressed in other countries first and would thoroughly review its supply chain.  The country had recently experienced the problems of cold storage when it had to discard about 5 million doses of flu vaccines because they were not stored at recommended temperatures.  A 2018 study commissioned by the agency found that only a quarter of 2,200 private clinics it surveyed had medical refrigerators, with 40% using household refrigerators.

The UAE\u2019s Ministry of Health and Prevention registered the Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine for emergency use on the request of Pfizer, state news agency WAM reported, citing the ministry.  The UAE was the first country outside China to roll out the Chinese vaccine to the public, saying earlier this month it had 86% efficacy, citing an interim analysis of late-stage clinical trials.  China has included two candidate vaccines from Sinopharm and one from Sinovac Biotech Ltd in an emergency-use programme launched in July, targeting specific high-infection risk groups such as medical workers and border inspectors.  Dubai\u2019s Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management said on Twitter late Tuesday an \u201cextensive vaccination campaign\u201d against COVID-19 would kick off on Wednesday using Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) lost an appeal in May in a case alleging that Pfizer had abused its market power by offering big discounts and rebates on Lipitor to pharmacies, which bought large quantities of the drug and agreed to limit re-supply of competing generic atorvastatin products.  The commission said while the full Federal Court last month found that Pfizer had taken advantage of its market power, the court rejected the commission\u2019s view that Pfizer had done so in order to lessen competition.  So the ACCC has decided to appeal to the High Court of Australia.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  A vaccine is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.2 million people worldwide, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.  There are more than 200 candidates under development and the vaccine being developed by Oxford and licensed to British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L is seen as a front-runner.  \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we could reach that point before the end of this year,\u201d Oxford Vaccine Trial Chief Investigator Andrew Pollard said of the chances of presenting trial results.  Pollard told British lawmakers that establishing whether or not the vaccine worked would likely come this year, after which the data would have to be carefully reviewed by regulators and then a political decision made on who should receive it.  \u201cOur bit - we are getting closer to but we are not there yet,\u201d Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was the prospect of a vaccine in the first quarter of 2021. AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday.  \u2018GAME CHANGER\u2019  Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.  The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.  If Oxford\u2019s vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality.  Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: \u201cGood is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.  \u201cIt\u2019s a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,\u201d he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system.  But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The EU hopes to sign a contract soon for millions of doses of the vaccine, the European Commission announced on Monday, hours after the two companies said it had proved more than 90% effective, in what could be a major victory in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of American pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer Inc., is pictured in Toluca, Mexico October 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido\/File Photo  The Supreme Court decision is a blow for the U.S. drugmaker -- which had sought to affirm a secondary medical use patent for the product -- and a win for generic drug companies Actavis, now renamed Allergan, and Mylan.  Lyrica, known generically as pregabalin, was originally developed for epilepsy but further research showed it could also help patients suffering from neuropathic pain, which soon became its main market.  In a bid to protect this lucrative section of the market, Pfizer secured a secondary patent, valid beyond the life of the original one.  The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the secondary patent claims relevant to neuropathic pain were invalid.  For Pfizer, the legal fight had become a point of principle, following years of battles in lower courts, since its key secondary pain patent has now expired in Europe.  But the decision could leave it open to financial claims if Britain\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) tries to recover over-payments from using Pfizer\u2019s more expensive branded Lyrica, rather cheap generics.  \u201cThis is an enormous blow to Pfizer. They face claims running potentially into hundreds of millions of pounds if the NHS seeks to recover the excess costs,\u201d said Darren Smyth, partner at law firm EIP.  An NHS England spokesperson said: \u201cClinical commissioning groups and the NHS nationally have been tracking this legal case and will be deciding on the right next steps on behalf of patients and taxpayers.\u201d  U.S. GENERICS IN 2019  Pfizer had no specific comment on the possibility of NHS claims but said it was disappointed by the ruling and the decision would have a significant impact on incentives for innovation in public health.  \u201cThe period that a medicine is under patent is a critical phase in its lifecycle that fuels innovation -- as science evolves and knowledge grows, patients increasingly benefit from ongoing research into new uses for existing medicines,\u201d the company said.  \u201cAs situations such as these are expected to become more common, it\u2019s important for patients that pharmaceutical companies are able to protect patents, including second medical use patents.\u201d  The expiry of the basic patent on Lyrica five years ago had allowed generic drugmakers to launch cut-price versions of Pfizer\u2019s medicine, which carried a \u201cskinny label\u201d limiting their use to epilepsy and general anxiety disorder.  Pfizer sued, arguing it was inevitable that the copycat versions would be dispensed for pain as well as other conditions.  The U.S. group took the case to the Supreme Court after a appeal in the case was rejected in 2016. Since then Pfizer\u2019s secondary neuropathic pain patent in Britain has also expired, in July 2017.  In the United States, by contrast, Pfizer is only expecting generic competition to Lyrica in 2019.","848":"May 9 (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s competition regulator said on Thursday it will not oppose GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s deal to buy Pfizer\u2019s consumer healthcare business.

Canada is struggling to contain a second wave of the novel coronavirus. On Friday, the health ministry said there could be a spike of more than 100,000 new cases in just the next nine days. That means almost 12,000 new cases per day, compared with the 7,565 new cases reported on Thursday.  The spike in cases is being driven mainly by the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, health officials said, both of which have imposed health restrictions in recent weeks to try to slow the spread.","858":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured outside Pfizer Headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., July 22, 2020.

REUTERS\/Luke MacGregor  Under Read, a Scot who joined the company in 1978, Pfizer has weathered patent expirations of several blockbusters, including cholesterol drug Lipitor, through dealmaking, expansion in emerging markets and cost cuts.  Pfizer won 30 approvals from the U.S. health regulator during his tenure. Read, however, failed to pull off two mega deals - acquisition of British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L in 2014 and Botox maker Allergan Plc AGN.N in 2016 - that would have helped lower its corporate taxes.  Bourla, 56, was promoted to the newly created post of chief operating officer at the start of this year and was widely seen as the leading candidate for the top job.  Before becoming COO, he led the drugmaker\u2019s Innovative Health business, which holds its newer, patent-protected medicines, since the start of 2016. The unit recorded an 8 percent rise in revenue in 2017 to $31.4 billion.  \u201cNow is the right time for a leadership change and Albert is the right person to guide Pfizer through the coming era,\u201d Read, who will become executive chairman, said.

The stock had earlier touched 17-year high of $44.51.  \u201cThis looks like a well-considered transition, thus I\u2019m not convinced it will herald a major change in strategic thinking, particularly as Ian will still stay on as chairman,\u201d Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell said.  The leadership change comes at a time when the Trump administration has been pressuring drugmakers to lower prescription costs. Read, after a conversation with President Trump in July, had decided to defer price increases for no more than six months.  Pfizer, which has been trying to sell its consumer healthcare business for the past one year, is bracing for patent expiration of its neurological disease treatment Lyrica, which raked in $1.2 billion in second-quarter sales.

Below are the main details of the vaccine and progress on supply deals and potential approvals:  TYPE  - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which uses a chemical messenger to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the new coronavirus, thereby creating immunity.  - mRNA relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines.  - The new technology has not been approved for any vaccines so far; Pfizer and BioNTech have already collaborated to develop influenza vaccines based on mRNA.  DOSAGE AND EXPECTED COST  - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment.  - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay.  PROTECTION DURATION  - BioNTech Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunization effect of the vaccine would last for a year. Scientists do not know how long the effect will last.  DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE  - The European Medicines Agency said on Tuesday that if its experts have received enough data from Pfizer about the candidate vaccine against the coronavirus, the agency would complete its reviews by Dec. 29.  - Canada could approve Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u201caround December\u201d, a senior official at Canada\u2019s drug regulator said on Thursday.  - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a \u2018fast track\u2019 status in mid-July.  - The European Medicines Agency said in November Pfizer and BioNTech had submitted data from large-scale trial of their potential COVID-19 vaccine for the agency\u2019s rolling review, but had not yet applied for approval.  - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and it ran clinical trials in April.  - Testing of the vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month.

The Commission said last week it could approve vaccines within three days of approval by the EMA.  Britain and the United States are among countries which have already approved the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  The EMA usually takes at least seven months to issue a recommendation on vaccines after it receives full data from manufacturers, while the Commission can take as long as two months to authorise a vaccine after EMA approval.  If the EMA approves the vaccine on Monday, it will have taken just 20 days to assess the shot since it received data from large-clinical trials from Pfizer on Dec. 1.  The approval would be a conditional authorisation, meaning the vaccine would continue to be strictly monitored for efficacy and possible side-effects.  Available data show that in the short term the vaccine is highly effective against the new coronavirus and causes only mild side-effects.

FILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the European Commission headquarters, ahead of an EU leaders summit at the European Council headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium July 16, 2020. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  The bloc is in talks with at least six vaccine makers to acquire up front doses of potential shots against the novel coronavirus, officials told Reuters earlier in July, in a strategy meant to increase the chances of having COVID-19 vaccines for its population.  Despite the urgency to seal deals amid a global race to secure the most promising shots, the EU is struggling to reach swift agreements, said the officials, who are involved in the talks, and declined to be named because the negotiations are confidential.  The United States, meanwhile, has already inked two supply agreements with AstraZeneca AZN.L and Pfizer among other major funding deals.  The EU\u2019s negotiations with Johnson & Johnson are among the most advanced but have yet to conclude amid a back-and-forth over how to share liability costs if the potential vaccine showed unexpected side-effects, two of the officials told Reuters.  Johnson & Johnson had no immediate comment.  France's Sanofi is negotiating to supply 300 million doses of the potential vaccine it is developing with British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc GSK.L to the EU and wants an immediate upfront payment for the entire stock, two officials said.  But the EU wants to pay in tranches and delay some payments until the vaccine has passed large clinical trials, the officials said.  This has caused \u201csome hurdles,\u201d one of the officials said.  A spokesman for Sanofi declined to comment.  A spokesman for the Commission, which is leading EU talks with drugmakers, declined to comment.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Aside from the Pfizer, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson discussions, the EU is also in talks with biotech companies Moderna MRNA.O and Germany's CureVac, officials told Reuters earlier in July.  Moderna and CureVac were not immediately available to comment.  A deal with AstraZeneca AZN.L for its vaccine under development with Oxford University was struck by four large EU countries in June and is now about to be completed for the whole 27-nation bloc, officials said.  One official said the EU was seeking to seal three or four advance purchase deals.  \u201cOVER BUDGET\u201d  The most complex talks appear to be with Pfizer and BioNtech which are developing a vaccine using an experimental technology known as messenger RNA, or mRNA, which has not been approved for commercial use by medical authorities.  The two firms want the EU to pay them for 500 million doses only if their COVID-19 vaccine is authorised, one official told Reuters.  This might eliminate the EU\u2019s risk of losing money should the shot prove unsuccessful. But the bloc fears that if it waits for the vaccine to be proved effective, the bill could be much higher and they risk going \u201cover budget,\u201d one of the officials said.  In a further potential complication, some EU negotiators have raised doubts about mRNA, which is also used in the potential COVID vaccines developed by Moderna and CureVac.  Pfizer and BioNtech are also discussing liability issues with EU negotiators, a fourth person familiar with the talks told Reuters.  Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment.  The U.S. government last week agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of the vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to inoculate 50 million people, but with payments conditional on their vaccine being successful in large clinical trials.  The price agreed under that deal of nearly $40 per course of treatment is considered too high by the EU, officials told Reuters last week.  The EU is relying on about 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) from an emergency fund to finance its possible deals with vaccine makers, which could be topped up with payments from EU governments.  For instance, the agreement with AstraZeneca initially negotiated by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands cost the four countries 750 million euros for 300 million doses of the potential shot, an Italian official said, with an option to buy a further 100 million doses.  That works out at 2.5 euros per dose.  It is not clear whether under ongoing talks that money will now be provided by the EU emergency fund.

Reuters has recently debunked other claims about the first person to receive the vaccine in the UK (here) and the vaccine itself ( here , here , here ).  DEATHS  Six participants did die during the 44,000 person Pfizer vaccine trial, two of whom were given the vaccine while the other four people received a placebo (here).  Details of the deaths are laid out in FDA briefing documents ( here and here ), ahead of a Thursday meeting of outside experts to the FDA who will discuss whether to recommend the Pfizer shot for people aged 16 and older.  One of the vaccine recipients had a cardiac arrest 62 days after a second dose of the two-dose vaccination and died three days later. The other died from arteriosclerosis three days after a first dose of the vaccination. One of the placebo recipients died from myocardial infarction, another from haemorrhagic stroke and two others from unknown causes.  The FDA briefings clarify that the deaths were not deemed to be related to the vaccine: \u201cNone of these deaths were assessed by the investigator as related to study intervention\u201d. They explain: \u201cAll deaths represent events that occur in the general population of the age groups where they occurred, at a similar rate.\u201d  The social media post claims that Pfizer used a \u201cdeadly placebo\u201d in order to manipulate data. Pfizer documents show that the placebo (here) is a normal saline, specifically a 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection, which means it is simply a mixture of salt and water.  BELL\u2019S PALSY  The FDA briefing documents also show that it is true that there were four cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy among those who received the vaccine (here). Bell\u2019s Palsy is a sudden weakness or freezing of muscles on one side of the face, which in most cases is temporary ( here , here ).  The briefing says that the frequency of Bell\u2019s Palsy in the vaccine group is \u201cconsistent with the expected background rate in the general population\u201d, adding there is \u201cno clear basis upon which to conclude a causal relationship at this time\u201d.

ALLERGIC REACTIONS  Britain\u2019s medicine regulator, The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has said that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis in reaction to a medicine or food, or with a history of significant allergies should not have the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The advice comes after two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since the vaccine was rolled out on Dec. 8 ( here , here ).

Here is the full text of Health Canada\u2019s announcement:  \u201cThanks to advances in science and technology, and an unprecedented level of global cooperation, today, Canada reached a critical milestone in its fight against COVID-19 with the authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine.  \u201cHealth Canada received Pfizer\u2019s submission on October 9, 2020 and after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, Health Canada has determined that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine meets the Department\u2019s stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements for use in Canada.  \u201cAs part of its continued commitment to openness and transparency, Health Canada is publishing a number of documents related to this decision, including a high-level summary of the evidence that Health Canada reviewed to support the authorization of the vaccine. More detailed information will be available in the coming weeks, including a detailed scientific summary and the full clinical trial data package.  \u201cCanadians can feel confident that the review process was rigorous and that we have strong monitoring systems in place. Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada will closely monitor the safety of the vaccine once it is on the market and will not hesitate to take action if any safety concerns are identified.  \u201cThe terms and conditions of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine authorization require the manufacturer to continue providing information to Health Canada on the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine to ensure the benefits of the vaccine continue to be demonstrated through market use.  \u201cThe initial indication of the vaccine is for use in people 16 years of age or older. Pfizer-BioNTech are running further clinical trials on children of all age groups and the indication could be revised in the future to include children if the data from these studies support it.  \u201cThe vaccine was authorized under Health Canada\u2019s Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19. This process allowed Health Canada to assess information submitted by the manufacturer as it became available during the product development process, while maintaining Canada\u2019s high standards.\u201d (Reporting by Denny Thomas, editing by Steve Scherer)","900":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will pursue its request for India to approve its COVID-19 vaccine if the government commits to buying shots, the U.S. drugmaker told Reuters on Monday, even as global supplies tighten.

India\u2019s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) says Pfizer officials failed to turn up to meetings after the company\u2019s application was made in early December. The regulator has also declined to accept the company\u2019s request for approval without a small local trial on the vaccine\u2019s safety and immunogenicity for Indians, Reuters has reported.  Pfizer says its application is supported by data from a global study that shows an overall efficacy rate of 95% with no vaccine-related, serious safety concerns. It also says that, based on the same data, the vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech has been approved in Britain, the United States, the European Union and Canada.  \u201cThe data collected has been endorsed by various regulatory agencies (including the most evolved) and they have given EUA [based on] ... that data,\u201d the firm said in an emailed response to questions, including on India\u2019s demand for a local trial.  \u201cGiven our exclusive priority to government supply, we look forward to a confirmation from the government on necessary supplies, [on the] basis [of] which we will take the regulatory process forward, as we have done across the world,\u201d it added.  Last week, government officials in some EU countries said Pfizer had slashed in half deliveries to them, causing frustration and hampering vaccination drives.  Indian officials have had discussions with both Pfizer and its U.S. rival Moderna Inc about making their shots in India, given its large pharmaceutical capacity.  However, India, the world\u2019s biggest vaccine maker, says it is mainly relying on shots already approved or tested at home to run its massive immunisation campaign that began on Jan. 16.  Pfizer said its current focus was on distributing the vaccine around the world using manufacturing capacity in the United States and Europe.  \u201cOnce the pandemic supply phase is over and we enter a phase of regular supplies, Pfizer will evaluate all additional opportunities available,\u201d it said.  Asked why it did not attend meetings called by the CDSCO, Pfizer said its officials had not been given enough notice.  \u201cThe company representatives have been unable to participate in previous meetings due to extremely short notices of a few hours or less and time-zone limitations,\u201d the company said.  \u201cWe remain committed to engaging with the Government of India to make this vaccine available for use by the government in the country.\u201d","901":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured outside Pfizer Headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., July 22, 2020.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N said on Friday it is in talks to shift more of its medicine production to outside contractors as it prepares for large-scale production of an experimental vaccine to prevent COVID-19, should it prove safe and effective.  The U.S. drugmaker is tapping its network of around 200 outside contractors, which includes Catalent Inc CTLT.N, Lonza Group AG LONN.S, and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N, to play a bigger role in producing some of its existing medicines, Mike McDermott, president of global supply at Pfizer, told  Reuters in an interview.  Pfizer did not specify which companies within its network it is in active discussions with about shifting production.  That will help Pfizer shift a portion of production at four of its vaccine manufacturing facilities, including one of its largest U.S. factories, toward the coronavirus vaccine while preventing disruptions in supply of its other products, he said.  \u201cThey have been hugely helpful in the past and will help us through this,\u201d McDermott said.  Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.F) said on Tuesday they have begun delivering doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidates for initial human testing in the United States. Trials in Germany had already begun.  If successful, Pfizer said it hopes to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as October. It could distribute up to 20 million doses by the end of 2020, and potentially hundreds of millions next year, it said.  The shift to outside production of other medicines will primarily effect vaccines and intravenous drugs. Pfizer currently produces around 1.5 billion doses of injected vaccines and drugs each year.  McDermott said Pfizer will also add additional shifts to its own factories, hire more workers to take advantage of its unused production capacity, and stockpile current products in preparation for the shift to COVID-19 vaccine production.  Pfizer said earlier this week it was preparing four of its manufacturing sites - three in the United States and one in Belgium - to produce the vaccine, even before clinical trials shows which, if any, of the four potential candidates being tested demonstrates efficacy in preventing infection with the novel coronavirus.  It will cost Pfizer at least $150 million to gear up its facilities for the new vaccine, McDermott said.  Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine candidates use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has long been talked about but has yet to produce an approved product. The mRNA technology instructs cells in the body to make specific coronavirus proteins that then produce an immune response.  It has the potential to be among the first vaccines against the virus that has infected more than 1 million people in the United States and killed over 77,000.  Producing vast quantities of vaccines requires that Pfizer and BioNTech work to rapidly scale up their suppliers\u2019 ability to make raw materials for mRNA vaccines, McDermott said, adding that many are small biotechs.  It could also face potential shortages of more basic materials, he added, such as the vials and syringes used to contain and administer vaccines.  Those materials \u201ccould become stressed in this environment, where you are trying to produce your ... existing products and add in vaccines needed for hundreds of millions or billions of people,\u201d McDermott said.  Contract manufacturers Lonza and Catalent are also working with other drugmakers to help produce potential treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus.  Last week, Lonza said it was working with Moderna Inc MRNA.O to help it produce its experimental mRNA vaccine being developed with U.S. government backing.  Catalent agreed last month to help Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N manufacture its coronavirus vaccine candidate.  Lonza, Catalent and Thermo Fisher did not immediately respond to requests for comment about their work with Pfizer.  Pfizer also operates its own contract manufacturer, CenterOne, which provides raw materials to other drugmakers.","905":"March 13 (Reuters) - Merck KGaA:  * MERCK AND PFIZER PROVIDE UPDATE ON PHASE III JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100 STUDY  * MERCK KGAA - ALLIANCE ACCEPTED RECOMMENDATION OF INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (DMC) TO TERMINATE JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100 TRIAL  * MERCK KGAA - TO TERMINATE AS STUDY UNLIKELY TO SHOW STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL  * MERCK KGAA - DETAILED ANALYSIS OF PHASE III JAVELIN HEAD AND NECK 100 STUDY CONDUCTED AND STUDY FINDINGS TO BE SHARED WITH THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY Source text - bit.ly\/39SmV9e Further company coverage: (Gdansk Newsroom)","906":"FILE PHOTO: National Guard personnel and pharmacists from Safeway and Albertsons administer vaccines at a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mass vaccination site at the Clark County Event Center at the Fairgrounds in Ridgefield, Washington, U.S. January 27, 2021.

REUTERS\/Michele Tantussi  \u201cWhen reading the temperature loggers that were enclosed in the cool boxes, doubts arose about the compliance with the cold chain requirements,\u201d the district of Lichtenfels in the north of Germany\u2019s largest state, Bavaria, said in a statement.  Medical staff found that the temperature in one vaccine transport cool box had risen to 15 degrees Celsius, a spokesman for Lichtenfels said, above the maximum of 8C stipulated by the manufacturers. He added that his district had not received advice from BioNtech yet on how to proceed.  The regional government of Bavaria\u2019s Upper Franconia region where several affected districts are based said that BioNTech cleared the vaccines late on Sunday.  \u201cBioNTech has confirmed the quality of the vaccine shots,\u201d a spokeswoman for Upper Franconia said. \u201cThe vaccination programme can start (in our region).\u201d  BioNtech had earlier said in a statement it was responsible for the shipment to the 25 German distribution centres and that the federal states and local authorities were responsible for the shipment to the vaccination centres and the mobile vaccination teams.  \u201cThis is where the variations in temperature occurred. We are in contact with many authorities to provide advice, however it is up to them how to proceed\u201d, a BioNTech spokeswoman said.  In a December presentation, BioNtech had said that once removed from the freezer, the vaccine can be stored for up to five days at 2-8C and up to two hours at temperatures up to 30C, prior to use.  The vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112\u00b0F) before being shipped to distribution centres in specially designed cool boxes filled with dry ice.  Once out of ultra-low temperature storage, the vaccine must be kept at 2C to 8C to remain effective for up to five days. The cool boxes designed by Pfizer are fitted with GPS trackers so the companies can deal with potential storage issues en route.  The spokesman for Lichtenfels said 1,000 shots had been affected by the temperature issue and that the city and the districts of Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Hof, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel in northern Bavaria were waiting to hear from BioNTech about whether the vaccine could still be used.  \u201cVaccination against the coronavirus is not about who vaccinates the fastest or who does the most doses. Safety and conscientious work for the benefit of the population have the highest priority,\u201d said Oliver Baer, district administrator in Hof.  The European Union launched a mass COVID-19 vaccination drive on Sunday with pensioners and medics lining up to get the first shots to see off a pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives worldwide.  The delays in Germany highlight the challenge in rolling out the vaccine while regulators review for approval other shots, including those made by Moderna and AstraZeneca, which are easier to transport and store.  The roll-out of the Pfizer vaccine in the United States has been slow putting the government\u2019s target of 20 million vaccinations this month in doubt, as hospitals have navigated preparing the previously frozen shots for use, finding staff to run clinics and ensuring proper social distancing.  In Germany, similar temperature issues also delayed the start of the vaccination campaign in the southern Bavarian districts of Augsburg and Dillingen, where staff eventually got clearance from BioNTech to use the shots.  Germany\u2019s vaccination campaign officially kicked off on Sunday with residents of elderly care homes being inoculated.

Trump, who has faced sharp criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, is eager to take credit for the speedy development and distribution of a vaccine.  One official said the executive order would lead to the formulation of guidelines for U.S. government agencies to help other countries procure the vaccine once demand in the United States was met.  It was unclear why an executive order was needed to ensure that the vaccines would be distributed domestically first, though the order appeared to be designed in part to underscore Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy ahead of the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.

Invitees at the meeting include drug distributors, pharmacies and logistics companies such as McKesson Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, CVS Health Corp, United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp.  The New York Times reported that Pfizer may not be able to provide more of its vaccine to the United States until next June because of its commitments to other countries.

The German biotech startup has led the vaccine race but its shot has been slow to arrive in the European Union due to relatively slow approval from the bloc\u2019s health regulator and the small size of the order placed by Brussels.  The delays have caused consternation in Germany, where some regions had to temporarily close vaccination centres days after the launch of an inoculation drive on Dec. 27.  \u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look good - a hole is appearing because there\u2019s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine,\u201d BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told news weekly Spiegel in an interview.  A shot from Moderna is expected to be cleared by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Jan. 6.  German Health Minister Jens Spahn has urged the EMA to also quickly approve a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca that Britain cleared this week. The EU timeline for that treatment remains uncertain.  Sahin said the BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine, which uses messenger RNA to instruct the human immune system to fight the coronavirus, should be able to cope with a variant first detected in Britain that appears to be more contagious.  \u201cWe are testing whether our vaccine can also neutralise this variant, and will soon know more,\u201d he said.  Asked about coping with a strong mutation, he said it would be possible to tweak the vaccine as required within six weeks - though such new treatments might require additional regulatory approvals.  NEW PRODUCTION LINE PLANNED  Sahin founded BioNTech with his wife, Oezlem Tuereci, who is the company\u2019s chief medical officer. Both faulted the EU\u2019s decision to spread orders in the expectation that more vaccines would be quickly approved.  The United States ordered 600 million doses of the BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine in July, while the EU waited until November to place an order of half that size.  \u201cAt some point it became clear that it would not be possible to deliver so quickly,\u201d Tuereci told Spiegel. \u201cBy then it was already too late to place follow-on orders.\u201d  BioNTech hopes to launch a new production line in Marburg, Germany, in February that could produce 250 million doses in the first half of the year, said Sahin.  Talks are under way with contract manufacturers on boosting output and there should be greater clarity by the end of January, he added.  Sahin also said BioNTech would make its vaccine, which requires storage at around minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), easier to handle.

Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine protects against virus variants  The COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE appears to protect against highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa, a laboratory study suggests. In blood samples from vaccine recipients, scientists found the vaccine appears effective against the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein on the virus, according to a report posted on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Pfizer scientist Phil Dormitzer said the vaccine has been tested against 16 mutations, and none have really had any significant impact. \"That's the good news,\" he said, before adding a note of caution. \"That doesn't mean that the 17th won't.\" Ongoing testing will be needed, experts said, to allay concerns about whether the vaccines will be protective as the virus mutates. The vaccine is based on synthetic messenger RNA technology (mRNA), as is the one from Moderna Inc. \"The evidence is not conclusive but there is a lot to indicate that the existing mRNA vaccines do cover the new variants,\" said Andreas Bergthaler of the Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. AstraZeneca Plc,, Moderna and CureVac NV are also testing their shots against the fast-spreading coronavirus variants.

The drugs - tocilizumab, sold as Actemra by Roche, and Kevzara (sarilumab) from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi - reduced death rates by 8.5 percentage points among critically ill patients. That means that for every 12 patients treated with one of the drugs, one life would be saved, said Dr. Anthony Gordon of Imperial College London, coauthor of a report posted on Thursday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The data, from 803 severely ill patients, showed that the drugs, which suppress the body's immune response, reduced mortality rates from 35.8% in a control group to 27.3% among patients receiving either drug. Previous studies had found no clear benefit from these drugs, but they included less severely ill patients treated at different stages in the disease. \"A crucial difference,\" Gordon said, \"may be that in our study, critically ill patients were enrolled within 24 hours\" of when their organs started to fail, which suggests the sickest patients may gain the most benefit from these drugs. (bit.ly\/2LshaaX)  Allergic reactions \u201crare\u201d after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine  Based on early safety monitoring, anaphylaxis and less serious allergic reactions to the Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine appear to be rare, researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported on Wednesday. Monitoring by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System jointly run by the two agencies detected only 21 cases of the life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis among the nearly 1.9 million first doses of the vaccine administered between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23. Most people with anaphylaxis had a history of allergies or allergic reactions, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. For 71% of those with anaphylaxis, the allergic reactions occurred within 15 minutes. The agencies also received reports of 83 cases of less serious allergic reactions, including rashes, itchy skin, scratchy sensations in the throat, and mild respiratory symptoms. The CDC and FDA say they will continue to work together \"to monitor for adverse events ... after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines and will regularly assess the benefits and risks of vaccination.\" (bit.ly\/3hZygJp)  Immunosuppressive medicines do not worsen COVID-19 outcomes  Medications that suppress the immune system - necessary for many chronic diseases - do not worsen outcomes of COVID-19 cases, a new study shows. Researchers looked back at 2,121 adults hospitalized for COVID-19 between March and August, including 108 who were taking the kinds of immunosuppressive drugs used to treat cancers, severe joint diseases, skin conditions, inflammatory intestinal disorders, and other serious illnesses. After accounting for patients' general baseline health status, researchers found no significant differences between those who did or did not take immunosuppressive drugs in the risk of needing mechanical ventilation, the risk of dying, or the amount of time they were hospitalized. \"Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence that should provide reassurance to clinicians and patients using chronic immunosuppressive medicines,\" the researchers concluded in the report published on Thursday in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke  Some districts in Bavaria said on Monday they would not use the shots received over the weekend on concerns the vaccines developed by Pfizer and BioNTech may have become too warm during their delivery in household cool boxes, a spokesman for the Lichtenfels district said.  \u201cThere were doubts as to whether the cold chain was maintained at all times,\u201d Lichtenfels District Administrator Christian Meissner told Reuters TV.  The vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) before being shipped to distribution centres in specially designed cool boxes filled with dry ice.  Once out of ultra-low temperature storage, the vaccine must be kept at 2C to 8C to remain effective for up to five days. The cool boxes designed by Pfizer are fitted with GPS trackers so the companies can deal with potential storage issues en route.  While BioNTech takes responsibility for the transport to the deep freezer hubs, local authorities are tasked with providing safe and cooled transport to the individual vaccination centres.  The vaccines arrived in Lichtenfels and six other northern Bavarian districts on Saturday in cool boxes of the type used for picnics or camping trips. The temperature loggers in some cases showed interim temperatures of up to 15C.  \u201cBioNTech commented and said that the vaccine was probably okay, but probably okay is not enough,\u201d Meissner said, adding that the shots would not be used to prevent damage to the public\u2019s trust in the vaccination campaign.  According to the government of Upper Franconia, where the districts are based, BioNTech had told it: \u201cBased on of the facts presented by you in your email of 12-27-2020 at 19.52 and internal stability data we do not see any influence of the described transport deviation on the quality of the vaccine shots concerned.\u201d  BioNTech declined to comment.  After consulting with the Bavarian Health Ministry, the districts decided not to use the 1,000 shots earmarked for use in Lichtenfels as well as Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Hof, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel, also in northern Bavaria, the Lichtenfels spokesman said.  Local medical staff had said that they would not feel comfortable using the shots, he said, adding that a new batch of vaccine shots arrived on Monday perfectly cooled and that the vaccination campaign started one day late.  Elsewhere in Germany, in the Vorpommern-Ruegen district, authorities said eight workers in an elderly care home in Stralsund city received five times the recommended dose of the BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine on Sunday.

The WHO\u2019s Hans Kluge\u2019s comments come as some countries including Britain are seeking to counter low vaccine supplies by extending the gap between first and second doses to up to 12 weeks, and by considering lower volume doses of some shots.  Kluge said it was important to strike a balance between making the most of limited supplies and protecting as many people as possible.  \u201cIt is important that such a decision represents a safe compromise between the limited global production capacity at the moment, and the imperative for governments to protect as many people as possible while reducing the burden of any subsequent wave on the health systems,\u201d he told a media briefing.  Proposals to prolong the gap between first and second dose have generated fierce debate among scientists. Pfizer and BioNTech have warned they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose was given more than 21 days after the first.  The EU gave emergency use approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech shot two weeks ago and hundreds of thousands of Europeans have received it since the rollout began just over a week ago.  Britain, which approved the shot in December, has administered more than a million doses of the vaccine in just under a month.  The European Union has secured 200 million doses and has taken up an option for another 100 million.

Pfizer has advised Canadian health officials to administer early doses of the vaccine at the sites where they are first delivered in large batches. At least until more data is available, it will not be possible to break up batches and send small quantities of the vaccine on to other locations.  That means many long-term care residents are likely to miss out on the first batch of vaccinations in Canada, the third country in the world to approve the vaccine, in the midst of a surge in infections that threatens to overwhelm hospitals.  It is not yet clear how movement restrictions could play out in other countries. In the United Kingdom, first doses were delivered to hospitals, and not care homes. But the drug regulator said on Thursday that some licensed companies and hospitals will be allowed to break down vaccine shipments so they can be taken into care homes, once processes and training are in place.  A delay in vaccinating long-term care home residents risks increasing COVID-19 deaths in Canada, which has struggled to protect its elders and staff. In the first wave, 81% of deaths were among care home residents, a share well above the OECD average.

On Wednesday, Health Canada cleared Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for public use, after an accelerated review. A panel advising the government has said long-term care home residents and healthcare workers should be prioritized for early vaccination.  But in Ontario, care home residents may need to wait until the Pfizer vaccine can be moved more easily or a vaccine from Moderna Inc is available, said Rick Hillier, head of the province\u2019s vaccination task force, at a Monday briefing.  While the need to store the vaccine at ultra-cold temperatures has been widely discussed, Ontario officials said the movement restriction is meant to limit the amount of physical movement, like shaking, during vaccine handling.  Pfizer has said it would consider relaxing the restrictions depending on the result of initial campaigns, said Christian Dub\u00e9, health minister of the province of Quebec.  LACK OF DATA  Asked about the restrictions, a Pfizer Canada spokeswoman said it will ship frozen vials directly to 14 initial points of vaccination chosen by the government. The company did not give a reason for the restriction.  \u201cFor the initial stages of vaccination, I can confirm that we are asking for vaccines to be administered only at the first vaccination points,\u201d said spokeswoman Christina Antoniou.  In hard-hit Quebec, the first vaccines will be shipped directly to two long-term care homes next week, including the Maimonides care facility in Montreal, to vaccinate residents and staff.  To work around the movement restrictions, health workers from other care homes will travel to Maimonides to be vaccinated with any leftover doses, said Francine Dupuis, associate chief executive of the health network that oversees the home.  The challenge for administrators comes later, when shipping vaccines to smaller care facilities across the province, she said.  Thomas Madden, chief executive of BioNTech partner Acuitas Therapeutics, based in Vancouver, said the issue is most likely a lack of data during the rapid rollout, not the vaccine\u2019s actual durability.  \u201cWhatever storage and transportation conditions are used for the vaccine, studies have to have been conducted in advance to demonstrate that the quality of the vaccine is maintained under those conditions,\u201d he said.  Madden, an expert in lipid nanoparticles, a key ingredient in the vaccine, said, \u201cthe challenge is that you have a limited amount of time to run those studies, which are relatively complicated.\u201d  Madden noted that BioNTech gave less restrictive guidance in a recent presentation, which said defrosted vials could be transported for up to six hours.  Elsewhere in Canada, in Saskatchewan, which has a large number of remote, indigenous communities, officials plan to deploy Moderna\u2019s vaccine mainly in rural, isolated places, said Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab.

REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas\/File Photo  Once front-runners in a global race to develop a vaccine, the AstraZeneca and University of Oxford partnership has been overtaken by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech, whose vaccine is already being used in Britain and the United States.  The following are details of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine effort.  TYPE OF VACCINE  - Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the vaccine is a recombinant viral vector vaccine, meaning a virus is used as a means of delivering the vaccine.  - It uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus that encodes instructions for making proteins from the novel coronavirus to generate an immune response and prevent infection.  DOSAGE, PROTECTION DURATION AND STORAGE  - AstraZeneca has said the UK authorisation was for a two dose regime.  - Two regimens are being tested: one in which recipients get two full doses, and another with half a dose followed by a full dose.  - The half-dose first regimen was found to be 90% effective in a subset of trial subjects. The success rate was 62% with the originally planned two full doses, based on interim data.  - In December, Oxford said the vaccine has a better immune response when a two full-dose regime is used, citing data from early trials.  - Immune response could last at least a year.  - The vaccine should be effective against the new coronavirus variant, and studies are under way to fully probe the impact of the mutation.  - The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions for at least six months, making it logistically easier to transport than Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.  - AstraZeneca aims to supply millions of doses in the first quarter to Britain and is working with the UK government for first vaccinations to begin early in the new year.  EXPECTED DOSAGE PRICE  - Pricing in Britain is unknown so far.  - Italy\u2019s health ministry said in June the vaccine would cost about 2.5 euros ($2.80) per dose in Europe.  - AstraZeneca has said it will be able to manufacture the vaccine at a few dollars per dose.  - Pricing in Latin America is not expected to exceed $4 per dose.  - Serum Institute of India has said it would price the vaccine at $3 per dose for India and other emerging economies.  - Sources told Reuters it could cost $4 to $5 per dose in Bangladesh.  - Costs in other regions have not yet been disclosed.  - AstraZeneca has said it would not profit from the vaccine during the pandemic, but a report from the Financial Times in October showed the company can declare when it considers the pandemic to have ended in its deals for the vaccine.  - AstraZeneca will look to profit from wealthier countries at the \u201cappropriate time\u201d.  TESTING AND DATA  - Trials combining the vaccine with Russia\u2019s Sputnik V will start by the end of the year, and Russia wants to jointly produce the new vaccine if it is proven to be effective.  - Vastly divergent performance with different dose regimens has called for more clarity on the vaccine\u2019s efficacy which averaged 70.4%, well below vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, but above the 50% threshold set by many regulators.  - Serum Institute of India will continue to test a two full dose regimen of the vaccine.  - AstraZeneca had to pause global trials on Sept. 6 after an unexplained illness in a participant.  - Trial of the vaccine in the United States resumed in October after other countries had ended their pause.  - AZD1222 produces an immune response in both old and young adults, and also led to lower adverse responses among the elderly, AstraZeneca said in October.  - The vaccine also accurately follows genetic instructions programmed into it by its developers, according to an analysis by independent scientists.  - Brazil said in October that a trial volunteer had died.  - A source told Reuters the Brazilian trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 vaccine, although the death was reported to be a suicide.  - In July, data from early-stage trials published in The Lancet showed the vaccine was safe and produced an immune response.  DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE  - The lead developer had said in July the vaccine could be rolled out by year-end, but the delivery and testing timeline has since been pushed back.  - Data read-out submitted to regulators across the world to seek approval.  - Experts have predicted a safe and effective vaccine could take 12-18 months to develop, even at the record speeds.  TARGET DOSES\/GLOBAL CAPACITY OF SUPPLY  - More than 3 billion doses are planned.  - The company will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, and 700 million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.  - AstraZeneca is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and refrigerate it when the vaccine gets closer to approvals.  TIE-UPS  - Even before studies showed any signs of efficacy, AstraZeneca had signed several supply and manufacturing deals around the world.  - It also joined forces with IQVIA to speed up testing.  - AstraZeneca has been granted protection from future liability claims related to the vaccine by most of the countries with which it has struck supply agreements, a senior executive told Reuters in July.","940":"BRUSSELS, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The distribution of an initial 200 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech will be completed for the European Union by September, a spokesman for the EU Commission said on Monday.  \u201cDistribution of the full 200 million doses is scheduled to be completed by September 2021,\u201d the spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement.

FILE PHOTO: Small bottles labelled with \"Vaccine\" stickers stand near a medical syringe in front of displayed \"Coronavirus COVID-19\" words in this illustration taken April 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  Public resistance to vaccines has been much discussed this year, but the issue became very real on Monday when Pfizer and BioNTech announced their candidate was more than 90% effective in large trials - hoisting an actual shot onto the horizon.  Numerous opinion polls carried out before and during the pandemic showed confidence is volatile, and that political polarization and online misinformation threatens uptake. Many people have concerns about the accelerated speed of COVID-19 vaccine development.  The World Health Organization estimates about 70% of people must be inoculated to break transmission of the virus. Since it is unlikely a vaccine, once approved, will be immediately available for the masses, experts said getting medical workers on board will be critical.  \u201cWe should have really targeted discussions and engagement with healthcare providers,\u201d Heidi Larson, director of the global Vaccine Confidence Project, told Reuters.  \u201cNot only are they going to be the first ones expected to get a vaccine - if not required to - they\u2019re also going to be the ones on the frontlines facing the onslaught of questions from the public.\u201d  FIRST IN LINE?  While about 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development globally, with dozens in human clinical trials, no shot has actually crossed the finish line and been approved, though the one from Pfizer-BioNTech appears to be on track.  The high rate of efficacy in the Pfizer-BioNTech interim results could help boost confidence, Cornell University government Professors Douglas Kriner and Sarah Kreps said.  Their recently published research showed that if an initial COVID-19 vaccine was about as effective as a flu shot, uptake by the American public may fall far short of the 70% level needed to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d.  \u201cHowever, if the vaccine was 90% effective it would significantly increase Americans\u2019 willingness to vaccinate by more than 10%, critical to ensuring enough public acceptance to help the U.S. eventually get closer to herd immunity,\u201d said Kreps.  Experts are also cautioning any conversation over a vaccine\u2019s risks and rewards must be frank. A return to normal life will still take time, with no one shot likely to be a silver bullet. And many questions are likely to remain, including how long a vaccine will provide protection.  The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, a non-profit that supports the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has been holding focus groups to gauge the public mood and is now crafting campaign messages to help tackle concerns.  Its chief executive, Susan Winckler, said more than a dozen focus groups of 150 people in total held since August - some in person, some by video - had unearthed numerous concerns.  \u201cWe heard distrust of both government and the healthcare system,\u201d Winckler said. \u201cMany didn\u2019t want to be first in line for the shot.\u201d  It\u2019s a global phenomenon; a survey from early November, carried out by the World Economic Forum and covering 18,526 people in 15 countries, showed 73% of people willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, a four-point fall since August.  EARLY BATTLE  Regulators and the drug industry have taken pains to reassure the public they won\u2019t cut corners on safety, with a top U.S. drug agency official saying he would quit if an unproven vaccine were rubber stamped.  The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, a drug industry group, also plans a campaign by 2021, while the U.S. Council for International Business, with 300 multinational corporations as members, is also getting behind a campaign pushing for workforce take-up of eventual COVID-19 vaccines.  Some studies show government and employer recommendations will help convince people to get vaccinated.  Scott Ratzan, co-leader with Larson of \u2018CONVINCE\u2019, an initiative supporting communication and engagement for vaccine uptake globally, stressed the importance of medical workers getting inoculated, saying others would then be more likely to follow suit.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the medical folks signed on ... we\u2019ll lose the early battle,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only way to get back to normal is if we can get enough workers or employees covered.\u201d","943":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window.)  * Xilinx jumps on $35 bln buyout deal from AMD  * Merck up after raising profit forecast  * Pfizer, Eli Lilly fall after results  * Indexes: Dow down 0.26%, S&P flat, Nasdaq up 0.47% (Updates to market open)  Oct 27 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 was little changed on Tuesday after a sharp pull back in the prior session as investors parsed through a slew of mixed corporate earnings, while awaiting progress on U.S. fiscal stimulus.

But a lower dose of the drug, tanezumab, failed to alleviate pain when compared with a placebo, the companies said in a statement.  The drug was being tested in patients who had already used three different classes of painkillers but had not experienced enough relief or were intolerant to those treatments.  Tanezumab belongs to a category of pain medications that target the nerve growth factor, a protein involved in the growth of nerve cells.  U.S. health regulators have been encouraging the development of such pain medicines rather than opioids, as the United States faces an epidemic of opioid use and abuse.  Chronic low back pain affects an estimated 33 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability, Pfizer and Lilly said. Treatment often requires painkillers such as codeine, in cases where over-the-counter medication does not help.  Last year, the two companies reported positive results from a late-stage study testing tanezumab in patients with osteoarthritis pain of the knee or hip.

FILE PHOTO: Coronavirus: On November 16, 2020, US biotech company Moderna announced a vaccine against COVID-19 that is 94.5% effective. Montreal, November 16, 2020  The following is a comparison of the two vaccines and what to expect as both become available:  HOW ARE THE VACCINES SIMILAR?  Both vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which contains instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus. The instructions spur the immune system into action, turning the body into a virus-zapping vaccine factory. No actual virus is contained in the vaccines.  Both the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines target the crown-like spikes on the surface of the coronavirus that it uses to break into healthy human cells. The spikes also give the family of viruses their distinctive name.  The vaccines appear to be similarly effective. Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine was around 95% effective at preventing disease symptoms in its late-stage trial, while Moderna\u2019s vaccine was around 94% effective.  Both are given in two doses; Pfizer\u2019s 21 days apart and Moderna\u2019s 28 days apart. Very few participants who received the vaccine in either trial got sick with COVID-19 and almost none got seriously ill.  Data the companies have submitted to the Food and Drug Administration suggest that they start offering partial protection against COVID-19 around two weeks after recipients receive their first dose.  HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT?  COLD VS ULTRA-COLD  The main difference between the two vaccines is the temperature required to keep them stable long-term.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccine must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 Fahrenheit). Once thawed, it can only be refrigerated for 5 days. The vaccine requires a special shipping container packed with dry ice to keep it at the proper temperature.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine can be stored at standard freezer temperatures of -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for up to six months. After it\u2019s thawed, it can be kept in a refrigerator for up to 30 days.  SIDE EFFECTS AND SAFETY  Neither of the two large-scale clinical trials of the vaccines turned up any serious long-term side effects. But the vaccines do have slightly different short-term side effect profiles.  While the vaccines have not been compared head-to-head, Moderna\u2019s vaccine appears to be associated with slightly more severe cases of fatigue, headache and fever in the day or two following the second shot, especially in people younger than 65.  Although not seen in its clinical trial, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine has been linked with a few cases of severe allergic reactions as it has been rolled out in the UK and the United States. At least two healthcare workers in Britain and two in Alaska have reported severe allergic reactions soon after receiving the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  Britain\u2019s medical regulator has said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reactions to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.  But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it should be safe for most Americans with allergies to receive the vaccine.  WILL MASKS STILL BE NEEDED?  More data is needed to understand exactly how effective either vaccine is at preventing virus transmission. While they are both highly effective at keeping symptoms and severe illness at bay, we do not know if they prevent someone from becoming infected. Until that is known, experts say, masks will still be needed to ensure that vaccinated people do not spread the virus.  WILL AMERICANS GET TO CHOOSE?  At this point, with vaccines in short supply, few people will have the luxury of expressing a preference of which they receive. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that the first doses be given to healthcare workers and residents in long-term care facilities and most states plan to do that.","948":"FILE PHOTO: A sign is pictured outside Pfizer Headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., July 22, 2020.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  Ugur Sahin, chief executive of Germany\u2019s BioNTech, which with partner Pfizer Inc, took less than a year to get a vaccine approved, said on Tuesday he expects its messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine to still work well.  Moderna Inc, Germany\u2019s CureVac and British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc also believe their shots will work against the new threat that has sown chaos in Britain, prompting a wave of travel bans that are disrupting trade with Europe and threatening to further isolate the island country.  \u201cScientifically it is highly likely that the immune response by this vaccine can also deal with this virus variant,\u201d he said on a call with reporters.  Sahin said it will take another two weeks or so of study and data collection to get a definitive answer.  \u201cThe vaccine contains more than 1,270 amino acids, and only nine of them are changed (in the mutated virus). That means that 99% of the protein is still the same.\u201d  The mutation known as the B.1.1.7 lineage may be up to 70% more infectious and more of a concern for children.  In the event that the variant presents vaccine developers with an unexpected challenge, an advantage of mRNA is that scientists can quickly re-engineer genetic material in the shot to match that of the mutated protein, whereas modifying traditional vaccines would require extra steps.  \u201cIn principle, the beauty of the mRNA technology is we can directly start to engineer a vaccine which completely mimics this new mutation,\u201d Sahin said.  \u201cWe could be able to provide a new vaccine technically within six weeks. Of course, this is not only a technical question. We have to deal with how regulators... would see that.\u201d  Pfizer\/BioNTech, Moderna and CureVac all developed mRNA vaccines, while AstraZeneca has a more traditional vaccine that uses an adenovirus found in chimpanzees to deliver genetic material from the coronavirus to spur an immune response.  Germany\u2019s CureVac started late-stage clinical trials on its vaccine candidate last week and is constantly reviewing variants, which the company said are common as viruses spread.  Britain\u2019s chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said on Saturday vaccines appeared to be adequate in generating an immune response to the variant of the coronavirus.

U.S. law enforcement and cybersecurity officials did not respond to requests for comment.  Hacking attempts against healthcare and medical organisations have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic as attackers ranging from state-backed spies to cyber criminals hunt for information.  Reuters has previously reported on allegations that hackers linked to North Korea, South Korea, Iran, Vietnam, China and Russia have on separate occasions tried to steal information about the virus and potential treatments.  Reuters has documented that espionage campaigns targeted a slew of pharmaceutical and vaccine development companies including Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, and Moderna. Regulators and international organizations such as the World Health Organization have also come under repeated attack.  \u201cVaccine candidates represent liquid gold to many parties, both in terms of the opportunity and the pure market value,\u201d said Rogers, who is also vice president at security company Okta Inc. \u201cInformation on the vaccine and access to any link in the distribution chain has significantly increased value.\u201d  The respiratory virus, which emerged in China in late 2019, has infected more than 68 million people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally.

Pfizer said the glass vials will be used for some of its existing sterile injectable medicines and that they were also being assessed for storing a range of new products. The company did not provide details of these new products.  Pfizer, like rivals Merck & Co and AstraZeneca, is racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, which does not yet have an approved vaccine or treatment.  With vaccines being seen by world leaders as a way to restart stalled economies, drugmakers are looking to scale up their production to meet surging global demand.  Some companies such as AstraZeneca have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up production of COVID-19 vaccines that are expected to need billions of vials.  It would be essential to fill a vial with five to 10 doses of the vaccines to cope with the requirement of huge volumes of vaccines and the relative shortage of vials, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels said on Thursday.  Johnson & Johnson also has a potential COVID-19 vaccine under development which it plans to test in humans by September.","959":"(Reuters) - Stock markets in Australia and New Zealand jumped more than 2% on Tuesday, joining a global rally in equities overnight as investor risk appetite was boosted by promising developments toward a coronavirus vaccine.

Speaking in a briefing, Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it is hard to explain the different efficacy rates between the AstraZeneca\/Oxford shot and the other vaccines developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and one by Moderna.  Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna late-stage studies showed efficacy of more than 90%, while the British shot was on average 70% effective after testing its efficacy for all levels of the disease from severe to mild.

Pfizer Inc\u2019s announcement that its vaccine was more than 90% effective in tests come as Senate Republicans and House Democrats are in a standoff over the health of the economy and investors are closely watching any movement over talks.  Democrats have pushed for a $2 trillion package, with support for state and local governments that are facing steep layoffs, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pushed back, arguing Congress should enact a smaller coronavirus stimulus package highly targeted at the pandemic\u2019s effects.  \u201cYou have to assume in general that whatever level stimulus you would have received will probably be less because policy makers will say that the economy will mend,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. Equity Strategist for Credit Suisse.  The vaccine news came after the United States became the first country to cross more than 10 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally.  New Jersey joined some other U.S. Northeast states on Monday by reimposing economic restrictions such as closing indoor dining by 10 p.m.  Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, the corporate parent of PIMCO, cautioned that stimulus relief was still required to minimize the pandemic\u2019s economic and social effects. The \u201cinclination is to argue that the fiscal support is no longer needed. That would be wrong,\u201d he tweeted.  Talks for another stimulus bill will likely be affected by polls for two open U.S. Senate seats at play in the Jan. 5 run-off elections in Georgia, said Esty Dwek, head of global macro strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, who cautioned that the U.S. economy remains weak.  \u201cEven with a vaccine we need stimulus,\u201d she said, adding that the risk is that any further relief bills will \u201cbe about politics and not about need.\u201d  LESS DEPENDENT ON STIMULUS  While another stimulus bill would likely extend the market rally, the lack of a relief package now will not sink stocks or investor sentiment as much as before Pfizer\u2019s news, said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co.  \u201cThe downside risk of what does a world looks like in a no-stimulus scenario is frankly less disastrous to the market than it was yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now appear to have blue skies ahead if all of this is as positive as it looks.\u201d  As investors moved into riskier assets on Monday, stocks hit record peaks while benchmark 10-year Treasury rates jumped to their highest since March, when the U.S. economy froze under lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus.  Expectations for an imminent vaccine will likely push interest rates higher as investors price in an economic rebound next year, said Jabaz Mathai, head of U.S. rates strategy at Citigroup, wrote in a note Monday. \u201cNevertheless, a stimulus package would be ideal to create a bridge for the economy.\u201d  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said a vaccine reduced the need for a stimulus but said if it was not available to the general public until March or April, \u201cwe might need something to bridge that.\u201d  Markets could continue to rally even if new stimulus is pushed to next year, said Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle. A stimulus bill will now likely range from $500 billion to $1 trillion, rather than the $2 trillion plus that Democrats had been pushing for, she added.  \u201cPeople were rightly staying away from certain sectors\u201d like hotels and travel, she said.

AstraZeneca AZN.L said on Thursday it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from late-stage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelf-life of supplies.  It is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers, and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and keep it at fridge temperature when the vaccine gets closer to approval.  \u201cWe are a little bit late in deliveries, which is why the vaccine has been kept in frozen form,\u201d CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call.  However, he added AstraZeneca was \u201cfully\u201d prepared to launch the vaccine when it is ready, adding the company\u2019s weekly delivery schedule should roughly match what the UK government has in mind for its vaccination plans.  AstraZeneca and its partner on the project, the University of Oxford, said data from late-stage trials should land this year. If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said.  The British duo are racing with Pfizer\/BioNTech, Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world\u2019s best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives.  Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval.  The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this.

On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe.  For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations.  However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts\u2019 expectations of 98 cents.

Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Sunday that the government would await advice from scientists on how best to proceed, after a trial showed the AstraZeneca vaccine did not significantly reduce the risk of mild or moderate COVID-19 from the 501Y.V2 variant that caused a second wave of infections starting late last year.  Prior to widespread circulation of the more contagious variant, the vaccine was showing efficacy of around 75%, researchers said.  In a later analysis based mostly on infections by the new variant, there was only a 22% lower risk of developing mild-to-moderate COVID-19 versus those given a placebo. Although researchers said the figure was not statistically significant, due to trial design, it is well below the benchmark of at least 50% regulators have set for vaccines to be considered effective against the virus.  The study did not assess whether the vaccine helped prevent severe COVID-19 because it involved mostly relatively young adults not considered to be at high risk for serious illness.  AstraZeneca said on Saturday that it believed its vaccine could protect against severe disease and that it had already started adapting it against the 501Y.V2 variant.  Still, professor Shabir Madhi, lead investigator on the AstraZeneca trial in South Africa, said data on the vaccine were a reality check and that it was time to \u201crecalibrate our expectations of COVID-19 vaccines\u201d.  South Africa hopes to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population, to achieve some level of herd immunity but has yet to administer a single shot.  It had hoped to roll out the AstraZeneca vaccine to healthcare workers soon after on Monday receiving 1 million doses produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII).  Instead, it will offer health workers vaccines developed by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer\/BioNTech in the coming weeks.  \u201cWhat does that mean for our vaccination programme which we said will start in February? The answer is it will proceed,\u201d Mkhize told an online news briefing. \u201cFrom next week for the next four weeks we expect that there will be J&J vaccines, there will be Pfizer vaccines.\u201d  NEW APPROACH  Professor Salim Abdool Karim, an epidemiologist advising the government, said there needed to be a new approach to immunisations, given uncertainty about how effective current vaccines would be against the 501Y.V2 variant.  First a vaccine should be used in a targeted group to assess hospitalisation rates, and then if it proves effective in reducing hospitalisations it could feature in a wide-scale rollout, he said.  If it was not effective in reducing hospitalisations, individuals who had received it should be offered another effective vaccine, either a booster based on the variant or another vaccine, Abdool Karim added.  It was probable that South Africa would experience a third wave of infections when winter starts in around four months\u2019 time, Madhi said.  He added that it would be \u201csomewhat reckless\u201d to discard the 1 million AstraZeneca doses the country had received when there was still a chance they could protect against severe COVID-19.  Anban Pillay, health ministry deputy director-general, said the expiry date on the AstraZeneca doses was in April, but the government was speaking to the SII to seek an extension or exchange.  Madhi said South Africa might want to reframe its target group for vaccination. \u201cIt really needs to be centred around the prevention of severe disease and death from what will likely be a resurgence sometime soon.\u201d","972":"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will kick off its COVID-19 vaccination programme on Wednesday amid concerns that a shortage of special syringes could lead to the waste of millions of doses of Pfizer vaccine as the country grapples with its third and most serious wave of infections.  A Tokyo hospital staff member checks the temperature of Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine with delivery staff at a hospital in Tokyo, Japan, February 16, 2021. Kimimasa Mayama\/Pool via REUTERS  Japan\u2019s vaccination programme chief Taro Kono announced the launch of the programme at a news conference on Tuesday after the government officially approved Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday, the first such approval in Japan.  But fears are growing in Japan that millions of doses of Pfizer vaccine could be wasted due to a shortage of special syringes that maximise the number of shots used from each vial.  The government has made urgent requests, but manufacturers are struggling to ramp up production fast enough, creating the latest headache for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who suffers from weak public support.  \u201cWe are still trying to secure these special syringes,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said on Tuesday.  Japan\u2019s vaccination drive, the last to be launched among G7 industralised nations, will start with 40,000 medical workers.  The government will then target people aged 65 or above, those with existing health conditions, and workers at elderly care facility workers. The vaccination drive would be completed within a year, Kono said.  \u201cNow that we are starting our inoculation drive - a crucial card to play in our fight against the coronavirus pandemic - I hope that many people get vaccinated while correctly understanding the benefits and risks,\u201d he said.  Inoculating Japan\u2019s population swiftly is a top priority for Suga\u2019s government as he is determined to hold the Tokyo Olympics this summer after the Games were postponed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Japan, with a population of 126 million, has so far signed contracts to procure 314 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc, enough for 157 million people.  SYRINGE SHORTAGE  Japan last month signed a contract with Pfizer Inc to procure 144 million doses of its vaccine, or enough for 72 million people.  One vial is meant for six shots, Pfizer says, but it takes special syringes that retain a low volume of solution after an injection to extract six doses, while only five shots can be taken with standard syringes that the government has stored up in preparation for the inoculation drive.  When asked last week, Kato did not directly answer questions whether the shortage of the ideal syringe meant the number of shots Japan can administer would be reduced, but on Tuesday he conceded that without it there would be waste.  \u201cWhen it comes to what\u2019s left in vials and syringes, what\u2019s unused will be disposed of,\u201d Kato said.  Both a Pfizer Japan spokeswoman and a Japanese health ministry official declined to say whether the contract to supply Japan with 144 million doses of vaccine by the end of the year is based on six doses being taken from each vial.  \u201cI want to do everything I can to make sure that we can get six doses, considering that there are so many people around the world waiting to be vaccinated, and Japan can\u2019t be the one country that is wasting its vaccines,\u201d Kono said.  In a bid to minimise the amount of vaccine left unused in syringes and vials, the government is asking medical equipment manufacturers to boost output of the low dead-space syringes, but there are doubts whether that can be done quickly enough.  Although daily cases have been in decline in recent weeks in Japan after peaking in early January, Tokyo and nine other prefectures are still under the coronavirus state of emergency.","973":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine has been given to 140,000 people in Britain, and the feedback on side effects and tolerability has been reassuring, BioNTech\u2019s chief medical officer said on Thursday.  Britain was the first to approve the shot for emergency use on Dec. 3, followed by Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \u201cIn Britain, 140,000 people have been vaccinated by now and the tolerability data are exactly as we have shown in our clinical trial,\u201d Chief Medical Officer Oezlem Tuereci said in a webcast call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

REUTERS\/Clodagh Kilcoyne  COVID-19 hospital admissions are rising by 20% a day, and the number of patients being treated could surpass the first wave peak within a day or two, having reached 776 on Monday. There were 73 patients in intensive care units (ICU).  The head of Ireland\u2019s health service operator said that on that trajectory, the total number in hospitals could hit 2,500 this month, with between 250 and 430 in ICU. Public hospitals can surge ICU capacity safely to 375 and the health service was again seeking to take over private hospital ICU beds, Paul Reid said.  \u201cI think we\u2019ve run out of adjectives to describe how serious this is... The numbers in that trajectory we cannot sustain,\u201d Reid told the Newstalk radio station.  Until recently Ireland had one of the lowest infection rates in Europe, leading the government to allow the reopening of most of the economy in December.  But the 14-day COVID-19 incidence rate per 100,000 people has risen almost five-fold to 583 in the last two weeks. Modelling chief Philip Nolan said the true underlying rate, owing to a backlog of positive tests, was 700-800, surpassing the corresponding first wave peak of around 600 in April.  The country\u2019s Chief Medical Officer last week said Ireland now had the \u201cfastest-growing\u201d incidence rate in the European Union and on Monday said officials have not been as concerned at any point in the whole pandemic as they are now.  VACCINE ROLLOUT  Ireland will ramp up its early stage vaccine rollout this week. Its immunisation advisory committee recommended the continued administering of two doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine in the period indicated by its manufacturers, and not to follow a recent shift by Britain to postpone second doses in order to give more people a first shot.  Reid said the health service would likely report around 7,000 daily COVID-19 cases in the coming days, \u201ca frightening scale\u201d after the positive test rate soared to 25% on Sunday alone.  One local doctor in Louth, the second hardest-hit county that borders Northern Ireland where cases are also surging, said 90% of her COVID-19 referrals from Dec. 28 to Dec. 31 returned positive.  \u201cI was referring symptoms as mild as head colds.

World stock markets held near record highs after Britain approved Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, the first Western country to approve a shot for the disease. Investors are hoping a vaccine rollout will boost global economic recovery. Canada is a major producer of commodities, including oil, so the loonie tends to be sensitive to the outlook for the global economy. Oil slipped as the market awaited a pact from producers on output. U.S. crude prices were down 0.3% at $44.43 a barrel, while the Canadian dollar dipped 0.1% to 1.2940 per U.S. dollar, or 77.28 U.S. cents. The currency touched its strongest intraday level since October 2018 at 1.2916. Canadian labor productivity fell by a record 10.3% in the third quarter, as hours worked rebounded faster than business output, Statistics Canada said. That follows a record increase in the second quarter, which was marked by lockdown measures imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Canada's jobs report for November is due on Friday, which could help guide expectations for the Bank of Canada policy outlook.

A former World Bank economist, Sandu defeated the pro-Moscow incumbent Igor Dodon in last month\u2019s presidential election, promising to fight endemic corruption and putting Moldova\u2019s relations with the European Union back on track.  The eastern European country of 3.5 million, where the West and Russia vie for influence, has been rocked in recent years by instability and corruption scandals, including the disappearance of $1 billion from the banking system.  Though Moldova rolled out a political and trade agreement with the EU in 2014, the EU has become increasingly critical over Moldova\u2019s track record on reforms and fighting corruption. Iohannis never visited Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, during Dodon\u2019s tenure.  Romania has access to 10 million doses as part of the EU\u2019s agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech, and began vaccinating frontline healthcare workers on Sunday.  \u201cThe victory of Maia Sandu in the presidential elections is a victory of historic importance.

Following are reactions to the news.  Scientists\u2019 reactions:  ALEXANDER GINTSBURG, DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW\u2019S GAMALEYA INSTITUTE WHICH DEVELOPED RUSSIA\u2019S MAIN VACCINE CANDIDATE, SPUTNIK V  \u201cWe welcome the progress shown by our foreign colleagues in the development of a vaccine against the new coronavirus. The more vaccines are available in the world, the better people will be protected.  \u201cPeople at high risk of infection - primarily medical workers - are already being actively vaccinated in our country. Production is being scaled up and new production sites are joining the process. In the near future we expect to publish interim results of the post-registration trial of the vaccine Sputnik V, the so-called Phase III trials. I am sure that its effectiveness level will also be high.\u201d  CLEMENS WENDTNER, CHIEF PHYSICIAN OF INFECTIOLOGY AND TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEAD OF THE SPECIAL UNIT FOR HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS LIFE-THREATENING INFECTIONS, MUNICH SCHWABING CLINIC, GERMANY  \u201cThis is remarkable, as many ongoing vaccination studies on COVID-19 currently only assume a success rate of at least 50%. In addition, it should be emphasized that a sharp end point has been defined - infection yes or no. Alternatively, with less high expectations of a vaccine, already attenuated disease courses, so-called mitigated courses, could be considered a success. In addition, the mRNA vaccination appears to be effective after only four weeks, which means that one does not have to wait long for protection.\u201d  WALID GELLAD, PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, UNITED STATES  \u201cThis is a hint that these mRNA vaccines are likely to work, and there\u2019s at least one other. And they\u2019re likely to be safe, at least from this trial. So that\u2019s highly encouraging. The other thing that\u2019s highly encouraging is that science can now create a vaccine in a relatively short amount of time and test it, which gives a lot of hope for the future when these things happen again.\u201d  ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL, BRITAIN  \u201cThis vaccine needs to be stored at -80c. This could create major logistical challenges for mass treatment outside major urban areas and in low or middle income countries.\u201d  \u201cHowever, overall this is a huge step forwards in the fight against COVID-19. We will need to see whether updated versions of this vaccine are needed to protect people against new strains of the virus which might emerge in future.\u201d  RICHARD HATCHETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE CEPI COALITION FOR EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS INNOVATIONS  \u201cThese are hugely positive and encouraging interim results and are testament to the ingenuity and skill of the scientific community in advancing vaccine candidates against COVID-19. We commend Pfizer\/BioNTech on this historic interim result and the speed at which they have advanced through clinical development.  \u201cWe believe these interim results also increase the probability of success of other COVID-19 candidate vaccines which use a similar approach [pre-fusion spike as their immunogen], including all of the vaccines in the CEPI portfolio.\u201d  PETER HORBY, PROFESSOR OF EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, BRITAIN  \u201cThis news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general.  \u201cOf course we need to see more detail and await the final results, and there is a long, long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment.\u201d  ELEANOR RILEY, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, BRITAIN  \u201cAt face value, this is exceptionally good news: a vaccine that is 90% effective at preventing symptomatic cases of COVID-19 and with millions of doses available by the end of the year.  \u201cHowever, the full data set on which the claim is based has not yet been released and so we don\u2019t know exactly what has been found.\u201d  LAWRENCE YOUNG, PROFESSOR OF MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF WARWICK, BRITAIN  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to interpret the interim analysis, but it does appear very encouraging.\u201d  \u201cIn this... preliminary analysis there is a significant reduction in the COVID-19, and I interpret that to mean that ... individuals are not developing disease, but it doesn\u2019t tell us anything about whether people are getting infected or not.\u201d  JOHN MOORE, PROFESSOR AT WEILL CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE, NEW YORK CITY  \u201cI can see nothing problematic.\u201d  As for what this means for other vaccines, Moore said: \u201cModerna\u2019s is likely to work as well given the similar design and performance, and Novavax also, as it seems more potent. It\u2019s harder to judge about the other candidates.\u201d  MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON, BRITAIN  \u201cThis cautiously sounds like an excellent result from the phase 3 trials, but we should remain a little cautious. The provisional findings are made available in a press release, and the study is ongoing. However, if the final results show an effectiveness of anywhere near 90% with response in elderly and ethnic minority populations, that is an excellent result for a first generation vaccine.  \u201cThis has been seen before \u2013 the rapidly-produced ebola vaccine generated very high levels of effectiveness and exceeded all expectations. Equally, billions of dollars and numerous clinical trials have struggled to produce any form of vaccination against HIV. Science can be unpredictable.\u201d  AZRA GHANI, CHAIR IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY, IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON  \u201cThese new results represent the first demonstration of substantial efficacy of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19 disease which is very welcome news. It is important to bear in mind that these are early results based on a relatively small number of cases. In addition, the efficacy estimate is based on seven days of follow-up of participants following the second dose; further data in the coming weeks and months will provide a better picture of longer-term vaccine efficacy.\u201d  WILLIAM SCHAFFNER, INFECTIOUS DISEASES EXPERT AT VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE, UNITED STATES  \u201cThe efficacy data are really impressive. This is better than most of us anticipated. I would have been delighted with efficacy of 70% or 75%. 90% is very impressive for any vaccine. The study isn\u2019t completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.\u201d  IAN JONES, PROFESSOR OF VIROLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF READING, BRITAIN  \u201cOf all the vaccines currently in development the BioNtech product always looked like the most bang-per-buck as it is entirely focused on the part of the virus that binds to the human cell, the receptor binding domain.  \u201cThe only things we will not know for some time is the longevity of the response in all age groups, but assuming antibody titres are high that should be at least as good as any other vaccine currently in trial.\u201d  JOHN BELL, REGIUS PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD WHO SITS ON THE UK GOVERNMENT\u2019S VACCINE TASKFORCE, TOLD BBC RADIO:  \u201cI\u2019m really delighted with this result for no other reason than it shows you you can make a vaccine against this little critter. As you know, there are many pathogens where we\u2019ve tried for decades and never managed to get a vaccine, you know, malaria, HIV.\u201d  \u201cDistribution of this is going to be challenging, and there\u2019s a lot of complexities associated with that. But... that\u2019s not the headline here. The headline is, we\u2019ll solve those things if we need to. But... it rolls the pitch for other vaccines because I can\u2019t see any reason now why we shouldn\u2019t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease.  \u201cOur (Oxford\u2019s) first interim analysis is also likely to be available in the very near future, and by that I mean weeks, not months. So, I\u2019m pretty optimistic that given this result, we\u2019ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well.\u201d  \u201cWhen you look at the immunological responses you get from the Oxford\/AstraZeneca vaccine and the ones from the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and indeed even the Moderna vaccine. They all look about the same. So, I\u2019m optimistic that that probably reflects similar levels of efficacy.\u201d  FLORIAN KRAMMER, PROFESSOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI, USA  \u201cThese are fantastic results. The efficacy could be higher than expected, and this probably means that - at least in the U.S. - there will be an application for approval very soon. Of course, it would be better to see age-specific data, but I suspect that these will be published soon. Frankly, this is the best news I have received since Jan. 10.\u201d  MARYLYN ADDO, HEAD OF TROPICAL MEDICINE SECTION, UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER EPPENDORF (UKE), HAMBURG, GERMANY  \u201cThese are interesting first signals, but again they are only communicated in press releases. Primary data are not yet available and a peer-reviewed publication is still pending. We still have to wait for the exact data before we can make a final assessment. At present, there are still few details about the exact data, for example regarding different age groups and in which groups the 94 cases occurred exactly.\u201d  BERND SALZBERGER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL REGENSBURG, GERMANY  \u201cIn the Pfizer\/Biontech press release, the Phase II\/III placebo-controlled observer-blinded study with the vaccine BNT162b2 reported a vaccine efficacy of over 90%. Although only a few events - a total of 94 cases - have been observed in the study so far, this is a very good result. No serious side effects have been reported - overall a very positive result, which will probably lead to an early approval.\u201d  GERD FAETKENHEUER, HEAD OF INFECTIOLOGY, CLINIC I FOR INTERNAL MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL COLOGNE, GERMANY  \u201cThese are great and promising data. It is incredible that in such a short period of time this progress with the development of a vaccine and clinical trials within a few months has been achieved. The results on efficacy and safety so far are excellent.  \u201cI think this will have a major impact on our handling of the pandemic and I hope that large quantities of the vaccine will be available quickly. The researchers involved can only be congratulated\u201d.  DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON  In terms of the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic, \u201cit\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s not \u2018overnight success\u2019 good news\u201d.  Altmann cautioned that this and other potentially successful vaccines would still need to be approved and delivered to people across the world, and this will still take many months.  He added, however: \u201cI always felt optimistic, and my optimism remains strong.\u201d  Government reaction:  ITALIAN HEALTH MINISTER ROBERTO SPERANZA  \u201cToday\u2019s news about the anti-COVID vaccine is encouraging. But caution is still needed. Scientific research is the real key to overcoming the emergency. In the meantime, we must never forget that the behaviour of each of us is essential to bend the curve.\u201d  SWITZERLAND\u2019S HEALTH MINISTRY  \u201cWe welcome every advance made by the global efforts to come up with a COVID-19 vaccine. The federal government is working intensively to as quickly as possible to give the Swiss people access to a safe and effective vaccine. We\u2019ve signed two contracts already, with Moderna and AstraZeneca, and we\u2019re currently in negotiations with additional, promising vaccine makers.\u201d  Corporate reaction:  LUCIO ROVATI, CEO OF ITALY\u2019S ROTTAPHARM BIOTECH, WHICH IS WORKING WITH TAKIS BIOTECH ON A COVID-19 VACCINE  \u201cThis is important news. Nothing that was not expected. Anyway, great, great. The problem remains that the data is limited in duration, 28 days after the first inoculation. The problem will be to see how long the coverage lasts. But in any case it is already very important to know that there is an effective vaccine, also because it seems a vaccine well tolerated in the medium term.

The harsh statistics tallied by Reuters cemented the United States' position as the nation worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic, even as drugmaker Pfizer Inc PFE.N provided some hope with successful late-stage tests of its vaccine.  President-elect Joe Biden hailed Pfizer\u2019s progress, but urged Americans to wear masks as he noted a vaccine may not be widely available for many months.  The number of Americans with COVID-19 currently hospitalized has surged around 73% over the past 30 days to at least 59,008 - a record level that surpasses the previous high of 58,370 on July 22. Daily new infections, meanwhile, exceeded 100,000 for the sixth consecutive day.  Hospitalizations are a key metric of how the pandemic is progressing because, unlike case counts, they are not influenced by the number of tests performed.  Texas reported the highest number of hospitalized patients with 6,103, followed by Illinois with 4,409 and California with 3,668 patients, according to the Reuters tally.  Biden, who spent much of his election campaign criticizing President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, pledged over the weekend to make tackling the pandemic a top priority.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Mask wearing has become a political issue in the United States, with Trump mocking Biden for wearing a mask during the campaign and many conservatives contending masks infringe on their individual freedom.  DEATH TOLL RISING  Politics aside, the data shows that the United States is experiencing its worst phase so far of the outbreak. It has reported more than a million new cases in the past 10 days, according to the Reuters tally, the speediest surge in infections since the country reported its first COVID-19 cases, in Washington state, 294 days ago.  More than 770,000 new cases were diagnosed in the week ended Nov. 10, up 34% over the previous seven days, according to the tally. The country has reported a total of around 10.13 million cases.  Deaths over the week to Nov. 10 increased 15%, or more than 6,600 people, over the previous week. That was the highest one-week total since mid-August, taking the overall death toll for the pandemic to more than 238,000.  Worryingly for officials, health experts say the death toll tends to spike four to six weeks after a surge in infections.  In Texas, which became the first U.S. state to surpass one million cumulative coronavirus cases on Saturday, authorities in the El Paso county on Monday said they were bringing in 10 temporary refrigerated morgue trailers in anticipation of further fatalities.

While the highly effective vaccine is designed to be given in two doses around three weeks apart, Britain\u2019s government has opted to extend that time gap to up to 12 weeks to try to swiftly reach as many people as possible with a first dose.  The study released on Tuesday used blood samples from 26 people who had received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks previously to test whether the shot would protect against two variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus - the UK variant, known as B1.1.7., and the South African variant, which has the E484K mutation.  When testing the blood serum samples, all but seven of the participants had levels of antibodies sufficiently high to neutralise the virus \u2013 that is, to protect against infection, the researchers said.  When the scientists added all the key mutations found in B1.1.7 variant, however, they found the efficacy of the vaccine was affected, with, on average, two-fold higher concentrations of antibody required to neutralise the virus.  When the E484K mutation was added, even greater levels of antibody were required for the virus to be neutralised - with an average of a 10-fold increase needed, the researchers said.  Dami Collier, who co-led the work, said the findings suggest \u201ca significant proportion of people aged over 80 may not have developed protective neutralising antibodies against infection three weeks after their first dose of the vaccine.\u201d  Clinical trial data released last week on two other COVID-19 vaccines - from Novavax and Johnson & Johnson - also found the South African coronavirus reduced their ability to protect against the disease.","1000":"FILE PHOTO: Bruce Aylward, International team lead for the WHO-China joint mission on COVID-19 coronavirus attends a news conference after his trip to China at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, 25 February, 2020.

The WHO\u2019s vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX is set to start rolling out vaccines to poor and middle income countries in February with 2 of 3 billion targeted doses expected to be delivered this year.  WHO already has deals with several suppliers, including AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India.  However, critics say the absence of Pfizer\u2019s shot is an important gap and one of the reasons that poorer countries are lagging behind wealthier ones in administering vaccines.  So far, 44 countries out of the 50 that have already begun vaccinations have used the Pfizer shot, WHO data showed.  The vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below which the WHO has said creates difficulties for some developing countries.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday blamed vaccine nationalism for the inequity, saying the world was on the brink of \u201ccatastrophic moral failure\u201d and has urged countries and manufacturers to spread doses more fairly.","1001":"(Reuters) - The European Union officially launched its mass COVID-19 vaccination programme on Sunday with the goal of making shots available to all its adult population by the end of 2021.

Bodo Schackow\/Pool via Reuters  Germany\u2019s BioNTech has sent an initial 12.5 million doses of the vaccine it developed with U.S. drugs giant Pfizer to EU countries. In total, the 27-country region of 450 million people has negotiated contracts for over two billion doses of vaccine from various suppliers.  Non-EU countries including Britain, Switzerland and Serbia have already started vaccinating their populations.  Following are plans for the wider European rollout:  GERMANY  An initial 150,000 doses have been delivered to allow authorities to start the first vaccinations in care homes for the elderly, with further doses due later in the week.  The Harz district in the state of Saxony-Anhalt gave some care home residents the jab on Saturday with the main programme starting on Sunday. Over two million doses - enough to vaccinate more than one million people under the two-dose regimen - will be delivered by the end of the first week of January.  FRANCE  The French campaign kicked off in the Paris region with a 78-year-old woman in a long-term care unit of a public hospital receiving the first shot.  ITALY  Three health workers at the Rome Spallanzani hospital were inoculated early on Sunday. A total of some 480,000 doses are expected to arrive in coming days for administering at 300 sites across Italy, including from temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions in town squares.  SPAIN  A 96-year-old residential home resident and an auxiliary nurse became the first people in Spain to receive a COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday at the facility in Guadalajara, near the capital Madrid. The country will receive 350,000 doses per week of the vaccine starting Dec. 26.  POLAND  In Poland the first five people, all employees of the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior in Warsaw, were the first to be vaccinated. The hospital is due to vaccinate some 250 to 300 of its employees on Sunday, with shots also starting in other hospitals around the country.  NETHERLANDS  The first batch of 10,000 Pfizer\/BioNtech vaccines arrived this weekend but the Netherlands will not start vaccinating until Jan. 8 with the first jabs going to care home workers, home care nurses and those caring for the disabled.  BELGIUM\/LUXEMBOURG  Vaccinations are expected to begin on Dec. 28.  SWEDEN\/DENMARK\/ICELAND\/NORWAY  Sweden and Norway are each expecting an initial batch of 10,000 shots. Norway will focus on deploying them in nursing homes. Denmark expects to have enough shots initially to vaccinate the 40,000 people in nursing homes, followed by those with high risk of illness or healthcare staff. Iceland will receive 10,000 doses around New Year.  PORTUGAL  The first shots on Dec. 27 will be given to frontline health workers from five big hospitals: two in Lisbon, two in Porto and one in Coimbra. About 80,000 Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine doses will be delivered by the end of the year.  HUNGARY  Hungary started vaccinating healthcare workers on Saturday, a day earlier than in most other countries in the European Union. It received a first shipment of vaccines that will be enough to inoculate 4,875 people, state news agency MTI said.  AUSTRIA  In Austria, three women and two men over 80 were the first people to receive the vaccine in Vienna on Sunday morning in the presence of Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  BULGARIA  In Bulgaria, vaccinations started simultaneously in several hospitals in the capital Sofia and cities of Plovdiv and Burgas after the first batch of 9,750 shots arrived on Saturday.  CROATIA  In Croatia, the first person to receive the vaccine was in a residential home for elderly people in the capital Zagreb. Some 2,000 people should receive the vaccine on Sunday across Croatia, mostly in residential homes for elderly people, but also some staff in health centres.","1002":"FILE PHOTO: A teenager receives a vaccination against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Tel Aviv, Israel, January 24, 2021.

Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told a parliamentary panel that new infections and hospital admissions for serious or critical COVID-19 complications were now at record numbers.  But he said he knew of \u201cno serious morbidity\u201d among Israelis eligible for the vaccination certificate - a document issued by the state a week after the second dose is administered, when Pfizer says the vaccine is 95% effective. He said 0.014% had contracted milder forms of COVID-19.  Israel began what has become the world\u2019s fastest per capita distribution of vaccines against the new coronavirus on Dec. 19, using the shot developed by the American firm Pfizer Inc. and Germany\u2019s BioNTech.  According to Health Ministry figures, 23% have received the first shot and more than 6% the second, between 21 and 28 days later.  The ministry blames highly communicable variants originating abroad for setbacks in Israel\u2019s bid to halt the spread of the virus.  A week after beginning vaccinations, it imposed its third national lockdown, which officials say may need to be extended into February.  But last Thursday it reported a reproduction number - known as \u201cR\u201d - of less than 1, which indicates that epidemic is no longer growing.","1003":"KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 16 (Reuters) - Malaysia will receive its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines produced by U.S. and German drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech on Feb. 21, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Tuesday.

The applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) came a day after Moderna sought emergency use for its shot in the United States and more than a week after Pfizer and BioNTech did the same.  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month.  \u201cWe can start to deliver within a few hours (of an approval),\u201d said Sierk Poetting, head of operations and finance at BioNTech. \u201cWe have been stocking up. And everything that is there can really be distributed within a few hours.\u201d  The EMA clouded the timeline, however, when it said it would complete its review for that vaccine by Dec. 29 at the latest, and for Moderna\u2019s shot by Jan. 12. It added its schedule may be subject to change as its evaluation proceeds.  The European Commission, the EU executive body, said it would likely give its final authorization for a vaccine\u2019s rollout days after a recommendation by the EMA.  An effective immunization is seen as the main weapon against the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.4 million lives and ravaged economies across the globe. Close to 50 potential vaccines are being tested on volunteers worldwide.  FILE PHOTO: Biontech's logo is seen through a 3D-printed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken November 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  Both U.S. biotech firm Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech have reported preliminary findings of more than 90% effectiveness - an unexpectedly high rate - in trials of their vaccines, which are both based on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.  CUSTOMISED GENETIC CODE  Their work validates that of several biotech experts, who for years have been labouring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory.  Both inoculations work by injecting people with customised genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response.  Pfizer and BioNTech reported final trial results on Nov. 18 that showed their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns.  Moderna Inc said on Monday that full results from a late-stage study showed its candidate, mRNA-1273, was 94.1% effective, also with no serious safety concerns.  Any clearance in the EU and United States for the vaccines will be \u201cconditional\u201d or for \u201cemergency use\u201d, meaning developers are obliged to continue trials and provide more trial results as they emerge.  The European filings complete so-called rolling reviews, initiated by the EMA on Oct. 6 in the case of Pfizer and on Nov. 16 for Moderna, aimed at speeding up the process by doing a real-time assessment of the data as it lands.  The EMA said on Tuesday it had started a rolling review of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine candidate after preliminary results showed it triggered production of antibodies and immune cells against the virus. The review will go on until enough evidence ss available for a formal marketing authorisation application, the regulator added.  The British government said here last week that Pfizer and BioNTech had reported the data from their clinical trials to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).","1005":"April 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS - URGES PFIZER SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 7 FOR CORPORATE POLITICAL SPENDING DISCLOSURE Source text: (bit.ly\/2HajfWb) Further company coverage:","1006":"In the weeks after drug manufacturers Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Pfizer-BioNTech announced successful clinical trial results for their respective COVID-19 vaccine candidates, posts on social media implied they were unsafe by making misleading comparisons of the speed of COVID-19 vaccine development and ongoing efforts to find cures for HIV\/AIDS, cancer and the common cold.  FILE PHOTO: Vials of AstraZeneca's COVISHIELD, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, are seen before they are packaged inside a lab at Serum Institute of India, Pune, India, November 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas\/File Photo\/File Photo  Such posts \u2013 which read, \u201c40 years of research\u2026 no vaccine for HIV \/ At least 100 years of research\u2026 no vaccine for cancer \/ Ongoing research\u2026 no vaccine for the common cold \/ Less than a year for a Covid vaccine?\u201d \u2013 can be found here , here and here .  The Reuters Fact Check has previously debunked claims comparing vaccine efforts for COVID-19 to influenza, RSV (common cold) and cancer (here and comparing the efficacy of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines here ).  HIV\/AIDS  As of 2017, half of all people living with HIV worldwide are receiving antiretroviral treatment, also known as ART (here). HIV.gov explains that when \u201cpeople living with HIV achieve and maintain viral suppression by taking HIV medication daily as prescribed, they can stay healthy and have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their partners.\u201d  Finding an HIV vaccine has been challenging because the virus \u201cmutates rapidly and has unique ways of evading the immune system,\u201d according to the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (here). While typical vaccines imitate recovered patients\u2019 immune response, \u201cthere are no documented cases of a person living with HIV developing an immune response that cleared the infection.\u201d  While vaccines are usually inactivated or weakened viruses, \u201cinactivated HIV was not effective at eliciting immune responses in clinical trials\u201d and \u201ca live form of HIV is too dangerous to use\u201d (here).  Using the same technique as Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines, a new investigational HIV vaccine from Moderna relies on messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus (here).  CANCER  With the statement \u201cAt least 100 years of research\u2026 no vaccine for cancer,\u201d the social media posts falsely portray cancer as a communicable disease. Unlike AIDS, caused by human immunodeficiency viruses, or COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2, cancer is not typically caused by viruses or bacteria, which is what vaccines protect the body against (here).  \u201cThere is no one single cause for cancer,\u201d Stanford University Healthcare points out. Instead, scientists believe that it is the interaction of many factors together that produces cancer. The factors involved may be genetic, environmental, or constitutional characteristics of the individual\u201d (here).  There are, however, several viruses that can increase one\u2019s risk for certain cancers, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), Human papillomavirus (HPV), and Human T-cell leukemia virus type (HTLV-1) (here , here ).  The HPV vaccine can help reduce risk of cervical cancer and the hepatitis B vaccine can help reduce your risk of liver cancer (here). Regular screening, practicing safe sex, and not sharing syringes or needles are recommended means of prevention for the other viruses mentioned.  As for bacteria, the American Cancer Society says that long-term stomach infection with Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria can cause ulcers that may lead to cancer over time (here).  In addition, infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, a common type of bacteria that can be transmitted through sex and affect the female reproductive system, may increase one\u2019s risk for cervical cancer, according to some studies (here).  There are currently no vaccines on the market for preventing either kind of bacterial infection, though scientists are working to develop them (here , here).  THE COMMON COLD  WebMD explains that finding an effective vaccine for the common cold has been difficult \u201cprimarily because there are more than 200 different varieties of viruses that can cause colds\u201d (here).  As stated here by Scientific American, scientists have been searching for a cure for the common cold since the 1950s, when rhinoviruses were first identified as a leading cause.  With at least 160 different strains of rhinovirus alone, \u201ccracking the cold isn\u2019t so much looking for one solution to one problem as it is trying to design a master key to open hundreds of different locks at once,\u201d Peter Barlow, an immunologist at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland, told Scientific American.  THE COVID-19 VACCINE  The COVID-19 vaccine is targeting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease (here). Initial research suggests that there are at least six strains of SARS-CoV-2 but that the mutation rate is low and the virus shows little variability, making it easier to develop a vaccine (here , here).  In November 2020, drug manufacturers AstraZeneca (here) , Moderna (here) and Pfizer-BioNTech (here) announced successful final trial results for their respective COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Final vaccine trial data showed that the COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were over 90% effective with no serious side effects (here , here).  The first round of vaccinations are expected to be administered in the United States as soon as the COVID-19 vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug administration (FDA), which will review Pfizer\u2019s trial data on Dec. 10 and Moderna\u2019s on Dec. 17 (here).  VACCINE DEVELOPMENT TIME  Compared to HIV, cancer and the cold, COVID-19\u2019s infection rate and the immediate economic impact to the world economy certainly contributed to the speed of the vaccine\u2019s development (here).  The speed has created concerns among the public and countries are watching Britain, the first country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, for information about possible side effects (here , here ).  Vaccines have to go through a number of stages before they are approved (here).  There has been a huge global effort to pool resources in order to accelerate the development and production of the COVID-19 vaccine (here).  In April 2020, the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator (here) was launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, bringing together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, philanthropists and global health organizations to support the development and distribution of tests, treatments and vaccines.  As the WHO explains, in the case of COVID-19, unprecedented financial investments and scientific collaborations have made it possible for some steps in research and development to happen \u201cin parallel.\u201d For example, some clinical trials are evaluating multiple vaccines at the same time, though clinical and safety standards are maintained despite the acceleration (here).  VERDICT  Missing context. The posts make a false comparison by juxtaposing the quick timeline of the COVID-19 vaccine with the lack of a vaccine for HIV\/AIDS, cancer, and the common cold. Finding an effective HIV vaccine is difficult because the virus rapidly mutates. Cancer is not a communicable disease and is not commonly caused by viruses, though a handful of viruses do increase one\u2019s risk for certain cancers. Finding a vaccine for the common cold is difficult as there are over 200 different varieties of viruses that can cause colds.  This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

The country\u2019s National Health Service is giving priority to vaccinating people over the age of 80, frontline healthcare workers and nursing home staff and residents.  Here is what people getting the vaccine should expect.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE GETS THE VACCINE?  The vaccine, developed with new messenger RNA technology using a manufactured fragment of the coronavirus\u2019 genetic code, is injected into the arm. The immunization is given in two doses, three weeks apart, and has been shown in trials to protect up to 95% of recipients from contracting COVID-19.  Pfizer has said side effects in trial volunteers were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The most severe side effects occurred after the second dose: fatigue in 3.8% of volunteers and headache in 2%. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.  WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION DOES IT GIVE?  The vaccine prevented COVID-19 illness seven days after the second injection - which is about a month after the first shot.  Clinical trials so far have not been designed to determine if an immunized person can still spread the coronavirus to someone else. Some vaccines, such as hepatitis A, do provide such protection - known as sterilizing immunity - but others do not. COVID-19 vaccine makers focused trials on determining whether the drug stopped people from getting ill.  It will also be several more months before it becomes clear how long the vaccination will protect someone from coronavirus infection.  \u201cUntil then, it is better to avoid the pub, and other in-person gatherings with many people,\u201d said Dr. Anita Shet, infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  DOES THE VACCINE MEAN BACK TO NORMAL LIFE?  Since there is no evidence that the immunization prevents transmission of the virus - and no vaccine is 100% effective - scientists call for continued vigilance, including mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing. \u201cAs with all vaccines, it may work really great in certain patient subsets, but not as well in others ... Does that mean you are free to hop on a plane or have 30 people over at your house? Probably not,\u201d said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director for infection prevention at Colorado\u2019s UCHealth.  She said vaccination campaigns are unlikely to reach \u201ca critical mass\u201d until next spring or early summer.

The potential treatment is the fourth early-stage COVID-19 drug to show promise in human testing, along with projects involving Moderna, CanSino Biologics and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.  BioNTech\u2019s shares were up about 8%, after rising as much as 19% to reach their highest in more than three months.  Pfizer stock also gained, rising 4.4% to $34.13. In turn, shares in some rival vaccine developers, such as Moderna and Novavax Inc dropped.  BioNTech said testing of two dosages of its BNT162b1 drug on 24 healthy volunteers showed that after 28 days they had developed higher levels of COVID-19 antibodies than typically seen in infected people.  It said the higher of the two doses - both administered via two injections within three weeks of one another - was followed by a short fever in three out of four participants after the second shot.  A third dosage, tested at a higher concentration in a separate group, was not repeated after the first shot because of injection pain.  \u201cThese first trial results show that the vaccine yields immune activity and causes a strong immune response,\u201d said BioNTech\u2019s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin.  He said larger trials were being prepared to show whether this translates into protection against a real infection.  \u201cWhile more work needs to be done, we believe the benefits appear to outweigh the risks so far, especially when considering the disease the vaccine is trying to prevent,\u201d Mizuho Securities analyst Divan Vamil said in a note.  Bernstein analysts said their initial impression was that the data was \u201csolid\u201d, but noted they don\u2019t expect the initial generation of vaccines to be silver bullets in terms of conferring nearly complete protection.  PEER REVIEW  No COVID-19 vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis last year found that about one in three vaccines in the first stage of testing later gains approval.  BioNTech, which listed on the U.S. Nasdaq in October, said the data demonstrated that BNT162b1 could be administered in a dose that was well tolerated with only temporary side effects.  Early-stage human trials of vaccines are designed to measure certain antibodies and other immune markers in the blood as an indicator of the body\u2019s readiness to fight an infection that then requires further validation.  The pharmaceutical industry is eager to launch larger follow-up trials to see how vaccinated participants react to real infections over longer periods.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Brokerage SVB Leerink said these larger studies are required for vaccine approval and adoption, and the timing for approval will be dependent on the trials and their results, and not more abbreviated smaller interim studies.  BioNTech and Pfizer will now pick the most promising of four experimental vaccines for a trial involving up to 30,000 healthy participants, which is likely to begin in the United States and Europe in late July, if it gets the regulatory green light.  If it eventually gets marketing approval, the companies are gearing up to make up to 100 million doses by the end of 2020 and another 1.2 billion doses by the end of 2021 at sites in Germany and the United States.  Results from early-stage testing of BioNTech\u2019s three other potential vaccines are yet to be published.  The manuscript with the preliminary data from the clinical trials, which were launched in April and May, is under peer review for publication in a scientific journal, BioNTech said.

The vaccine, developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, won emergency-use approval from federal regulators on Friday after it was found to be 95% effective in preventing illness in a large clinical trial.  The first 2.9 million doses began to be shipped to distribution centers around the country on Sunday, just 11 months after the United States documented its first COVID-19 infections.  Up till Monday, the United States had registered 16,286,343 cases and 299,489 deaths from the virus.  In New York, a doctor who works at Lenox Hill Hospital and a nurse who works at Long Island Jewish Medical Center were to be among the first to receive the vaccine publicly at Long Island Jewish Medical Center on Monday, according to Northwell Health, the largest hospital system in the state.  \u201cBoth Dr. Duroseau and Nurse Lindsay have worked tirelessly to ease the suffering of COVID-19 patients since the virus outbreak began in New York 10 months ago,\u201d Northwell said in a statement.  \u201cIt is their hope that their willingness to be among the first to be vaccinated in the region will serve as an example to the general public to take advantage of this life-saving treatment.\u201d  Hospitals in Texas, Utah and Minnesota said they also anticipated receiving their first doses of the vaccine at select hospitals on Monday, to be administered right away.  The first U.S. shipments of coronavirus vaccine departed from Pfizer\u2019s facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, on Sunday, packed into trucks with dry-ice to maintain the necessary sub-Arctic temperatures, and then were transported to UPS and FedEx planes waiting at air fields in Lansing and Grand Rapids, kicking off a national immunization endeavor of unprecedented complexity.  The jets delivered the shipments to UPS and FedEx\u2019s respective cargo hubs in Louisville and Memphis, from where they were loaded onto planes and trucks to be distributed to the first 145 of 636 vaccine-staging areas across the country. A second and third waves of vaccine shipments were due to go out to the remaining sites on Tuesday and Wednesday.  \u201cThis is the most difficult vaccine rollout in history. There will be hiccups undoubtedly but we\u2019ve done everything from a federal level and working with partners to make it go as smoothly as possible. Please be patient with us,\u201d Surgeon General Jerome Adams told Fox News on Monday, adding that he would get the shot as soon as he can.  The massive logistical effort is further complicated by the need to transport and store the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine at minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), requiring enormous quantities of dry ice or specialized ultra-cold freezers.

The number of registered COVID-19 deaths jumped by a record 952 on Wednesday. The previous record was 598 last Friday.  However, Wednesday\u2019s figures are not entirely comparable to previous days because they were inflated by a technical problem in one state, said the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases, which collates the data.  Fears that the pandemic is spiralling out of control prompted Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors to announce on Sunday a tough lockdown from Dec. 16 until at least Jan. 10.  Shops and schools will stay shut in a pre-Christmas tightening of restrictions following a partial lockdown in November, which closed bars and restaurants but failed to contain a second wave of the pandemic.  Germany was more successful than many countries in keeping the coronavirus under control in the first wave in the spring but the situation looks different now.  The Robert Koch Institute put the number of confirmed cases at 1,379,238, an increase of 27,728. The total death toll in Germany is 23,427.

News of Pfizer Inc's vaccine, which the drugmaker is developing with German partner BioNTech, comes after global markets were jolted by the halting of two high-profiled COVID-19 vaccine trials earlier in the week. The MSCI's index for Latin American currencies rose 0.1% but was headed for a weekly decline of more than 1%. Chile's peso rose 1%, making gains for the first time in five day after the country's central bank left its benchmark rate steady at 0.5% on Thursday, maintaining its efforts to revive the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The peso was also supported by strengthening prices of copper, Chile's biggest export, as demand from China continued to improve. Mexico's peso added 0.8%, and was set to outpace its Latam peers for the week. The country's currency has been benefiting from an economic rebound in the United States, its main trading partner. The Argentine peso held steady after the central bank said on Thursday it will lower the benchmark Leliq rate to 36% from the previous level of 37%, while raising the reverse repo rate three points to 30%, as part of a wider push to harmonize interest rates. \"The lack of a clear and comprehensive reaction by the authorities to the notorious denachoring in expectations is creating a vicious circle and leading to a fast deterioration in the economic situation in the country,\" emerging markers FX strategists at Citigroup said.

Vials of AstraZeneca's COVISHIELD, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine are seen inside a visual inspection machine inside a lab at the Serum Institute of India, in Pune, India, 30 November 2020. Picture taken November 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas  The deal comes in a week that AstraZeneca said it was conducting further research to confirm whether its COVID-19 vaccine could be 90% effective, potentially slowing its rollout, and as a rival shot from Pfizer was launched in Britain and approved for use in the United States.  The British company said on Saturday that Alexion shareholders would receive $60 in cash and about $115 worth of equity per share - either in AstraZeneca\u2019s UK-traded ordinary shares or in dollar-denominated American Depositary Shares.  Based on a reference average ADR price of $54.14, that implies a total price of $175 per share. Alexion shares closed at around $121 apiece on Friday.  \u201cIt is a tremendous opportunity for us to accelerate our development in immunology, getting into a new segment of disease, a new segment of physicians, and patients we haven\u2019t been able to cover so far,\u201d AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told a media call.  Alexion\u2019s best-selling drug is Soliris, used against a range of rare immune-disorders including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which causes anaemia and blood clots, and whose revenue rose 3.6% in the first nine months to $3 billion.  AstraZeneca hopes that an improved version of Soliris called Ultomiris has an even larger market potential. It expects more growth from introducing the target\u2019s rare-disease treatments to China and other emerging markets.  The British firm said the boards of both companies had approved the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021.  AstraZeneca was once seen as leading the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, but has fallen behind Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, as well as Moderna, whose shots have shown greater efficacy in late-stage clinical trials.  With a planned capital increase of about $25 billion after the deal closure, Soriot is looking to harness a strong advance by AstraZeneca stock, driven by the stellar growth of new cancer drugs.  The shares have climbed about 70% through the past three years. A precursor cash call, on a much smaller scale, was a $3.5 billion issue last year to fund the purchase of rights to cancer drug Enhertu from Daiichi Sankyo.  RARE DISEASES  Despite generating billions in cash from treatments such as Soliris, one of the most expensive drugs in the world costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, Alexion shares have struggled in recent years as investors have worried about competition heating up.  That had led it to be seen as a possible bid target.  Hedge fund and activist investor Elliott Management has urged Alexion to seek a buyer and in May spoke out publicly.  The fund, which had held private meetings with the company, said CEO Ludwig Hantson\u2019s go-it-alone approach had failed to gain traction and opposed its plan to buy rivals to diversify its research pipeline.  Elliott first invested in Alexion in 2017 when the share price was only slightly lower than Friday\u2019s close of $120.98. Elliott did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  AstraZeneca said it expected the deal to immediately boost core earnings and to deliver pretax synergy gains of around $500 million per year. It also expects around $650 million in one-time cash costs during the three years following completion.  Speaking on an analyst call, 61-year-old Soriot said the deal should put to rest speculation he was on his way out, as he was determined to stay on board to see the strategic benefits of the transaction delivered.  Soriot also told reporters the deal was the result of exclusive talks and no competitive bidder was involved.  AstraZeneca finance chief Marc Dunoyer said a capital increase for the equity component of the transaction would take place on closure of the deal.  On AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, Soriot said it wasn\u2019t yet clear if the company would need results from a U.S. clinical trial before filing for approval with U.S. regulators.  Assuming positive results from that trial, the company should be able to submit the vaccine to U.S. regulators within the next six weeks, he added.","1028":"JAKARTA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Indonesia has secured 155.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccines and is seeking another 116 million through deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and global vaccine programme COVAX, government data showed on Thursday.

A few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine.\u201d  AYFER ALI, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT WARWICK BUSINESS SCHOOL WHO SPECIALISES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY:  \u201cThe approval of the Pfizer vaccine is a landmark moment in the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic. However, if we need to vaccinate the whole population, or at least a large portion of it, we need all the vaccines we can get.\u201d  \u201cOther vaccines, which have not yet been approved, may have better profiles in terms of protecting different populations, such as the elderly. They may also be easier to administer logistically because they need fewer shots or are easier to store and transport.\u201d  \u201cCompetition is also good in achieving a better price, especially for lower income countries faced with vaccinated large populations.\u201d  MICHAEL HEAD, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW IN GLOBAL HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON:  \u201cThis is excellent news and a huge landmark in the global efforts to address this pandemic. The regulators have clearly been satisfied with the data presented to them.\u201d  \u201cThe Pfizer vaccine does require storage at around -70C, which will pose significant logistical challenges for all countries that choose to use it. These are not insurmountable but certainly challenging.\u201d  \u201cOther vaccines, such as the Oxford AstraZeneca candidate, require storage at much lesser temperatures and will be simpler to transport. Given we will certainly need more than one licensed vaccine to maximise global coverage, everyone will still be eagerly waiting for further developments from Oxford and Moderna.\u201d  LIAM SMEETH, PROFESSOR OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND POPULATION HEALTH, LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL MEDICINE:  \u201cThe continued progress on vaccines is fantastic news. A route towards a much better situation in the UK is becoming clear. A further circuit breaker in January or possibly February is likely to be needed. But, it is realistic to hope that by March or April the vast majority of older people, care home residents, and those with severe conditions will have been immunised.\u201d  \u201cWe can then work towards wider immunisation \u2013 with ideally much of the population covered in time for next winter. Life won\u2019t ever be the same as it was before Covid-19, but it will feel a whole lot better than now.\u201d  \u201cFor the foreseeable future - and maybe forever - we are very unlikely to reach the situation we are in with smallpox (gone), polio (almost gone), or measles (controlled in populations with high enough vaccine coverage). Instead, we are going to need to find ways to fairly happily live alongside this virus.\u201d  ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL  \u201cWith 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks. However, we need new independent clinical trials to monitor long-term safety and efficacy.\u201d  FRENCH PRIME MINISTER JEAN CASTEX told BFM TV that a European decision was expected towards the end of December.  \u201cFrom what I know, it\u2019s due in the days ahead, more likely towards the end of December than the beginning.\u201d  \u201cI will never take the risk of vaccinating people without the having approval to put (the vaccine) on the market by the competent authorities.\u201d  JAMES ATHEY, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN STANDARD INVESTMENTS:  \u201cIncoming news surrounding the development and distribution of COVID vaccinations continues to be unequivocally positive, and subsequently, is being cheered and welcomed by financial markets that are desperate for good news.\u201d  \u201cThis morning\u2019s announcement that vaccination in the UK could begin as early as next week saw further gains for sterling following yesterday\u2019s strong performance following the Times Radio report that Brexit negotiations have entered the final and crucial stage. However, these gains have been stopped in their tracks by a subsequent headline suggesting that EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told EU ambassadors that there may not be a Brexit deal after all.\u201d  SYLVAIN GOYON, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY AT ODDO BHF IN PARIS:  \u201cStock market reactions following the Pfizer and Moderna announcements already reflect bets of a rapid normalization. To this extent the UK registration is somewhat already priced in\u201d  MIKE BELL, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  \u201cApproval of a highly effective vaccine may mark the beginning of the end to the Covid-19 economic turmoil and the beginning of a new bull market for equities.\u201d  \u201cThe scientists have come to the rescue and delivered what investors were hoping for Christmas this year. As this year\u2019s savings are spent next year, the global economy should boom driving corporate profits and equities higher in 2021.\u201d  DANNY ALTMANN, PROFESSOR OF IMMUNOLOGY AT IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON:  \u201cExciting news keeps coming, but this really is momentous. Nobody knew how the battle to find effective vaccines would pan out. Now, less than 11 months from the first characterisation of the virus sequence, we have the first emergency approval for use of a really effective vaccine. Truly heroic.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think we should get too hung up on \u2018the race\u2019 and this as the 1st approval.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  That opens the door for its early use in hard to reach places that might not be appropriate for Pfizer Inc\u2019s vaccine which needs ultra-cold storage.  Here are details of how it could be distributed.  HOW COLD IS COLD STORAGE?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine is stable for up to six months at a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), about home freezer levels, when shipped and stored.  The company said it expects the vaccine to be stable when kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days, up from an initial projection of 7 days. The vaccine will be distributed in 10-dose vials and can be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours after thawing.  By comparison, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine can be transported and stored for up to 6 months at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F). It can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to five days.  WHEN WILL IT BE SHIPPED, TO WHOM?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine will be distributed by the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program. U.S. health officials have said that at first they are most likely to distribute vaccines to healthcare workers, people who are in nursing homes, first responders and those with health conditions who are high-risk.  Most Americans will be inoculated in May or June, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert.  Under Operation Warp Speed\u2019s distribution plan, the first group of shots will likely be distributed to and administered in closed settings, like hospitals and nursing homes.  After January, as supply increases, those shots will start to be available in pharmacies, doctors offices and clinics as well as mobile clinics, the plan shows.  Health officials have said it will be easier to use Moderna\u2019s vaccine in these settings than Pfizer\u2019s.  HOW WELL DOES THE MODERNA VACCINE WORK?  Moderna on Monday said its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 based on early results from large studies. That is similar to Pfizer\u2019s which the U.S. drugmaker has said is more than 90% effective.

Pfizer declined to comment beyond its previous statement. Pfizer said on Jan. 15 it will make up for the slowdown in deliveries with manufacturing changes that will boost output.  The government statement added the special commissioner will also assess in the coming hours what further action to take at national and European levels.  If Pfizer does not meet its contractual obligations, the drug group could be accused of breaching the contract it has signed with the European Union on member states\u2019 behalf, an Italian source familiar with the matter said.  The company will be given a few days to respond, at most one week, the person added.  Maker of the rival AstraZeneca vaccine also said initial supplies to the continent would fall short because of a production glitch.  On Saturday Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the delays in vaccine supplies amounted to a serious breach of contractual obligations, adding that Italy would use all available legal tools.","1048":"LONDON\/GENEVA (Reuters) - A facility set up by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the GAVI vaccine group has exceeded an interim target of raising more than $2 billion to buy and distribute COVID-19 shots for poorer countries, but said it still needs more.

The European Commission, France, Spain, South Korea, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and others had in recent weeks pledged another $360 million to the AMC, the alliance said, bringing total funding over the $2 billion target for this year.  Another $5 billion will be needed in 2021 to procure COVID-19 vaccine doses as they come through development and are approved by regulators, GAVI said in a statement.  Berkley also welcomed the U.S. presidential election outcome, adding he expected to have talks with president-elect Joe Biden\u2019s team about the COVAX plan.  \u201cIt\u2019s positive that the incoming administration has already established a COVID-19 task force filled with many scientists we know are believers in science and moving this forward,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe U.S. is already one of GAVI\u2019s biggest supporters, they care enormously about vaccines for the developing world.

King County, which represents greater Seattle, has $14 million of COVID-19 funding for 2021, roughly what it spends in a month to run public testing sites and other services, and a fraction of the $87 million emergency COVID-19 aid it received in 2020, said Ingrid Ulrey, the public health policy director for King County.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been on pins and needles the whole last three or four months, watching what\u2019s happening at the federal level, waiting, watching,\u201d she said. When newly approved federal funds finally trickle down to her level, she expects them to be less than this year, insufficient and too late.  \u201cIt\u2019s shockingly low,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have a huge new, unprecedented, daunting task of vaccine delivery.\u201d King County is at risk of being unable to hire the up to 40 additional nurses and administrators needed to begin the next wave of public vaccinations.  In counties across the United States, the funding crisis has limited the hiring of needed vaccine staff, delayed the creation of vaccination centers, and undermined efforts to raise public awareness, officials told Reuters.  The federal government spent more than $10 billion to speed COVID-19 vaccine development but has so far disbursed little funding for distribution, even as it pushed the responsibility of actual immunizations onto state and local governments.  A new $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package provides $8.75 billion to states to assist in vaccinations, in line with what state and local officials had requested, but months after distribution work should have begun.  \u201cThe Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states. Now it is up to the states to administer. Get moving!\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Wednesday.  The promised wave of newly approved vaccinations has been only a ripple: 2.6 million Americans have received a shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, far fewer than the 20 million the federal government promised for December.  Nearly 10 million of the 12.4 million doses the government has distributed to states sit unused, and on Tuesday, President Elect Joe Biden said it would take years, not months, to vaccinate most Americans at the current pace.  Hospitals and pharmacies CVS and Walgreens are in charge of the first wave of vaccinations of health care workers and long term care residents. But local health systems will take a leading role in immunizing the next, bigger waves, and will be critical for groups such as the uninsured, underinsured, homeless and others.  The shortage of local public health staff will only grow more challenging as the vaccination effort expands to essential workers and older Americans, said Claire Hannan, the director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a trade group for local public health departments.  Brandon Meline, logistics chief for Illinois\u2019s Champaign-Urbana Public Health District said their district was tapping a rainy day fund until more federal assistance arrives.  \u201cWe\u2019re four weeks into significant planning and two weeks into active distribution and we don\u2019t have a secure funding stream,\u201d Meline said in a Christmas Eve interview while waiting for a vaccine shipment to arrive.  Coconino County, the largest in Arizona, needs to hire around 20 people to run vaccination clinics and get to residents who live hours from hospitals, including some who are at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, said Kim Musselman, director of the county\u2019s health and human services department.  Musselman said its nurses are stretched thin as they staff the free vaccination clinic it set up in Coconino County and will struggle to maintain it, let alone set up additional clinics, without more funding. The state has not signaled help is forthcoming.  \u201cWe have been told, because we\u2019ve repeatedly asked, is there any public assistance reimbursement for vaccine-related expenditures?

That would be enough to inoculate three million people as both vaccines require two shots about a month apart.

Located 65 km (40 miles) below Seoul and boasting temperatures frostier than an Antarctic winter, the facility would be the best, perhaps only, place in South Korea suitable for bulk storage of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, says company CEO Kim Jin-ha.  \u201cAs soon as we heard about the Pfizer vaccine, we started getting ready... other options wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Kim told Reuters, adding that the warehouse\u2019s use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to keep temperatures cool trumped electricity.  Warehouses which use electricity would have difficulty maintaining the -70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) required by the vaccine for storage and carry the risk of the temperature rising during a power blackout, he said.  The company, which is backed by Goldman Sachs and SK Holdings Co Ltd, has been in talks with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency since early November and while nothing is yet decided, expectations are high it will land a contract.  The agency has asked Korea Superfreeze to provide plans and cost estimates for storing and distributing vaccines, including how it would handle a scenario where vaccines would be shipped to 260 different locations, Kim said.  South Korea has arranged to buy 20 million doses of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech .  The country also has deals for 20 million doses each for the vaccines developed by Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc \/Oxford University and for another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson.  In total, that would be enough to inoculate 34 million people in a country of 51.8 million and shipments are expected to begin no later than March.  Kim said, however, it was not clear to him if the agency would tap the company for vaccines other than Pfizer\u2019s which have less onerous cold storage requirements. Moderna\u2019s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20 C while AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine needs only normal fridge temperatures.  To accommodate Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, Korea Superfreeze is planning a dedicated passageway and elevator so there is no interference from outside temperatures. Once it confirms it has a contract, it will begin construction which may take 2-3 months.  The warehouse also has 220 closed-circuit cameras that monitor resting cargo round the clock, Kim said.  He added that South Korea and Japan were the only countries with LNG-powered facilities which can offer storage at these temperatures and that the warehouses in Japan were much smaller and more remotely located due to earthquake risks.  All in all, the Korea Superfreeze rooms capable of storing goods at -70 C add up to 1,600 square metres (17,222 square feet). But just how much of that will be needed remains unclear as the company has not yet ascertained how big the containers carrying the vaccines will be and how much will be shipped to South Korea at a time.

U.S. economic growth is moderating as the coronavirus spreads and fiscal help fades, Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said on Wednesday. Raising gold's appeal for other currency holders, the dollar held near a 2-1\/2 year low. Non-yielding bullion, which has risen over 20% so far this year, tends to benefit from widespread stimulus measures because it is widely viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement that could result from the stimulus. The stimulus would drive \"some physical demand, encourage notions of problematic price inflation in the coming months,\" said Kitco Metals senior analyst Jim Wyckoff. Gold, however, registered its worst monthly performance in four years in November, weighed down by optimism over a vaccine-fuelled economic rebound.

The Global Times, a tabloid published by the People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, has published more than ten reports in the past week critical of vaccines and inoculation schemes in the West.  About half of them have referred to reported deaths of some highly frail patients in Norway after being inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccine developed Pfizer and its partner BioNTech.  In a Jan. 15 editorial, the Global Times accused mainstream U.S. and British news outlets of \u201cdeliberately downplaying the deaths\u201d and \u201cusing propaganda power to promote the Pfizer vaccine and smearing Chinese vaccines.\u201d  \u201cThose major Western media will immediately hype any unfavourable information about Chinese vaccines and try to amplify their impact on public psychology,\u201d it said.

FILE PHOTO: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies during the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 31, 2020. Kevin Dietsch\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  Britain announced the approval of the vaccine on Wednesday, with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) saying it had rigorously assessed the vaccine data and had cut no corners.  It gave the UK the jump in the race to begin mass inoculation against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally and hammered the world economy. U.S. and European Union regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval.  In a CBS interview on Thursday, Fauci suggested the British regulators had failed to scrutinize the data carefully enough and had waved the vaccine through - comments that were prominently reported on the main British TV news channels.  He later gave an interview to the BBC in which he said his earlier comments had come out wrong.  \u201cThere really has been a misunderstanding, and for that I\u2019m sorry, and I apologize for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community in the UK,\u201d Fauci said.  \u201cI did not mean to apply any sloppiness (to the UK regulatory process), even though it came out that way,\u201d he added.  Fauci said the point he had been trying to make was that in the U.S. context, with widespread vaccine scepticism, it would not have been appropriate to conduct the process in the same way and at the same speed as what happened in Britain.  \u201cIf we had for example approved it yesterday or tomorrow, there likely would have been pushback on an already scrutinising society,\u201d he said.  \u201cYou know, at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to be safe, it\u2019s going to be effective, the people in the UK are going to receive it and they\u2019re going to do really well, and the people in the United States are going to receive it and we\u2019re going to do pretty well,\u201d Fauci said.  In response to his earlier criticism, the MHRA issued a statement saying it had \u201crigorously assessed the data in the shortest time possible without compromising the thoroughness of our review\u201d.  The regulator also said its emergency approval had allowed \u201csome stages of this process to happen in parallel to condense the time needed, but it does not mean steps and the expected standards of safety, quality and effectiveness have been bypassed\u201d.  Fauci is the most high-profile member of the White House coronavirus task force and has often clashed with President Donald Trump on how to protect Americans from the virus, which has caused about 273,000 U.S. deaths.

[nW1N2HQ0GG]","1082":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday that its drug tafamidis reduced the risk of death for patients with a rare and fatal heart disease by around 30 percent, boosting the prospects of what could be a billion-dollar-a-year drug.  The Pfizer logo is seen at their world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014. REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/File photo  The study showed that tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality over a 30-month period in patients with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy to 29.5 percent, versus 42.9 percent in patients who received a placebo. It also reduced the rate of cardiovascular-related hospitalization by around 32 percent, Pfizer said.  The data was presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Munich.  \u201cThe result is really, phenomenally encouraging and gives fantastic hope for patients with this devastating illness,\u201d said Dr. Brenda Cooperstone, chief development officer of rare disease at Pfizer. \u201cIt\u2019s a uniformly fatal disease.\u201d  Tafamidis is one of 15 potential blockbuster treatments Pfizer is trying to develop. The company\u2019s chief executive officer, Ian Read, has touted Pfizer\u2019s pipeline, arguing that the growth potential from these drugs makes undertaking a large transaction unnecessary.  There are currently no approved medications in the United States for transthyretin cardiomyopathy. The number of patients currently diagnosed with the progressive disease is exceedingly small -- somewhere in the range of 2,000 to 5,000 patients globally.  But Pfizer believes the disease is underdiagnosed and that there could be 400,000 to 500,000 patients in developed markets around the world. Cooperstone said the current diagnosis rate is only around 0.5 percent to 1 percent.  \u201cPart of that is driven by the fact that today there is no therapy - there\u2019s no reason to actually make the diagnosis,\u201d she said, noting that a real treatment should significantly help improve the diagnosis rate.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the drug breakthrough status in May after Pfizer released topline results from the study, which could accelerate the drug\u2019s approval.  Cooperstone said Pfizer expects to complete the submission of its application for tafamidis to the FDA in the fourth quarter. The agency has committed to reviewing it as fast as possible, she said, but declined to lay out a timeline for approval.  Until then, Pfizer has established an expanded access program to make the drug available to patients prior to regulatory approval.  SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said in a research note last week that a second-half submission to regulators suggests approval and launch of the drug in 2019. He said that at an annual price of $150,000 to $300,000, the drug could bring in $600 million to $1.2 billion globally.  The study had around 440 patients enrolled.  Tafamidis was previously rejected by the FDA as treatment for a rare neurodegenerative disease. But it is currently approved, under the brand name Vyndaqel, in 40 other countries as a treatment for familial amyloid polyneuropathy, a rare, progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease.  While the drug would not currently have any competition, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc are developing drugs for a similar disease - hereditary TTR amyloidosis - also caused by a buildup of transthyretin protein in the body.","1083":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - After developing and rolling out COVID-19 vaccines at record speed, drugmakers are already facing variants of the rapidly-evolving coronavirus that may render them ineffective, a challenge that will require months of research and a massive financial investment, according to disease experts.  FILE PHOTO: Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer of Johnson & Johnson attends the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland January 22, 2016. REUTERS\/Ruben Sprich  Executives from Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE are considering new versions of their vaccines to respond to the most concerning variants identified so far. That is just one piece of the work needed to stay ahead of the virus, nearly a dozen experts told Reuters.  A global surveillance network to assess emerging variants must be built. Scientists need to establish what level of antibodies will be required to protect people from COVID-19 and determine when vaccines need to be altered. And regulators must convey what is needed to demonstrate updated vaccines are still safe and effective.  \u201cAt this point, there is no evidence that these variants have changed the equation in terms of protection from the vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota. \u201cBut we have to be prepared for that.\u201d  Johnson & Johnson told Reuters the concerning variant first identified in South Africa has got its attention and will tweak its vaccine accordingly if needed. Pfizer said it could produce a new vaccine relatively quickly, but a top vaccine executive said manufacturing it presents additional challenges.  The urgency of this effort is clear. State health officials in South Carolina on Thursday reported the first two cases of the South African variant in the United States.  Moderna on Monday said lab studies showed antibodies made in response to its vaccine were six times less effective at neutralizing a lab-created version of a South African variant than prior versions of the virus.  A study released on Wednesday ahead of peer review found the South African variant reduced neutralizing antibodies 8.6-fold for the Moderna vaccine and by 6.5-fold for the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot, although a separate Pfizer-backed study released on Wednesday suggests its vaccine may be more hardy. Moderna said this week it is starting work on a potential booster shot.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  COULD TAKE MONTHS  Just how far protection can drop before a COVID-19 vaccine needs to be altered is not yet known. With influenza, an eightfold drop in vaccine-induced antibody protection means time to update. That does not necessarily apply to this coronavirus.  \u201cThe problem is we don\u2019t know what the cut point is for coronavirus,\u201d said Dr. John Mascola, director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), whose scientists helped develop Moderna\u2019s vaccine.  Mascola said both studies testing the Moderna vaccine against the South African variant are roughly in the \u201csame ballpark.\u201d It could be that antibody protection is high enough from the vaccine that it will still be effective, he said.  NIAID scientists are analyzing data from Moderna\u2019s late-stage trial to see what level of neutralizing antibodies is required for protection. They are comparing individuals who were vaccinated but got sick anyway to vaccinated people who remained healthy.  It could take two months to complete this work, Mascola said. They hope to produce a benchmark for the minimum level of vaccine-induced antibodies needed to protect against COVID-19.  A global surveillance network is also needed to identify troubling new variants as they emerge, similar to one used to track fast-mutating flu viruses. That could cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in the United States alone.  Richard Webby, a flu surveillance expert from St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said the United States could probably build a system to identify variants fairly quickly. Developing the capability to determine whether they evade current vaccines will take more time.  The United States is currently conducting genetic sequencing to look for changes in the virus in just 0.3% of positive coronavirus tests. That pales compared with 10% in the UK, which was first to discover a major mutation in the virus that increases transmission by at least 50%. Experts said countries should sequence at least 5% of positive cases to detect significant changes in the virus.  Companies are waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to relay what testing will be needed for altered vaccines, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer\u2019s top viral vaccine scientists. With influenza vaccines, companies can make changes without new trials. \u201cBut that\u2019s after doing it for 50 years,\u201d he said.  Peter Marks, who oversees the FDA\u2019s vaccine approval process, has said small trials testing updated vaccines in around 400 participants may be needed at first. Even that could add months to the process.  Norman Baylor, chief executive of Biologics Consulting and a former FDA vaccines official, said the agency will lay out the regulatory road. But public health agencies like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization would decide when vaccines should be updated, as with flu.  Altering Pfizer\u2019s vaccine would require \u201ca very minor change,\u201d Dormitzer said.  Like Moderna\u2019s, it uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks.  He estimates the company could make a prototype version in a week or so, and take another two months to scale up and update their lab tests.  J&J, which is expected to release late-stage trial data on its vaccine within days, has laid the groundwork to address troubling virus changes, Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters. Its trial included sites in South Africa, which should give the company insight on that variant.  If a change is necessary, Stoffels said J&J likely would add a second strain into its existing vaccine.  \u201cWe are looking at this with a lot of attention,\u201d he said.","1084":"FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

Oil markets also rose after Saudi Arabia suggested it and other oil producers could adjust its current supply-cut pact, perhaps taking more barrels off the market if demand slumps in the winter as infections rise and before the vaccine is widely available.  Fuel demand is down worldwide as a result of the pandemic, and with infections now surpassing 50 million globally, numerous nations, especially in Europe, are reimposing lockdowns to slow the virus\u2019s spread. The vaccine news gave traders hope that the pandemic could be tamped down next year, which would help people resume normal life, boosting demand.  \u201cOil particularly reacted to the news because of what it means,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. \u201cThe pandemic is hitting transportation terrifically and 80% of crude oil barrels go to transportation fuel, so I think this is a logical response.\u201d  Both contracts rose more than $4 earlier in the session as traders sought to unwind bearish bets. Brent and WTI traded 148% and 139% of last session\u2019s volumes, respectively.  Pfizer said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on initial data, a victory in the battle against a pandemic that has forced lockdowns around the world.  The OPEC+ group, which includes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, could adjust their deal to balance the market, the kingdom\u2019s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said.  OPEC+ is currently cutting 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd), and considering reducing those cuts to 5.7 million bpd from January. If OPEC+ maintains the current curbs on output, it would tighten supply and lead to higher prices.  Key members of OPEC are wary of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden relaxing measures on Iran and Venezuela, which could mean an increase in oil production that would make it harder to balance supply and demand.  \u201cWhile a Biden presidency increases the likelihood of Iranian oil supply returning to the market, this is not something that will happen overnight, and we still believe it\u2019s more likely an end of 2021\/2022 event,\u201d ING said in a note.

The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an emergency use authorization for the Moderna Inc vaccine, the second after Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE.  Workers in pharmaceutical services provider Catalent Inc\u2019s facility in Bloomington, Indiana, will fill and package vials with Moderna vaccine and hand off to McKesson, which will ship doses from facilities including Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis, Tennessee. Those locations are close to air hubs for United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp .  The start of delivery for the Moderna vaccine will significantly widen availability of COVID-19 vaccines as U.S. deaths related to the respiratory virus set records.  \u201cThis is now a footrace between the vaccine and COVID,\u201d New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday at a briefing on the virus. He said the state expects to receive 346,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine next week. Those will go to 292 medical facilities across the state.  Pfizer organized its own distribution system but the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed, led by an Army general, is in charge for Moderna. The Moderna delivery system will have some of the same players as Pfizer\u2019s but will differ in key ways.  Transportation companies UPS and FedEx are giving priority to vaccines on planes and trucks that are moving holiday gifts and other cargo. Their drivers will handle the bulk of the last-mile Moderna vaccine deliveries. They are going directly to vaccination sites, unlike Pfizer\u2019s which was sent to large hubs and redistributed.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine is available in quantities as small as 100 doses and can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators, while the inoculations from Pfizer come in boxes of 975 doses, must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), and can be held for only 5 days at standard refrigerator temperatures.  Texas and Arkansas officials told Reuters they expect Moderna to be the primary vaccine for rural areas, which often lack the ultra cold storage equipment to store full trays of Pfizer\u2019s vials. Once the plastic on a Pfizer 975-dose tray is opened, recipients have 120 hours to use the vaccine.  U.S. Army General Gus Perna, chief operating officer of the government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program, said on a Monday press call that doses of Moderna\u2019s vaccine will be shipped to 3,825 U.S. sites.  Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pifzer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday, Gareth Rhodes, a member of the New York governor\u2019s COVID-19 task force said. And a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel on Sunday will consider what groups should get vaccinated next.  \u201cThe logistics will be easier with the Moderna vaccine,\u201d said Jesse Breidenbach, senior executive director of pharmacy for Sanford Health, which operates almost four dozen hospitals in South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa.  \u201cThirty days in the refrigerator will make it a bit easier to deal with,\u201d Breidenbach said.  Still, doses of vaccine must travel with security guards, including U.S. Marshals, and will be stored in locked refrigerators.  U.S. officials have said they expect to have 40 million doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by the end of the year - enough to inoculate 20 million people. Both vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness in pivotal clinical trials with no serious safety issues.  Separately, U.S. officials said Pfizer is preparing to distribute 2 million additional doses of its vaccine to locations around the U.S. next week, with preparations for shipping beginning over the weekend.

FILE PHOTO: A logo for Pfizer is displayed on a monitor on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., July 29, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  The full scope of Novartis' NOVN.S $500 million plan, revealed to Reuters in an interview with the company's gene therapy chief, has not been previously disclosed. It is second only to Pfizer PFE.N, which has allocated $600 million to build its own gene therapy manufacturing plants, according to filings and interviews with industry executives.  Gene therapies aim to correct certain diseases by replacing the missing or mutated version of a gene found in a patient\u2019s cells with healthy copies. With the potential to cure devastating illnesses in a single dose, drugmakers say they justify prices well above $1 million per patient.  But the treatments are also extremely complex to make, involving the cultivation of living material, and still pose a risk of serious side effects.  Drugmakers say building their own manufacturing plants is a response to rising costs and delays associated with relying on third-party contract manufacturers, which are also expanding to capitalize on demand.  They say owning their own facilities helps safeguard proprietary production methods and more effectively address any concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is keeping a close eye on manufacturing standards.  \u201cThere\u2019s so little capacity and capability at contract manufacturers for the novel gene therapy processes being developed by companies,\u201d said David Lennon, president of AveXis, Novartis\u2019s gene therapy division. \u201cWe need internal manufacturing capabilities in the long term.\u201d  The approach is not without risks.

PUSHING THE LIMITS  The rewards are potentially great, however.  Gene therapy is one of the hottest areas of drug research and, given the life-changing possibilities, the FDA is helping to speed treatments to market.  It has approved two so far, including Novartis\u2019s Zolgensma treatment for a rare muscular disorder priced at $2 million, and expects 40 new gene therapies to reach the U.S. market by 2022.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  There are currently several hundred under development by around 30 drugmakers for conditions from hemophilia to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia. The proliferation of these treatments is pushing the limits of the industry\u2019s existing manufacturing capacity. Developers of gene therapies that need to outsource manufacturing face wait times of about 18 months to get a production slot, company executives told Reuters.  They are also charged fees to reserve space that run into millions of dollars, more than double the cost of a few years ago, according to gene therapy developer RegenxBio.  As a result, companies including bluebird bio BLUE.O, PTC Therapeutics PTCT.O and Krystal Biotech KRYS.O are also investing in gene therapy manufacturing, according to a Reuters analysis of public filings and executive interviews.  They follow Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc BMRN.O, developer of a gene therapy for hemophilia, which constructed one of the industry's largest manufacturing facilities in 2017.  REGULATORY SCRUTINY  The FDA is keeping a close eye on standards.  This comes amid the agency\u2019s disclosure in August that it is investigating alleged data manipulation by former executives at Novartis\u2019 AveXis unit.  AveXis had switched its method for measuring Zolgensma\u2019s potency in animal studies. When results using the new method didn\u2019t meet expectations, the executives allegedly altered the data to cover it up, the FDA and Novartis have said.  One of the former executives, Brian Kaspar, denied wrongdoing in a statement to Reuters. Another, his brother Allan Kaspar, could not be reached for comment.  Novartis and the FDA say human clinical trials, which found Zolgensma effective in treating the most severe form of spinal muscular atrophy in infants, were not affected. Novartis also says its investments in gene therapy production started long before it became aware of the data manipulation allegations.  But the scandal has highlighted the importance of having a consistent manufacturing process for gene therapies, industry executives say.  According to four of them, the FDA has stressed in recent meetings the need for continuity in production processes all the way from the development of a drug to its commercialization.  By bringing production in-house, drugmakers may avoid pitfalls such as the need to switch to a larger facility if contract manufacturers\u2019 capacity proves limited, executives say.  The FDA is finalizing new guidelines for gene therapy manufacturing, expected at the end of the year.  \u201cManufacturing consistency is always a major concern for the agency,\u201d FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo told Reuters.  Highlighting the pressures on the industry, Sarepta Therapeutics SRPT.O, which largely outsources manufacturing, delayed a clinical trial of its Duchenne treatment in August, telling investors it wanted to avoid any questions from regulators about consistency in producing its therapy at commercial scale.  ENOUGH GROWTH FOR ALL?  \u201cBetween the trade secrets, the cost schedules and the time lag, it makes a whole lot of sense, if you can do it, to build out your own facilities and more and more gene therapy companies have started to do that,\u201d said Krish Krishnan, chief executive of Krystal Biotech Inc.  Krystal, which is developing therapies for rare skin diseases, has built one manufacturing facility and plans to invest more than $50 million in a new one it will start constructing in December.  MeiraGTx MGTX.O, which focuses on gene therapies for eye conditions, estimates it is currently spending roughly $25 million a year on manufacturing, including process development.  Despite such moves, however, contract manufacturers like Lonza LONN.S and Thermo Fisher TMO.N are confident their businesses will continue to grow due to the strength of demand.  Thermo Fisher has told investors its Brammer gene therapy manufacturing division, acquired in May, could soon earn $500 million in revenue a year, double its projected 2019 earnings. Lonza CEO Marc Funk is also optimistic.  \u201cDemand in gene therapy has increased,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe believe this is going to continue in the coming years.\u201d","1103":"FILE PHOTO: A small shopping basket filled with vials labeled \"COVID-19 - Coronavirus Vaccine\" is placed on a Pfizer logo in this illustration taken November 29, 2020.

REUTERS\/Pedro Nunes  The vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech was the first to get EU approval in December.  It was initially sold in the EU in vials meant to deliver five doses, but a global shortage of shots and a viability assessment on dosage convinced the EU drugs regulator to approve on Jan. 8 the extraction of six doses from the same vials.  The decision increased availability, prompting Pfizer to raise its output targets for this year to 2 billion vaccines from 1.3 billion initially envisaged.  For buyers of the vaccine, however, there was a drawback because EU states face the prospect of paying the price of six doses for each vial, regardless of their ability to extract a sixth shot.  \u201cWe will fulfil our supply commitments in line with our existing agreements \u2013 which are based on delivery of doses, not vials \u2013 and in accordance with locally approved labelling,\u201d Pfizer said after the EU drugs regulator\u2019s decision to shift to a six-dose label.  The European Commission has repeatedly declined to comment on the pricing arrangements after the regulatory change.  Officials and healthcare professionals in Germany and France, the bloc\u2019s largest states, have pointed to yields short of six doses because of technical difficulties and warned of a lack of the special syringes, known as Low Dead Space Syringes, needed to extract the sixth dose..  At a meeting of EU health ministers last week, Belgium said bottlenecks in the supply of these syringes were likely when Pfizer begins to deliver bigger volumes of its shots, of which the EU has secured 600 million doses, an official who attended the meeting told Reuters.  A Belgian diplomat said the country had urged the EU executive commission to speed up joint procurement for syringes to avoid \u201cunnecessary delays\u201d.  While there is no immediate shortage, there are not enough syringes for mass vaccination, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian health ministry told Reuters on Thursday, saying the Baltic country had joined the EU procurement scheme.  \u201cWhat is now not a problem, can easily become a very big problem tomorrow,\u201d she said.  A spokesman for the EU Commission said the EU had negotiated contracts with several firms for the delivery of hundreds of millions of these special syringes and needles, but could not say when deliveries would begin.  The EU is the main buyer of the shot worldwide and Pfizer-BioNTech are the main suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines to the EU.  The two companies were heavily criticised when they announced last week a temporary slowdown in deliveries to EU countries while they improve production capacity.","1105":"(Reuters) -Millions of COVID-19 vaccines are sitting unused in U.S. hospitals and elsewhere a week into the massive inoculation campaign, putting the government\u2019s target for 20 million vaccinations this month in doubt.  As of Wednesday morning, only 1 million shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine had been given, about one-third of the first shipment sent last week. Over 9.5 million doses of vaccines, including Moderna\u2019s, have now been sent to states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  While hospitals have started giving out Moderna\u2019s vaccine, the CDC has not yet reported that data and there may be a lag in reporting shots given of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.  The slow pace has barely picked up from the first week when 614,000 shots were given although nearly 2.9 million were shipped.  Hospitals said the first COVID-19 vaccinations started slowly last Monday as they navigated preparing the previously frozen shots for use, finding employees to run the vaccination clinics, and ensuring proper social distancing both before and after vaccination. Some said they did only about 100 shots the first day.  They were contending with a COVID-19 surge, as cases around the United States surpassed 18 million with 323,000 deaths. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/34pvUyi)  The Trump administration promised to vaccinate 20 million by the end of the year while providing little funding to achieve the goal.  That\u2019s nine days to give out nearly 19 million shots or over 2 million people vaccinated a day including on Christmas Day.  Almost 5.9 million doses of Moderna Inc\u2019s vaccine should go out this week and an additional 2 million doses from Pfizer and partner BioNTech.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThe commitment that we can make is to make vaccine doses available,\u201d U.S. Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said on a Wednesday press call. He noted the rate of people getting a shot in their arm is \u201cslower than we thought it would be.\u201d  Two more vaccines may be approved in February from Johnson & Johnson Inc and AstraZeneca Plc.  The government\u2019s goal is 100 million Pfizer and Moderna shots in arms by March 1.  Operation Warp Speed\u2019s General Gustave Perna, who is leading the vaccine distribution effort, on Monday said that the CDC data reflects a reporting lag and that the number of vaccinations will catch up as time goes on.  The CDC said its data may also reflect a lag between vaccine dosing and state reporting. Most nursing home vaccinations only began in mass this week, and the CDC data does not specify how many doses from the first shipment were being held by states for that group.  STAFF STRETCHED THIN  Margaret Mary Health, a 25-bed rural hospital in Indiana, built a drive-thru vaccination clinic at a local fire station and one at a local recreation center to vaccinate healthcare workers in the surrounding counties, according to Chief Executive Officer Tim Putnam.  Putnam, who has done traffic control at the clinic\u2019s drive-thru, said they have used about 400 of 1,100 doses received.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cWe\u2019re asking for volunteers from our staff, volunteers from the local community college to step in and build this process from the ground up,\u201d he said.  Some of the largest U.S. hospitals inoculated more than 1,000 people per day, having done dry runs of the vaccine delivery and rollout.  Vermont, Delaware and Idaho were among states that confirmed their states had given only thousands of doses - a fraction of those available to them - during the first week.  Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at Yale School of Public Health, described the initial tally as \u201cdiscouraging\u201d and said \u201cthe challenges of getting vaccines out as quickly as we\u2019re able to manufacture them will only grow.\u201d  Johnson & Johnson\u2019s one-shot vaccine could speed deployment because it requires a conventional refrigerator and has no specialized procedures to thaw out and administer, said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association for Immunization Managers trade group. AstraZeneca\u2019s two dose vaccine also can be stored in a refrigerator.  \u201cWhen it\u2019s refrigerator-stable and a one-dose regimen, it can\u2019t get any easier than that,\u201d Hannan said.  HOSPITALS START SLOWLY BUT SPEED UP  Dr. Saul Weingart, the chief medical officer of Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said the hospital had given about 750 doses of the around 3,000 available as of Friday. It started with 100 shots per day and worked up to about 450, he said.  He said experts at the hospital modeled that giving Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine would take 10 minutes, about two to three times as long as a flu shot, due to the procedures needed because the vaccine is stored in a deep freeze. Patients need to socially distance before and after being given the vaccine and be monitored for allergic reactions.  The United States gives 170 million flu vaccinations each year within a few months, but for the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States must give about three times that number of shots - the Pfizer and Moderna shots are two doses - to reach most Americans by July. At its current pace, the U.S. appears to have the capacity to administer less than a third of the shots that are shipped in a given week, underscoring the gap.  A spokesperson for Houston Methodist, a hospital in Houston, Texas, said it had given 8,300 employees the vaccine as of Monday with about 7,000 doses left from the first shipment.  The University of Southern California\u2019s Keck Medicine medical school has vaccinated over 3,000 employees and said it will take six weeks for everyone, similar to its flu vaccination schedule.  States and health departments need federal money to hire staff, from data center workers to track inoculations to call center employees to field questions, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.  The U.S. Congress\u2019s current coronavirus aid package sets aside more than $8 billion for vaccine distribution but is delayed.  \u201cYou can\u2019t hire someone in December and train them up if you don\u2019t know you can pay them in January,\u201d Casalotti said.","1106":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain expects to have 10 million doses of Pfizer\/BioNTech\u2019s candidate COVID-19 vaccine available by the end of the year if regulators approve it, Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said on Monday, following positive clinical trial results.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The spokesman said that Britain had now ordered 40 million doses of the candidate vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech BNTX.O, enough to give protection to 20 million people.  Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective, a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed more than a million people, battered the world\u2019s economy and upended daily life.  \u201cIn total we have procured 40 million doses of the Pfizer candidate vaccine with 10 million of those doses being manufactured and available to the UK by the end of the year if the vaccine is approved by the regulators,\u201d the spokesman said.  In all, the government has signed six supply deals for vaccine candidates, including Pfizer\/BioNTech's and one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca AZN.L, which is also considered expected to post late-stage trial results this year.  \u201cI can\u2019t see any reason now why we shouldn\u2019t have a handful of good vaccines available to this disease,\u201d John Bell, regius professor of medicine at University of Oxford who sits on the UK government\u2019s vaccine taskforce, told BBC Radio, adding that it augured well for Oxford\u2019s own vaccine.  \u201cI\u2019m pretty optimistic that given this result, we\u2019ll have a reasonably good chance of getting a good result as well,\u201d he said, referring to Oxford\u2019s late-stage trial results he said would come in \u201cweeks not months\u201d.  Johnson has placed England under a second national lockdown to contain a new wave of COVID-19 infections, but he has said that the prospects of a vaccine are one cause for optimism that the situation will improve by spring.  His spokesman said that though the government was \u201coptimistic of a breakthrough, we must remember there are no guarantees,\u201d adding that only once safety data was published would licensing authorities consider making it available to the public.  \u201cIn the meantime the NHS (National Health Service) stands ready to begin the vaccination programme for those most at risk once a COVID-19 vaccine is available, before being rolled out more widely,\u201d he said.  Oxford\u2019s Bell went further. Asked if life would be returning to normal by spring, he said: \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m probably the first guy to say that but...

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  That opens the door for its early use in hard to reach places that might not be appropriate for Pfizer Inc's PFE.N vaccine which needs ultra-cold storage.  Here are details of how it could be distributed.  HOW COLD IS COLD STORAGE?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine is stable for up to six months at a temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), about home freezer levels, when shipped and stored.  The company said it expects the vaccine to be stable when kept at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for 30 days, up from an initial projection of 7 days. The vaccine will be distributed in 10-dose vials and can be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours after thawing.  By comparison, Pfizer\u2019s vaccine can be transported and stored for up to 6 months at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F). It can be stored at standard refrigerator temperatures for up to five days.  WHEN WILL IT BE SHIPPED, TO WHOM?  Moderna\u2019s vaccine will be distributed by the U.S. government\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program. U.S. health officials have said that at first they are most likely to distribute vaccines to healthcare workers, people who are in nursing homes, first responders and those with health conditions who are high-risk.  Most Americans will be inoculated in May or June, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert.  Under Operation Warp Speed\u2019s distribution plan, the first group of shots will likely be distributed to and administered in closed settings, like hospitals and nursing homes.  After January, as supply increases, those shots will start to be available in pharmacies, doctors offices and clinics as well as mobile clinics, the plan shows.  Health officials have said it will be easier to use Moderna\u2019s vaccine in these settings than Pfizer\u2019s.  HOW WELL DOES THE MODERNA VACCINE WORK?  Moderna on Monday said its vaccine was 94.5% effective at preventing COVID-19 based on early results from large studies. That is similar to Pfizer\u2019s which the U.S. drugmaker has said is more than 90% effective.  Moderna data also showed the vaccine was capable of helping prevent severe cases of COVID-19, and it represented volunteers from diverse communities.","1108":"(For a Reuters live blog on U.S., UK and European stock markets, click LIVE\/ or type LIVE\/ in a news window)  Nov 10 (Reuters) - European shares hovered at eight-month highs on Tuesday on optimism around signs of a breakthrough in developing a COVID-19 vaccine, although concerns about the depth of the economic damage from the pandemic capped gains.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - As questions mount over whether the United States will authorize a coronavirus vaccine ahead of November elections, experts say there is a slim chance that enough evidence will be available to prove one is safe and effective in that time frame.  U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said a vaccine is possible before the Nov. 3 election, and accused a \u201cdeep state\u201d within the nation\u2019s top health regulator of trying to slow pivotal clinical trials to hamper his chances at a second term.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration denied that claim, saying its decisions will be guided by data alone. Drugmakers, seeking to bolster public confidence amid political squabbles on Tuesday pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards in their quest for a vaccine.  Vaccine safety was in focus on Wednesday after AstraZeneca PLC said that it had put a pause on its coronavirus trial on the vaccine with Oxford to review the safety data of an unexplained illness in the U.K. trial. It described the move as routine and said it would restart trials when an independent committee recommended it do so.  Other companies have recently made comments suggesting they could have an answer on whether their vaccines work before November.  \u201cIt would really be an amazing vaccine to show that,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters.  Fauci said initial trial results are likely to become available in November or December, but late October remains a possibility. \u201cIt is conceivable that if there are enough infections documented early on that you might get that answer earlier,\u201d he said.  Vaccines must demonstrate they are at least 50% more effective than a placebo to be considered for approval. To prove that, government officials have said, at least 150 COVID-19 infections must be recorded among trial participants with at least twice as many occurring among the placebo group.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  If a vaccine is especially effective, companies could have their answer sooner. Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, whose U.S. vaccine trials have enrolled thousands of people and are the most advanced, say they may have proof after just a few dozen subjects become infected.  Independent panels of experts called data and safety monitoring boards (DSMB) will review trial data at pre-specified points. These boards can recommend companies stop the trials if the evidence is overwhelmingly positive or negative.  For Pfizer, the first interim look occurs when 32 trial volunteers get infected.  Experts interviewed by Reuters cautioned that information gleaned from a limited number of subjects could miss important safety issues that letting the trial fully play out might reveal.  \u2018ABSOLUTELY INSUFFICIENT\u2019  Pfizer\u2019s trial calls for four interim analyses by the DSMB, the first after just 32 recorded infections. \u201cWe may have enough data to be able to share the first analysis by October,\u201d said Pfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts.  Moderna\u2019s first interim analysis will come after 53 trial subjects become infected, the company told investors last month.  Basing a decision on 53 cases, is \u201can absolutely insufficient number,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester who has served on FDA vaccine advisory panels. \u201cYou would know very little about safety.\u201d  To halt the trials due to positive results, vaccines would likely have to exceed the 50% efficacy threshold.  Pfizer has not disclosed what standard will be used for stopping its trial early. William Gruber, senior vice president of Pfizer vaccine clinical research and development, said \u201cthe standard would be evidence of very high efficacy.\u201d  A senior official with the U.S. effort to accelerate COVID-19 vaccine development said companies have created appropriate trials to hold interim analyses that could detect especially effective vaccines earlier.  SPEEDY ENROLLMENT  Although both drugmakers began vaccinating people in their respective 30,000-subject trials on July 28, Pfizer is in position to generate results earlier in part because it is administering the second shot of its two-dose vaccine a week earlier than Moderna. Moderna also slowed enrollment to ensure greater participation of at-risk minorities in its study.  Pfizer\u2019s trial also begins collecting data on infections that occur a week after it administers its second shot. Moderna has a two-week lag between the second shot and when it will begin collecting infection data in earnest.  Both trials are on pace to be fully enrolled soon.  Dr. Henry Miller, a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute think tank and former director of the FDA\u2019s office of biotechnology, said an emergency use authorization based on a small number of infections would not deliver an adequate answer on the safety of a vaccine intended for use by millions of healthy people. Some side effects could take four to six months to occur, he said.  Dr. Gregory Glenn, research chief for Novavax Inc, which is also developing a coronavirus vaccine, said the October timeline remains possible. But he believes Americans will likely be waiting longer.  \u201cI just think humility is a good thing right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe FDA set out some pretty strict criteria for success. So that\u2019s going to take a pretty good vaccine to do that.\u201d","1111":"BERLIN\/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Germany was weighing on Monday whether to allow a delay in administering a second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine from BioNTech and Pfizer to make scarce supplies go further, after a similar move by Britain last week.  Syringes are prepared for the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at a nursing home in Bad Windsheim, Germany December 27, 2020. REUTERS\/Hannibal Hanschke  Separately, Denmark approved on Monday a delay of up to six weeks between the first and second shots of the vaccine.  In Berlin, the health ministry was seeking the view of an independent vaccination commission on whether to delay a second shot beyond a current 42-day maximum limit, according to a one-page document seen by Reuters on Monday.  The move came amid criticism of Health Minister Jens Spahn - including from his conservative political allies - that Germany has failed to procure enough vaccines and been too slow to ramp up its national inoculation campaign.  Spahn told his Christian Democratic Union at a closed-door meeting on Monday that he hoped to offer vaccinations by this summer to everyone in Germany, once more vaccines have won regulatory approval, according to sources who attended.  Some German health experts have welcomed Britain\u2019s move to delay administering a second dose of the BioNTech\/Pfizer shot, which comes as governments try to provide protection against coronavirus to as many people as possible by giving them one shot and delaying a second.  \u201cIn view of the current scarcity of vaccines and the very high numbers of infections and hospitalisations (in Germany), a strategy in which as many people as possible are vaccinated as early as possible is more effective,\u201d said Leif-Erik Sander, head of the vaccine research team at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital.  However, BioNTech and Pfizer pointed in a joint statement to a lack of trial data to support delaying the second dose.  \u201cThe safety and efficacy of the vaccine has not been evaluated on different dosing schedules as the majority of trial participants received the second dose within the window specified in the study design,\u201d the companies said, referring to a prime shot and a booster given three weeks apart.  \u201cThere is no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.\u201d  The European Medicines Agency said a maximum interval of 42 days between the first and the second shot of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine should be respected to obtain full protection.  According to the latest daily update from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has vaccinated around 239,000 people since starting its campaign on Dec. 27 - well short of the 1.3 million doses that were delivered by the end of 2020.  By way of comparison, Britain has administered more than a million COVID-19 vaccines so far, more than the rest of Europe put together, Health Minister Matt Hancock said.  DANISH MOVE  The Danish Health Authority will allow a wait of up to six weeks before administering a second dose, its head Soren Brostrom told local news wire Ritzau on Monday, after scrutinising vaccine data.  But Brostrom said the original guidelines of waiting only three to four weeks should be followed whenever possible.  \u201cIf you go longer than six weeks, we cannot see the scientific evidence that you are protected with certainty. Therefore we cannot recommend that,\u201d Brostrom added.  As of Monday, a total of 46,975 Danes had received the first Pfizer-BioNTech shot, mostly health workers and the elderly.  While a longer interval between shots has not been tested in clinical trials, some scientists said it was a sensible plan given the extraordinary circumstances.  European Union approval for a vaccine from Moderna, expected this week, should add another 1.5 million doses of supply in the coming weeks, the German Health Ministry document said.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.  COVID-19 post-vaccination may be less contagious  People who get a COVID-19 vaccine can still become infected with the novel coronavirus, although they are likely to be protected against severe illness, and a new study suggests they also may be less contagious. At a large Israeli health maintenance organization where 650,000 members received the two-dose vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, researchers identified 2,897 patients who later tested positive for COVID-19. The amounts of virus on swab samples from the nose and throat were reduced four-fold for infections occurring at least 12 days after the first dose of vaccine compared to what is typically seen in unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, the research team from Maccabi Health Services and the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology found. Viral loads are known to be linked with contagiousness and disease severity. But this study was not a randomized trial and it did not look at patients' viral loads over time, nor the rates at which their contacts became infected, which would be the most direct evidence of whether a vaccine reduces virus transmission. Still, the authors concluded in a paper posted on Monday on the medical website medRxiv ahead of peer review, \"These reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread.\" (bit.ly\/2LK5HnE)  Study shows range of COVID-19 benefits from arthritis drug  A large study adds to evidence that Roche's arthritis drug tocilizumab, sold under the brand name Actemra, cuts the risk of death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, shortens their hospital stays and reduces their need for mechanical ventilation. The randomized trial involved more than 4,000 patients with varying degrees of illness. Some needed only simple oxygen therapy while others needed mechanical ventilation. Most also were receiving a steroid such as dexamethasone. The rate of death within 28 days was 29% for patients in the tocilizumab group and 33% in the control group, according to a report posted on Thursday on the medical website medRxiv ahead of peer review. After accounting for patients' age, sex and other risk factors, tocilizumab was associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of death. \"We now know that the benefits of tocilizumab extend to all COVID patients with low oxygen levels and significant inflammation,\" study co-leader Peter Horby of the University of Oxford said in a press statement. Used in combination with steroids, Horby added, \"the impact is substantial.\" (bit.ly\/3aUZhuy)  Bone marrow cells travel to brain in some COVID-19 patients  Very large bone-marrow cells are showing up in the brains of people who died of COVID-19, which may help explain some of the neurological problems associated with the disease, according to researchers. The cells, called megakaryocytes, normally reside in the bone marrow and make platelets for blood clotting. \u201cWe found that in some patients who died of COVID-19, the capillaries - the smallest blood vessels - contained very large cells called megakaryocytes,\u201d study leader David Nauen of Johns Hopkins University told Reuters. \u201cThey are so large they could be occluding blood flow through the capillaries and limiting oxygen delivery to the brain, which could impair brain function.\u201d As reported on Friday in the journal JAMA Neurology, his team studied brain tissue from 15 patients who died of COVID-19 and found megakaryocytes in five of their brains. \u201cWhat signaled these cells to leave the bone marrow and travel to the brain is unknown, but COVID-19 causes disruptions of the clotting system, and it\u2019s possible this is related,\u201d Nauen said.

Officials have said that Pfizer and the U.S. government will begin distributing the shots within 24 hours of receiving a regulatory green light and hospitals are planning to give healthcare workers the first shots early next week.  CVS expects to receive its first Pfizer dose allotment toward the end of next week but will wait until December 21 to give shots to comply with regulators, said Chris Cox, senior vice president at CVS Health. He said U.S. officials want to give administrators of shots to nursing homes time to review information documents about the shot and get waivers from nursing home residents and their families.  Some states are opting to use Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine to inoculate their nursing home residents rather than the Pfizer shot, he added, saying that earliest date that CVS can administer Moderna\u2019s shots to nursing home residents is December 28.  Moderna has applied for emergency authorization and is expected to receive it soon after a meeting of advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on December 17.  CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, which run the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy chains but also offer other offsite pharmacy services, have an agreement with the federal government to vaccinate nursing home residents across the country through a voluntary program.

Britain believes that the vaccine, which Pfizer is co-developing with Germany's BioNTech SE 22UAy.F, could be ready to distribute before Christmas, the report said.  Pfizer\u2019s Chief Executive Albert Bourla has previously said the company could release data on whether or not the vaccine works as early as this month.  The U.S. drugmaker said this week if trials are successful the company expects to file for emergency authorization of the vaccine candidate from U.S. regulators shortly after it has enough safety data in late November.  Britain has agreed supply deals for six vaccine candidates including frontrunners from Pfizer and AstraZeneca.","1120":"LONDON (Reuters) - The pace of Britain\u2019s rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is being limited by the supply of shots, and the government is working with both Pfizer and AstraZeneca to increase supplies, health minister Matt Hancock said on Thursday.  The government must quickly ramp up the rate of vaccinations in order to meet an ambitious target to inoculate more than 13 million people who are elderly, vulnerable or frontline workers by mid-February.  \u201cThe rate limiting step is the supply of vaccine, and we\u2019re working with the companies, both Pfizer and of course AstraZeneca, to increase the supply,\u201d Hancock told broadcasters.  \u201cThe manufacturers are doing a brilliant job, and they\u2019re delivering to the schedule that\u2019s agreed, but that schedule is the amount of vaccine that we have ... we expect to see that amount of vaccine being delivered going up.\u201d  Hancock spoke after the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University was rolled out in doctors surgeries from Thursday.  More than 1.3 million people in the United Kingdom have received one shot of either AstraZeneca\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, but the government needs to be administering around 2 million doses a week to hit its February target.  In a sign of supply constraints, one doctor visited by Hancock on Thursday said she had not received the delivery of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine she had been expecting.  Birmingham City Council\u2019s leader and local lawmakers also wrote to Hancock saying no AstraZeneca vaccine was available in the central English city and that stocks of the Pfizer shot would run out on Friday.  Britain is prioritising the administration of an initial shot to more people, delaying second doses beyond a month after the first.  Just 20,000 people received their second shot of the Pfizer vaccine before the guidance was changed. Pfizer has said there is no data for the efficacy of the first shot beyond 21 days.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if the vaccine rollout goes to plan, new lockdown measures introduced this week could start to be eased in February.  Johnson, who will give a news conference later on Thursday, has previously cited the time it takes for the regulator to approve batches of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine as one limiting factor.  AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was first deployed in hospitals on Monday. It does not have the ultra-low temperature requirements that Pfizer\u2019s does, making it easier to roll out.  Initial boxes of the Pfizer vaccine contained nearly 1,000 doses, but the NHS said smaller boxes had also been approved for use that could be used in settings like care homes without wasting doses.","1121":"SANTIAGO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Chilean health regulator has approved for emergency use the COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, paving the way for the first doses to be administered as early as Christmas to citizens over the age of 16.  The Institute of Public Health (ISP) received the Pfizer request for approval on Nov. 27, and a panel of experts was convened to analyze the vaccine data supplied by the U.S. drugmaker.  Chile has signed a purchase agreement for 10 million doses of the Pfizer\/BioNtech vaccine, enough to inoculate 5 million people. The vaccine is administered in two doses three weeks apart.  Chile\u2019s health minister Enrique Paris said over the weekend the country was logistically prepared to begin administering the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine as soon as it was approved and available. Chilean media reports this week suggested an initial batch of around 30,000 doses could arrive in as little as eight days, and be administered on Dec. 24 and 25, though the health ministry declined to confirm the reports.  Paris told Reuters last month the Pfizer vaccine would be used in the first three months of 2021 to vaccinate five million people from among Chile\u2019s most \u201csusceptible\u201d populations, including health workers, prison officers, prisoners, armed forces and people in old age homes. He added that he hopes to have 80% of Chile\u2019s population of 18 million vaccinated by the end of the first half of 2021.  Chile has also secured a deal for 14.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and incorporated a clause into its agreement for the Sinovac vaccine trial the country is hosting for preferential purchase of 20 million doses, rising to 60 million doses over three years.  It also has signed up to have access to 7.6 million vaccine doses through the global vaccine distribution scheme COVAX, co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization.  Heriberto Garc\u00eda, director of the ISP, said the approval of the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use came with certain unspecified restrictions. \u201cAs we move forward and get more information, we will be able to expand it,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere is a lot of important analysis to do around how we are going to conduct studies and risk analysis and drug surveillance to be able reassure the population on any questions that arise,\u201d Garcia added.

At present, the country is reporting more than 1,000 new cases a day, and has a total of 576,731 confirmed cases and 15,959 deaths from the disease.

The focus now is on key U.S. non-farm payrolls data at 1330 GMT, forecast to show a rise of 469,000 in November, according to a Reuters poll.  The upbeat mood saw the U.S. dollar lose ground to other major currencies.  \u201cOne of the elements of the better news we are getting, for instance the vaccine, is to increase the attraction of risky assets and that reduces the appetite for the U.S. dollar,\u201d said Eric Brard, head of fixed income at asset manager Amundi.

The newspaper reported on Friday that the FDA is likely to issue the EUA by Friday evening, citing people familiar with the agency\u2019s planning. It had reported on Thursday night that the FDA would announce the news on Saturday.  Swift clearance of the vaccine was widely expected after a panel of expert advisers to the FDA on Thursday endorsed its emergency use to help stem a pandemic that has killed more than 285,000 people in the United States.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Work to distribute the experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech SE BNTX.O is gearing up after the companies announced successful interim data earlier on Monday, but it will not be coming to local pharmacies for the general public any time soon.  The data, which sent U.S. stocks to record highs [.N], showed that the two companies\u2019 experimental vaccine is 90% effective at preventing COVID-19. They are still awaiting data on safety, which could come later this month.  Pfizer and BioNTech need to get regulators to sign off on the shot before it can start shipping vaccines to those considered most in need by government. Healthcare workers and people living in nursing homes will likely top that list.  But the vaccine\u2019s complex and super-cold storage requirements are an obstacle for even the most sophisticated hospitals in the United States and may impact when and where it is available in rural areas or poor countries where resources are tight.  The main issue is that the vaccine, which is based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below.  \u201cThe cold chain is going to be one of the most challenging aspects of delivery of this vaccination,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.  \u201cThis will be a challenge in all settings because hospitals even in big cities do not have storage facilities for a vaccine at that ultra-low temperature.\u201d  Indeed, one of the most prestigious U.S. hospitals, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said it does not currently have that capability.  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a vaccine that needs storage at minus 70 or 80. That\u2019s a tremendous logistical issue not only in the U.S. but outside the Western world,\u201d said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic.  \u201cWe\u2019re a major medical center and we don\u2019t have storage capacity like this. That will be true for everybody. This is a logistical obstacle.\u201d  Pfizer spokeswoman Kim Bencker said the company was working closely with the U.S. government and state officials on how to ship the vaccine from its distribution centers in the United States, Germany and Belgium around the globe.  The detailed plan includes using dry ice to transport frozen vaccine vials by both air and land at their recommended temperatures for up to 10 days, she said.  See graphic on COVID-19 global tracker: here  ON ICE  State and local healthcare providers are responsible for storing and administering vaccines once delivered.  They can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2-8 degrees C \u2013 a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals, Bencker said.  The Pfizer storage units can also be refilled with ice for up to 15 days, she said.  But shots will spoil in around five days at normal refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing. BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters the companies are analyzing if they can extend that for two weeks.  The vaccine of Moderna Inc MRNA.O, which is working on a vaccine based on similar technology, does not need to be stored at such a low temperature.  Other vaccines including ones from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Novavax Inc NVAX.O can be stored at 2-8 degrees C, the temperature of a regular refrigerator.  EXPANSION  Northwell Health, a major hospital system in New York, is expanding its ultra-cold storage capacity. Although it is possible to deploy the vaccine before it spoils, Northwell Chief Pharmacy Officer Onisis Stefas said the hospital decided the freezer access would ensure a smooth rollout.  The cold storage requirements could impede Pfizer\u2019s ability to reach rural healthcare systems and nursing homes, or less wealthy nations, which may not have the funds for the refrigeration units, experts said.  \u201cIf Pfizer\u2019s is the only vaccine to be authorized in the next few months, we do worry about equity when it comes to spreading it to rural areas,\u201d said Claire Hannan, executive director at the Association of Immunization Managers, a nonprofit organization representing state and local public health officials who handle vaccines.  Ultra-cold freezer supplies are already limited as hospitals scramble to stock up, Stefas said.  Some states have said they have a shortage of ultra-cold freezers, according to public documents that states filed with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.  New Hampshire has purchased extra ultra-cold freezers and like other states is lobbying the Trump administration for additional funds, the documents show.  California has also said ultra-cold freezer supplies are limited and roughly half of the states\u2019 health departments are looking in to purchasing or leasing additional cold storage supplies.  It has proposed building a distribution network of ultra-cold freezers, including mobile vaccination clinics, to reach underserved areas around the state. California said it will not provide vaccine supplies to facilities without adequate cold-storage capabilities.  Without the extra equipment, doctors will have a dilemma: store vaccines in standard refrigerators and deploy all 975 doses in each Pfizer vaccine container in less than five days or restock them with dry ice and open them only twice a day to extend the vaccines\u2019 life span, Hannan said.  \u201cI think it will be difficult, but based on the task and how important it is, people will do the best to their ability to make that happen,\u201d Stefas said.","1148":"Aug 7 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday it signed a multi-year agreement with Gilead Sciences Inc to manufacture and supply the company\u2019s antiviral drug remdesivir for COVID-19 patients.

The agency is issuing the guidance to boost transparency and public trust as health experts have become increasingly concerned that the Trump administration might be interfering in the approval process, the newspaper said.  According to the report, the FDA is expected to ask vaccine manufacturers seeking an emergency authorization to follow trial participants for a median of at least two months after they receive a second vaccine shot. It also said the agency is asking that trials identify a specific number of severe cases of COVID-19 in patients who received a placebo in the trials.  Few vaccine developers were expected to have definitive trial results before the presidential election. Pfizer Inc had been the exception, although its timetable could slip with the new guidance.  Moderna Inc has said it is unlikely to have data in October. AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s trial in the United States is halted while investigators try to determine whether a serious neurological problem suffered by one participant in the company\u2019s U.K. trial was caused by the vaccine.  Moderna and Pfizer began their late-stage trials on July 27, and took about a month to enroll 15,000 people, the halfway point for their initial planned enrollment.  The trials are designed for people to receive their second shot either three or four weeks after the first. Two months of follow-up would make it unlikely the companies would have enough data before mid-November.  Pfizer said on Tuesday that based on current infection rates it still expects to know whether or not their vaccine works as early as the end of October. Pfizer\u2019s trial protocol calls for an early look at the data after just 32 participants become infected.  \u201cWe anticipate providing FDA with safety data, including the median of two months safety data after the second dose, on a rolling basis to help inform FDA\u2019s ultimate determination of authorization or approval,\u201d the drugmaker said in an emailed statement.","1152":"FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

The company was due to submit the vaccine for review last week.  \u201cWe hope the evidence indicates that it\u2019s a safe product,\u201d Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a nightly news conference. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we would have 2 million doses in January.\u201d  He said 9,000 people are participating in CanSino\u2019s clinical trial in Mexico.  Mexico on Tuesday reported 990 more deaths, one of the pandemic\u2019s highest daily increases, bringing the death toll to 123,845. The country also registered another 12,099 infections, pushing the overall tally to 1,401,529.

Switzerland, which has 8.6 million people and hopes to start vaccinating some time in the first half of 2021, had previously reserved nearly 10 million doses of prospective vaccines from Moderna and AstraZeneca and has now set aside 400 million Swiss francs ($435.92 million) for purchases.

Data from separate trials of Moderna\u2019s and AstraZeneca\u2019s candidates are due later this year.  A Russian vaccine project on Wednesday also said that its candidate\u2019s efficacy topped 90% in a small sampling of trial participants.

WHEN CAN CANADIANS EXPECT TO BE VACCINATED?  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the House of Commons on Wednesday that Canada would receive 30,000 doses next week and up to 249,000 by the end of the year.  Only a handful of provinces have so far detailed their immediate plans. Saskatchewan said it expected to receive Pfizer vaccine for 1,950 people by Tuesday, and would use it to inoculate healthcare workers caring directly for COVID-19 patients. Neighboring Manitoba said it expected enough Pfizer vaccine next week to immunize 900 healthcare workers.  General immunization for all 38 million Canadians will begin in April 2021 with a goal of 100% coverage by the end of the third quarter, Health Canada said in a document.  WHO WILL RECEIVE THE FIRST DOSES?  Officials say priority groups such as healthcare workers, employees in long-term care homes, vulnerable members of the elderly population and those living in remote Indigenous communities will receive vaccines first.  HOW WILL VACCINES BE TRANSPORTED AND TO WHERE?  Provincial orders for vaccines will be coordinated through a national operations center with help from the military.  Pfizer\u2019s ultra-low temperature vaccine will be transported by the manufacturer directly to the 14 points of inoculation that Ottawa has set up across the country.  The federal government has contracted FedEx Corp and Innomar Strategies, a Canada-based division of AmerisourceBergen to provide logistical support on vaccine delivery.  Frozen vaccines, like Moderna\u2019s, will be transported by federally contracted logistics service providers from where they are manufactured to set points of delivery.  Canada is now running distribution drills to ensure that critical capability gaps are filled, risks are mitigated, and contingencies are put in place.  WHICH OTHER VACCINES ARE IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS  Canadian officials say the next regulatory decision will be on Moderna Inc\u2019s candidate vaccine. Canada also has agreements to purchase the potential vaccines of Novavax Inc, Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi SA with GlaxoSmithKline Plc, AstraZeneca Plc, and Medicago.  If all were to receive regulatory approval, Canada could buy enough doses to vaccinate the country more than five times over.  Canada expects the first 6 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna Inc to arrive in the first quarter of 2021, enough for 3 million of the 38 million population.  WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF ADMINISTERING VACCINES TO PEOPLE?  Health authorities in the provinces and territories are responsible for determining how vaccines will be deployed and on administering them to their populations. Inoculation will be free.  Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province, has also set up a task force headed by Canada\u2019s former Chief of the Defence Staff Rick Hillier.","1165":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon has secured about 2 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which will cover 20% of the country\u2019s nationals, the health minister said on Monday.

Lifting global sentiment was news that Pfizer Inc's experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, a major victory in the war against a pandemic. The People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.5897 per dollar prior to market open, 226 pips firmer than the previous fix of 6.6123 and its strongest level since June 27, 2018. The spot market opened at 6.6175 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.6058 at midday, 222 pips firmer than the previous late session close. But gains in the yuan were capped by rising borrowing costs in the interbank market, as some market participants interpreted tighter liquidity as a sign of authorities' low tolerance for fast rallies. As such, traders refrained from testing new highs in the local unit. \"The PBOC has drained cash from money market recently. It is quite an obvious signal that the authorities are attempting to ease the pace of yuan appreciation,\" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) for the overnight tenor rose to 2.333% on Tuesday, the highest level since Oct. 28. The yuan rose to a more than 28-month high against an easing dollar on Monday, underpinned by improving market sentiment as investors welcomed Joe Biden's election as U.S. president. \"The yuan's appreciation trend is yet to be over and it probably would rise above 6.5 per dollar thanks to China's solid economic fundamentals, historically high U.S.-China interest rate spread and potential weakness in the greenback,\" CIB Research said in a note. The currency's climb on Tuesday was also contained by downbeat inflation data. China's factory-gate prices fell at a sharper-than-expected pace in October, weighed by soft demand for fuel even as the country's trade and manufacturing sectors staged impressive recoveries from their COVID-19 slump. China's new bank loans are expected to fall sharply in October from the previous month, but are likely to be higher than a year earlier, as the central bank maintains policy support for the economy because of the global pandemic.

The U.S. yield curve, viewed in part as a gauge of risk appetite, also flattened on Thursday, after steepening the last few sessions on positive COVID-19 vaccine news from Pfizer Inc early this week. Analysts said investors are realizing that distributing the vaccine to the world would take time. Demand at the $27 billion U.S. 30-year bond auction on Thursday was decent, analysts said, although the yield of 1.68% exceeded market expectations at the bid deadline. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.29, slightly higher than the August refunding but the same number as the October reopening. Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, took 61.9% of the total, a little better than the 59.8% takedown at the August refunding. \"The 30-year auction was solid,\" said Jim Vogel, senior rates strategist, at FHN Financial in Memphis. \"We had good participation in the face of a 9 basis-point rally in the 30-year and therefore we have kept the price gains in Treasuries today.\" Thursday's data on U.S. consumer prices, which were unexpectedly unchanged in October, kept yields lower. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, CPI was also flat after rising 0.2% the prior month. In afternoon trading, U.S. benchmark 10-year yields were down at 0.884%, from 0.989% late on Tuesday. Bond markets were closed on Wednesday for Veterans Day. Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, said the 1% yield on the 10-year note is a big psychological level. \"But it's going to take a little bit of effort to get through that 1%, and today's CPI number didn't help. Rising coronavirus cases every day won't help either,\" he added. On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 10,314,254 cases, up 143,408 from its previous count, and said the number of deaths had risen by 1,479 to 241,069. U.S. 30-year yields fell to 1.645% from Tuesday's 1.76%. On the front end of the curve, U.S. two-year yields slipped to 0.176% from 0.185% on Tuesday. The U.S. yield curve, meanwhile, flattened, with the spread between the two-year and 10-year narrowing to 70 basis points . U.S. President-elect Joe Biden moved ahead with planning his new administration on Thursday as his fellow Democrats in Congress blasted Republican \"shenanigans\" challenging Donald Trump's election loss. The post-election uncertainty has weighed on bond investors as well and kept a lid on U.S. rates. In Thursday's research note about the U.S. election outcome, Fitch Ratings said it expected a \"noisy but ultimately orderly\" shift of power to the Biden administration. The ratings agency said it also expected Republicans to keep control of the U.S. Senate, noting that a divided government could pose a \"serious obstacle to legislation that would address structural issues.\" November 12 Thursday 3:25PM New York \/ 2025 GMT Price Current Net Yield % Change (bps) Three-month bills 0.09 0.0913 -0.005 Six-month bills 0.1 0.1014 -0.003 Two-year note 99-230\/256 0.1768 -0.008 Three-year note 100-14\/256 0.2317 -0.026 Five-year note 99-72\/256 0.3964 -0.064 Seven-year note 99-16\/256 0.6378 -0.088 10-year note 99-240\/256 0.8815 -0.108 20-year bond 95-12\/256 1.4132 -0.118 30-year bond 93-172\/256 1.6448 -0.115 DOLLAR SWAP SPREADS Last (bps) Net Change (bps) U.S. 2-year dollar swap 8.25 0.50 spread U.S. 3-year dollar swap 7.25 1.25 spread U.S. 5-year dollar swap 5.50 0.50 spread U.S. 10-year dollar swap -1.00 -1.75 spread U.S. 30-year dollar swap -34.50 0.00 spread (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Jonathan Oatis and Richard Chang)","1170":"BELGRADE, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Ana Brnabic received Serbia\u2019s first COVID-19 vaccine shot on Thursday, kicking off a mass inoculation drive with doses developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer Inc. is seen at a branch in Zurich, Switzerland October 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  Nearly all of the price increases will be below 10%, and around half of them are in the range of 4 to 6%, said 3 Axis co-founder Eric Pachman. The median price increase is around 5%, he said.  More price increases are expected to be announced later this week, which could affect the median and range.  Soaring U.S. prescription drug prices are expected to again be a central issue in the presidential election. President Donald Trump, who made bringing them down a core pledge of his 2016 campaign, is running for re-election in 2020.  Many branded drugmakers have pledged to keep their U.S. list price increases below 10% a year, under pressure from politicians and patients.  Drugmakers often negotiate rebates on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from healthcare payers. As a result, health insurers and patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug.  Pfizer will hike prices on more than 50 drugs, including its cancer treatment Ibrance, which is on track to bring in nearly $5 billion in revenue this year, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz.  Pfizer spokeswoman Amy Rose confirmed the company\u2019s planned price increases. She said the company plans to increase the list prices on around 27% of its portfolio in the United States by an average of 5.6%.  Of the medicines with increases, she said 43% of them are sterile injectibles, and many of those increases are less than $1 per product.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  GlaxoSmithKline said it will raise prices on more than 30 drugs. The company will raise prices on the blockbuster respiratory treatments it delivers through its Ellipta inhaler, its recently acquired cancer drug Zejula and on several products in its HIV-focused ViiV joint venture, according to 3 Axis Advisors. Price increases ranged between 1% and 5%.  Sanofi said it will raise prices on around 10 of its drugs, with hikes ranging between 1% and 5%. The drugmaker noted the increases are in line with its commitment to not raise prices above medical inflation.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.TA raised prices on more than 15 drugs, in some cases by more than 6%, according to 3 Axis Advisors. A Teva spokesperson said the company regularly reviews prices in the context of market conditions, availability and cost of production.  3 Axis advises pharmacy industry groups on identifying inefficiencies in the U.S. drug supply chain and has provided consulting work to hedge fund billionaire John Arnold, a prominent critic of high drug prices.  STAYING OUT OF THE CROSSHAIRS?  Ian Spatz, a senior adviser at consulting firm Manatt Health, said that drugmakers could be holding to relatively low price hikes in an attempt to stay out of politicians\u2019 crosshairs. Trump, for instance, targeted Pfizer after a proposed round of price increases in 2018, saying in a tweet that the drugmaker \u201cshould be ashamed.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m sure many manufacturers are interested in making sure they are not called out on a large list price increase,\u201d Spatz said.  The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world\u2019s most lucrative market for manufacturers.  Trump, a Republican, has struggled to deliver on a pledge to lower drug prices before the November 2020 election. His administration recently proposed a rule to allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada.  The administration had previously scrapped an ambitious policy that would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates they receive from drugmakers to Medicare patients.  The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed a bill earlier in December that would cap prices for the country\u2019s most expensive drugs based on international prices and penalize drugmakers that do not negotiate with the Medicare insurance program for seniors.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Lebanon said in mid-December it was expecting to sign a deal for supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and hoped to receive the first batch eight weeks after that.  But the country, now struggling with a severe spike in infections that has overwhelmed hospitals, hit a legal stumbling block that has so far prevented it from finalising the agreement.  The new law would give Pfizer-BioNtech, and other companies that provide vaccines to Lebanon, protection from any future liability claims for two years.  It includes a clause that points to the Lebanese health ministry as the only entity responsible for compensation.  Lebanon is under a three-week lockdown that ends on Feb. 1 and a strict 24-hour curfew until Jan. 25 after lax measures over the Christmas and New Year\u2019s holiday period led to a spike in cases.  Hamad Hasan, the country\u2019s caretaker health minister, has previously said the ministry had secured about 2 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, to cover 20% of Lebanese nationals, but the government has yet to announce a starting date for a national vaccination programme.  Hasan on Friday tweeted his thanks to the parliament for approving the law. He has been hospitalised since Wednesday with coronavirus but is in stable condition and continuing to work from his hospital bed.  Apart from the anticipated Pfizer-BioNtech deal, Lebanon\u2019s President Michel Aoun approved on Friday the transfer of 26.4 billion Lebanese pounds ($17.53 million) to COVAX to book 2.73 million vaccines, his official twitter account said.  The country had previously signed up for COVAX, the global scheme backed by the World Health Organization to provide vaccines to poorer countries.  As of Thursday, Lebanon had recorded 237,132 cases of coronavirus and 1,781 deaths since the start of the pandemic.  The latest spike in infections has hit the country hard as its medical system was already reeling from a severe financial crisis that led to supply shortages, and a port explosion in August that damaged major hospitals in Beirut.

Pfizer vaccine appears highly effective  An experimental COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc PFE.N and BioNTech SA 22UAy.DE appears to be more than 90% effective, based on data analyzed midway through a gold-standard clinical trial, the companies announced on Monday. The trial has enrolled 43,538 participants so far, including many from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds. Pfizer said researchers had analyzed 94 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in trial participants and found the vast majority of the infections were in volunteers in the placebo group. The trial is expected to continue until 164 confirmed cases of COVID-19 are available for analysis. BioNTech's co-founder and chief executive said he was optimistic that the protective effect of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine would last for at least a year.

Researchers analyzed nearly 12,000 visits by adult patients to emergency departments at five New York City hospitals. They found COVID-19 in 57.5% of patients who went to the hospital because of weakness, falls, or altered mental status, in 55.5% of those who came in because their blood sugar was out of control, and in 51.4% of patients whose chief complaint was a gastrointestinal problem. Patients over the age of 65 tended to have more atypical complaints such as diarrhea, fatigue and weakness. Patients with dehydration, altered mental status, falls and high blood sugar were at higher risk for death in the study. The new findings can help hospitals provide better care and are \"also important for family members and people that work with the elderly to better identify possible warning signs of COVID-19 infection,\" coauthor Dr. Christopher Clifford of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai told Reuters. (bit.ly\/3pcqjnp)  COVID-19 can fuse heart cells, disrupt rhythm  COVID-19 can disrupt the heart's electric system, according to a report undergoing peer review at a Nature Research journal. The heart pumps blood by sending electrical signals through its \"conducting cells\" to tell \"muscle cells\" to contract. Normally, each conducting cell activates the one next to it in a domino effect to ensure smooth contractions. An autopsy of a COVID-19 patient found the virus had infected her heart in an unusual patchy pattern, \"with small islands of infected cells here and there,\" Dr. Jay Schneider of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota told Reuters. Upon further study in the laboratory, his team realized the spike protein on the surface of the new coronavirus can create holes between neighboring cells, causing them to fuse together. So instead of orderly electrical signal transmission and a steady heart rhythm, the signals flow like \"a tsunami tidal wave\" through the fused cells.

The following is what people getting the vaccine should expect.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE GETS THE VACCINE?  The vaccine, developed with new messenger RNA technology using a manufactured fragment of the coronavirus\u2019 genetic code, is injected into the arm. The inoculation is given in two doses, three weeks apart, and has been shown in trials to prevent illness from COVID-19 in 95% of recipients.  Pfizer has said side effects in trial volunteers were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The most severe side effects occurred after the second dose: fatigue in 3.8% of volunteers and headache in 2%. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.  WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION DOES IT GIVE?  The vaccine begins conferring some protection after the first shot and reaches full effectiveness about a week after the second shot, according to a review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday.  Clinical trials so far have not been designed to determine if an immunized person can still spread the coronavirus to someone else. Some vaccines, such as hepatitis A, do provide such protection - known as sterilizing immunity - but others do not. COVID-19 vaccine makers focused trials on determining whether the drug stopped people from becoming ill.  It will also be several more months before it becomes clear how long the vaccination will protect someone from the coronavirus.  \u201cUntil then, it is better to avoid the pub, and other in-person gatherings with many people,\u201d said Dr. Anita Shet, infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  DOES THE VACCINE MEAN BACK TO NORMAL LIFE?  Since there is no evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of the virus - and no vaccine is 100% effective - scientists call for continued vigilance, including mask-wearing, hand-washing and social distancing.  \u201cAs with all vaccines, it may work really great in certain patient subsets, but not as well in others ... Does that mean you are free to hop on a plane or have 30 people over at your house? Probably not,\u201d said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director for infection prevention at Colorado\u2019s UCHealth.  Vaccination campaigns are unlikely to reach \u201ca critical mass\u201d until next spring or early summer.","1188":"FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), is seen in London, Britain, April 25, 2017.

FILE PHOTO: People wearing protective face masks walk past office buildings in Lujiazui financial district in Pudong, in Shanghai, following the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, China June 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Aly Song  Global coronavirus cases now exceed 50 million but encouraging news on Pfizer\u2019s experimental vaccine could be a game-changer for world growth. Here are some shapes being used to describe the outlook during extraordinary times.  1. \u201cW\u201d  A growth double-dip is viewed as the likely scenario for major economies such as the United States and Europe, many of which are facing another coronavirus wave and activity curbs. That trajectory is captured by a \u201cW\u201d, largely replacing the \u201cU\u201d shaped rebound projected by some earlier this year.  For instance, a euro zone Q3 economic bounce caused by economies reopening from the first set of lockdowns, is expected to turn into another contraction in the fourth quarter.  But the second leg of the double-dip should be shallower than the first because restrictions are less harsh, while consumers and firms are better prepared.  For an interactive version of the graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs\/35lc0VJ.  2. \u201cV\u201d  If a vaccine is rolled out sooner than expected, forecasts for a V-shaped economic rebound could make a comeback.  And a \u201cV\u201d trajectory remains the base case for Asia, which has not been hit as hard by a coronavirus second wave.  China will be the only major economy to expand this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, which expects 1.9% growth in 2020 and 8.2% in 2021.  For an interactive version of the graphic, click here tmsnrt.rs\/3k8nzUo.  3. Square root \u201c\u221a\u201d  The mathematical square root sign conveys a dip, followed by a recovery, which then flatlines. More bullish than the double-dip W-shape, but less bullish than a V, the square root is meant to illustrate that while renewed lockdowns will limit growth they won\u2019t necessarily result in a further growth decline.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to go with more the square root, or in golfing there\u2019s a term called the \u2018dogleg\u2019 which seems appropriate \u2013 which is more that it goes down, and then up, and then tapers off,\u201d said Wells Fargo Asset Management senior investment strategist Brian Jacobsen.  Square root shape recovery for UK  4. Greek \u201c\u03bc\u201d  If euro zone growth contracts less severely than feared, the path could take the shape of the Greek letter \u201c\u03bc\u201d -- an outlook that is slightly less harsh than the double dip captured by a \u201cW\u201d.  The economy expanded 12.7% in the July-September period, after contracting 11.8% in the previous quarter. This bigger-than-anticipated bounce should lift average 2020 and 2021 growth, blurring the impact of any fourth-quarter contraction.  Gilles Moec, chief economist at Axa Investment Managers, expects a 4-5% shock to Q4 zone GDP, bringing this year\u2019s overall decline to around 8%.  \u201cBut it would still be a very special form of \u201cW\u201d trajectory, since the second leg would be significantly shallower than the first one,\u201d Moec said. \u201cThe best analogy we would find is with the Greek letter \u03bc.\u201d  Euro area GDP in a '\u03bc' shape  5. \u201cK\u201d  Another shape under consideration is \u201cK\u201d in which sectors take divergent paths. In this scenario, some businesses such as manufacturing bounce back sharply as restrictions ease, while others such as services sector firms struggle until a vaccine is rolled out.  \u201cI increasingly like this to describe the outlook... it means there will be sectors that thrive from the lockdown and those that are under pressure for instance travel, leisure, and aviation,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro for ING Research.

Canada, struggling to deal with a rapidly spreading second wave of the coronavirus, has reported a total of 18,120 deaths and 715,072 cases so far.  European governments last week said the Pfizer supply problems were unacceptable and meant the credibility of their vaccination programs was at risk.  Canadian Procurement Minister Anita Anand said the delay was \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, adding she had insisted to Pfizer over the weekend that Canada be treated fairly and not be forced to wait longer than other nations for vaccines.  \u201cPfizer assured me and Canada of equitable treatment,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cPfizer Canada has assured us that we will have our full allotment and I believe Europe will also receive its full allotment.\u201d  The premier of Alberta said on Monday his province would run out of doses within a day.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Federal health officials met with Pfizer representatives on Tuesday as Brazil seeks to secure vaccine supplies. The Health Ministry said in a statement that it would buy the Pfizer vaccine, currently in Phase 3 trials, if it was proven safe and was registered with health authority Anvisa.  As it draws up immunization plans, the ministry will also meet this week with Johnson & Johnson, India\u2019s Bharat Biotech and the makers of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine.  Brazil has the third-highest coronavirus case count in the world, leading many pharmaceutical companies to do trials of their vaccines in South America\u2019s largest country.  State health authorities have taken a more aggressive stance than their federal counterparts on securing vaccine supplies.  The director of Sao Paulo state\u2019s Butantan Institute biomedical center, Dimas Covas, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that Butantan expected to have 46 million doses of Sinovac ready in January to be used if approved by Brazil\u2019s health regulator Anvisa.  Butantan is organizing the Phase 3 trials of the vaccine in Brazil, with Covas saying preliminary results indicate it has an excellent safety profile.  Covas said 10,000 volunteers had already received about 19,000 shots of the two-dose vaccine, and 2,000 other people had still to be included in the trials.  Anvisa suspended the trials for a day and a half last week after the death of a volunteer, which police reported as a suicide and Butantan said had no relation to the vaccine.  The temporary halt had no affect on the clinical trials, Covas said, adding that Butantan had a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d with Anvisa.  Butantan and Anvisa have sent experts to China where they are in a two-week quarantine before they can visit vaccine facilities, they said.","1216":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico can see an end to the coronavirus pandemic on the horizon with the first doses of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine scheduled to arrive in weeks, said a top official in charge of the country\u2019s international response to the health crisis.  FILE PHOTO: People are seen on the street as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak continues in Mexico City, Mexico December 4, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlos Jasso  Martha Delgado, a deputy foreign minister tasked with helping to secure vaccine supplies for Mexico, said Pfizer had agreed to deliver doses to the different points of vaccination across the country rather than to a central distribution center.  That will significantly reduce a potential logistical nightmare for Mexico, which does not have the super-cold storage facilities needed to distribute the shots.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is based on a novel technology that uses synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) to activate the immune system against the virus and needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below.  \u201cThe super-freezing cold chain this particular vaccine requires would be handled by the company until the point of delivery,\u201d Delgado told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday.  Mexico has inked an agreement with Pfizer to acquire 34.4 million doses of its two-shot vaccine, and the first 250,000 shots are expected to arrive this month, with deliveries possibly continuing until December of 2021. The government has said it will prioritize vaccinating health workers.  The prospect of vaccine delivery is the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d of the pandemic, said Delgado.  Pfizer submitted details about its vaccine to Mexico\u2019s health regulator, Cofepris, last month and is awaiting approval.  The agreement is for 250,000 doses to be shipped in December once the vaccine is approved. After those shots reach their destination, the delivery of the second doses is triggered three weeks later, Delgado said.  The government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has also signed a pre-purchase agreement for the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University. Mexico expects enough doses to be delivered between March and August to inoculate 38.7 million people.  But a hiccup in that vaccine\u2019s late-stage clinical trial in which some volunteers received a half dose followed by a full dose, instead of two full doses, could delay delivery, said Delgado.  The half-dose first pattern was found to be 90% effective in preventing illness, versus a 62% success rate with the two full dose regimen, according to interim data.  \u201cOnce we have the results of the study confirming (the new data), I think they\u2019ll also tell us if we have a week, two, or I don\u2019t know how many of delay in delivery,\u201d Delgado said.  Mexico also has a pre-purchase agreement to supply doses for 35 million people with a vaccine from China\u2019s CanSino Biologics Inc, which is conducting large-scale trials at 19 test centers in the country.  Delgado said CanSino\u2019s trial in Mexico has enrolled some 15,000 participants out of a 40,000-volunteer global program, and delivery could happen from early next year through Sept. 2021.  Mexico had said first deliveries could happen in December.  \u201cOver a third of CanSino\u2019s global clinical trial is happening here in Mexico. So this is very relevant; it also demonstrates technical confidence,\u201d said Delgado, adding that the Chinese firm has invested over $280 million in Mexico.  Additionally, Mexico has secured enough vaccines to cover 20% of its population through the global COVAX facility mechanism, led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization to promote equitable access.  Mexico has a population of over 120 million and the virus has killed more than 108,000 people. Infections are around peak levels, so hopes are riding high on the vaccines.  \u201cThere is a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Delgado said.","1217":"FILE PHOTO: A man walks past Pfizer's world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sought leave to appeal against a judgment by a Federal Court in May, when Pfizer was alleged to have abused its market power by offering big discounts and rebates on Lipitor to pharmacies.  The drug stores were said to have bought large quantities of the drug and agreed to limit re-supply of competing generic atorvastatin products.  The court had found that Pfizer took advantage of its substantial market power, but did not accept the ACCC\u2019s argument that Pfizer had acted to lessen or deter competition.  Pfizer Australia said, in an emailed statement to Reuters, it welcomed the High Court\u2019s decision to dismiss ACCC\u2019s case.

Getting the full six doses from vials of the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot \u2013 as allowed this month by the European Union\u2019s health regulator \u2013 requires needles that are both thin enough to minimize waste and long enough to deliver the jab, as required, into the recipient\u2019s shoulder muscle.  Fignon\u2019s hospital in the Mediterranean resort of Cannes was sent needles from the French public health authority that were too short, he said, forcing it to hunt locally for supplies. Other nearby hospitals got the right needles and were generous enough to share some.  \u201cTo us, it looks like Russian roulette,\u201d Fignon told Reuters. \u201cYou do not know what you will be getting.\u201d  Similar shortages are cropping up elsewhere in Europe, complicating a stuttering start to vaccination efforts that have been compounded by warnings from Pfizer and AstraZeneca, its Anglo-Swedish peer, that they will not be able to meet vaccine supply commitments in the near term.  Pfizer now forecasts it will produce 2 billion doses this year, but this assumes it will be possible to extract the full six from each vial. It charges by the dose, meaning the cost of a vial has gone up 20%.  The European Commission is pressing Pfizer and German partner BioNTech to deliver more of the low-dead-space needles to extract the extra dose.  BioNTech says it has procured 50 million needles that it can sell at cost to countries around the world, and is seeking to buy more. That compares with the EU\u2019s order of up to 600 million doses of its vaccine.  Industry executives say that, while output of needles and syringes is sufficient to meet current demand, chaotic ordering means that they often do not get to where they are most urgently needed. Work is under way to assess future demand and find ways to meet it, they say.

Some, like Baden-Wuerttemberg and Thuringia, had the good fortune to order the right kind of needles and syringes early on. But others, including Bavaria, Saarland and Lower Saxony, didn\u2019t and are having to place follow-on orders, say officials.  Saxony, on the Czech border, is also having to shop around as scarce supply forces up prices, said Lars Werthmann, regional head of vaccine logistics at the German Red Cross.  \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to forfeit a single dose at the moment. And we can\u2019t justify failing because of a 5-cent syringe,\u201d Werthmann told Reuters.  Europe\u2019s leading maker of injection equipment, a privately owned German company called B.Braun, says it faces increased demand for syringes and other products needed for vaccinations.  \u201cWith our competitors, we are currently able to cover all demands in connection with products needed for the vaccinations,\u201d said spokeswoman Christine Bossek. \u201cWe are working in parallel on solutions to ensure that this will also be the case in the future.\u201d  German medical technology industry association BVMed said there were no production bottlenecks and that supplies of syringes and needles were adequate. But muddled orders were complicating distribution, it added, calling for better coordination.  SHOT UTENSILS  Switzerland had placed orders for so-called \u201cshot utensils\u201d to deliver five doses per vial. With six now allowed, it is in talks with Pfizer to supply equipment needed to draw that number of doses, the Federal Office of Public Health said.  Officials in Britain, which has made a faster start to its vaccination drive, say that health teams are well supplied with the right injection kit.  Back in Cannes, Fignon says he and his colleagues have managed to extract six doses from the Pfizer vials but this will not last unless doctors get the equipment they need.  \u201cSome countries had the right equipment from the very start; we did not here in France,\u201d he said.The French health ministry has acknowledged that extracting the sixth dose was challenging and required specific equipment.

The U.S. drugmaker is tapping its network of around 200 outside contractors, which includes Catalent Inc and Lonza Group AG, to play a bigger role in producing some of its existing medicines, Mike McDermott, president of global supply at Pfizer, told Reuters in an interview.  That will help Pfizer shift a portion of production at four of its vaccine manufacturing facilities, including one of its largest U.S. factories, toward the coronavirus vaccine while preventing disruptions in supply of its other products, he said.  \u201cThey have been hugely helpful in the past and will help us through this,\u201d McDermott said.  Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (22UAy.F) said on Tuesday they have begun delivering doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidates for initial human testing in the United States. Trials in Germany had already begun.  If successful, Pfizer said it hopes to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as October. It could distribute up to 20 million doses by the end of 2020, and potentially hundreds of millions next year, it said.  The shift to outside production of other medicines will primarily effect vaccines and intravenous drugs. Pfizer currently produces around 1.5 billion doses of intravenously injected vaccines and drugs each year.  McDermott said Pfizer will also add additional shifts to its own factories, hire more workers to take advantage of its unused production capacity, and stockpile current products in preparation for the shift to COVID-19 vaccine production.  Pfizer said earlier this week it was preparing four of its manufacturing sites - three in the United States and one in Belgium - to produce the vaccine, even before clinical trials shows which, if any, of the four potential candidates being tested demonstrates efficacy in preventing infection with the novel coronavirus.  It will cost Pfizer at least $150 million to gear up its facilities for the new vaccine, McDermott said.  Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccine candidates use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has long been talked about but has yet to produce an approved product. The mRNA technology instructs cells in the body to make specific coronavirus proteins that then produce an immune response.  It has the potential to be among the first vaccines against the virus that has infected more than 1 million people in the United States and killed over 77,000.  Producing vast quantities of vaccines requires that Pfizer and BioNTech work to rapidly scale up their suppliers\u2019 ability to make raw materials for mRNA vaccines, McDermott said, adding that many are small biotechs.  It could also face potential shortages of more basic materials, he added, such as the vials and syringes used to contain and administer vaccines.  Those materials \u201ccould become stressed in this environment, where you are trying to produce your ... existing products and add in vaccines needed for hundreds of millions or billions of people,\u201d McDermott said.  Contract manufacturers Lonza and Catalent are also working with other drugmakers to help produce potential treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus.  Last week, Lonza said it was working with Moderna Inc to help it produce its experimental mRNA vaccine being developed with U.S. government backing.  Catalent agreed last month to help Johnson & Johnson manufacture its coronavirus vaccine candidate.  Lonza and Catalent did not immediately respond to requests for comment about their work with Pfizer.  Pfizer also operates its own contract manufacturer, CenterOne, which provides raw materials to other drugmakers.","1231":"May 17 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * LYRICA\u00ae (PREGABALIN) ORAL SOLUTION CV PHASE 3 TRIAL IN PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY MEETS PRIMARY ENDPOINT  * PFIZER - POSITIVE TOP-LINE RESULTS OF PHASE 3 STUDY EXAMINING USE OF LYRICA ORAL SOLUTION CV AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY  * PFIZER - RESULTS SHOWED ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT WITH LYRICA 14 MG\/KG\/DAY RESULTED IN STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY VERSUS PLACEBO  * PFIZER INC - TREATMENT WITH LYRICA AT LOWER DOSE DID NOT RESULT IN STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY VERSUS PLACEBO Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1232":"FILE PHOTO: Britain's Health Secretary Matt Hancock speaks during a media briefing, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, at 10 Downing Street, in London, Britain November 16, 2020.

But a lower dose of the drug, tanezumab, failed to alleviate pain when compared with a placebo, the companies said in a statement.  The drug was being tested in patients who had already used three different classes of painkillers but had not experienced enough relief or were intolerant to those treatments.  Tanezumab belongs to a category of pain medications that target the nerve growth factor, a protein involved in the growth of nerve cells.  U.S. health regulators have been encouraging the development of such pain medicines rather than opioids, as the United States faces an epidemic of opioid use and abuse.  Chronic low back pain affects an estimated 33 million Americans and is a leading cause of disability, Pfizer and Lilly said. Treatment often requires painkillers such as codeine, in cases where over-the-counter medication does not help.  Last year, the two companies reported positive results from a late-stage study testing tanezumab in patients with osteoarthritis pain of the knee or hip.","1235":"* Pfizer update on coronavirus vaccine sends shares, oil higher  * Soybeans already supported by strong demand, S.

Broad optimism about Pfizer\u2019s vaccine trials added support to a soybean market already buoyed by strong Chinese demand and weather risks in South America.

Most-active corn futures crawled 3\/4-cent higher to $4.07-1\/2 per bushel, while wheat slid 4-1\/2 cents to $5.97-1\/2 per bushel at the CBOT.  Traders adjusted positions in the markets before the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues a monthly report on Tuesday that is expected to trim the government\u2019s estimates for domestic soybean and corn yields and inventories.  An uptick in demand for U.S. farm products from China, the world\u2019s top soybean importer, has helped to draw down U.S. ending stocks.  The USDA, in a daily reporting system for export sales, said on Monday that exporters sold 123,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to unknown destinations.  The deal is \u201ca continuation of post-election buying,\u201d Feltes said, after the USDA on Friday announced separate U.S. soybean export sales to China and unknown buyers.  The USDA, in a weekly report released after the market closed on Monday, said the U.S. soybean crop was 92% harvested and corn was 91% harvested, compared with expectations for 94% and 91%, respectively.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Opioid abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and drugmakers have been looking for less addictive and safer options for people wanting to reduce pain.  The treatment, tanezumab, belongs to an investigational category of pain medications that target nerve growth factor, a protein involved in the growth of nerve cells, and is also being evaluated to treat chronic lower back and cancer pain.  U.S. regulators in 2015 lifted a hold on trials of medicines targeting the protein due to concerns they could worsen osteoarthritis in a small percentage of patients.  Pfizer\u2019s shares were marginally up at $37.79 in premarket trade. Eli Lilly shares rose 1 percent to $90.50.  The study showed that patients who received two doses of the drug, tanezumab, showed a statistically significant improvement in physical function and an assessment of osteoarthritis by the patients, when compared to placebo, meeting all three goals of the study.  Preliminary safety data showed that the drug was generally well-tolerated in these patients, with only about 1 percent of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects.  \u201cSafety concerns have been an overhang on the tanezumab opportunity. The data today should alleviate some of those concerns, in our opinion,\u201d Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louis Chen said.  Pfizer and Lilly, in a $1.8 billion deal, agreed in 2013 to jointly develop and sell tanezumab for several pain-related conditions, with the companies equally sharing development expenses and future sales.  The drug\u2019s sales are expected to reach $283 million for Pfizer by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters\u2019 data.  Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting about 20 million people in the United States alone.  Due to the lack of effective alternatives, patients with painful conditions like osteoarthritis and cancer turn to opioids for managing their symptoms. On average, 115 Americans die every day from opioid overdose.","1244":"May 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc\u2019s quarterly profit rose 14 percent, led by higher sales of breast cancer drug Ibrance.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it had received the first data on the vaccine in June and carried out a rigorous rolling analysis to international standards before giving its approval.  Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the jab are needed per person to gain immunity.  Below are details on the manufacturing and storage process, and the British vaccination programme:  MANUFACTURING PROCESS:  - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below.  - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days.  - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius).  - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites.  BRITISH ROLLOUT:  - Britain will start vaccinating people early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Belgium. The speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine, Britain said.  - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year.  - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.  - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the jab.  - 50 hospitals are set up across England and waiting to accept the vaccine, vaccination centres are being set up now, and in time local health centres known as general practitioners (GPs) and pharmacists will provide the jab in the community if they have those capabilities.  - The community element is likely to take on a larger role if a rival vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is approved, because it does not need such cold storage and is easier to deliver.","1249":"March 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc:  * PFIZER ANNOUNCES TOP-LINE RESULTS FROM PHASE 3 STUDY OF 20-VALENT PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINE IN PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE-NA\u00cfVE ADULTS AGED 18 YEARS OR OLDER  * PFIZER INC - ENCOURAGED BY RESULTS FROM STUDY & REMAIN ON TRACK TO FILE ADULT 20VPNC INDICATION WITH FDA BY END OF 2020  * PFIZER - PRIMARY IMMUNOGENICITY OF NON-INFERIORITY FOR 20 SEROTYPES INCLUDED IN 20VPNC IN ADULTS OVER 60 YEARS & OLDER AT 1 MONTH AFTER VACCINATION MET  * PFIZER INC - SECONDARY IMMUNOGENICITY OBJECTIVES FOR ADULTS 18-59 YEARS OLD COMPARED TO THOSE 60-64 YEARS OLD MET NON-INFERIORITY FOR ALL 20 SEROTYPES Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","1250":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is investing $500 million to expand a manufacturing facility in Sanford, North Carolina, that plays a central role in its efforts to become a major player in gene therapy, the company said on Wednesday.

Pfizer has been looking to move into innovative and fast- growing therapeutic areas such as oncology and gene therapy in recent years as it prepares for a looming patent cliff on some of its biggest drugs in the mid-2020\u2019s.  In March, Pfizer agreed to buy gene therapies under development at French biotech Vivet Therapeutics for as much as $636 million. It has gene therapies under development for diseases including DMD, hemophilia, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Pfizer is in a race with rivals such as Sarepta Therapeutics Inc to be the first to bring a curative, late-stage treatment to DMD market.  Sarepta recently faced a setback when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, citing safety risks, rejected its application to market a DMD treatment called Vyondys 53, which is not a gene therapy.  Pfizer has been making big moves toward becoming a more streamlined business focused exclusively on innovative drugs.

The vaccine\u2019s efficacy was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities - a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately hurt the elderly and certain groups including Black people.  Tracking the vaccine race tmsnrt.rs\/3nEc4Gz  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could grant emergency-use by the middle of December, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters TV. Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December, he added.  \u201cIf all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,\u201d he said.  The success rate of the vaccine developed by the U.S. drugmaker and German partner BioNTech was far higher than what regulators had said would have been acceptable. Experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic.  Of the 170 volunteers who contracted COVID-19 in Pfizer\u2019s trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received a placebo and not the vaccine, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe COVID-19, one had received the vaccine.  \u201cA first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,\u201d said Enrico Bucci, a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. \u201cToday is a special day.\u201d  BioNTech\u2019s Sahin said U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) would be applied for on Friday.  An FDA advisory committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10 to discuss the vaccine, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment.  COVID-19 RUNS RAMPANT  The final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc MRNA.O on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness.  \u201cWe now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.  The Moderna vaccine is likely to be authorized within seven to 10 days of Pfizer receiving its EUA, U.S. officials said, with states ready to begin distribution within 24 hours.  The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.  The news was especially welcome with the virus again running rampant around the world, setting records for new infections and hospitalizations almost daily.  The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over age 65, a particularly high-risk group.  FILE PHOTO: Syringes are seen in front of displayed Biontech and Pfizer logos in this illustration taken November 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  \u201cThis is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,\u201d said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool\u2019s department of pharmacology.  Global shares rose as the trial results countered concerns around the soaring infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.6% while BioNTech jumped 3.8% in the United States. Moderna shares fell 3.6%.  Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future.  DISTRIBUTING SHOTS  Pfizer said it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country.  On Wednesday, Pfizer said it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses in the first half of 2021. It also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year.  Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization\u2019s top emergency expert, said it would be at least 4-6 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world.  Distribution of a Pfizer-BioNTech shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in normal refrigeration for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.  Moderna\u2019s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36\u00b0-46\u00b0F).  FATIGUE AND HEADACHES  Pfizer said vaccine was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue (3.8%) and headaches (2%) after the second dose. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.  \u201cThese are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,\u201d said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge.  Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said it is on track to deliver data this year.  Authorization of vaccines for children will take longer. Only Pfizer has started vaccinating volunteers under age 18 and as young as 12. Moderna and J&J have said they hope to start testing the vaccine in younger people soon.","1253":"FILE PHOTO: A woman is placed in an ambulance outside the Sienna St. George long term care home (at rear) as frontline care workers and their union, SEIU Healthcare, hold a rally to demand that Sienna Senior Living invest more on resident care and staff safety amid a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada January 7, 2021.

Scientists, public health officials and investors welcomed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test as a watershed moment that could help turn the tide of the pandemic if the full trial results pan out. However, mass roll-outs, which needs regulatory approval, will not happen this year and several vaccines are seen as necessary to meet massive global needs.  Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F said they had found no serious safety concerns yet and expected to seek U.S. emergency use authorization this month, raising the chance of a regulatory decision as soon as December.  If granted, the companies estimate they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  \u201cToday is a great day for science and humanity,\u201d said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla, noting the data milestone comes with \u201cinfection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.\u201d  Experts said they wanted to see the full trial data, but the preliminary results looked encouraging.  \u201cThis news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general,\u201d said Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford.  There are still many questions, such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age and how long immunity may last.  \u201cBut the bottom line is, as a vaccine it\u2019s more than 90% effective, which is extraordinary,\u201d top U.S. infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN.  Pfizer expects to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for people aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need two months of follow-up safety data to assure no side effects crop up. That is expected to be available in the third week of November.  U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it would take several weeks for U.S. regulators to receive and process the data before a potential approval.  MARKETS SURGE  The prospect of a vaccine electrified world markets with the S&P 500 and Dow hitting record highs. JPMorgan said on Monday it expected the S&P 500 index to hit 4,000 points by early 2021 and called Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and called Pfizer Inc\u2019s PFE.N COVID-19 vaccine update \u201cone of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years.\u201d  Stock of theme park and film company Walt Disney rose 12% and movie chain operator AMC Entertainment Holdings was up 51%. Shares in companies that have thrived during lockdowns, such as Netflix Inc NFLX.O and conferencing platform Zoom Video ZM.O tumbled. Gun stocks sold off on higher hopes for a return to normal and a lack of civil unrest.  Pfizer shares jumped more than 8% to their highest since July last year, while BioNTech\u2019s stock hit a record high. Mizuho Securities analyst Vamil Divan forecast the vaccine may generate sales in excess of $8.5 billion for Pfizer in 2020-2021 alone.  Shares of other vaccine developers in the final stage of testing also rose with Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N up nearly 4% and Moderna Inc MRNA.O, whose vaccine uses a similar technology as the Pfizer shot, up more than 8%. Britain's AstraZeneca AZN.L, however, fell 2%.  Moderna is expected to report results from its large-scale trial later this month.  \u201cIt\u2019s likely that we\u2019re going to have more than one vaccine that\u2019s effective,\u201d Fauci said.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  The World Health Organization called the results very positive but warned there was a funding gap of $4.5 billion that could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.  There are other challenges as well that could affect less affluent countries. The Pfizer vaccine must be shipped and stored at an extremely cold temperature, which requires necessary infrastructure. Even many U.S. hospitals lack these super cold storage units, which may impact when and where the vaccine becomes available in many U.S. rural areas as well.  That highlights the need for more traditional vaccines in development, such as J&J\u2019s candidate.  \u2018NEAR ECSTATIC\u2019  Still, there was cause for jubilation.  \u201cI\u2019m near ecstatic,\u201d Bill Gruber, one of Pfizer\u2019s top vaccine scientists, said in an interview. \u201cThis is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we\u2019re now in.\u201d  Between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated to break the dynamic of the spread of COVID-19, said Germany\u2019s health minister Jens Spahn, adding that he did not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021.  The European Union said on Monday it would soon sign a contract for up to 300 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.  The companies have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They did not receive research funding from the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Warp Speed vaccine program.  The drugmakers have also reached supply agreements with the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.  The interim analysis, conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo.  Pfizer did not provide that detail, but over 90% effective implies that no more than 8 of the 94 had received the vaccine, administered in two shots about three weeks apart.  The efficacy rate, which could drop once full results are available, is well above the 50% effectiveness required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine.  Shortly after Pfizer\u2019s announcement, Russia said its Sputnik V vaccine was also more than 90% effective, based on data collated from inoculations of the public.  MORE DATA NEEDED  To confirm the efficacy rate, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases among volunteers. Bourla told CNBC on Monday that could be before the end of November.  Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain\u2019s University of Warwick, noted that the data may show the vaccine keeps people from getting sick but not necessarily from becoming infected. \u201cAnd the subtlety there ... is if you\u2019re infected then you can still transmit the virus.\u201d  Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which on Sunday exceeded 50 million cases since the new coronavirus first emerged late last year in China.  The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. The technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.  The Trump administration has said it will have enough vaccine doses for all of the 330 million U.S. residents who want it by the middle of 2021.","1261":"KIEV, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Ukraine will receive 117,000 doses of American-made Pfizer-BioNTech m-RNA vaccine in February within the framework of the COVAX programme, Viktor Lyashko, Ukraine\u2019s deputy health minister, said.

The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of coronavirus vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.  The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca\u2019s, as well as vice versa, with intervals of 4 and 12 weeks.  Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and Biontech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine.  It is expected more vaccines will be added to the trial when they are approved and rolled out.  Recruitment for the study starts on Thursday, with over 800 participants expected to take part, the researchers said. That makes it much smaller than the clinical trials that have been used to determine efficacy of the vaccines individually.  The trial will not assess the overall efficacy of the shot combinations, but researchers will measure antibody and T-cell responses, as well as monitor for any unexpected side effects.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Matthew Snape, an Oxford vaccinologist who is leading the trial, said initial results could inform vaccine deployment in the second half of the year.  \u201cWe will get some results through, we expect, by June or thereabouts that will inform the use of booster doses in the general population,\u201d he told reporters.  The trial is looking to recruit people over the age of 50 who may be at higher risk than younger people and have not been vaccinated already.  AstraZeneca\u2019s shot is also being tested in combination with Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, and British drugmaker\u2019s research chief has said more studies on combining vaccines should be done.","1271":"TORONTO\/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Many Canadian seniors living in nursing homes could face delays before receiving Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine after first deliveries arrive next week, as health officials seek to comply with restrictive vaccine handling advice from the drugmaker.  FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  Pfizer has advised Canadian health officials to administer early doses of the vaccine at the sites where they are first delivered in large batches. At least until more data is available, it will not be possible to break up batches and send small quantities of the vaccine on to other locations.  That means many long-term care residents are likely to miss out on the first batch of vaccinations in Canada, the third country in the world to approve the vaccine, in the midst of a surge in infections that threatens to overwhelm hospitals.  It is not yet clear how movement restrictions could play out in other countries. In the United Kingdom, first doses were delivered to hospitals, and not care homes. But the drug regulator said on Thursday that some licensed companies and hospitals will be allowed to break down vaccine shipments so they can be taken into care homes, once processes and training are in place.  A delay in vaccinating long-term care home residents risks increasing COVID-19 deaths in Canada, which has struggled to protect its elders and staff. In the first wave, 81% of deaths were among care home residents, a share well above the OECD average.

On Wednesday, Health Canada cleared Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for public use, after an accelerated review. A panel advising the government has said long-term care home residents and healthcare workers should be prioritized for early vaccination.  But in Ontario, care home residents may need to wait until the Pfizer vaccine can be moved more easily or a vaccine from Moderna Inc is available, said Rick Hillier, head of the province\u2019s vaccination task force, at a Monday briefing.  While the need to store the vaccine at ultra-cold temperatures has been widely discussed, Ontario officials said the movement restriction is meant to limit the amount of physical movement, like shaking, during vaccine handling.  Pfizer has said it would consider relaxing the restrictions depending on the result of initial campaigns, said Christian Dub\u00e9, health minister of the province of Quebec.  LACK OF DATA  Asked about the restrictions, a Pfizer Canada spokeswoman said it will ship frozen vials directly to 14 initial points of vaccination chosen by the government. The company did not give a reason for the restriction.  \u201cFor the initial stages of vaccination, I can confirm that we are asking for vaccines to be administered only at the first vaccination points,\u201d said spokeswoman Christina Antoniou.  In hard-hit Quebec, the first vaccines will be shipped directly to two long-term care homes next week, including the Maimonides care facility in Montreal, to vaccinate residents and staff.  To work around the movement restrictions, health workers from other care homes will travel to Maimonides to be vaccinated with any leftover doses, said Francine Dupuis, associate chief executive of the health network that oversees the home.  The challenge for administrators comes later, when shipping vaccines to smaller care facilities across the province, she said.  Thomas Madden, chief executive of BioNTech partner Acuitas Therapeutics, based in Vancouver, said the issue is most likely a lack of data during the rapid rollout, not the vaccine\u2019s actual durability.  \u201cWhatever storage and transportation conditions are used for the vaccine, studies have to have been conducted in advance to demonstrate that the quality of the vaccine is maintained under those conditions,\u201d he said.  Madden, an expert in lipid nanoparticles, a key ingredient in the vaccine, said, \u201cthe challenge is that you have a limited amount of time to run those studies, which are relatively complicated.\u201d  Madden noted that BioNTech gave less restrictive guidance in a recent presentation, which said defrosted vials could be transported for up to six hours.  Elsewhere in Canada, in Saskatchewan, which has a large number of remote, indigenous communities, officials plan to deploy Moderna\u2019s vaccine mainly in rural, isolated places, said Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab.  The nearby province of Manitoba has said it will likely vaccinate at centralized super-sites.","1272":"Dec 3 (Reuters) -  * PFIZER SLASHED ITS COVID-19 VACCINE ROLLOUT TARGET AFTER FACING SUPPLY-CHAIN OBSTACLES - WSJ  * PFIZER EXPECTS TO SHIP HALF THE DOSES IT HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED AFTER FINDING RAW MATERIALS IN EARLY PRODUCTION DIDN'T MEET ITS STANDARDS- WSJ Source text : on.wsj.com\/2I8RJKd Further company coverage:","1273":"BENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Indian shares inched up to record highs on Tuesday, led by gains in IT stocks and top automaker Maruti Suzuki, as hopes for a coronavirus vaccine supported risk sentiment.

REUTERS\/Kim Kyung-Hoon\/File Photo  The government has made urgent requests, but manufacturers are struggling to ramp up production fast enough, creating the latest headache for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who suffers from weak public support.  \u201cWe are still trying to secure these special syringes,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said on Tuesday.  Japan, with a population of 126 million, last month signed a contract with Pfizer Inc to procure 144 million doses of its vaccine, or enough for 72 million people.  One vial is meant for six shots, Pfizer says, but it takes special syringes that retain a low volume of solution after an injection to extract six doses, while only five shots can be taken with standard syringes that the government has stored up in preparation for the inoculation drive.  When asked last week, Kato did not directly answer questions whether the shortage of the ideal syringe meant the number of shots Japan can administer would be reduced, but on Tuesday he conceded that without it there would be waste.  \u201cWhen it comes to what\u2019s left in vials and syringes, what\u2019s unused will be disposed of,\u201d Kato said.  Both a Pfizer Japan spokeswoman and a Japanese health ministry official declined to say whether the contract to supply Japan with 144 million doses of vaccine by the end of the year is based on six doses being taken from each vial.  Inoculating Japan\u2019s population swiftly is a top priority for Suga\u2019s government as he is determined to hold the Tokyo Olympics this summer after the Games were postponed for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  In an bid to minimize the amount of vaccine left unused in syringes and vials, the government is asking medical equipment manufacturers to boost output of the low dead-space syringes, but there are doubts whether that can be done quickly enough.  Nipro Corp, which runs a Thailand plant capable of making 500,000 units a month, said it planned to boost its monthly capacity to a few million, but that it would take up to five months to reach that goal.  \u201cWe are getting a request from the health ministry and we need to take some steps. But it\u2019s not something we can do overnight. It\u2019s another four to five months before we can ramp up sharply,\u201d a Nipro spokeswoman said.  Another major Japanese medical gear maker Terumo Corp said it had started developing syringes fit for extracting six doses from a vial, but that it was too early to say when it can start commercial output.  Although daily cases have been in decline in recent weeks in Japan after peaking in early January, Tokyo and nine other prefectures are still under the coronavirus state of emergency.  Japan has seen cases total around 418,000, with 7,042 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.","1280":"Feb 1 (Reuters) - BioNTech and Pfizer Inc are on-track to meet the delivery deadline for their coronavirus vaccine to the European Union, the Germany-based company said on Monday.

But in a letter to Chief Medical Officer (CMO) for England Chris Whitty, the British Medical Association said leaving the 12-week interval for the Pfizer vaccine went against World Health Organization guidance.  They urged the government to reduce the gap between Pfizer doses to a maximum of six weeks.  The makers of the vaccine, Pfizer and BioNTech, have warned that they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose is given more than three weeks after the first.  Leaving a 12-week gap is allowing Britain\u2019s vaccine programme to proceed quickly.  Government data published on Saturday showed 5.86 million people have now received a first dose of the vaccine, after a record 478,248 people had the jab in the last 24 hours.  Whitty said on Friday that the longer wait between doses was a \u201cpublic health decision\u201d aimed at vaccinating many more people and based on the fact that the great majority of protection comes from the first jab.

The EU bloc is set to secure 200 million doses with an option for another 100 million.  \u201cUnder the common framework agreement, Italy will receive some 13.6% of the first 200 million doses, with 3.4 million doses expected as early as in January, provided the European Medicine Authority approves the vaccine in December,\u201d the source said.  The initial supply would immunize 1.7 million people as the vaccine requires an initial shot followed by a booster 21 days later.  On Monday, Pfizer said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, in a major victory in the fight against the global pandemic.  Italy has reported over 960,000 cases of COVID-19 to date and 41,750 deaths.","1291":"NEW YORK\/LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L has pulled ahead in a race to buy Pfizer's PFE.N consumer healthcare business, which the U.S. drugmaker believes could be worth as much as $20 billion, after its main rival Reckitt Benckiser RB.L quit the auction.  FILE PHOTO: Ian Read, chief executive officer of Pfizer, addresses a news conference in New York November 5, 2013.\/File Photo  Sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday that the British pharmaceuticals group had submitted a binding bid. It is possible there may still be other offers, the sources added, or Pfizer could decide against a sale.  Reckitt said late on Wednesday it had only offered to buy part of the Pfizer business, which proved unacceptable. One person familiar with the matter said the company had been most interested in the best-selling painkiller Advil.  Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very well known and durable brands with loyal customers.  Limited buyer demand could now ease pressure on GSK to pay top-dollar or might instead allow it to coax the Pfizer unit into a joint venture it has with Novartis NOVN.S, some investors and bankers said, although this would be complex.  Pfizer has been hoping to fetch some $20 billion for its consumer health business, which includes familiar over-the-counter brands such as Advil, Centrum multivitamins and Chapstick lip balm, according to the sources.  Shares in Reckitt jumped 5 percent on relief it would not be over-leveraging or making a dilutive rights issue to fund a deal, while GSK slipped 1.5 percent.  But the decision is a blow for Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who has long coveted the Pfizer operation as a means to bolster Reckitt\u2019s position in consumer health (CH).  \u201cIf indeed RB has opened the door for Pfizer CH to be acquired by GSK, it might end up significantly strengthening one of its main CH competitors,\u201d said Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Reckitt said its strict financial discipline meant it only made sense to bid for part of the unit, but this was rejected. It will now focus on organic growth and integration of its $16.6 billion acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition.  DURABLE BRANDS  Pfizer said it was reviewing the future of the consumer business following the Reckitt decision.  \u201cPfizer continues to evaluate potential strategic alternatives for the consumer healthcare business, which include a spin-off, sale or other transaction, and Pfizer ultimately retaining the business. We have not yet made a decision, but continue to expect to make one in 2018,\u201d it said in a statement.  For GSK, a deal would be the boldest move to date for new CEO Emma Walmsley, who took over last April. It would further increase the company\u2019s leading position in consumer health, but could stretch its finances at a time when investors are anxious about the dividend.  Walmsley has also said her first priority is improving GSK\u2019s new drug pipeline in the face of mounting competition in its core respiratory and HIV divisions.  GSK runs its consumer healthcare business via a joint venture with Novartis. Novartis has the right to sell down its minority stake starting from this month, although it has previously indicated it is in no rush to do so.  Analysts said an alternative to buying Pfizer\u2019s operations outright could be to give Pfizer an equity share in the venture. While this would require complex negotiations, GSK and Pfizer do already work together in another joint venture in HIV.  \u201cThat sort of thing is a nice idea but it would require such a lot of work on governance,\u201d said GSK shareholder Steve Clayton at Hargreaves Lansdown.  GSK declined to comment on the state of any Pfizer discussions. However, Walmsley has previously said she would look at bulking up in consumer health, where scale is important.  \u201cWe will be extremely focused on discipline around returns and frankly, this is not a need to do,\u201d she said last month.","1292":"OTTAWA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc told Canada on Tuesday it will receive no coronavirus vaccines the week of Jan 25 and supplies will be cut back sharply over the next three weeks, a senior Canadian official said.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government is under pressure over the slow roll out of the vaccination program, caused in part by Pfizer Inc temporarily cutting its promised deliveries and a temporary slowdown of Moderna Inc doses.  \u201cObviously with this global supply chain around new products and manufacturing scale-ups ... there are momentary disruptions week over week. But we\u2019re still very much on track to get the commitments fulfilled and get many vaccines to Canadians as quickly as possible,\u201d Trudeau said in an interview.  Trudeau promised that tens of millions of doses would arrive in the months to come and reiterated that every Canadian seeking inoculation would be vaccinated by September.  As part of a bid to contain the spread of the disease, Canada and the United States have closed their joint border to non-essential travel. Trudeau said he and new U.S. President Joe Biden agreed on a joint approach to fighting COVID-19.  \u201cWe\u2019re working very, very closely on all aspects of it from borders to scientific research to indeed vaccines,\u201d he said.  \u201cOur conversations are going to continue with the U.S. on supply chains,\u201d he said, without giving details. Last year, tensions arose between Canada and the administration of then President Donald Trump over delays in the supply of personal protective equipment.  Last year Trump also signed an executive order aimed at keeping U.S.-produced vaccines in the United States. Trudeau did not give a direct answer when asked whether he would press Biden to scrap the order.  Canada does not yet have a vaccine manufacturing facility of its own and is reliant on foreign suppliers.  Separately, federal Procurement Minister Anita Anand said deliveries of AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine could begin before the end of March, if Canada\u2019s health regulator approves its use.  AstraZeneca Canada filed a rolling application for its vaccine with Health Canada in October and is waiting for approval from the drug regulator. Health Canada is expected to complete its review soon.  In a separate briefing, federal officials confirmed Canada\u2019s most recent shipment of Moderna Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine contained 22% fewer doses than originally expected and said the next shipment, due in three weeks, would also be short.  Fortin added Moderna was working in \u201cgood faith\u201d to deliver those doses as quickly as possible to Canada and noted the obstacles would be temporary.  Shipments of Pfizer Inc\u2019s vaccine, meanwhile, are expected to ramp up later this month.  Trudeau\u2019s government is also facing criticism over tapping into COVAX, a global vaccine-sharing initiative meant to help low-income countries buy doses. Canada will get 1.9 million AstraZeneca doses from the initiative.  \u201cOur government will never apologize for doing everything possible to get Canadians vaccinated as quickly as possible,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told lawmakers.","1296":"FILE PHOTO: Small bottles labeled with a \"Vaccine COVID-19\" sticker and a medical syringe are seen in this illustration taken taken April 10, 2020.

Pfizer plans to launch the drug, Daurismo, in the United States by early December with a monthly list price of $16,925, a Pfizer spokeswoman told Reuters.  Daurismo was approved for use in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) aged 75 or older or those who have certain health conditions prior to receiving their diagnosis, for whom intensive chemotherapy is not an option, Pfizer said.  The treatment comes with a boxed warning - the agency\u2019s harshest - that flags risks of severe birth defects or embryo-fetal death.  \u201cIntensive chemotherapy is usually used to control AML, but many adults with AML are unable to have intensive chemotherapy because of its toxicities,\u201d said Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA\u2019s Oncology Center of Excellence.

Here are some questions and answers about the cases and what they might mean.  WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?  UK officials said there have been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. Anaphylaxis can cause throat swelling, breathing trouble and difficulty swallowing, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system, which the UK National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening.  WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE VACCINE, ACCORDING TO UK REGULATORS?  British regulators initially responded by saying anyone with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food should not take the shot. An adviser to the group later said it was \u201ctweaking\u201d advice in part to say a food allergy was not a risk.  Late on Wednesday, the UK regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not get the vaccine.  Pfizer had excluded people with a history of significant adverse reaction to vaccines or its vaccine\u2019s ingredients from late-stage trials.

Jacob King\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT PROSPECTS FOR U.S. AUTHORIZATION?  U.S. regulators are expected to consider emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine soon after a Thursday meeting of advisers.  Moncef Slaoui, who is spearheading the U.S. government\u2019s vaccine development efforts, said on Wednesday he expected the British allergic reactions would be considered in the U.S. authorization process and that people with known severe allergic reactions probably should not take the vaccine until more was understood.  WHAT DO DOCTORS SAY?  Some praised UK regulators\u2019 caution, while others said broad restrictions were not warranted by available evidence.  \u201cFor the general population, this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  What would be wise, he said, would be \u201cfor anyone who has known severe allergic reaction such that they need to carry an EpiPen to delay having a vaccination until the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified.\u201d  Mayo Clinic virologist Gregory Poland, who has advised U.S. regulators, described Britain\u2019s early reaction as \u201coverdoing it,\u201d pointing to the initial response about food allergies, which he said \u201chave nothing to do with this.\u201d  \u201cI would have said, \u2018If you\u2019ve had anaphylactic-level reactions to vaccines, we want to know about that so we take extra care,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t immunize you. But I would do it in a more controlled setting.\u201d  Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, praised the way the reactions had been handled. \u201cThe fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that the monitoring system is working well,\u201d he said.  Mitchell Grayson, director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio, voiced concern over how the issue might reduce interest in vaccinations. \u201cI\u2019m worried the whole event will cause millions of people to choose not to get vaccinated because of what they heard,\u201d he said.  HOW COMMON ARE SEVERE OR SIGNIFICANT ALLERGIES?  \u201cIn the UK in 2012 there were around seven hospital admissions per 100,000 people for severe allergies. This included different triggers such as foods, drugs and insect stings,\u201d said Louisa James, a expert in immunology at Queen Mary University of London. Fatalities remain very rare and have not increased even as hospital admissions have risen in many countries.","1300":"FILE PHOTO: Registered pharmacist fills a dead volume syringe with the COVID-19 vaccine at a pop-up vaccination site in William Reid Apartments in Brooklyn, New York City, U.S., January 23, 2021.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE said a large-scale clinical trial showed their vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19.  While a jump in longer-dated U.S. Treasury yields helped push the yen to its biggest loss overnight since March, analysts said the currency pared losses as some traders took profit on the dollar.  In afternoon Asian trade, the yen firmed to 104.97 against the dollar.  Against the Australian dollar, the yen fetched 76.43, having lost more than 2% overnight.  \u201cWhat\u2019s important about the overnight movement is that it overturned the current trend of the U.S. dollar falling, instead of the yen, when the market turns risk-on,\u201d said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.  \u201cThe yuan and euro have been rising against the dollar as equities jumped on Joe Biden\u2019s election win... But the overnight movement flipped things back to the way it is when markets usually turn risk-on: U.S. Treasury yields rise and the yen depreciates more than the dollar.\u201d  The vaccine news comes as the global tally of COVID-19 infections reached 50.68 million on Monday, stoking worries of more lockdown measures across the globe.  But markets got a bit over-excited following the vaccine news considering the trial results are still preliminary, said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.  Indeed, many questions about the vaccine are yet to be answered, such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age and how long immunity may last.  \u201cPerhaps the market did over-react to the vaccine, given there\u2019s still some way to go prove that it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Westpac currency analyst Imre Speizer.  \u201cWhat they\u2019ve shown is that it\u2019s reasonably effective, safety is another stage. Once the market looked into the finer print of what these results were, maybe they backed off the trade a bit.\u201d  Riskier currency such as the Australian dollar steadied at $0.7281 against its U.S. counterpart, near a seven-week high touched on Monday as traders digested the vaccine news.  Across the Tasman sea, the New Zealand dollar last sat at 0.6833 per U.S. dollar, up 0.23% in Asian trade.  The euro was moderately higher at 1.1834, after dropping more than 0.4% overnight.  The prospects of a Biden presidency has boosted risk sentiment as many believe it could boost international trade relations and maintain an easy monetary policy.  Still, incumbent Donald Trump has made no sign of conceding and his campaign is planning a series of rallies to build support for legal fights challenging the election results.  U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday said President Donald Trump was completely within his rights to look into \u201cirregularities\u201d from the election.  Trump also said he had \u201cterminated\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper, signalling he may use his final months in office after defeat at the polls to settle scores within his administration.  Against a basket of currencies, the dollar held steady at 92.65, slightly above Monday\u2019s 10-week trough of 92.12.  Sterling firmed 0.21% to $1.3187 against the greenback, near a nine-week high it touched in the previous session.

This comparison lacks context.  Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS  \u201cHow are people ok with a 90% success rate for the Pfizer #vaccine but yet they\u2019re not ok with a 99% survival rate for the virus? Make it make sense please\u201d, posts shared on online read (here) (here) .  It should firstly be noted that vaccine efficiency and the survival rate are two separate measures, and so are not directly comparable.  The vaccine efficiency is the probability the vaccine will prevent someone from catching COVID-19, while the survival rate is the likelihood that someone who has already contracted the disease will survive.  SURVIVAL RATE  While the exact mortality rate of COVID-19 is still not known, a hypothetical rate of 1% would still result in a massive number of deaths if left to spread unchecked.  Even with restrictions such as lockdowns, there have been so far been more than 1.3 million COVID-19 deaths recorded worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University (coronavirus.jhu.edu\/map.html) .  Alongside this, the post does not consider that the impact of COVID-19 extends beyond its death toll.  \u201cSome UK NHS trusts have around 30% of their beds taken up with COVID-19 patients, and there are around 30000 NHS staff off work due to a COVID-19 infection or self-isolating\u201d, Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told Reuters via email.  \u201cInfection control takes up a huge amount of resource, wards have to be closed, and thus COVID-19 has a massive knock-on effect on other care, such as cancer, mental health or stroke patients\u201d.  There is also the impact of \u2018long COVID\u2019, an ongoing illness after contracting the coronavirus, which Head notes has been emerging as a \u201csignificant chronic burden\u201d in the young and healthy or those who had a mild initial infection.  VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS  Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, this does not make it an ineffective tool for controlling disease and preventing deaths.  Flu vaccines, for instance, are between 40%-60% effective but help save lives. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that during the 2018-19 season, the vaccine prevented 3,500 influenza-associated deaths (here) .  Head explains that, at time of writing, there are around 1.5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in the UK (here) .  \u201cIf there had hypothetically been a 90% effective vaccine available at the start of the year, then this would hypothetically reduce expected cases to around 150000\u201d, Head said.  \u201cAnd going further, assuming a 99% survival and 1% death rate, then this would show 1500 deaths, rather than around 50000.\u201d  VERDICT  Missing context. A 90% efficiency rate for a vaccine would substantially reduce the spread and death toll from COVID-19. A 1% mortality rate, on the other hand, would still lead to a massive number of deaths if the disease was left to spread unchecked.  This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

Scarce vaccine supply, cumbersome paperwork, a lack of healthcare staff and an aged and immobile population are hampering efforts to get early doses of a vaccine made by U.S.-based Pfizer and German partner BioNTech into the arms of the people.  Germany has set up hundreds of vaccination centres in sports halls and concert arenas and has the infrastructure to administer up to 300,000 shots a day, Health Minister Jens Spahn said.  But the majority are standing empty, with most states not planning to open centres until mid-January as they prioritise sending mobile teams into care homes.  A day spent with a vaccination team in the small town of Dillenburg, 100 km (60 miles) to the north of Germany\u2019s financial capital Frankfurt, shows just how painstaking the task is.  The team starts out by loading a cool-box containing 84 doses of the Pfizer vaccine defrosted overnight into a waiting ambulance, and setting out for the Elisabeth residential care home.  There they are met by manager Peter Bittermann, who has already dealt with the forms needed to vaccinate residents and staff, and provided space for the shots to be administered and recipients monitored post-vaccination.  The four-member immunisation team, plus two trainees, has just a few hours to dispense the temperature-sensitive Pfizer vaccine before it is no longer fit for use.  The German Red Cross needs an extra 350 people to run its local vaccination campaign, said Nicole Fey, spokeswoman of the local district administration.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to recruit some, but there can never be enough,\u201d she told Reuters TV.  GERMANY LAGS  In the first two weeks of its vaccination drive Germany has given 533,000 shots, just two-fifths of the 1.3 million doses received. Britain, by contrast, has reached the 2 million mark.  Israel, the world leader in terms of the share of population covered, is inoculating 150,000 people daily, with its universal and digitally enabled healthcare system making it easier to schedule appointments.  Germany\u2019s larger size and federal set-up are complicating operations, a problem also faced in the United States.  Elsewhere in Europe, the decentralisation of Spain\u2019s vaccination operation has exposed differences between regions and led to tensions with the central government.  Germany\u2019s 16 states blame the federal government for not securing enough doses. Doctors in some centres say shifts have been cancelled. In Berlin, one vaccination centre was opened, only to be closed over New Year due to a lack of shots.  Spahn says manufacturing problems rather than too few orders are to blame for the limited supply. Pfizer and BioNTech in November halved their production forecast to 50 million doses by year-end. Each recipient requires two shots..  The government is working with BioNTech to open a new production site in the western town of Marburg, he said. BioNTech\u2019s chief executive said last week the Marburg plant may enter service in February, ahead of schedule.  \u201cWith the capacity we have already created in Germany, we will be able to carry out between 250,000 and 300,000 vaccinations per day - when we have the vaccine doses,\u201d Spahn said this week.  Germany expects to receive 5.3 million shots from Pfizer\/BioNTech by mid-February and another 2 million doses of a second vaccine from Moderna, just approved by the European Union, by the end of March.  Yet this will barely be enough to cover the 5.7 million people, or 6.8% of the population, aged over 80.  THE LAST MILE  As in Spain, state-by-state performance in Germany varies widely. Top of the class is Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the north, with 15.6 vaccinations per 1,000 residents, while Saxony has a rate of just 4.4.  In Thuringia, another laggard, state premier Bodo Ramelow said on Tuesday that many doses sent to hospitals had been returned. \u201cIf the brakes come on at a vaccination rate of 30 or 33%, we have a real problem,\u201d he told Deutschlandfunk radio.  In Saxony, the social affairs ministry said missing consent forms, challenges with route planning, COVID outbreaks in homes and last-minute cancellations had slowed its rollout.  Shots in Saxony were stored centrally until recently, meaning mobile teams had to drive long distances before heading to care homes.  In contrast to Dillenburg, Saxony has been overrun by people volunteering for its vaccination drive, said Lars Werthmann, regional logistics chief at the German Red Cross.  \u201cThe next mammoth task is to coordinate all these people,\u201d Werthmann said.  Doctors meanwhile express frustration at appointment booking systems that vary from state to state, saying they cause confusion and erode trust.  To speed up the rollout of COVID-19 shots, Germany should distribute them through its network of family doctors\u2019 practices as soon as there is a vaccine that can be easily stored in a fridge, said Berlin paediatrician Burkhard Ruppert.  Germany is hoping to administer shots at doctors\u2019 practices in a second phase.  \u201cOur strength in Germany is this outpatient care system,\u201d said Ruppert, who heads a local doctors\u2019 association. \u201cWe\u2019re not a country of large-scale managed systems like the United Kingdom or Israel might be.\u201d  \u201cWe are in a race against a virus,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will only win if we vaccinate as much and as fast as possible.\u201d","1316":"BUDAPEST, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Hungary started vaccinating healthcare workers against the coronavirus with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday, a government spokesman told Reuters.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Sarah Lim, a 46-year-old nurse, and 43-year-old infectious diseases doctor Kalisvar Marimuthu were among the more than 30 staff at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases who were vaccinated on Wednesday, the health ministry said.  They will return for the second dose of the vaccine on Jan. 20.  \u201cVaccines have managed to bring pandemics down to their knees before. So I am hopeful that this vaccine will do the same,\u201d Marimuthu said in recorded remarks provided by the health ministry.  Singapore is the first country in Asia to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It has also signed advance purchase agreements and made early down-payments on several other vaccine candidates, including those being developed by Moderna and Sinovac.  It expects to have enough vaccine doses for all its 5.7 million people by the third quarter of 2021.  \u201cSAFE AND EFFECTIVE\u201d  Singapore hopes to complete vaccination coverage by the end of next year, health minister Gan Kim Yong said.  \u201cOur priority over the next few months is to ensure that the vaccines that we use are safe and effective, and we are able to roll out this programme to the whole population smoothly and in an orderly manner,\u201d he said.  Singapore acted swiftly after the first cases of the virus were reported, and although it was blindsided by tens of thousands of infections in migrant workers\u2019 dormitories, it has reported only a few new local cases in recent months.  In total, only 29 people in Singapore have died from COVID-19, one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. This has led some Singaporeans to question whether they need to take the jabs.  While Gan acknowledged Singaporeans\u2019 concerns over the unknowns of a new vaccine, he said it had met all safety and efficacy requirements based on current data and that the authorities would continue their monitoring.  To show the vaccine is safe, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 68, said he and his colleagues would be among the first to get the shots. They will be free and voluntary, but the government is encouraging all medically eligible residents to take them.

The delay is another blow to the EU, which has also been hit by delays in deliveries from Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca and U.S. company Moderna, and had also faced earlier delays on the Pfizer vaccine.  It also raises questions about the rationale of an EU vaccine export control scheme which was set up in late January to ensure timely deliveries but has not yet been activated, despite the supply shortfalls.  By the middle of last week, Pfizer had delivered to the EU 23 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with German firm BioNTech, said an EU official who is directly involved in talks with the U.S. company.  That was about 10 million doses less than Pfizer had promised to supplied by mid-February, said a second official who is also involved in the talks.  Pfizer declined to comment, saying schedules of its deliveries were confidential. The executive European Commission did not respond to a request for comment on delivery shortfalls.  EU officials have said Pfizer committed to delivering 3.5 million doses a week from the start of January, for a total of 21 million shots by mid-February.  In mid-January, there was a temporary hiccup in supplies which EU officials say was largely resolved last month. . But a lot of doses that were due to arrive in December are still missing, the two EU officials said.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was approved for use in the EU on Dec. 21. The following day, BioNTech said the companies would ship to the EU 12.5 million doses by the end of the month. .  Only about 2 million of those doses due in December have been delivered, according to Reuters calculations.  The shortfall would amount to about 30% of the total supplies pledged for the period from December until mid-February.  One EU official said the company had committed to delivering the missing doses by the end of March.  The EU has two contracts with Pfizer for the supply of 600 million vaccine doses.  TRADE FLOWS  Although the EU\u2019s own supplies have fallen short, the European Commission has approved all requests for export of COVID-19 vaccines - mostly from Pfizer\/BioNTech - since it set up its mechanism to monitor flows.  In the period between Jan. 30 and Feb. 16, the EU gave the green light to 57 requests for vaccine export to 24 countries, including Britain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a Commission spokeswoman said on Wednesday.  Before the monitoring scheme was set up, the bloc had already exported millions of vaccines to Israel, Britain and Canada among others, mostly Pfizer\u2019s, according to customs data cited in a EU document seen by Reuters.  Israel has administered a number of vaccines which is equal to more than 75% of its population, including first and second doses administered, figures from University of Oxford-based Our World in Data show. The figure for the UAE is around 50% and for Britain it is above 20%, while EU countries on average stand at about 5%.  Countries with a high number of inoculations are already vaccinating people who are not among the most vulnerable, while those most in need elsewhere have not yet had a shot.  The World Health Organization has set the target of inoculating 20% of poor countries\u2019 population by the end of the year.

Pfizer has said it can produce up to 1.3 billion doses around the world this year. The new agreement with the EU comes on top of another order for 300 million doses of the vaccine, branded in the EU under the name Comirnaty, that the bloc agreed with Pfizer and German partner BioNTech in November.  \u201cWe now have agreed with BioNTech and Pfizer to extend this contract. With the new agreement we could purchase a total of up to an additional 300 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference on Friday.  Pfizer was more cautious.  \u201cWe are in talks with the European Commission about an amendment to our existing supply agreement for Comirnaty, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d it said in a statement.  The move would allow EU governments to double their orders from Pfizer to 600 million doses, von der Leyen said, as the 27-nation bloc races to ramp up the vaccination of its 450 million people. Each recipient of the Pfizer vaccine need two doses to develop maximum protection.  In a separate announcement, the EU drug regulator changed its recommendation for the use of the Pfizer vaccine, allowing the extraction of six doses from a vial instead of five, confirming an earlier Reuters story.  That would increase available doses by 20%. The pricing would continue to be calculated in doses and not in vials, a spokesman for Pfizer said, meaning that there would be no discount on prices paid by the EU for new deliveries. An EU document seen by Reuters in December showed the price was 15.5 euros ($19) per dose.  Von der Leyen said 75 million of the additional doses under the new deal would be delivered in the second quarter of this year, and the rest by the end of 2021. Pfizer said that in total 500 million doses would be available to the EU by the end of this year, and an option for another 100 million could be taken up.

REUTERS\/Piroschka van de Wouw\/Pool  PRODUCTION CAPACITY  The large EU order is likely to require an expansion of Pfizer-BioNTech production capacity this year, as the companies already have deals with other wealthy nations for large supplies in 2021.  They cut by half to 50 million doses their production in 2020 after facing some snags in securing supplies of vaccine ingredients.  European officials said the companies were working to expand production capacity in Europe.  Pfizer has agreed to sell the United States up to 600 million doses, of which 200 million have been already ordered. Another 120 million doses are reserved for Japan this year, and 40 million for Britain, among disclosed deals.  Germany said on Monday it had agreed with BioNtech to supply 30 million additional doses in a side deal, although the timing of the delivery was unclear.  The German move, agreed in September but revealed only this week as the government faced pressures at home, appears to be in contrast with EU agreements that forbid members to negotiate parallel deals with vaccine makers.  \u201cNo member state on this legal binding basis is allowed to negotiate in parallel or to have a contract in parallel,\u201d von der Leyen said. But a Commission spokesman declined to comment on whether the German deal was legal under EU agreements.  The new EU agreement includes a possible immediate order for 200 million doses and an additional option to buy another 100 million, the Commission said.  Doses are usually shared among EU states in proportion to their population, but it was unclear whether all governments would make orders based on the new contract.

Hugo Lopez-Gatell, the deputy health minister, said Mexico was considering delaying the administration of the second dose of the two-shot Pfizer Inc.\/BioNTech vaccine to patients to help get the first dose to those in need more quickly.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing if we need to expand the time period to 35 days,\u201d said Lopez-Gatell, who added that there would be \u201cno need\u201d to delay the administration of the second doses if enough new vaccine arrives in the coming weeks.  The Pfizer vaccine is currently the only one being administered in Mexico, which has reported the fourth-highest death toll from the pandemic worldwide.  Mexico had been expecting weekly deliveries of some 400,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but as a result of the U.S. drugmaker\u2019s agreements with the World Health Organization (WHO), it is now expecting to only receive half of that total.  The WHO said on Monday it was in advanced talks with Pfizer about including its vaccine in the agency\u2019s portfolio of shots to be shared with poorer countries.  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador added that his administration will issue authorization for any company or local government that wants to acquire vaccines to administer them in Mexico.  Mexico\u2019s Business Coordinating Council (CCE), one of the country\u2019s top business lobbies, said the announcement was \u201cpositive\u201d but added that laboratories around the world had committed their current allotments to national governments.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  The U.S. government agreed to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and German biotech BioNTech SE 22UAy.F to inoculate 50 million people at a price of $39 for a two-dose treatment course.  \u201cAll the countries that are developed right now will not receive a lower price for the same volume commitment than the U.S.,\u201d Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on a conference call.  Pfizer executives said they expect people will need to receive continued vaccinations for a number of years to maintain herd immunity globally, either because immunity may diminish over time or the virus will mutate.  The mRNA technology employed in the BioNTech\/Pfizer vaccine \u201cis ideal for both: you can boost and boost and boost without losing efficacy,\u201d Bourla told Reuters. \u201cAnd also, you can move very fast from one type of vaccine to another by simply modifying the (genetic) code.\u201d  The vaccine\u2019s price could change once the pandemic period ends, compared with its initial decision aimed at ensuring broadest access.  Pfizer is one of many companies racing to bring COVID-19 vaccines to market, seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has claimed more than 655,000 lives globally.  BioNTech and Pfizer on Monday began a large, late-stage trial of their vaccine candidate to demonstrate its efficacy.  Bourla said Pfizer was in concurrent talks with the European Union and several of its member states on supplying them with the vaccine.  A deal with the EU \u201cwould be much easier,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also we are having extensive discussions with several member states, just in case we can\u2019t find agreement with the EU.\u201d  European efforts to secure potential COVID-19 vaccines are mired in wrangles over price, payment method and potential liability costs, three EU officials told Reuters over the weekend.  Bourla called an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump last week that would tie what Medicare pays for drugs to lower prices in other countries \u201can enormous distraction at a time where the industry needs to be completely focused on developing a potential COVID-19 vaccine or treatment.\u201d  The CEO said Pfizer could rethink U.S. expansion plans if the Trump order were to be implemented.  On Tuesday, Pfizer beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast, as the U.S. drugmaker predicted a recovery in vaccination rates and doctor visits.  The company took a roughly $500 million hit to total sales in the second quarter as the drop in visits to hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices curtailed demand for several products.  The impact was offset somewhat by demand for blood thinner Eliquis, which has been used to help treat COVID-19 patients.  Pfizer now expects 2020 adjusted profit of $2.28 to $2.38 per share, raising both ends of the range by 3 cents. Pfizer shares rose 4% to $39.07.","1332":"FILE PHOTO: A man walks past Pfizer's world headquarters in New York April 28, 2014.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  CHICAGO\/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly a fifth of 11,000 people enrolled so far in a 30,000-volunteer U.S. trial testing a COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer PFE.N and German partner BioNTech 22UAy.F are Black or Latino, groups among the hardest hit by the coronavirus virus pandemic, a top Pfizer executive said.  \u201cBetween Latinx and Black or African American populations, we\u2019re running at about 19 percent or so,\u201d Dr. Bill Gruber, Pfizer\u2019s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cWe\u2019re trying to push even higher than that.\u201d  Black and Latino Americans are infected with COVID-19 at more than twice the rate of white Americans, with Native Americans infected at even higher rates, research has shown. The groups are historically underrepresented in clinical trials.  The companies\u2019 vaccine has quickly advanced into late-stage testing, with some participants already getting their second of two doses.  Physicians and scientists have been urging companies testing coronavirus vaccines to include Black, Latino and indigenous Americans in COVID-19 vaccine trials in hopes of building trust among at-risk populations.  \u201cWe have a lot of campaigns to reach out to those communities because they are overrepresented in terms of COVID-19 illness, so we are very keen to have those individuals as part of our trial,\u201d Gruber said on Thursday. \u201cThey have higher attack rates and they are most likely to benefit.\u201d  According to a Reuters\/Ipsos poll in May, only half of Black Americans said they were somewhat or very interested in taking a COVID-19 vaccine.  Gruber did not disclose the number of Native Americans enrolled in the trial, but said Pfizer plans to draw on ties from its Prevnar 7 pneumococcal vaccine tests in the southwestern United States.  \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll be able to make further inroads in that community as well,\u201d he said.  Pfizer and BioNTech expect to have data sufficient for an emergency use authorization (EUA) or to start a full submission in October, according to Gruber.  The company does not need to finish recruiting the full 30,000 patients planned for the trial in order to have enough data to support an EUA, he said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said COVID-19 vaccine trials need to have a safety database of at least 3,000 individuals for each of the younger and elderly populations in which it is tested.  Ultimately, the speed with which the vaccine can be approved depends on how quickly patients in the placebo arm become infected with the virus, starting about a week after the second dose is administered. That began this week.  \u201cWe won\u2019t really know until we get a little farther,\u201d Gruber said.  \u201cWe\u2019re following the rules that assure rigor,\u201d he added, saying the company was taking no short cuts.  \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what will happen politically,\u201d Gruber said, when asked about concerns the Trump administration might pressure companies and regulators to announce progress before the November election.  Gruber said the companies were now in talks with the FDA about how to begin testing the vaccine in children, a group the regulatory agency itself is eager to gather data on.  Vaccines work differently in children and adults.  Gruber said vaccine tests often progress in stages, first in older adolescents, then younger adolescents, and finally in children. But younger adults have higher rates of reactions, such as fevers and sore arms, to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine than older adults do, Gruber said.  Roughly 17% of adults between the ages of 18-55 in Pfizer\u2019s most recent trial had fevers after being given the vaccine, most of them mild, compared with 8% among those aged 65-85.  There is a risk those reactions could be even more heightened in younger populations, he added.  \u201cYounger children - maybe that\u2019s not going to be tolerated. Maybe we\u2019re going to have severe fevers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re adopting a very thoughtful, graduated approach. Children are not just small adults.\u201d  Gruber said the company is submitting safety data to the FDA and working out a testing plan for children, which he expects to start soon.","1337":"WELLINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - New Zealand will receive its first batch of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine next week, ahead of previous expectations of receipt by the end of the first quarter, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted the green light from Britain\u2019s medicine authority as a global win and a ray of hope for the end of the pandemic, though he recognised the logistical challenges of vaccinating an entire country of 67 million.  Britain\u2019s move raised hopes that the tide could soon turn against a virus that has killed nearly 1.5 million people globally, hammered the world economy and upended normal life for billions since it emerged in Wuhan, China, a year ago.  Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted emergency use approval to the vaccine developed by Pfizer and German biotechnology partner BioNTech, which they say is 95% effective in preventing illness, just 23 days after Pfizer published the first data from its final stage clinical trial.  \u201cFantastic news,\u201d Johnson told parliament, though he cautioned that people should not get carried away.  \u201cAt this stage it is very, very important that people do not get their hopes up too soon about the speed with which we will be able to roll out this vaccine.\u201d  International drugmakers and researchers have been racing to develop vaccines for months and Britain\u2019s authorisation coming first may be seen as a coup for a government that has faced criticism over its handling of the crisis.  U.S. and EU regulators are sifting through the same Pfizer vaccine trial data, but have yet to give their approval.  Britain\u2019s swift decision drew criticism from Brussels where, in an unusually blunt statement, the EU regulator said its longer procedure was more appropriate and based on more evidence.  Johnson might be persuaded to take a COVID-19 shot on television to show it was safe, but he would not have one before those in greater need, his press secretary said.  Britain said it would start vaccinating those most at risk of dying early next week after it gets 800,000 doses from Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing centre in Belgium, and UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said tests on that first batch had been completed.  Hours after the British announcement, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian authorities to begin mass voluntary vaccinations next week. Russia will have produced 2 million doses of its own vaccine within the next few days, Putin said.  Pfizer vaccine executive Ralf Rene Reinert said other countries were looking to emulate Britain.  \u201cThe UK is leading, and now let\u2019s see how the other countries move forward. And Pfizer will do everything to exchange all the data packages with every regulatory agency,\u201d he said.  German Health Minister Jens Spahn said EU member states could have issued similar emergency approvals, but Europe had decided to move forward as one.  \u201cIt\u2019s very important we do this to help promote trust and confidence in this authorisation,\u201d he said.  Britain is bound by European law until the transition period ends on Dec. 31, but opted for emergency approval anyway.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Asked if the speedy approval was a \u201cbig Brexit bonus\u201d, Johnson credited global efforts instead.  \u201cIt\u2019s a truly international thing and very, very moving to see it,\u201d the PM said.  \u2018NO CORNERS CUT\u2019  Pfizer shares rose almost 4% to their highest since July 2019 and BioNTech\u2019s U.S.-listed shares rose almost 5% after hitting record highs on Tuesday.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Global stocks were also higher over optimism the world can turn a corner in curbing the pandemic, although the gains were more muted than those seen in November, when Pfizer published the first trial results. [MKTS\/GLOB]  Britain\u2019s MHRA approved the vaccine in record time by doing a \u201crolling\u201d concurrent analysis of data and the manufacturing process while Pfizer raced to conclude trials.  \u201cNo corners have been cut,\u201d MHRA chief June Raine said in a televised briefing from Downing Street, adding that the first data on the vaccine had been received in June and undergone a rigorous analysis to international standards. \u201cSafety is our watchword.\u201d  The emergency use approval does not come with any associated volume cap or threshold, Pfizer UK\u2019s country manager said.  \u201cWith 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks,\u201d said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow in the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Liverpool.  U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said the British move should inspire confidence.  \u201cFor the American people this should be very reassuring. An independent regulatory authority in another country has found this vaccine to be safe and effective for use,\u201d Azar told Fox Business Network.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will make a decision on emergency use authorization of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine in days or weeks after a panel of outside advisers meets on Dec. 10 to review the data and make its recommendation to the agency.  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it could give emergency approval for the shot by Dec. 29, while the World Health Organization said it was reviewing it for \u201cpossible listing for emergency use\u201d.  \u201cThe data submitted to regulatory agencies around the world are the result of a scientifically rigorous and highly ethical research and development programme,\u201d said Ugur Sahin, chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech.  The company said it expected FDA and EMA to make decisions in mid-December.  Johnson said life would not return to normal right away, but there was now certainty that things would improve. He said the vaccines would not be mandatory but strongly encouraged eligible people to take them.  The speed of the rollout depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine - and the extreme temperature of -70C (-94F) at which it must be stored. It can be kept for five days in a regular fridge.  Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots are needed per person to gain immunity.","1340":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE have started an international study with 4,000 volunteers to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of their COVID-19 vaccine in healthy pregnant women, the companies said on Thursday.

Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development for Pfizer, said in an interview the company could have results by the fourth quarter of 2021.  Gruber said data so far suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 have higher rates of severe disease. They also have higher rates of pregnancy complications, such as premature birth, compared with pregnant women not infected by the coronavirus.  That increased risk is why U.S. regulators and public health advisers \u201care interested in doing this in the first place - so people can be fully informed about the safety profile,\u201d he said.  Last week, the U.S. National Institutes of Health called for greater inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in COVID-19 vaccine research.  Bioethicists, vaccine and maternal health experts have argued for years that pregnant women should be included early in trials of pandemic vaccines so they would not need to wait until long after a successful one emerges.  Nevertheless, pregnant women were excluded from the large U.S. trials used to obtain emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines.  Drugmakers have said they first need to make sure the vaccines are safe and effective more generally.  In the United States, regulators require drugmakers to conduct safety studies in pregnant animals before vaccines are tested in pregnant women to ensure they do not harm the fetus or lead to a miscarriage. The companies said those studies revealed no new risks.  Pregnant women in the United States have already received their first doses, the companies said.  The new study will test pregnant women aged 18 and older in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mozambique, South Africa, the UK and Spain.  Women will receive the vaccine during weeks 24-34 of gestation, getting two shots 21 days apart - the same regimen used in the larger clinical trial.  Shortly after giving birth, participants who got a placebo in the trial will be given an opportunity to get the actual vaccine, while remaining part of the study, the companies said.  The trial will also assess whether vaccinated pregnant women transfer protective antibodies to their babies.","1341":"Feb 19 (Reuters) - Premier Inc:  * PREMIER INC.

Four EU sources told Reuters that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been under pressure from the European Commission and EU governments to approve vaccines more quickly.  One EMA official said on Monday pressure had increased on the agency from EU governments \u201cthrough usual channels of communications\u201d after Dec. 2, when the British regulator granted an emergency authorisation to the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine.  A second source familiar with EMA\u2019s work confirmed pressure has increased after approvals elsewhere.

Officials have said the are working night and day through December, with night shifts, to complete the evaluation.  It usually takes the agency at least seven months to approve a vaccine after it gets full data from manufacturers.  EU officials have repeatedly said that no shortcuts would be taken, and a faster assessment was possible because preliminary data on the vaccine had been shared by Pfizer since October.  The breakneck pace to deploy in less than 12 months vaccines that normally take 10 years to be developed is mentioned in global polls as one of the main concerns about the safety of shots and could undermine confidence in vaccinations, experts said.  Continental European countries have traditionally high rates of vaccine hesitancy.

Jeenah Moon\/Pool via REUTERS  The Swiss drug regulator Swissmedic\u2019s decision comes days after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave the green light to Moderna\u2019s vaccine. The messenger RNA vaccine, relying on similar technology as that used by Pfizer-BioNTech, is a two-dose shot that in trials showed 95% efficacy.  Switzerland has been a second-wave coronavirus hotspot, with infections totalling some 500,000 and deaths rising by dozens daily to more than 7,500.  The country, which has been vaccinating with Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s shots since before Christmas, this week canceled the famed Lauberhorn World Cup ski race, due to COVID-19 fears.  Health ministry officials have predicted the country will get a total of 500,000 doses in January, and another one million doses in February, with Moderna\u2019s shot adding to totals.  \u201cFollowing a thorough review of all the submitted data on safety, efficacy and quality, Swissmedic has today temporarily authorised the Moderna vaccine,\u201d the regulator said.  The vaccine comes with a \u201cMade in Switzerland\u201d label, as contract drug manufacturer Lonza makes its active ingredients at its factories in Visp, near the Matterhorn mountain.  Lonza said on Monday production at the first of three new Visp manufacturing lines has started, with the first batch due before the end of the month.  Switzerland has ordered some 15 million vaccine doses, including from AstraZeneca whose products have yet to be approved, after setting aside 400 million Swiss francs ($455 million) for shots. High global demand from everywhere, combined with limited production, means there is too little vaccine to go around.  Still, the country has told its 8.6 million residents that everybody who wants to will likely be able to get vaccinated by next summer.","1350":"NEW YORK, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine appeared to work against a key mutation in the highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in the UK and South Africa, according to a laboratory study conducted by the U.S. drugmaker.  The not-yet peer reviewed study by Pfizer and scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch indicated the vaccine was effective in neutralizing virus with the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein.  The mutation could be responsible for greater transmissibility and there had been concern it could also make the virus escape antibody neutralization elicited by the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer\u2019s top viral vaccine scientists.  The study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine. Its findings are limited, because it does not look at the full set of mutations found in either of the new variants of the rapidly spreading virus.  Dormitzer said it was encouraging that the vaccine appears effective against the mutation, as well as 15 other mutations the company has previously tested against.  \u201cSo we\u2019ve now tested 16 different mutations, and none of them have really had any significant impact.

The researchers plan to run similar tests to see if the vaccine is effective against other mutations found in the UK and South African variants and hope to have more data within weeks.  Scientists have expressed concern that vaccines being rolled out may not be able to protect against the new variants, particularly the one that emerged in South Africa.  Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said this week that while both variants had some new features in common, the one found in South Africa \u201chas a number additional mutations\u201d that included more extensive alterations to the spike protein.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc , which use synthetic messenger RNA technology, can be quickly tweaked to address new mutations of a virus if necessary. Scientists have suggested the changes could be made in as little as six weeks.

Governments are introducing new lockdown measures to halt the spread while facing massive demand for vaccines which are seen as the best way out of the global health crisis.  But with jabs in limited supply as production ramps up, the WHO has been examining how they can be used most effectively.  \u201cWe deliberated and came out with the following recommendation: two doses of this (Pfizer) vaccine within 21-28 days,\u201d Alejandro Cravioto, chairman of WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), told an online news briefing.  The panel said countries should have leeway to spread out shots over six weeks so that more people at higher risk of illness can get them.  \u201cSAGE made a provision for countries in exceptional circumstances of (Pfizer) vaccine supply constraints to delay the administration of the second dose for a few weeks in order to maximise the number of individuals benefiting from a first dose,\u201d Cravioto said.  He added: \u201cI think we have to be a bit open to these types of decisions which countries have to make according to their own epidemiological situations.\u201d  More than 85 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and around 1.85 million have died, according to a Reuters tally.  SPACING DOSES  SAGE executive Joachim Hombach said spacing out the two Pfizer inoculations could be acceptable for countries unable to implement the main recommendation.  \u201cThe JCI, the recommending body of the UK, has given more flexibility up to 12 weeks in consideration of the specific circumstances that the country is currently facing,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe...totally acknowledge that countries may see needs to be even more flexible in terms of administration of the second dose. But it is important to note that there is very little...empirical data from the trials that underpin this type of recommendation,\u201d he added.  Given the limited supply of vaccines at present, Cravioto said SAGE did not recommend the Pfizer jab for international travellers as a priority unless they were in a very high-risk group, such as the elderly and those with pre-existing ailments.  Kate O\u2019Brien, a WHO immunization expert, said there was a robust discussion at SAGE about the trade-off between adhering strictly to standard dosing in clinical trials and allowing for a broader use of vaccine as first doses, thus risking delay in getting the second dose out to some people.  Alluding to delays in rolling out inoculations, she said: \u201cNobody expected this to be easy and we are starting to see where the road bumps are and where we need to make adjustments.\u201d  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d that China had not authorised entry of an international mission to examine the origins of the global coronavirus pandemic.

Pfizer said it would raise the list price of most of the drugs by 5 percent, while prices for three will rise by 3 percent, and the price of one by 9 percent, all effective Jan. 15. The company did name the drugs in line for price hikes.  Pfizer said it does not expect the price increases to boost its revenue in the United States next year as it believes that rebates to insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will offset them.  Chief Executive Ian Read said in the statement that the company believes the best way to make drugs more affordable is by focusing on reducing out-of-pocket costs and returning rebates to consumers. This would effectively place responsibility for lowering costs with PBMs and insurers, rather than drugmakers.  The company rolled back a set of price increases in July after Trump said in a tweet that the drugmaker \u201cshould be ashamed\u201d and that his administration would respond.

All of the vaccines already approved or in development use this outer portion of the virus, known as the spike protein, to train the body to recognize the virus and make virus-neutralizing antibodies.  The N501Y mutation is linked to greater transmissibility, and scientists have expressed concerns it could also allow the virus to escape the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to the vaccine, said Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer\u2019s top viral vaccine scientists.  The first results of tests on some of the key variants of concern offer some hope as Britain and other countries try to tame the more infectious variants, which authorities believe are driving a surge in infections that could overwhelm healthcare systems.  Although all viruses mutate constantly, scientists are concerned about the mutations first discovered in Britain and South Africa because they are believed to be capable of altering key functions of the virus.  The Pfizer study was conducted on blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine.

They hope to have data within weeks.  The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness.  Independent experts gave a cautious welcome to the Pfizer study findings, but said the situation needs constant vigilance.  Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at Britain\u2019s University of East Anglia, said \u201cthe jury is still out on the impact of the South African variant on vaccine efficacy.\u201d  Deborah Dunn-Walters, a professor of immunology at Surrey University in Britain, said it was \u201creassuring\u201d that Pfizer is closely monitoring variants.  Ongoing testing will be needed, experts said, to allay concerns about whether vaccines being given to millions of people in the fight against the pandemic will protect them as the virus mutates. COVID-19 has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide.  \u201cThe evidence is not conclusive but there is a lot to indicate that the existing mRNA vaccines do cover the new variants.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration  The move to grant emergency authorisation to the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine has been seen by many as a political coup for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has led his country out of the EU and faced criticism for his handling of the pandemic.  The decision was made under an ultra-fast, emergency approval process, which allowed the British drugs regulator to temporarily authorise the vaccine only 10 days after it began examining data from large-scale trials.  In an unusually blunt statement, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is in charge of approving COVID-19 vaccines for the EU, said its longer approval procedure was more appropriate as it was based on more evidence and required more checks than the emergency procedure chosen by Britain.  The agency said on Tuesday it would decide by Dec. 29 whether to provisionally authorise the vaccine from U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE .  A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU executive, said the EMA\u2019s procedure was \u201cthe most effective regulatory mechanism to grant all EU citizens\u2019 access to a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d as it was based on more evidence.  Pfizer UK Country Manager Ben Osborn said, \u201cWe have provided complete data packages, the unblinded data, to both regulators. I think what you\u2019re seeing is just the difference in the underlying process and timelines, as opposed to any difference in data submission.\u201d  June Raine, the head of Britain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said, \u201cThe way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards.  \u201cOur progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review and our rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,\u201d she added.  The EMA started a rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer trials on Oct. 6, an emergency procedure aimed at speeding up possible approval, which usually takes at least seven months from reception of full data.  The UK regulator launched its own rolling review on Oct. 30, and analysed less data than made available to the EMA.  \u201cThe idea is not to be first but to have a safe and effective vaccine,\u201d Germany\u2019s Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference.  Asked about the emergency procedure used by Britain, he said EU countries had opted for a more thorough procedure to boost confidence in vaccines.  \u201cIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk,\u201d the EMA\u2019s former head Guido Rasi told an Italian radio.  \u201cPersonally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first,\u201d he added.  \u2018PROBLEMATIC\u2019  EU lawmakers were even more explicit in their criticism of Britain\u2019s move.  \u201cI consider this decision to be problematic and recommend that EU Member States do not repeat the process in the same way,\u201d said Peter Liese, an EU lawmaker who is a member of German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s party.  \u201cA few weeks of thorough examination by the European Medicines Agency is better than a hasty emergency marketing authorisation of a vaccine,\u201d said Liese, who represents the centre right grouping, the largest in the EU Parliament.  Under EU rules, the Pfizer vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but EU countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine at home for temporary use.  Britain is still subject to EU rules until it fully leaves the bloc at the end of the year.  \u201cThere is an obvious global race to get the vaccine on the market as fast as possible,\u201d said Tiemo Wolken, an EU lawmaker from the socialist grouping, the second largest in the Parliament.  \u201cHowever, I do believe that it is better to take the time and make sure that the quality, effectiveness and safety is guaranteed and matches our EU standards.\u201d","1368":"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's health minister is encouraged by a Pfizer PFE.N announcement that its COVID-19 vaccine proved effective in a late-stage trial but still does not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021, he said on Monday.

To break the dynamic of the spread of the coronavirus, between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated, Spahn said. However, the first vaccines are only expected to be available in limited amounts.  Germany plans to set up centralised vaccination centres to inoculate priority groups in the first instance, which will be supported by mobile teams.  First in line for vaccines should be those who are at risk due to their age or pre-existing conditions, particularly people living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities, the German research centre Leopoldina and the Ethics Council said in a position paper on priorities for vaccine delivery on Monday.  The second group should include those exposed to the virus through their jobs, such as front-line healthcare workers, who could also spread infections to vulnerable people.  For the third group, the experts proposed those who are needed to maintain public life, including health authority officials, police and security staff, firefighters and teachers.  Detailed recommendations will only be possible once late-stage data on the characteristics of vaccines is available, the experts said.  The German health ministry expects seven potential vaccines to complete testing this year or next, and is anticipating the first approvals in the first quarter of 2021, according to a copy of its national vaccine strategy paper seen by Reuters.  Vaccination will not be mandatory. The German government will pay for the vaccines, while the cost of setting up vaccination centres will be borne by the states and public and private health insurers where appropriate.  To get an overview on the effectiveness of the vaccines, Germany will collect non-personal data including information on age, sex, place of residence, vaccination date, vaccine product and vaccination dose administered, the ministry paper says.","1369":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Merck & Co said on Thursday a combination treatment of its cancer drug Keytruda and Pfizer Inc\u2019s Inlyta met the main goals of a late-stage study in patients with the most common form of kidney cancer.

The FDA is widely expected to authorize emergency use in days. Distribution and inoculations in the United States are expected to begin almost immediately thereafter.  The committee voted 17-4 that the known benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks of taking the shot for individuals 16 and older, with 1 member of the panel abstaining.  \u201cThis is a historic moment,\u201d Eric Dickson, chief executive of UMass Memorial Health Care, who was not on the advisory panel, said after the vote. He called the vaccine from Pfizer and German partner BioNTech \u201cthe best solution to get us out of our current situation and help us save lives.\u201d  Pfizer had asked that the two-dose vaccine be approved for use in people aged 16 to 85. Several advisory panel members discussed whether 16 and 17 year olds should be included in the recommendation. In the end, they voted on the question as put them by the FDA, which included 16 to 17 year olds.  It was not clear why four panelists voted against authorization but several mentioned they were not comfortable with including 16 and 17 year olds, arguing the risk to those individuals was low, and the evidence in the trial was scant.  \u201cThe final decision about whether to authorize the vaccine for emergency use will be made by FDA\u2019s career officials,\u201d the agency said in a statement.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The panel also discussed concerns raised by two reports of serious allergic reactions among vaccine recipients in Britain, and what to advise pregnant women, who were excluded in the study. Women of childbearing age comprise a large proportion of healthcare workers, who will be among those first in line to get the vaccine.  The FDA said during the panel meeting that there was not enough data to support or contradict use of the vaccine in pregnant women. The agency recommends they make the decision on their own with advice from their doctors.  Dr. Gregory Poland, a virologist from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who has previously served two terms on the FDA advisory panel, said he was surprised advisers did not voice more cautions about pregnant women.  FDA TO REVIEW ALLERGY ISSUE  The advisers also spent a major portion of the meeting discussing Pfizer\u2019s plan to give volunteers who received a placebo in its trial the option to get the vaccine when they become eligible for it under recommendations set by state and local health officials.  Much of that focused on how an emergency authorization would affect the scientific integrity of Pfizer\u2019s ongoing study and the way other vaccines are studied in the future.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Pfizer believes it should offer the vaccine to people in the placebo group of its trial as they become eligible for the shot.  The concern, expressed by both the FDA and members of the advisory panel, is that telling trial participants who got placebo and who got the vaccine, called \u201cunblinding,\u201d will make it harder to continue collecting data on safety and effectiveness needed to win full FDA approval of the vaccine.  Documents prepared by the FDA ahead of the meeting did not point out any new safety or efficacy issues, raising optimism the United States would soon follow the UK and Canada authorizing the vaccine.  Britain\u2019s health regulator on Wednesday advised some people with a history of anaphylaxis, an overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system related to medicine or food, to avoid the getting the vaccine.  Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer\u2019s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told the panel they \u201csaw no serious allergic reactions to the vaccine\u201d among the nearly 44,000 volunteers enrolled in the trial.  Nevertheless, an FDA official said the agency has asked Pfizer to add severe allergic reactions to their plans to study safety issues related to the vaccine once it\u2019s authorized.  Pfizer and BioNTech last month said a two-dose regimen of the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing illness from COVID-19, and detailed data released in the agency\u2019s documents showed the vaccine began showing some protection even before volunteers received a second dose.  The documents also disclosed data on safety including cases of Bell\u2019s palsy among volunteers in the placebo and vaccine groups, though it said the cases in the trial occurred at the same rate as in the general population. Other reactions included fever, fatigue and chills.","1372":"Jan 15 (Reuters) - Canada\u2019s Procurement Minister Anita Anand says:  * PFIZER WILL TEMPORARILY SLOW DELIVERIES OF VACCINE DUE TO PRODUCTION PROBLEMS FOR ALL COUNTRIES SUPPLIED BY ITS EUROPEAN FACTORY  * CANADA STILL WILL BE ABLE TO REACH GOAL TO OFFER VACCINATIONS TO ALL CANADIANS BY END OF SEPT  * PFIZER PRODUCTION DELAY IS DUE TO WORK EXPANDING MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND IS TO BE EXPECTED WHEN GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS ARE STRETCHED WELL BEYOND LIMITS (Reporting by Steve Scherer)","1373":"LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was very proud that the United Kingdom had become the first place in the world to have a clinically authorised coronavirus vaccine, after its regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech jab.  \u201cI\u2019m obviously absolutely thrilled with the news.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  A laboratory study released on Wednesday suggested that the South African virus variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine by two-thirds, but it is not clear how much that reduces the shot\u2019s effectiveness against this version of the pathogen.  Phil Dormitzer, one of Pfizer\u2019s top viral vaccine scientists and a co-author of the study, said in an interview he believes the current vaccine is highly likely to still protect against the concerning variant first discovered in South Africa.  \u201cA level of neutralizing antibodies that may be on the order of between a third and a half the level of neutralizing antibodies you see against the original virus does not mean you have only a third to half of the protection level, you may well have full protection,\u201d he said.  University of Texas Medical Branch professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he also believes the lessened immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection.  Shi said that in clinical trials, both the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and a similar shot from Moderna Inc conferred some protection after the first of two doses with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels seen in the laboratory study of the South African variant.  Still, Dormitzer, chief scientific officer of viral vaccines at Pfizer Vaccines Research and Development, said the company was developing plans to test a redesigned booster for the vaccine.  \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that primarily because we think that means that we\u2019re going to need to change that vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s primarily to learn how to change strain, both in terms of what we do at the manufacturing level, and especially what the clinical results are.  \u201cSo if a variant comes along for which there is clinical evidence of escape, we\u2019re ready to respond very quickly,\u201d Dormitzer added.  He said the company has already made a DNA template for a prototype vaccine targeting the variant and plans to manufacture a batch of it.  The company is proposing to do a Phase I clinical trial of a booster shot of that prototype vaccine that it would test against a booster for the current vaccine.  \u201cThis will be a immunogenicity study where you look at the immune response. And those studies are much, much smaller than the giant efficacy studies,\u201d Dormitzer said.  \u201cIn immunogenicity studies you can look at the immune response of every person in the study. It\u2019s not as definitive as efficacy data, for sure. But it can be gathered much more quickly,\u201d he explained.  The company would likely conduct some animal testing in parallel as well, he said.

In counties across the United States, the funding crisis has limited the hiring of needed vaccine staff, delayed the creation of vaccination centers, and undermined efforts to raise public awareness, officials told Reuters.  The federal government spent more than $10 billion to speed COVID-19 vaccine development but has so far disbursed little funding for distribution, even as it pushed the responsibility of actual immunizations onto state and local governments.  A new $2.3 trillion pandemic aid and spending package provides $8.75 billion to states to assist in vaccinations, in line with what state and local officials had requested, but months after distribution work should have begun.

The promised wave of newly approved vaccinations has been only a ripple: around 2.8 million Americans have received a shot, including fewer than 170,000 residents of nursing homes, one of the most at-risk groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That is far fewer than the 20 million vaccinations the federal government promised for December.  Nearly 10 million of the 12.4 million doses the government has distributed to states sit unused, and on Tuesday President-elect Joe Biden said it would take years, not months, to vaccinate most Americans at the current pace.  Hospitals and pharmacies CVS and Walgreens are in charge of the first wave of vaccinations of health care workers and long-term care residents. But local health systems will take a leading role in immunizing the next, bigger waves, and will be critical for groups such as the uninsured, underinsured, homeless and others.  The shortage of local public health staff will only grow more challenging as the vaccination effort expands to essential workers and older Americans, said Claire Hannan, the director of the Association of Immunization Managers, a trade group for local public health departments.

Picture taken December 8, 2020. John Maniaci\/UW health\/Handout via REUTERS  (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.  mRNA vaccines may need more study for treating some cancer patients  COVID-19 vaccines that employ new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology to fend off the illness may require further testing before it becomes clear they are safe for cancer patients with solid tumors, cancer treatment experts say. That would include the vaccines from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna Inc. The vaccines work by carrying genetic instructions for making a protein from the virus that the immune system learns to recognize and defend against. The mRNA is encased in a microscopic \"packet\" called a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), or liposome, that protects and delivers the fragile molecule into cells. While this technique is new for vaccines, it has long been used to carry cancer drugs into tumors, because tumors easily take up liposomes. This raises the possibility that tumor tissues would capture some of the liposomes carrying the vaccine's mRNA, said Gerard Milano of Nice University in France. The potential for part of the vaccine to become stuck in tumors and the resulting effect on cancer patients \"is an open question to which there is currently no answer,\" Milano said. In a paper published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer, his team calls for \"a careful evaluation of the efficacy of these promising mRNA COVID-19 vaccines administered as lipid carriers for patients with solid tumors, including a possible re-appraisal of the dosing for optimal protection of this specific and frail population.\" (go.nature.com\/2JQq4hV)  Solid sewage beats wastewater for tracking COVID-19  Public health officials trying to track the spread of the new coronavirus might be better off looking for its genetic material in solid sewage rather than in wastewater, a new study suggests. For several days in March and April, researchers collected and analyzed wastewater and the solids that settled out of the water at two California sewage treatment plants. They reported on Wednesday in Environmental Science & Technology that concentrations of genetic material from the virus were up to 1,000 times higher in the solids than in the wastewater, making detection more sensitive and accurate for the solid samples. They also analyzed settled solids collected over several months from waste treatment plants in a large urban area and found that concentrations of genetic material on different days correlated with the number of new COVID-19 cases reported on those days. Coauthor Krista Wigginton of the University of Michigan said that compared to extracting the virus from raw sewage, extracting it from solids \"requires fewer steps and essentially the same equipment,\" potentially making it \"a more straightforward and more sensitive approach\" to COVID-19 surveillance. (bit.ly\/3oAL9Ma)  Men worldwide doing worse with COVID-19  A large international study of COVID-19 patients confirms that men are more likely than women to become seriously ill and die of the disease. Researchers pooled data from government websites and the medical literature on more than 3.1 million people infected with the new coronavirus in 46 countries. They found no difference in the proportion of male and female patients who contracted COVID-19. Men, however, were nearly three times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit and 39% more likely to die from COVID-19. In a report published on Wednesday in Nature Communications, the investigators said previous studies have found \"fundamental differences\" in the way men's bodies and women's bodies respond to infections. In people with COVID-19, they write, \"these differences are likely to lead to more effective viral control in females.\" The data has important implications for managing patients and for public health, the researchers said.

The encouraging results from an analysis of blood of participants in trials are based on more extensive analysis than those released by the U.S. drugmaker last week.  Last week, Pfizer said a similar laboratory study showed the vaccine was effective against one key mutation, called N501Y, found in two highly transmissible new variants spreading in Britain and South Africa.  The latest study, posted on bioRxiv.org but not yet peer reviewed, was conducted on a synthetic virus with 10 mutations that are characteristic of the variant known as B117 identified in Britain.  Among the 11 authors of the study are Ugur Sahin and Oezlem Tuereci, co-founders of BioNTech. Sahin is chief executive and his wife Tuereci is chief medical officer.  It provides further hope as record numbers of daily deaths from COVID-19 are reported in Britain, which is believed to be driven by the more transmissible variant. It also means vaccine development would for now not have to start all over again.  But the virus needs to be continuously monitored to check that changes maintain protection by vaccines, the study said.  For the test, blood samples drawn from 16 vaccinated participants in prior clinical trials were exposed to a synthetic virus called pseudovirus which was engineered to have the same surface proteins as B117, as characterised by 10 hallmark mutations.  The antibodies in the blood of the volunteers given the vaccine, known as Comirnaty, or BNT162b2, neutralised the pseudovirus as effectively as the older coronavirus version that the product was initially designed for.

The world is pinning its hopes on vaccines to rein in the coronavirus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, as many countries impose tighter and longer lockdowns to try to bring the pandemic under control.  VARIANTS AND VACCINES  The variants are said by scientists to be more transmissible than previously dominant ones, but they are not thought to cause more serious illness.  \u201cThe South African strain has been detected in the UK - albeit currently in small numbers - but does seem to be increasing in recent weeks,\u201d said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at Britain\u2019s University of East Anglia.  \u201cVariants with this mutation could reduce vaccine efficacy, though most likely all current vaccines would still be highly effective.\u201d  Experts have called for continued testing to establish whether vaccines will protect people as the virus mutates. COVID-19 has killed more than 2 million people worldwide.  Preparation for potential COVID-19 vaccine strain changes would be \u201cprudent\u201d, the study said on Wednesday.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and the one from Moderna Inc, which both use synthetic messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, can be quickly adapted to address new mutations in the coronavirus if necessary.

FILE PHOTO: A worker passes a line of freezers holding coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine candidate BNT162b2 at a Pfizer facility in Puurs, Belgium in an undated photograph. Pfizer\/Handout via REUTERS.  A recent survey by an air cargo association and a drug shippers' group found only 15% of industry participants felt ready to transport goods near the minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94\u00b0F) required by the Pfizer Inc PFE.N vaccine, while around 60% could meet Moderna Inc's MRNA.O less stringent -20\u00b0C requirement.  Typically, airlines use containers with cooling materials such as dry ice to transport pharmaceutical products, but some don\u2019t have temperature controls, making products susceptible to unforeseen events such as flight delays.  Airlines are now considering options ranging from a large plug-in freezer that can cost about as much as a small car to a multi-layered canister that uses liquid nitrogen to ship vaccines requiring a deep freeze.  The potential demand for such high-end packaging has helped shares of cold container specialists such as Cryoport Inc CYRX.O and Germany-based va-Q-tec VQTG.DE more than double in recent months.  \"With direct contracts with five temperature-controlled container manufacturers, Korean Air has secured sufficient quantities of containers. For now, we are in the process of signing contracts with other container manufacturers,\" a Korean Air 003490.KS spokesperson said.  Air France-KLM AIRF.PA said it was gearing up for a test run with one of the drugmakers - it declined to say which - that will see dummy samples shipped at ultra-low temperatures, likely via Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.  The drill will use boxes carrying as many as 5,000 doses each, all cooled by dry ice, Air France-KLM special cargo manager B\u00e9atrice Delpuech told Reuters. Later shipments may also use larger ultra-cold containers rented from va-Q-tec.  \u201cThey need to validate the entire logistics chain from end to end, including the air freight segment,\u201d Delpuech said. \u201cWe have a dedicated task force examining every step of the process with all our teams, to make sure there are no hitches anywhere.\u201d  DRY ICE LIMITS  But one difficulty with vaccine transport is that airplanes can only carry a limited amount of dry ice - frozen carbon dioxide - as it turns into gas over time, displacing the breathable air in the cabin.  All widebody planes can carry a maximum of around 1 tonne of dry ice in refrigerated and insulated containers, according to a DHL white paper on vaccine transport.  \u201cDepending on the type of aircraft, there are usually not more than a few containers on board at the same time,\u201d said Joachim von Winning, chief executive of Air Cargo Community Frankfurt.  For an alternative, Deutsche Post AG's DPWGn.DE DHL has been using Cyroport's capsule containers, which use liquid nitrogen to keep goods as cool as -150C for up to 10 days to support clinical vaccine trials, said Patricia Cole, DHL Global Forwarding's global head of temperature management solutions.  Although it is relatively a small-scale solution, with only hundreds of vials in each container, broader preparations have already begun.  Pfizer, which is working with DHL, FedEx Corp FDX.N and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N for vaccine distribution in the United States, said on Monday it has launched a pilot delivery programme in four states to help it refine its nationwide and global shipping plan.  The U.S. drugmaker has also developed temperature-controlled and GPS-enabled boxes that use dry ice to keep its vaccine at around -70C for up to 10 days.  But cold-chain solutions providers such as Sweden\u2019s Envirotainer say so-called active containers, which use electric motors to cool their contents, are safer and more cost-effective.  A Envirotainer spokesman said that its fleet of active temperature-controlled containers was twice that of its competitors and that it was preparing to increase its capacity by 50%.  Va-Q-tec also said this month that it would significantly expand its container fleet over the coming months in anticipation of orders COVID-19 vaccine transport.  Airlines have become more reliant on cargo for revenue this year as passenger numbers plunged amid pandemic-related travel restrictions.  Accenture\u2019s Seabury Consulting estimates the global roll-out of a vaccine will generate 65,000 tonnes of air freight, which is five times the air vaccine trade in 2019.  But airlines think the potential for the vaccine to allow a return to normal travel is most important, KLM chief executive Pieter Elbers said at a CAPA Centre for Aviation event on Nov. 11.  \u201cI think overall for the entire industry, the vaccine is going to be much more important than the cargo revenues it would bring,\u201d he said.","1384":"Oct 19 (Reuters) - Australia\u2019s competition watchdog said on Friday the High Court dismissed its special leave application to appeal a court\u2019s decision on whether Pfizer Inc\u2019s local unit used its market power to limit competition for its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.

Here is the full text of Health Canada\u2019s announcement:  \u201cThanks to advances in science and technology, and an unprecedented level of global cooperation, today, Canada reached a critical milestone in its fight against COVID-19 with the authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccine.  \u201cHealth Canada received Pfizer\u2019s submission on October 9, 2020 and after a thorough, independent review of the evidence, Health Canada has determined that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine meets the Department\u2019s stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements for use in Canada.  \u201cAs part of its continued commitment to openness and transparency, Health Canada is publishing a number of documents related to this decision, including a high-level summary of the evidence that Health Canada reviewed to support the authorization of the vaccine. More detailed information will be available in the coming weeks, including a detailed scientific summary and the full clinical trial data package.  \u201cCanadians can feel confident that the review process was rigorous and that we have strong monitoring systems in place. Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada will closely monitor the safety of the vaccine once it is on the market and will not hesitate to take action if any safety concerns are identified.  \u201cThe terms and conditions of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine authorization require the manufacturer to continue providing information to Health Canada on the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine to ensure the benefits of the vaccine continue to be demonstrated through market use.  \u201cThe initial indication of the vaccine is for use in people 16 years of age or older. Pfizer-BioNTech are running further clinical trials on children of all age groups and the indication could be revised in the future to include children if the data from these studies support it.  \u201cThe vaccine was authorized under Health Canada\u2019s Interim Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19.

FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn declined to lay out a specific timetable for approval of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech but said he hoped the regulator would make a decision this month.  Many federal officials are expecting a vaccine approval within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of experts, though one FDA official recently said an approval decision could take weeks.  \u201cWe expect to move quickly,\u201d after that meeting, Hahn told Reuters in an interview.  Britain leapt ahead of the United States this week in approving Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, intensifying scrutiny on U.S. regulators as they consider whether to grant emergency use in the country that leads the world in coronavirus infections.  Hahn has come under pressure from outgoing President Donald Trump, who is eager to claim credit for a successful vaccine, to speed up the process.  The FDA head discussed the situation at a White House meeting with chief of staff Mark Meadows earlier this week to explain the timing and the \u201cbalancing act\u201d required to make sure a vaccine is safe and effective.  \u201cMr. Meadows asked for a briefing and we gave it, and it went very well,\u201d Hahn told Reuters. \u201cWe had a very robust discussion, and I know that term sometimes is loaded, robust, but we did.\u201d  Though he declined to give a specific timeline for vaccine approval, Hahn gave a nod to its likelihood by endorsing the White House\u2019s goal of having 20 million Americans inoculated by the end of the year.  FILE PHOTO: FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn testifies at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 23, 2020. Graeme Jennings\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  \u201cI think given what we know about supplies, it is realistic,\u201d Hahn said of that goal. \u201cIt\u2019ll very much depend upon ... the vaccination campaign.\u201d  Trump, a Republican who lost the Nov. 3 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden but has declined to concede the race, said last week he deserved credit for the vaccine.  GETTING TO 20 MILLION  Dealing with the virus that has killed more than 276,000 people in the United States as well as the economic fallout from the crisis is one of Biden\u2019s top priorities once he takes office on Jan. 20.  Hahn said Biden\u2019s team had not been in touch with him but he would be happy to provide information about the vaccine approval process. The cancer specialist said he had not made plans for a new job after the Biden administration takes over.  To get to 20 million people, the FDA would need to approve both Pfizer\u2019s vaccine and the shot developed by Moderna soon so they can go to the states quickly.  Data from late-stage trials of Moderna\u2019s vaccine, which uses the same mRNA technology as the Pfizer\/BioNTech shot, is due to be reviewed on Dec. 17.  Based on a scenario in which people get two doses, Pfizer plans to provide the United States with enough vaccine for 12.5 million people and Moderna has said it will have enough for 10 million people this year.  Pfizer and Moderna have tested their products as two-shot vaccines given weeks apart, but Hahn said officials at the agency were combing through their data and might consider them as a single-shot if warranted.  \u201cI can\u2019t prejudge what our scientists will decide, but we will look at that,\u201d Hahn said. A single shot vaccine would be much easier to manage because it would not require millions of Americans to return for a second shot weeks later, a major logistical challenge for public health officials. Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed program has struck deals with several drugmakers in an effort to help speed up the search for effective treatments to fight the global pandemic.  Of the vaccines being evaluated, only Johnson & Johnson\u2019s candidate is being tested as a single-shot vaccine.  A speedy vaccine approval could be a political win for Trump\u2019s outgoing administration, which has been pushing for effective treatments to help restore a sense of normality to daily life and a hard-hit U.S. economy.  Hahn said he would be eager to be inoculated as soon as there is an approval. \u201cI will be first in line and I will encourage my family to take this vaccine,\u201d he said.","1392":"A nurse holds a phial of the Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at University Hospital in Coventry, December 8, 2020.

Pfizer and BioNTech will not receive any money from the government unless their vaccine succeeds in large clinical trials and can be successfully manufactured, according to a Pfizer spokeswoman.  Under the agreement, the government would also have an option to procure an additional 500 million doses.

The Pfizer\/BioNTech candidate is one of the most advanced of over 150 vaccines being developed against COVID-19, which has claimed more than 600,000 lives globally and crippled economies.  The vaccine utilizes the chemical messenger RNA to instruct cells to make proteins that mimic the surface of the coronavirus, which the immune system sees as a foreign invader and mounts an attack. Although the technology has been around for years, there has never been an approved messenger RNA (mRNA)vaccine.

MSCI's index of Latin American stocks rose as much as 1% to its highest level since March 9, and the currencies index climbed 0.9% after drugmaker Pfizer said its COVID-19 vaccine was 95% effective and it would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days. Chile's peso was among the top regional gainers, strengthening 0.8% against the dollar on support from higher prices for copper, the country's top export. Data released earlier in the day showed Chile's third quarter gross domestic product contracted compared with a year earlier, but rose 5.2% versus the second quarter, showing signs of a slow recovery following the peak of the novel coronavirus pandemic. \"We think output will return to its pre-crisis level quicker (in Chile) than elsewhere in the region, supported by loose fiscal policy and high copper prices,\" Nikhil Sanghani, Latin America economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note. \"Chile will probably benefit from a vaccine quicker than others in the region as it has already made significant purchase agreements.\" Optimism over a vaccine has benefited regional risk assets over the past week, with Latam stocks outperforming their emerging markets peers on hopes of a relatively quicker economic recovery.

Peru's sol extended gains a day after recording its largest daily jump in more than seven months, following the appointment of Francisco Sagasti as interim president. \"Sagasti's track record as a centrist and a technocrat, as well as his strong support in Congress, bodes well for containing the political turmoil in the near-term,\" analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note. The Peruvian government also enacted a reform to citizen pension withdrawals in order to ease the economic impact of the virus. Brazil's real advanced 0.1%, putting it on course for a third straight day of gains.

Here are some questions and answers about the cases and what they might mean.  WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?  UK officials said there have been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. Anaphylaxis can cause throat swelling, breathing trouble and difficulty swallowing, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body\u2019s immune system, which the UK National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening.  WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE VACCINE, ACCORDING TO UK REGULATORS?  British regulators initially responded by saying anyone with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food should not take the shot. An adviser to the group later said it was \u201ctweaking\u201d advice in part to say a food allergy was not a risk.  Late on Wednesday, the UK regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not get the vaccine.  Pfizer had excluded people with a history of significant adverse reaction to vaccines or its vaccine\u2019s ingredients from late-stage trials.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/File Photo  HOW DOES THIS AFFECT PROSPECTS FOR U.S. AUTHORIZATION?  U.S. regulators are expected to consider emergency authorization of the Pfizer vaccine soon after a Thursday meeting of advisers.  Moncef Slaoui, who is spearheading the U.S. government\u2019s vaccine development efforts, said on Wednesday he expected the British allergic reactions would be considered in the U.S. authorization process and that people with known severe allergic reactions probably should not take the vaccine until more was understood.  WHAT DO DOCTORS SAY?  Some praised UK regulators\u2019 caution, while others said broad restrictions were not warranted by available evidence.  \u201cFor the general population, this does not mean that they would need to be anxious about receiving the vaccination,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.  What would be wise, he said, would be \u201cfor anyone who has known severe allergic reaction such that they need to carry an EpiPen to delay having a vaccination until the reason for the allergic reaction has been clarified.\u201d  Mayo Clinic virologist Gregory Poland, who has advised U.S. regulators, described Britain\u2019s early reaction as \u201coverdoing it,\u201d pointing to the initial response about food allergies, which he said \u201chave nothing to do with this.\u201d  \u201cI would have said, \u2018If you\u2019ve had anaphylactic-level reactions to vaccines, we want to know about that so we take extra care,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t immunize you. But I would do it in a more controlled setting.\u201d  Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, praised the way the reactions had been handled. \u201cThe fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that the monitoring system is working well,\u201d he said.  Mitchell Grayson, director of the division of allergy and immunology at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio, voiced concern over how the issue might reduce interest in vaccinations. \u201cI\u2019m worried the whole event will cause millions of people to choose not to get vaccinated because of what they heard,\u201d he said.  HOW COMMON ARE SEVERE OR SIGNIFICANT ALLERGIES?  \u201cIn the UK in 2012 there were around seven hospital admissions per 100,000 people for severe allergies. This included different triggers such as foods, drugs and insect stings,\u201d said Louisa James, a expert in immunology at Queen Mary University of London. Fatalities remain very rare and have not increased even as hospital admissions have risen in many countries.","1409":"GENEVA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization is in advanced negotiations with Pfizer about including the company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine in the agency\u2019s portfolio of shots to be shared with poorer countries, a senior WHO official said on Monday.  \u201cWe are in very detailed discussions with Pfizer.

REUTERS\/Kai Pfaffenbach  BERLIN\/DILLENBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Proud of their national reputation for efficiency, Germans are growing increasingly frustrated by the slow rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine its scientists helped develop.  Scarce vaccine supply, cumbersome paperwork, a lack of healthcare staff and an aged and immobile population are hampering efforts to get early doses of a vaccine made by U.S.-based Pfizer and German partner BioNTech into the arms of the people.  Germany has set up hundreds of vaccination centres in sports halls and concert arenas and has the infrastructure to administer up to 300,000 shots a day, Health Minister Jens Spahn said.  But the majority are standing empty, with most states not planning to open centres until mid-January as they prioritise sending mobile teams into care homes.  A day spent with a vaccination team in the small town of Dillenburg, 100 km (60 miles) to the north of Germany\u2019s financial capital Frankfurt, shows just how painstaking the task is.  The team starts out by loading a cool-box containing 84 doses of the Pfizer vaccine defrosted overnight into a waiting ambulance, and setting out for the Elisabeth residential care home.  There they are met by manager Peter Bittermann, who has already dealt with the forms needed to vaccinate residents and staff, and provided space for the shots to be administered and recipients monitored post-vaccination.  The four-member immunisation team, plus two trainees, has just a few hours to dispense the temperature-sensitive Pfizer vaccine before it is no longer fit for use.  The German Red Cross needs an extra 350 people to run its local vaccination campaign, said Nicole Fey, spokeswoman of the local district administration.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to recruit some, but there can never be enough,\u201d she told Reuters TV.  GERMANY LAGS  In the first two weeks of its vaccination drive Germany has given 533,000 shots, just two-fifths of the 1.3 million doses received. Britain, by contrast, has reached the 2 million mark.  Israel, the world leader in terms of the share of population covered, is inoculating 150,000 people daily, with its universal and digitally enabled healthcare system making it easier to schedule appointments.  Germany\u2019s larger size and federal set-up are complicating operations, a problem also faced in the United States.  Elsewhere in Europe, the decentralisation of Spain\u2019s vaccination operation has exposed differences between regions and led to tensions with the central government.  Graphic: COVID-19 vaccine doses administered -  Germany\u2019s 16 states blame the federal government for not securing enough doses. Doctors in some centres say shifts have been cancelled. In Berlin, one vaccination centre was opened, only to be closed over New Year due to a lack of shots.  Spahn says manufacturing problems rather than too few orders are to blame for the limited supply, after Pfizer and BioNTech in December halved their production forecast to 50 million doses by year-end. Each recipient requires two shots..  The government is working with BioNTech to open a new production site in the western town of Marburg, he said. BioNTech\u2019s chief executive said last week the Marburg plant may enter service in February, ahead of schedule.  \u201cWith the capacity we have already created in Germany, we will be able to carry out between 250,000 and 300,000 vaccinations per day - when we have the vaccine doses,\u201d Spahn said this week.  Germany expects to receive 5.3 million shots from Pfizer\/BioNTech by mid-February and another 2 million doses of a second vaccine from Moderna, just approved by the European Union, by the end of March.  Yet this will barely be enough to cover the 5.7 million people, or 6.8% of the population, aged over 80.  THE LAST MILE  As in Spain, state-by-state performance in Germany varies widely. Top of the class is Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the north, with 15.6 vaccinations per 1,000 residents, while Saxony has a rate of just 4.4.  In Thuringia, another laggard, state premier Bodo Ramelow said on Tuesday that many doses sent to hospitals had been returned. \u201cIf the brakes come on at a vaccination rate of 30 or 33%, we have a real problem,\u201d he told Deutschlandfunk radio.  In Saxony, the social affairs ministry said missing consent forms, challenges with route planning, COVID outbreaks in homes and last-minute cancellations had slowed its rollout.  Shots in Saxony were stored centrally until recently, meaning mobile teams had to drive long distances before heading to care homes.  In contrast to Dillenburg, Saxony has been overrun by people volunteering for its vaccination drive, said Lars Werthmann, regional logistics chief at the German Red Cross.  \u201cThe next mammoth task is to coordinate all these people,\u201d Werthmann said.  Doctors meanwhile express frustration at appointment booking systems that vary from state to state, saying they cause confusion and erode trust.  To speed up the rollout of COVID-19 shots, Germany should distribute them through its network of family doctors\u2019 practices as soon as there is a vaccine that can be easily stored in a fridge, said Berlin paediatrician Burkhard Ruppert.  Germany is hoping to administer shots at doctors\u2019 practices in a second phase.  \u201cOur strength in Germany is this outpatient care system,\u201d said Ruppert, who heads a local doctors\u2019 association. \u201cWe\u2019re not a country of large-scale managed systems like the United Kingdom or Israel might be.\u201d  \u201cWe are in a race against a virus,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will only win if we vaccinate as much and as fast as possible.\u201d","1412":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is expected to sign a deal this week for supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and is set to receive the first batch eight weeks after that, the caretaker health minister said.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for about 60,000 people will arrive as early as this month, as the country plans to roll out its vaccination campaign targeting about 50,000 frontline health workers and the elderly in February.","1420":"(This February 17 story corrects headline and first paragraph to show the reduction was in the protective antibodies elicited by the vaccine, not the protection of the vaccine overall)  Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - A laboratory study suggests that the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the Pfizer Inc\/BioNTech SE vaccine by two-thirds, and it is not clear if the shot will be effective against the mutation, the companies said on Wednesday.  The study found the vaccine was still able to neutralize the virus and there is not yet evidence from trials in people that the variant reduces vaccine protection, the companies said.  Still, they are making investments and talking to regulators about developing an updated version of their mRNA vaccine or a booster shot, if needed.  For the study, scientists from the companies and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) developed an engineered virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike portion of the highly contagious coronavirus variant first discovered in South Africa, known as B.1.351. The spike, used by the virus to enter human cells, is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines.  Researchers tested the engineered virus against blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine, and found a two- thirds reduction in the level of neutralizing antibodies compared with its effect on the most common version of the virus prevalent in U.S. trials.  Their findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).  Because there is no established benchmark yet to determine what level of antibodies are needed to protect against the virus, it is unclear whether that two-thirds reduction will render the vaccine ineffective against the variant spreading around the world.  However, UTMB professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he believes the Pfizer vaccine will likely be protective against the variant.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the minimum neutralizing number is. We don\u2019t have that cutoff line,\u201d he said, adding that he suspects the immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection.  That is because in clinical trials, both the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and a similar shot from Moderna Inc conferred some protection after a single dose with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels caused by the South African variant in the laboratory study.  Even if the concerning variant significantly reduces effectiveness, the vaccine should still help protect against severe disease and death, he noted. Health experts have said that is the most important factor in keeping stretched healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed.  More work is needed to understand whether the vaccine works against the South African variant, Shi said, including clinical trials and the development of correlates of protection - the benchmarks to determine what antibody levels are protective.  Pfizer and BioNTech said they were doing similar lab work to understand whether their vaccine is effective against another variant first found in Brazil.  Moderna published a correspondence in NEJM on Wednesday with similar data previously disclosed elsewhere that showed a sixfold drop antibody levels versus the South African variant.  Moderna also said the actual efficacy of its vaccine against the South African variant is yet to be determined. The company has previously said it believes the vaccine will work against the variant.","1421":"FILE PHOTO: Vials with a sticker reading, \"COVID-19 \/ Coronavirus vaccine \/ Injection only\" and a medical syringe are seen in front of a displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken October 31, 2020.

Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to show successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The companies said they have so far found no serious safety concerns and expect to seek U.S. emergency use authorization later this month.  If authorized, the number of vaccine doses will initially be limited. Many questions also remain including how long the vaccine will provide protection. However the news provides hope that other vaccines in development against the novel coronavirus may also prove effective.  \u201cToday is a great day for science and humanity,\u201d Albert Bourla, Pfizer\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cWe are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen.\u201d  Pfizer expects to seek broad U.S. emergency use authorization of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need to have collected two months of safety data on around half of the study\u2019s roughly 44,000 participants, expected in late November.  \u201cI\u2019m near ecstatic,\u201d Bill Gruber, one of Pfizer\u2019s top vaccine scientists, said in an interview. \u201cThis is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we\u2019re now in.\u201d  Pfizer said the interim analysis was conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, examining how many of them received the vaccine versus a placebo.  The company did not break down exactly how many of those who fell ill received the vaccine. Still, over 90% effectiveness implies that no more than 8 of the 94 people who caught COVID-19 had been given the vaccine, which was administered in two shots about three weeks apart.  The efficacy rate is well above the 50% effectiveness required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine.  To confirm its efficacy rate, Pfizer said it will continue the trial until there are 164 COVID-19 cases among participants. Given the recent spike in U.S. infection rates, that number could be reached by early December, Gruber said.  The data have yet to be peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. Pfizer said it would do so once it has results from the entire trial.  Pfizer and BioNTech have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They have also reached supply agreements with the European Union, the UK, Canada and Japan.  To save time, the companies began manufacturing the vaccine before they knew whether it would be effective. They now expect to produce up to 50 million doses or enough vaccine to protect 25 million people this year.  Pfizer said it expects to produce up to 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021.  GLOBAL RACE  The global race for a vaccine has seen wealthier countries forge multibillion-dollar supply deals with drugmakers like Pfizer, AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson Inc , raising questions over when middle income and poorer nations will get access to inoculations.  The U.S. quest for a vaccine has been the Trump administration\u2019s central response to the pandemic. The United States has the world\u2019s highest known number of COVID-19 cases and deaths with more than 10 million infections and more than 237,000 fatalities.  President Donald Trump repeatedly assured the public that his administration would likely identify a successful vaccine in time for the presidential election, held last Tuesday. On Saturday, Democratic rival Joe Biden was declared the winner.  Vaccines are seen as essential tools to help end the health crisis that has shuttered businesses and left millions out of work. Millions of children whose schools were closed in March remain in remote learning programs.  Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which on Sunday exceeded 50 million infections since the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year in China.  The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines.  Moderna Inc, whose vaccine candidate employs similar technology, is expected to report results from its large-scale trial later this month. The mRNA technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.  Pfizer alone will not have the capacity to immediately provide enough vaccines for the entire United States. The Trump administration has said it will have enough supply for all of the 330 million U.S. residents who wish to be vaccinated by the middle of 2021.  The U.S. government has said the vaccines will be provided for free to Americans, including the insured, uninsured and those in government health programs such as Medicare.","1428":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain\u2019s medical regulator assessed the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine according to international standards and within the provisions of European law, its chief executive said on Wednesday.  \u201cThe way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards,\u201d June Raine said.

Serum Institute has stockpiled 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and says it will raise its monthly output to much more than that now the approval has come.  Indian health officials say they generally ask for so-called bridging trials to determine if a vaccine is safe and generates an immune response in its citizens whose genetic makeup can be different from people in western nations. There are, however, provisions here under India's New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, to waive such trials in certain conditions.  A Pfizer spokeswomen had no immediate comment.  The Pfizer vaccine, developed in partnership with Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE, is already being administered to people in countries such as the United States and Britain. It was not immediately clear if any other countries had asked for similar smaller local trials before approving vaccines developed and tested abroad.

The bloc has agreed to pay 15.50 euros ($18.34) per dose for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, according to the official.  That would mean an overall price of up to 3.1 billion euros ($3.7 billion) for 200 million doses, rising to 4.65 billion euros if another optional 100 million doses are purchased under the deal, the official said.  The pricing information, previously undisclosed, confirms the EU is paying less per dose than the United States for an initial supply of that vaccine, as reported by Reuters last week.  The deal includes an insurance for EU countries to get compensation if the companies divert doses to the United States, according to the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.  The EU has separately agreed to pay 10 euros ($11.84) per dose for an initial supply of 225 million doses of the vaccine candidate from CureVac, a discount from the 12 euros the company set as the price for the shot, the official said.  The bloc struck the deal with CureVac this week to secure the supply of up to 405 million doses, of which 180 million are optional.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The official said CureVac had committed to starting deliveries by the end of March. It is unclear whether the additional 180 million doses would cost 10 or 12 euros each. Under the 10-euro price, though, the bloc would pay 4.05 billion euros for 405 million doses.  A spokesman for the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive body, declined to comment on terms and pricing of vaccine contracts because they are confidential.  Germany\u2019s BioNTech and CureVac declined to comment.  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer said it and BioNTech were using a tiered pricing formula based on volume and delivery dates and that the EU deal represented the largest initial order of its vaccine candidate to date.  \u201cWe are not disclosing further details of this agreement,\u201d it added.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  AMERICAN PRICE  Pfizer and BioNTech said on Wednesday that final data showed their shot was 95% effective against COVID-19, and that they could start distributing shots before Christmas should they secure emergency authorisations..  In July the U.S. government agreed with Pfizer to pay $19.5 per dose for 100 million, with an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately.  The lower price partly reflects the financial support given by the European Union to BioNTech for the drug\u2019s development, a second EU official told Reuters last week.  Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and CureVac candidates are based on new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and designed to be administered in two doses. That means, for the EU\u2019s Pfizer shot, it would cost 31 euros to inoculate one person.  To secure the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the EU has made a non-refundable down payment. The amount has not been disclosed, but the official said the bloc had paid 700 million euros to the companies.  The agreed price of 15.50 euros per dose would only be paid by those European governments willing to buy the shot, and only if it is approved by the EU regulator as safe and effective.  In a sign of the global race to secure vaccines, the EU required Pfizer and BioNTech to accept a \u201cbreach of contract clause\u201d if they diverted doses to the United States, the source said.  In that eventuality, EU states would be reimbursed 50% of the money they had paid, the official said. This clause was requested by the EU, the official added, despite the companies planning to produce the doses for Europe in Belgium and Germany.","1436":"FILE PHOTO: National Guard personnel and pharmacists from Safeway and Albertsons administer vaccines at a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mass vaccination site at the Clark County Event Center at the Fairgrounds in Ridgefield, Washington, U.S. January 27, 2021.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of Pfizer is seen at the entrance to the Pfizer factory in Puurs, Belgium December 3, 2020. REUTERS\/Yves Herman  Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough for just under a third of the population as two shots of the shot are needed per person to gain immunity.  Below are details on what the government, companies and health service have said about the manufacturing and storage process, logistics of the rollout, who gets the vaccine and where they will get it.  MANUFACTURING PROCESS:  - The vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F) or below.  - The two companies have developed specially designed, temperature-controlled shippers which can maintain their temperature for 10 days unopened. The shippers can also be used for storage, maintaining the required temperature, for a further 30 days.  - Once thawed, the vaccine vial can be stored for up to five days at refrigerated temperatures (2-8 degrees Celsius).  - The UK market will be supplied by Pfizer\u2019s manufacturing site in Puurs, Belgium, one of its largest sterile injectable sites.  LOGISTICAL DETAILS:  - Pfizer dispatched initial volumes of vaccine from Belgium, which arrived at secure locations in Britain by the weekend. Around 800,000 doses are expected to be available in the first week of rollout.  - After arriving, there is a post-delivery quality assurance process to ensure the vaccine\u2019s quality and integrity has been maintained through transit, which can take 12-24 hours.  - Each box is then opened and unpacked manually, with temperature data downloaded from each box.  - There are five packs of 975 doses per box. Only sites with the right regulatory licence can split the vaccine packs, which limits where they can be sent in the first instance.  WHICH PEOPLE GET IT WHEN?  - Britain has said the speed of the rollout then depends on how fast Pfizer can manufacture and deliver the vaccine.  - It will be administered in two shots, about three weeks apart. The bulk of the rollout will happen in the new year.  - Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers, according to the chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI).  - People in descending bands from 80 to 50 will follow on in the first wave, along with people aged 16 years to 64 years with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality.  WHERE WILL PEOPLE GET IT?  - Britain will use hospitals, large vaccination centres and community medical centres to distribute the vaccine.  - At first, the vaccine will be available from around 50 \u201cHospital Hubs\u201d, where shots will be defrosted and then prepared.  - Over 1,000 local vaccination centres, operated by groups of general practitioners (GPs), will then open. The health service has asked doctors to be ready to begin vaccinations from Dec. 14.  - When there is more vaccine and it is possible to split the packs up, the government has said it plans bigger vaccination centres and smaller arrangements through local pharmacies.","1438":"Dec 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Pfizer Inc and Astellas Pharma Inc\u2019s Xtandi to treat patients with a type of prostate cancer, the companies said on Monday.

FILE PHOTO: Small bottles labelled with \"Vaccine\" stickers stand near a medical syringe in front of displayed \"Coronavirus COVID-19\" words in this illustration taken April 10, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/File Photo  U.S. drugmakers Pfizer-BioNtech and Moderna have each said their coronavirus vaccines have an efficacy rate of around 95% and a Russian project touted 92% efficacy for its Sputnik V vaccine.  Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca announced an average efficacy rate of 70%, still well above the 50% rate that U.S. regulators have said they want to see before approving a COVID-19 vaccine for use.  WHAT ARE EFFICACY NUMBERS?  If a vaccine has an efficacy of, say, 80%, it means that if 100 people who have not previously been infected by the coronavirus are given the vaccine, on average 80 of them will not get the disease that the virus causes: COVID-19. These rates relate to vaccines administered and monitored in controlled circumstances, such as clinical trials.  DOES THAT MEAN AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S PROTECTION LEVEL IS THE SAME?  No. A person immunised with a vaccine that has, say, 80% efficacy is very likely to be protected from getting the disease with symptoms, especially severe ones.  They are also very likely to be protected from asymptomatic disease - but this, depending on the vaccine, may be less certain.  Even with 95% efficacy, there is no absolute guarantee of protection for any particular individual.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN THE REAL WORLD?  There is a difference between efficacy rates obtained in clinical trials and effectiveness - the real-world protection rate of a vaccine when it is rolled out.  \u201cEfficacy says: \u2018Does it work?\u2019. Effectiveness says: \u2018Can it be applied? Can you carry the efficacy to the people?\u2019,\u201d said Marcel Tanner, an epidemiologist and president of Switzerland\u2019s Academies of Arts and Sciences.  In the real world, a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness can be influenced by multiple, unpredictable factors including, for example: the rate of spread of a virus; how many, or few, people adhere to the optimum dosing schedule and timetable; how individuals\u2019 immune systems respond; whether the vaccine was stored at the correct temperature; whether people know, or don\u2019t know, if they\u2019ve been exposed before.  Generally, a vaccine\u2019s real-world effectiveness tends to be slightly lower than its efficacy.  WILL THESE VACCINES STOP THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC?  Experts say this is unlikely. More realistic, they say, is that we will have to live alongside the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  Evidence so far suggests that COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna and AstraZeneca will help stop people developing the disease. Only AstraZeneca\u2019s data, so far, shows signs that its shot may also help prevent transmission of the virus.  \u201cProtection against illness has a value for an individual,\u201d said Penny Ward,\u201d a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King\u2019s College London. She added, however, that vaccines that do not prevent transmission will not halt the pandemic.  \u201cUntil the vaccination and other measures result in the virus being close to elimination in any particular country, and worldwide, there will still be a need for distancing, masks and hand washing to reduce transmission further than will be achieved by the vaccine alone,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  \u201c(A) vaccine is no good until people are vaccinated, and even then, it will not result in a situation where all other protective measures can be immediately abandoned.\u201d","1446":"(Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to content of story)  OTTAWA, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Canada will be getting some doses of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine earlier than scheduled and is on track to inoculate the entire population by the end of September, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Sunday briefly acknowledged losing the U.S. election in a morning Twitter post but then backtracked, saying he concedes \u201cnothing\u201d and vowing to keep up a court fight that election-law experts say is unlikely to succeed.  President-elect Joe Biden focused on the coronavirus pandemic, setting meetings with vaccine developers as the crisis intensifies. The number of U.S. coronavirus cases passed 11 million on Sunday, a million more new cases than a week ago and the fastest increase since the pandemic began.  Biden defeated Trump in the Nov. 3 election by the same 306-232 margin in the state-by-state Electoral College that Trump proclaimed a \u201clandslide\u201d when he won it in 2016. The Democratic former vice president also won the national popular vote by at least 5.5 million votes, or 3.6 percentage points, with some ballots still being counted.  Trump, pursuing long-shot litigation to contest election results in several states, made conflicting comments on Twitter. He initially appeared to admit for the first time publicly that Biden won, then reversed course. Trump also repeated unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.  \u201cHe won because the Election was Rigged,\u201d Trump wrote, not referring to Biden by name, adding a list of complaints about vote counting. About 90 minutes later, Trump wrote: \u201cHe only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING!\u201d  After golfing at a club he owns in Virginia, Trump said on Twitter he would soon file \u201cbig cases showing the unconstitutionality of the 2020 Election.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the results in multiple states, without success.  Legal experts have said the Trump litigation stands little chance of altering the election\u2019s outcome, and election officials of both parties have said there is no evidence of major irregularities.  \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed doesn\u2019t make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that,\u201d Ron Klain, Biden\u2019s choice as White House chief of staff, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d  More than a week after Biden was declared the victor by major news organizations based on state-by-state vote counts, the General Services Administration still has not recognized him as president-elect, preventing his team from gaining access to government office space and funding normally afforded to an incoming administration to ensure a smooth transition.  Without explicitly mentioning the transition, Trump praised the GSA administrator he appointed, Emily Murphy, writing on Twitter: \u201cGreat job Emily!\u201d  Klain said Murphy\u2019s agency must formally recognize Biden, saying it is critical to ensure the president-elect receives intelligence briefings before taking office and to facilitate coordination with the White House coronavirus task force.

Some congressional Republicans and former members of Trump\u2019s administration have also called on the White House to allow Biden\u2019s transition team access to more information to prepare to govern.  VACCINE CHALLENGE The health crisis will be a paramount concern for Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. Klain said Biden's scientific advisers would meet with Pfizer Inc PFE.N and other drugmakers starting this week to prepare for the \"giant logistical project\" of widespread vaccination against a virus that has killed more than 245,000 Americans and thrown millions more out of work.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Pfizer said last week its vaccine candidate proved more than 90% effective in initial trials, giving hope that widespread vaccination in the coming months could help get the pandemic under control.  Other companies also are in advanced stages of developing promising vaccines.  \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a vaccine, but vaccines don\u2019t save lives.

Biden\u2019s campaign said it had raised $10.5 million of its target of $30 million for a \u201cBiden Fight Fund\u201d aimed at election defense efforts, according to a fundraising plea sent on Sunday.  A laborious hand recount is under way in Georgia, where Biden has been projected the winner and holds a lead of more than 14,000 votes. Patrick Moore, a Biden campaign legal adviser, said the recount had so far shifted vote totals \u201calmost imperceptibly,\u201d and in Biden\u2019s favor, and there had been no evidence of widespread irregularities.  Control of the U.S. Senate will be decided by two January runoff elections in Georgia, which will be important for the fate of Biden\u2019s ambitious legislative agenda.

REUTERS\/Andrew Kelly\/  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday that a third patient had to be hospitalized after being treated with its experimental gene therapy for a rare degenerative muscular condition, but said the safety profile still supports launching a larger late-stage trial of the treatment.  The drugmaker also said the gene therapy provided statistically significant improvements in the nine boys treated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in its phase 1b clinical trial and called the treatment a potential breakthrough for the disease. The company said, overall, the boys showed an improvement in their ambulatory abilities as well as potential improvements in muscle fiber health.  DMD is a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder, which affects about one in 3,500-5,000 male births worldwide, causes severe progressive muscle loss and premature death.  Pfizer\u2019s treatment is one of a number of gene therapies being developed for the disease, including a treatment developed by biotechnology company Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. Some analysts have suggested that the Sarepta gene therapy looks to have better safety profile in early trials than Pfizer\u2019s.  Pfizer said it hopes to launch its phase 3 trial within a few months, around the same time Sarepta hopes to launch its own phase 3 trial, which has been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Pfizer says all three patients who had serious adverse events in the trial had recovered within two weeks.  The company disclosed the first two hospitalizations in the trial last year. All three were among six patients given a higher dose of the treatment, a dosage level that Pfizer plans to continue in the next phase of the trial.  Michael Binks, vice president of rare disease clinical research at Pfizer, said three more patients that were not included in the phase 1b trial have since been dosed and none of them have required hospitalization. He said the company is learning how to better mange the response to the treatment.  \u201cWe have ability to monitor very closely through this period of five to 10 days after the administration to make sure that any changes are picked up very early,\u201d Binks said. \u201cAnd we think that\u2019s a manageable program to take forward into pivotal trials and even for commercialization,\u201d he said, noting that the gene therapy is a once-in-a-lifetime treatment for a life threatening disease.","1457":"FILE PHOTO: European Union flags flutter outside the European Commission headquarters, where Brexit talks are taking place, in Brussels, Belgium, December 24, 2020.

Both companies had applied for approval of their vaccines after Pfizer.  India\u2019s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation had declined to accept Pfizer\u2019s request for approval without a small local trial on the vaccine\u2019s safety and immunogenicity for Indians, Reuters has reported.

There are, however, provisions under India\u2019s New Drugs and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, to waive such trials in certain conditions.

Life won\u2019t ever be the same as it was before Covid-19, but it will feel a whole lot better than now.\u201d  \u201cFor the foreseeable future - and maybe forever - we are very unlikely to reach the situation we are in with smallpox (gone), polio (almost gone), or measles (controlled in populations with high enough vaccine coverage). Instead, we are going to need to find ways to fairly happily live alongside this virus.\u201d  ANDREW HILL, SENIOR VISITING RESEARCH FELLOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL  \u201cWith 450 people dying of COVID-19 infection every day in the UK, the benefits of rapid vaccine approval outweigh the potential risks. However, we need new independent clinical trials to monitor long-term safety and efficacy.\u201d  FRENCH PRIME MINISTER JEAN CASTEX told BFM TV that a European decision was expected towards the end of December.  \u201cFrom what I know, it\u2019s due in the days ahead, more likely towards the end of December than the beginning.\u201d  \u201cI will never take the risk of vaccinating people without the having approval to put (the vaccine) on the market by the competent authorities.\u201d  JAMES ATHEY, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR AT ABERDEEN STANDARD INVESTMENTS:  \u201cIncoming news surrounding the development and distribution of COVID vaccinations continues to be unequivocally positive, and subsequently, is being cheered and welcomed by financial markets that are desperate for good news.\u201d  \u201cThis morning\u2019s announcement that vaccination in the UK could begin as early as next week saw further gains for sterling following yesterday\u2019s strong performance following the Times Radio report that Brexit negotiations have entered the final and crucial stage. However, these gains have been stopped in their tracks by a subsequent headline suggesting that EU negotiator Michel Barnier has told EU ambassadors that there may not be a Brexit deal after all.\u201d  SYLVAIN GOYON, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY AT ODDO BHF IN PARIS:  \u201cStock market reactions following the Pfizer and Moderna announcements already reflect bets of a rapid normalization. To this extent the UK registration is somewhat already priced in\u201d  MIKE BELL, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT J.P.

The country\u2019s medical regulator was one of the first in the world to complete a comprehensive approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday, noting it was a year since the first local coronavirus case was detected.  Vaccination of priority groups with the Pfizer vaccine is expected to begin in late February at 80,000 doses per week, Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters.  Pfizer had told the Australian government it anticipated continuous supply but would provide global production guidance \u201cin mid-February for March and beyond on a weekly basis,\u201d he said.  The Australian rollout update comes after AstraZeneca Plc told European Union officials on Friday it would cut deliveries of its vaccine to the bloc by 60% in the first quarter due to production problems.  Hunt said AstraZeneca had advised Australia the company has \u201chad a significant supply shock and so that means we won\u2019t have as much of that AstraZeneca international in March as they had previously promised\u201d.  The AstraZeneca vaccine is yet to be approved by Australia, which expects to start CSL\u2019s domestic supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March, earlier than planned, at 1 million doses a week, he said.  \u201cThe decision to pay a premium for an onshore, secure, sovereign vaccine manufacturing capacity via CSL, that puts Australia in a vastly more secure position than almost any other country in the world,\u201d Hunt said.  Australia has set a target of 4 million vaccine doses by April. It has also committed to supplying vaccines to Pacific Island nations on a later timetable.  The Pfizer vaccine has been provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration\u2019s (TGA) for Australians aged 16 years and over.  Australia will administer the two doses of the vaccine to each recipient at the recommended time.  Quarantine and border personnel, frontline health workers and aged care and disability staff and residents will be the first group to receive vaccines.  There have been no new cases of community transmission in Australia in the past seven days, and there are no Australians with coronavirus in hospital intensive care units. Hunt contrasted this with six million cases globally in the last 10 days and 125,000 lives lost.

To ensure that remained the case, Australia on Monday suddenly suspended its travel bubble with New Zealand for 72 hours and ordered all those who had arrived since Jan. 14 to isolate and be tested, after New Zealand confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in the community in months.  \u201cThis will be done out of an abundance of caution whilst more is learned about the event and the case,\u201d Hunt told reporters later in the day.  Australia has had just under 28,800 cases in the past year, the overwhelming majority in Victoria state, and 909 deaths.","1482":"(Reuters) - Britain began the mass-vaccination of its population against COVID-19 on Tuesday, becoming the first Western nation to do so in a global endeavour that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history.

FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Coronavirus COVID-19 Vaccine\" sticker and a medical syringe in front of displayed Pfizer logo in this illustration taken, October 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The drugmakers said their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to become infected with the coronavirus.  The efficacy rate means that the overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine.  The 44,000-volunteer study was initially designed for a first interim analysis of whether the vaccine was working after 32 participants developed COVID-19.  Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer\u2019s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in an interview the companies changed the study plan after discussions with U.S. regulators and ultimately ended up with data on 94 people.  \u201cIt gives you more power and more confidence,\u201d said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. \u201cWhen you triple the numbers and you get a large difference between them, it\u2019s much more likely to be real.\u201d  Others cautioned that many questions remain, including whether the vaccine can prevent severe disease or complications, how long it will protect against infection and how well it will work in the elderly.  They noted that required safety data will not be available until later this month. In addition, Pfizer and BioNTech have yet to submit their data for peer review by other scientists, a key step in determining the quality of the results.  \u2018REALLY ENCOURAGING\u2019 BUT EARLY  \u201cThese are really encouraging but they are the earliest of results possible,\u201d said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The full study is designed to show the vaccine is effective after 164 people fall ill. Pfizer said that may happen in the first or second week of December, when a panel of outside advisors to the Food and Drug Administration reviews the study results and decides whether to recommend authorizing its use.  Gruber said he did not yet have a breakdown of how many of the first 94 infections occurred among Black or Latino participants, two communities hit hard by the disease. He also did he know exactly how many elderly people in the trial got sick. Older people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19  So far, none of the 94 people in the initial analysis developed severe COVID-19. The FDA initially had requested that the interim data include at least five severe cases, but recently relaxed that requirement, Gruber said.  \u201cIf a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University.  Gruber expects there will be some cases of severe disease before the trial ends.  \u201cBottom line is we\u2019re going to have to use the data we have and the high efficacy to give us confidence that we\u2019re going to prevent severe infection,\u201d he said.  Scientists also want to understand whether the Pfizer vaccine fully prevents people from getting infected with the new coronavirus - a huge advantage in reducing transmission - or if it simply reduces the degree to which they become ill.  \u201cIdeally, we want to be able to completely protect from infection, but I think we all accept that these so-called first generation vaccines are more likely to prevent disease,\u201d said Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain\u2019s University of Warwick. \u201cAnd the subtlety there, which is important, is if you\u2019re infected then you can still transmit the virus.\u201d  Pfizer intends to seek a broad approval for individuals aged 16 to 85, but the FDA and an advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would make decisions about who should be first in line to get the initial doses, which will be scarce.  If Pfizer wins emergency use authorization, Gruber said the company feels ethically bound to inform eligible trial participants who received a placebo that they are not protected against infection, and to offer them the vaccine in hopes of keeping them from dropping out of the trial.","1490":"FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen outside a doctors surgery that is delivering the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a surgery in Wolverhampton, Britain December 14, 2020.

Every vial of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was expected to include five doses, but GPs found it was possible to make six doses out of the vials, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported late on Thursday.  The National Health Service (NHS) confirmed to Reuters that in a weekly webinar with NHS England on Thursday, clinicians were told they could use the sixth dose \u201cat their discretion\u201d.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) did not respond to a request for comment. The Telegraph reported that the British regulator was looking at the feasibility of getting six vaccines out of the vials and was consulting with NHS England.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had said on Wednesday that extra doses from vials of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine can be used after reports of vaccine doses being thrown away by pharmacists due to labelling confusion.  The Pfizer vials are supposed to hold five doses, according to the labelling, but media reports said pharmacists had found a way for a sixth or even a seventh dose. Without clear approval from the manufacturer, the extra dose had to be discarded.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech shot, the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by Western drugs regulators, is being rolled out in countries including Britain and the United States, and is expected to be approved for use in the European Union next week.  Pfizer will request for an approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in Japan on Friday, according to Kyodo News.  Britain became the first country in the world to deploy Pfizer\u2019s vaccine earlier this month.","1491":"BRUSSELS\/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The EU\u2019s campaign to vaccinate Europeans against COVID-19 has got off to an uneven start in what will be a marathon effort to administer shots to enough of the bloc\u2019s 450 million people to defeat the viral pandemic.  Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine are prepared at the Rene-Muret hospital in Sevran, on the outskirts of Paris, France, December 27, 2020. Thomas Samson\/Pool via REUTERS  In one mishap, eight workers at a care home in Stralsund on the north German coast were injected with five times the recommended dose of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech. Four were hospitalised.  \u201cI deeply regret the incident. This individual case is due to individual errors. I hope that all those affected do not experience any serious side effects,\u201d district chief Stefan Kerth said on Monday.  In southern Germany, officials had to send back about 1,000 doses after finding they had been transported in cool boxes typically used for picnics or camping trips that failed to keep the vaccine cold enough.  The EU vaccination drive kicked off at the weekend, with health workers and residents of care homes across the bloc among the first to get the shots from Pfizer, which must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures.  In Italy, meanwhile, some politicians complained that Germany - the EU\u2019s largest member state and home to BioNTech - may be getting more than its fair share of shots.  The EU is due to receive its first 12.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine by New Year\u2019s Day, with distribution of 200 million doses across its 27 member countries to be completed by next September. The vaccine course requires two doses.  A spokesman for Pfizer declined to comment on specific schedules or whether the timeline indicated by the Commission represented a delay. \u201cOur timelines are aspirational and can shift based on capacity and manufacturing timelines,\u201d he said.  Talks are under way to agree on the delivery of an optional further 100 million doses under the contract sealed with the two companies, the EU said.  KEEPING COOL  The initial glitches highlight the challenge in rolling out the vaccine while regulators consider approving other vaccines, including from Moderna and AstraZeneca, which are easier to transport and store.  The rollout of the Pfizer shot in the United States has been slow, putting the government\u2019s target of 20 million vaccinations this month in doubt, as hospitals navigate preparing the previously frozen shots for use, finding staff to run clinics and ensuring proper social distancing.  As well as being the first COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered across the EU, the Pfizer shot is particularly tricky to handle. For long-term storage it needs to be deep frozen at about minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit).  It can be defrosted for a few days before being used, but even then must be kept chilled at between 2C and 8C.  In southern Germany, officials said they would not use some shots after temperature trackers in cool boxes showed they may not have been kept cold enough.  \u201cThere were doubts as to whether the cold chain was maintained at all times,\u201d said Christian Meissner, district administrator in the Bavarian town of Lichtenfels.  \u201cBioNTech said that the vaccine was probably okay, but \u2018probably okay\u2019 is not enough,\u201d he told Reuters TV.  The lapse happened after the doses were handed over to the local authorities. BioNTech declined to comment.  In Spain, delivery of a new batch from Pfizer was held up by a day to Tuesday due to a temperature issue that has now been resolved, Health Minister Salvador Illa said.  Maria Asuncion Ojeda, a resident at Madrid\u2019s Ballesol Parque Almansa nursing home, was still delighted to be an early recipient of the Pfizer vaccine.  \u201cI wanted to do it because it\u2019s the only way we can solve this problem,\u201d the 87-year-old said on Monday, a day after Spain began vaccinating care-home residents and their staff.  FAIR SHARES  The EU is distributing jointly procured vaccines on a pro-rata basis to the 27 member states based on their populations, while some European countries have also made their own deals to buy extra doses separately.  In Italy, some politicians said Germany appeared to be getting more than its fair share, at least during the highly symbolic initial rollout.  \u201cThe accounts don\u2019t add up,\u201d Italian virologist Roberto Burioni said on Twitter, pointing to reports in Germany that first-day deliveries had totalled more than 150,000 doses while other EU countries got just 10,000.  An official familiar with vaccine distribution in Germany said that each of the 16 German federal states had received 10,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine ahead of the weekend start of the inoculation drive.  An Italian reporter asked about the supplies at a German government news conference. An official from the German health ministry replied that Berlin had signed a separate deal for 30 million extra doses of the Pfizer vaccine.","1492":"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Muscovites from high-risk groups such as healthcare workers began registering for jabs of a Russian-made COVID-19 vaccine on Friday, two days after President Vladimir Putin called for large-scale vaccinations.

Interim trials showed it is 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19.  Mass testing for the second Russian vaccine, EpiVacCorona, began on Monday.  The online registration service allows Moscow residents in specified high-risk jobs and aged between 18 and 60 to book free vaccination appointments at 70 points around the city, starting from Saturday, the mayor\u2019s website said.  \u201cOver the first five hours, 5,000 people signed up for the jab - teachers, doctors, social workers, those who are today risking their health and lives the most,\u201d Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote on his personal website.  \u201cFor other Moscow residents, free vaccination will become available later,\u201d the website said.  Moscow has a total population of nearly 13 million.  Kirill Dmitriev, head of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund which is backing the development and marketing of Sputnik V, told the BBC on Friday that Russia expected to vaccinate around two million people in December.  CONCERNS  Scientists have raised concerns about the speed at which Moscow has worked, giving the regulatory go-ahead for its vaccines and launching mass vaccinations before full trials to test its safety and efficacy had been completed.  Russia has agreed production and supply deals with a number of foreign countries, but the European Union raised concerns when Hungary said it planned to import and possibly use Sputnik V as the vaccine had not been reviewed by the European Medicines Agency.  Britain is preparing in the coming days to launch its own mass innoculation programme after becoming the first country worldwide to approve Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.  Russia is currently developing 10 vaccines, TASS news agency cited Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, as saying on Thursday.  The decision to take part in Russia\u2019s vaccine trials is voluntary, authorities say, but some public sector workers have told Reuters of pressure to take part.  The views of Muscovites on the new vaccination campaign were mixed.  \u201cI like it because this is a chance to turn the tide, to reduce the infection rate,\u201d said one resident, Igor Krivobokov.  Others were more sceptical.  \u201cThis process will take a long time. Only a small amount of the vaccine has been produced,\u201d said Sergei Grishin, adding that he did not plan to get the jab himself.  Russia has so far recorded 2,402,949 COVID-19 infections, taking fourth place globally behind only the United States, India and Brazil. It has confirmed 42,176 deaths.  Russia reported 27,403 new coronavirus cases on Friday, but has resisted imposing lockdowns during the second wave of the virus, preferring targeted regional curbs, to cushion the impact on its struggling economy.","1493":"TOKYO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The minister overseeing Japan\u2019s vaccination programme, Taro Kono, said on Tuesday the European Union has approved the first shipment of Pfizer Inc\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine to Japan.

Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, which was shown to be more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on initial data, must be shipped and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (minus 94\u00b0F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46\u00b0F).  \u201cWe are hopeful that results from this vaccine delivery pilot will serve as the model for other U.S. states and international governments, as they prepare to implement effective COVID-19 vaccine programs,\u201d Pfizer said in a statement on Monday.  It picked Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico, and Tennessee for the program after taking into account their differences in overall size, diversity of populations, immunization infrastructure, and need to reach individuals in varied urban and rural settings.  The four states will not receive vaccine doses earlier than other states by virtue of the pilot, nor will they receive any differential consideration, Pfizer said.  The company expects to have enough safety data on the vaccine from the ongoing large scale late-stage trials by the third week of November before proceeding to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA).  Pfizer and its partner BioNTech SE 22UAy.F have a $1.95 billion deal to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to the U.S. government, which has an option to acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.  Earlier on Monday, rival Moderna Inc MRNA.O said its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, boosting hopes that vaccines against the disease may be ready for use soon.

The companies said the vaccine was more than 90% effective and they have so far found no serious safety concerns, priming it for possible speedy regulatory approvals.  Pfizer expects to seek broad U.S. emergency use authorisation in the U.S. of the vaccine for people aged 16 to 85 in coming weeks.  To do so, it will need to have collected two months of safety follow-up data on around half of the study\u2019s roughly 44,000 participants, expected in late November.  Pfizer and BioNTech, which already collaborate to develop mRNA-based vaccines for influenza, currently expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine in 2020 - enough to protect 25 million people - and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  Below are the main details of the vaccine and Pfizer\u2019s progress on supply deals and potential approvals:  TYPE  - The vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2, is based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines  DOSAGE AND EXPECTED COST  - Based on the supply deal with the United States, the price tag amounts to $39 for what is likely to be a two-dose course of treatment.  - Pfizer has said it will not charge other developed countries a lower price for the vaccine than what the United States will pay.  - BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin said he was optimistic the immunisation effect of the vaccine would last for a year although that was not certain yet.  DATA AND REGULATORY TIMELINE  - U.S. FDA granted the vaccine a \u2018fast track\u2019 status in mid-July and the vaccine showed promise in second early trial.  - The company has said it could file for emergency approval in the United States in November.  - Pfizer signed a deal worth up to $750 million with BioNTech in March to co-develop the potential vaccine, and target clinical trials in April.  - Testing of vaccine began in the United States in May after trials started in Germany the previous month.","1499":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission issued civil subpoenas to Johnson and Johnson in June as part of an investigation into whether contracting practices for its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, violated antitrust laws, the company said in a regulatory filing on Monday.

Pfizer Inc filed a lawsuit against J&J in 2017, saying its rival\u2019s contracts with health insurers for blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, were anticompetitive and aimed at blocking sales of Pfizer\u2019s biosimilar called Inflectra.  Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J had contracted with many insurers to give discounts in exchange for giving preference to Remicade, and to only pay for Inflectra in cases where Remicade proved to be ineffective. Inflectra was approved in 2016 while Remicade went on the market in 1998.  Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the lawsuit.  J&J has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting the Pfizer lawsuit.  Pfizer said in a statement that it had received a CID in June.  \u201cAs Pfizer\u2019s complaint alleges, J&J\u2019s unlawful conduct is designed to prevent Inflectra from being able to compete on its primary point of differentiation \u2013 price.

FILE PHOTO: An employee in personal protective equipment (PPE) removes vials of AstraZeneca's COVISHIELD, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine from a visual inspection machine inside a lab at Serum Institute of India, in Pune, India, November 30, 2020.REUTERS\/Francis Mascarenhas  Pfizer, with partner BioNTech SE, and rival Moderna have released trial data showing their COVID-19 vaccines to be about 95% effective at preventing the illness, while AstraZeneca last month said its vaccine was on average about 70% effective.  The companies have said distribution could begin almost immediately after any approval, with governments around the world to decide who gets them and in what order. The following is an outline of the process:  WHEN WILL COMPANIES ROLL OUT A VACCINE?  Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already started manufacturing their vaccines, and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be rolled out from early next week in Britain.  This year, Pfizer said it would have enough to inoculate 25 million people, Moderna will have enough for 10 million people and AstraZeneca will have enough for more than 100 million people.  The U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will manage distribution in the United States, with some 20 million people expected to be inoculated by the end of the year.  Some 60 million to 70 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine could be available per month beginning in January and most Americans will have access to shots by mid-2021, the government said on Tuesday.  In the European Union, it is up to each country in the 27-member bloc to start distributing vaccines to their populations.  WHO WOULD GET AN APPROVED VACCINE AND WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES?  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will make a decision on emergency use authorization on the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine in days or weeks after a panel of outside advisors meets on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to recommend it. The FDA often but not always follows the panel\u2019s advice.  Upon FDA authorization, the CDC is planning that first in line for vaccinations would be about 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents in long-term care facilities.  Essential workers, a group of 87 million people who do crucial jobs that cannot be done from home, are the likely next group. This includes firefighters, police, school employees, transport workers, food and agriculture workers and food service employees.  Around 100 million adults with high-risk medical conditions and 53 million adults over the age of 65, also considered at higher risk of severe disease, are the next priority.  U.S. public health officials said vaccines would be generally available to most Americans in pharmacies, clinics and doctors offices starting in April so that anyone who wants a shot can have one by the end of June.  It is unclear when a vaccine will be available for children. Pfizer and BioNTech have started testing their vaccine in volunteers as young as 12.  WHEN WILL A VACCINE BE AVAILABLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES?  Britain will start a roll-out of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine this month. The country had ordered 40 million doses - enough for just under a third of the population.  Older care home residents and their carers will be the highest priority to receive the vaccine, followed by those over 80 years of age and frontline health workers.  The European Union (EU), Japan, Canada and Australia are all running rapid vaccine regulatory processes.  The EU drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, said it could give conditional marketing approval for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine by Dec. 29 and make a decision on Moderna\u2019s by Jan. 12.  Most countries in the region have said the first vaccines would go to the elderly and vulnerable and frontline workers.  Many of AstraZeneca\u2019s doses this year are expected to go to Britain, where health officials have said that if approved they could begin vaccinating people in December.  Countries say they are buying vaccines via the European Commission\u2019s joint procurement scheme, which has deals for six different vaccines and nearly 2 billion doses.  Delivery timelines vary and most countries are still drawing up plans for distributing and administering shots.  Italy expects to receive the first deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and AstraZeneca\u2019s shot early next year. Spain plans to give vaccines in January.  Hungary\u2019s foreign minister said doses would land in the spring at the earliest.  Germany, home to BioNTech, expects to roll out shots in early 2021 with mass vaccination centres in exhibition halls, airport terminals and concert venues. It will also use mobile teams for care homes.  WHEN WILL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINES?  COVAX, a programme led by the World Health Organization and the GAVI vaccine group to pool funds from wealthier countries and non-profits to buy and distribute vaccines to dozens of poorer countries, has raised $2 billion.  Its first goal is to vaccinate 3% of the people in these countries with a final goal of reaching 20%. It has signed a provisional agreement to buy AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, which does not require storage in specialized ultra cold equipment like the Pfizer vaccine.  It is expected, but not certain, that less wealthy countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, such as India, will receive vaccines at low or no cost under this programme in 2021. Other countries, such as those in Latin America, may buy vaccines through COVAX. Several are also striking supply deals directly with drugmakers.  HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?  Vaccine makers and governments have negotiated varying prices, not all of which are public. Governments have paid from a few dollars per AstraZeneca shot to up to $50 for the two-dose Pfizer regimen. Many countries have said they will cover the cost of inoculating their residents.","1514":"FILE PHOTO: Syringes are seen in front of displayed Biontech and Pfizer logos in this illustration taken November 10, 2020.

Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first drugmakers to release successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine.  Chile has a deal to buy 10 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and also to purchase 14.4 million doses from AstraZeneca, and 60 million over three years from Sinovac, both of whom are testing for COVID-19 vaccines in the country. It has also signed up for 7.6 million doses through the global vaccine distribution scheme COVAX, co-led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the WHO.  The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks and produced at more rapid scale than conventional vaccines.  Chilean science minister Andres Couve told Reuters the deal with Pfizer had a delivery schedule starting from next year but added the use of messenger RNA was an emerging and modern technology, and therefore must be analyzed very carefully.

The special regulatory approval on Wednesday will allow South Korea to receive 117,000 doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine via the COVAX global vaccine sharing scheme around mid-February, drug safety minister Kim Gang-lip told a news conference.  The country has yet to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, but gave the regulatory clearance for emergency imports so it can kick off inoculation campaigns later this month, starting with about 50,000 frontline health workers.  The government had said it will inoculate about 10 million high-risk people by July and aim to reach herd immunity levels by November.

The government has lined up cold storage facilities with temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48\u00b0F), said V.K. Paul, who heads the group of experts on vaccine administration for COVID-19 that advises India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Paul said these preparations meet the requirements of what he said were the four emerging candidates in the race for India\u2019s vaccine.  \u201cThe four that I can see, including Serum, Bharat, Zydus, and Sputnik need normal cold chain. I see no problem for these vaccines,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  Serum Institute of India, the world\u2019s largest vaccine maker, is already mass producing and stockpiling AstraZeneca\u2019s Covishield shot, while Indian biotech players Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila are developing their own vaccine candidates.  And last month, Indian pharmaceutical player Hetero inked a deal with Russia\u2019s RDIF to manufacture over 100 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine per year in India.  The government expects the first approvals \u201cvery soon\u201d from the independent drug regulator for emergency use, he said.  \u201cI am hoping at the earliest because we are ready.\u201d  The government, however, was yet to have formal talks on pricing and had no firm purchase orders, he said.  \u201cThe Indian companies know the government will give a fair and reasonable price.\u201d  SUPPLIES AND STORAGE  At present, Indian regulators are considering three vaccines for emergency use authorisation, including those from Pfizer Inc , AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech.  But, Pfizer\u2019s limited stockpiles and its extreme storage condition requirements at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, would likely limit its use in India, which lacks such infrastructure.  \u201cIn a theoretical scenario, where there is no vaccine with conventional cold chain requirement, minus 70 degrees Celsius capacities will have to be created, and we will do so,\u201d Paul said.  Paul said the government is also in talks with Moderna , which also has requirements for ultra-cold storage.  India does not anticipate supplies from either Pfizer or Moderna until the second half of next year, said Paul.  \u201cWe would like to work with them (Moderna) to make that vaccine available in India, and (ensure) that vaccine is also manufactured in India - for us and for other countries. This is the call we have given to Pfizer also and we are in touch with them as well.\u201d  Paul said India may still consider granting Pfizer emergency use authorisation, despite it not having conducted safety and immune response trials in India, but said that decision would be taken by the drugs regulator.  \u201cAs of now, it is a norm or standard operating procedure that any vaccine marketed in India should have human study results from the Indian subjects,\u201d he said.  India has the world\u2019s second highest caseload of coronavirus behind the United States, but its death rate has been far lower.  Still, Paul said the immediate task was to protect lives and the government had prepared a plan to administer vaccines to 300 million people - or 600 million doses at two jabs each - in the first part of the programme.  This would be made up of 260 million people above the age of 50, an estimated 10 million below the age of 50 with serious co-morbidities and 30 million frontline workers, who have borne the brunt of infections.  \u201cThe way it looks as of now, optimistically, it appears possible to cover the above population of 300 million in six to eight months\u2019 time.\u201d","1521":"FRANKFURT, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s coronavirus vaccination campaign faced delays in several cities on Sunday after medical staff found potential irregularities in the cooling of the shot produced by BioNTech and Pfizer .

The Pfizer vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112\u00b0F) to remain effective before being shipped to distribution centres.  Pfizer has designed special shipping containers filled with dry ice to keep the vaccine from spoiling while in transit. Shots can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months, or for five days at 2C to 8C \u2013 a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals.  Besides Lichtenfels, the northern Bavarian cities of Coburg, Kronach, Kulmbach, Hof, Bayreuth and Wunsiedel also held off from inoculating people after uncertainty arose about whether the cold chain had been maintained.  \u201cVaccination against the coronavirus is not about who vaccinates the fastest or who does the most doses.

FILE PHOTO: Military personnel carry boxes of Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine after arriving at a warehouse in Colmenar Viejo, Spain, December 29, 2020. Moncloa Palace\/Pool via Reuters  Some 82,834 people in Spain have received the first dose of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine so far, health minister Salvador Illa told reporters on Monday.  \u201cWe have received the third shipment of the vaccine... and hope to reach cruising pace in our vaccination campaign in the coming weeks,\u201d Illa said, adding that the objective was to have between 15 and 20 million Spaniards vaccinated by May-June.  \u201cWe still recommend administering the vaccine\u2019s second dose in the period indicated by BioNTech-Pfizer,\u201d Illa noted. The United Kingdom recently opted to use up its vaccine stock to give more people a single inoculation, a strategy Germany is also studying.  The vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech cleared EU regulatory hurdles on Dec. 21 and vaccinations began on Dec. 27, but the process has been slow and cumbersome, prompting criticism in several member states including Germany and France.  In Spain, the vaccination campaign has been partially interrupted by a long New Year weekend, with many health sector workers still on holiday and some nursing home residents away visiting relatives. Several regions also complained of delays in receiving the vaccines last week.  \u201cIt has been quite disappointing and worrying. It was the perfect opportunity to give a boost to the fight against the virus and to set an example,\u201d Quique Bassat, an epidemiologist and researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Heath, told Reuters.  Echoing such frustration, French officials urged a faster rate of vaccinations on Monday, while Germany\u2019s health minister has come under fire over a shortage of vaccines there and the slow inoculation campaign.  With health a regional government competence in Spain, many regions have not published their own data yet, although Illa gave the first nationally compiled data today.  REGIONAL VARIATIONS  However, a compilation of the more granular data available in some of Spain\u2019s most populous areas shows the number of shots administered during the week was much lower than the 350,000 doses shipped, with big differences between regions.  Madrid had only vaccinated over 3,000 people as of Saturday from the 48,000 doses it received, while in Catalonia, where 60,000 vaccines are sent every week, only 8,293 people have been vaccinated so far.  The northwestern region of Galicia had vaccinated 9,500 people as of Sunday, about half of the 18,000 vaccines the region is due to receive each week. In the Canary Islands, 4,593 people had been inoculated by Saturday, 30% of people targeted in the first phase, using a third of their weekly doses.  \u201cSome regions have performed reasonably well ... others have been slower. There is a gap and it causes us a certain degree of frustration,\u201d doctor Amos Garcia Rojas, head of the Spanish Association of Vaccinology, told Reuters.  Madrid regional health official Enrique Ruiz Escudero said they intend to accelerate to administering 24,000 shots a week, while the rest of their weekly stock would be used as a second dose.  Catalan regional authorities, which plan to give shots to 748,000 of its 7.5 million inhabitants within 12 weeks, have pledged to give inoculations every day of the week to accelerate the process.  \u201cWe are confident we can achieve this,\u201d Josep Maria Argimon, Catalonia\u2019s regional head of public health, told a news conference.  With holiday season not over in Spain until after Epiphany day on Wednesday, some experts remained wary.  \u201cIt is incomprehensible that there are not enough staff and resources to continue to vaccinate every day. I think this is a big scandal,\u201d Manuel Perez-Alonso, Professor of Genetics at the University of Valencia, wrote on Twitter.","1530":"(Adds background)  BRUSSELS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - European Union countries could begin coronavirus inoculations as soon as this year, the head of the European Commission said on Tuesday.

After possible approval by the EU regulator, the European Commission is expected to formally approve the Pfizer vaccine within three days, after consultations with the 27 EU governments.  Commission decisions on approvals of medicines usually follow the EMA\u2019s recommendations.

European Council President Charles Michel, who represents the 27 EU member states\u2019 governments, said late on Tuesday he would call a video-conference summit before the end of January to discuss the \u201ctremendous\u201d vaccination challenge they face.  The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive, has signed six supply deals with vaccine makers for nearly 2 billion doses to be distributed on a pro-rata basis to members states based on their populations.  Of those, only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for use so far. The European Medicines Agency recommended on Wednesday the approval of the Moderna vaccine.  The European Commission this week defended its strategy, saying it had been important not to put all its eggs in one basket when various vaccines were still at development stage.  \u201cWe always knew that it would be a complex operation and this is precisely why the European Commission was so adamant that it was important that we could sign contracts with different companies,\u201d spokesman Eric Mamer said on Wednesday.  The German government is facing criticism at home for not ensuring greater supplies of the vaccine developed by Germany\u2019s BioNTech and U.S. company Pfizer.  However, in September it reached a bilateral deal - separate from the EU\u2019s contracts - for an additional 30 million doses, German officials said.  The European Commission said that EU countries committed not to conduct parallel talks with vaccine makers, but declined to comment on whether Germany had a separate deal with BioNTech.  Separately, Karl Lauterbach, an epidemiologist and lawmaker with German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Social Democrat coalition partners, accused France of trying to influence the EU\u2019s clutch of contracts in favour of a vaccine being developed by France\u2019s Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline.  \u201cFrance took care that not too much German vaccine was purchased in relation to the French vaccine,\u201d he told German TV on Monday. \u201cI do believe that other issues rather than purely health-related matters played a role here.\u201d  Echoing him, Germany\u2019s biggest tabloid Bild ran a headline saying \u201cFrance prevented more German vaccine\u201d, referring to the Sanofi\/GSK shot and that of Pfizer with the German biotechnology company BioNTech SE.  Lauterbach declined to comment on Wednesday.  French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune rejected accusations against France as \u201cunacceptable and false\u201d.  \u201cIt is absurd to play countries and laboratories off against each other because all countries need all the vaccines to vaccinate the maximum number of people between now and the summer,\u201d he said in a statement.  The tensions over the vaccination campaign come as coronavirus infections quicken in many member states.  The EU has displayed unprecedented solidarity in the face of the pandemic, agreeing on a huge joint borrowing programme to bolster the recovery of its economy.

Every vial of the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine was expected to include five doses, but GPs found it was possible to make six doses out of the vials, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported late on Thursday.  The National Health Service (NHS) confirmed to Reuters that in a weekly webinar with NHS England on Thursday, clinicians were told they could use the sixth dose \u201cat their discretion\u201d.  The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) did not respond to a request for comment. The Telegraph reported that the British regulator was looking at the feasibility of getting six vaccines out of the vials and was consulting with NHS England.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had said on Wednesday that extra doses from vials of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine can be used after reports of vaccine doses being thrown away by pharmacists due to labelling confusion.  The Pfizer vials are supposed to hold five doses, according to the labelling, but media reports said pharmacists had found a way for a sixth or even a seventh dose. Without clear approval from the manufacturer, the extra dose had to be discarded.  The Pfizer\/BioNTech shot, the first COVID-19 vaccine to be approved by Western drugs regulators, is being rolled out in countries including Britain and the United States, and is expected to be approved for use in the European Union next week.  Pfizer will request for an approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in Japan on Friday, according to Kyodo News.

The revamp is the boldest move yet by GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, who took over last year.  It will lead to the creation of a consumer health giant with a market share of 7.3 percent, well ahead of its nearest rivals Johnson & Johnson, Bayer and Sanofi, all on around 4 percent.  Walmsley has previously played down the idea of breaking up the group, something that a number of investors have called for over the years.  On Wednesday, however, she announced that GSK and Pfizer would combine their consumer health businesses in a joint venture with sales of 9.8 billion pounds ($12.7 billion), 68 percent-owned by the British company, in an all-equity transaction.  GSK said the deal laid the foundation for the creation of two new UK-based global companies focused on pharma\/vaccines and consumer healthcare within three years of the transaction closing.  For Pfizer, the deal resolves the issue of what to do with its consumer health division, which includes Advil painkillers and Centrum vitamins, after an abortive attempt to sell it outright earlier this year.  The logo of U.S. pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer Inc. is seen at a branch in Zurich, Switzerland October 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  GSK, whose consumer products include Sensodyne toothpaste and Panadol painkillers, had withdrawn from that earlier Pfizer auction process but Walmsley said the opportunity to strike an all-equity deal cleared the way for the new agreement.  \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve been able to do quickly and quietly,\u201d she told reporters in a conference call.  \u201cWhat this deal is all about is the opportunity to strengthen two businesses -- a world-leading consumer healthcare business and a new GSK that is focused on pharma and vaccines.\u201d  CRYSTALLIZING VALUE  Shareholders welcomed the news and the shares jumped 7 percent, with Jefferies analysts saying the future separation could crystallize value.  The new joint venture with Pfizer is expected to generate total annual cost savings of 500 million pounds by 2022 for expected total cash costs of 900 million and non-cash charges of 300 million. GSK plans divestments of some 1 billion pounds.  Walmsley said there would be an inevitable impact on jobs but there was also an opportunity for cost savings in procurement and across the supply chain.  The Pfizer deal is expected to boost adjusted earnings and free cashflow in the first full year after closing, which GSK anticipates will occur in the second half of 2019.  Pfizer, which already has a long-standing HIV medicines joint venture with GSK, said the transaction would be slightly accretive in each of the first three years after it closed.  The consumer tie-up follows a deal by GSK earlier this year to buy Novartis\u2019s stake in their consumer joint venture for $13 billion and comes as Walmsley tries to reshape Britain\u2019s biggest drugmaker, which has seen its shares move sideways for years.  Earlier this month, she agreed to buy cancer drug specialist Tesaro for $5.1 billion to try to revitalize its pharmaceuticals business, a high-priced acquisition that was poorly received by the market.  GSK has lagged rivals in recent years in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters and it largely sat out a spate of dealmaking by rivals under previous CEO Andrew Witty.  Seeking to reassure investors of its financial strength, GSK extended its guarantee on the dividend by stating it expected to pay unchanged dividends of 80 pence per share for 2019.  GSK was advised by Citi, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and Greenhill, while Centerview, Guggenheim and Morgan Stanley acted for Pfizer.","1534":"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Friday it had reached an agreement with Pfizer\/BioNTech for 40 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine and should be able to start delivering vaccines to poor and lower-middle income countries next month under its COVAX programme.

Bourla said the 40 million doses, a fraction of the company\u2019s total 2021 production estimate of 2 billion, would be sold on a non-profit basis. He described it as an initial agreement, and said more doses could be provided through the COVAX programme in future.  The deal comes amid growing criticism of vaccine inequity from both the WHO and others as wealthy countries inoculate millions of people using shots procured through bilateral deals.  WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the new agreement with Pfizer should allow vaccinations to begin in February for health workers, although details of supply arrangements are still being finalised.  He said he hoped the agreement would also encourage other countries to donate more of their Pfizer shots to support rapid roll-out, like Norway has.  \u201cThe commitment of the (United States) to join COVAX, together with this new agreement with Pfizer\/BioNTech, mean that we are closer to fulfilling the promise of COVAX,\u201d he said.  U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Thursday the United States intended to join the facility. Biden\u2019s predecessor Donald Trump had halted funding to the Geneva-based body and announced a withdrawal process.  The WHO said earlier this week it planned to deliver 135 million vaccines in the first quarter of 2021, without giving a breakdown by supplier.

And the number of COVID-19 fatalities rose by 425, to 42,960, meaning the seven-day moving average, at 560, was beyond the 500-threshold for the fourth day in a row, a level last seen during the first lockdown in the second half of April.  However, the daily number of new infections was more than 2,500 lower than on Wednesday, at 33,172, and the seven-day moving average of new cases, at 42,478, was down for the fifth day in a row. The cumulative number of cases now stands at 1,898,710, the fourth-highest in the world.  Castex said a quarter of current deaths in the country were due to the virus, and that while the \u2018R\u2019 rate that measures the spread was now below 1 it was too early to contemplate relaxing measures.  Castex said France could start to loosen restrictions from Dec. 1 if the case numbers permitted, first by allowing shops to re-open. But he said bars and restaurants would not be permitted to resume operating until later still.  Asked if citizens could buy train tickets to travel at Christmas, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too early to say.\u201d  If the slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week. But Castex added he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures if the spread quickened once more.  \u201cThe pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously,\u201d Castex said, adding one person was hospitalised every 30 seconds somewhere in France as a result of the virus.  When President Emmanuel Macron put the country back into lockdown, he said new infections needed to be hauled down to 5,000 per day for the curbs to be lifted.  After achieving a large degree of control over the pandemic following blanket lockdowns earlier in the year, governments across Europe have imposed new curbs to halt an alarming rise in case numbers in recent weeks, while trying to keep economies running as far as possible.

The applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) came a day after Moderna sought emergency use for its shot in the United States and more than a week after Pfizer and BioNTech did the same.  U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech said their vaccine could be launched in the European Union as early as this month.  \u201cWe can start to deliver within a few hours (of an approval),\u201d said Sierk Poetting, head of operations and finance at BioNTech. \u201cWe have been stocking up.

It added its schedule may be subject to change as its evaluation proceeds.  The European Commission, the EU executive body, said it would likely give its final authorization for a vaccine\u2019s rollout days after a recommendation by the EMA.  An effective immunization is seen as the main weapon against the pandemic, which has claimed more than 1.4 million lives and ravaged economies across the globe.

CUSTOMISED GENETIC CODE  Their work validates that of several biotech experts, who for years have been labouring to prove a once-unorthodox idea: The human body can act as its own vaccine factory.  Both inoculations work by injecting people with customised genetic code that instructs human cells to make key virus proteins to induce an immune response.  Pfizer and BioNTech reported final trial results on Nov. 18 that showed their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, with no major safety concerns.  Moderna Inc said on Monday that full results from a late-stage study showed its candidate, mRNA-1273, was 94.1% effective, also with no serious safety concerns.  Any clearance in the EU and United States for the vaccines will be \u201cconditional\u201d or for \u201cemergency use\u201d, meaning developers are obliged to continue trials and provide more trial results as they emerge.  The European filings complete so-called rolling reviews, initiated by the EMA on Oct. 6 in the case of Pfizer and on Nov. 16 for Moderna, aimed at speeding up the process by doing a real-time assessment of the data as it lands.  The EMA said on Tuesday it had started a rolling review of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine candidate after preliminary results showed it triggered production of antibodies and immune cells against the virus. The review will go on until enough evidence is available for a formal marketing authorisation application, the regulator added.

On Friday, a senior official told Reuters AstraZeneca Plc had also informed the European Union it would cut deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine to the bloc by 60% because of production problems.  \u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d Conte said in a Facebook post. \u201cOur vaccination plan ... has been drawn up on the basis of contractual pledges freely undertaken by pharmaceutical companies with the European Commission.\u201d  Italy, which is using vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna Inc as AstraZeneca awaits clearance for use of its vaccines across the EU, says Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week and would be down 20% next week.

In the meantime, vaccinations in Italy have slowed to 20,000-25,000 a day from peaks of more than 90,000 around two weeks ago, Locatelli said.  Rome has threatened to sue Pfizer.  Conte said expected delays in the vaccine by AstraZeneca were even more worrying, adding Italy would receive 3.4 million doses instead of 8 million in the first quarter if the 60% reduction were confirmed.  He added the heads of AstraZeneca Italy had confirmed the reduction in production capacity at a meeting on Saturday with Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza and COVID-19 Special Commissioner Domenico Arcuri.  \u201cSuch delays in deliveries represent serious contractual violations, which cause enormous damage to Italy and other countries,\u201d Conte said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll use all available legal tools as we\u2019re already doing with Pfizer-BioNTech,\u201d he added.  The European Medicines Agency will rule on the AstraZeneca vaccine on Jan. 29 and Locatelli said Rome would have to reassess immunisation plans after that.

The benchmark 10-year yield rose to its highest since March, climbing 14 basis points, its biggest one-day jump since March as well. The U.S. yield curve, one indication of risk appetite, hit its steepest level since February 2018, with the spread between 2-year and 10-year notes rising to as high 78.3 basis points. The spread was last at 77 basis points. Pfizer said on Monday its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing COVID-19, based on initial data from a large study. The news, potentially a major victory in the fight against a pandemic that has killed over 1 million people and roiled the world economy, sparked a sell-off in safe-haven bond markets in the United States and Europe. \"Today's vaccine news provides enormous relief, but the next story chapters are obscure and harder to time,\" said Jim Vogel, senior rates strategist, at FHN Financial in Memphis. \"For the first day of the news, the reaction in the bond market looks appropriate, while equities appear slightly ahead of themselves.\" Bond yields also benefited from some clarity with last week's U.S. presidential election. Two days after clinching victory over Republican President Donald Trump, Democrat Joe Biden convened a task force on Monday to devise a blueprint for tackling the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. His 13-member task force is headed by former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler, and Yale University healthcare equity expert Marcella Nunez-Smith. In afternoon trading, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were last up at 0.954%, from 0.82% late on Friday. It earlier rose to 0.975%, the highest since March. U.S. 30-year yields also touched their highest level since March of 1.767% and last traded up at 1.749%, from Friday's 1.598%. Tom di Galoma, managing director at Seaport Global Holdings, said he favored buying the dip in prices in either the 10-year near 1%, or the 30-year near 1.75%-1.80%. He added that 30-year bonds are \"severely oversold at the moment,\" and expects overseas accounts to buy this \"well-timed dip.\" The yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities hit -0.743, the highest since July. It was last at -0.77%, compared with -0.831% last Friday. U.S. break-evens, the bond market's gauge of investors' inflation outlook, also rose. The yield spread between 10-year TIPS and 10-year Treasury notes was at 1.725%, the highest level since late October. On Monday, the U.S. Treasury held a record $54 billion three-year note auction, with mixed results. The yield was at 0.25%, lower than the expected rate at the bid deadline. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.40, below both the 2.44 last month and the 2.44 average. It was the lowest since April but the decline, Action Economics said, was strictly a function of the increased auction volume. Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, took just 38.9% of the total, the weakest since May 2019, said Action Economics. It was down sharply from 55.7% in October and the 52.2% average.

Pfizer Inc\u2019s announcement that its vaccine was more than 90% effective in tests come as Senate Republicans and House Democrats are in a standoff over the health of the economy and investors are closely watching any movement over talks.  Democrats have pushed for a $2 trillion package, with support for state and local governments that are facing steep layoffs, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pushed back, arguing Congress should enact a smaller coronavirus stimulus package highly targeted at the pandemic\u2019s effects.  \u201cYou have to assume in general that whatever level stimulus you would have received will probably be less because policy makers will say that the economy will mend,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. Equity Strategist for Credit Suisse.  The vaccine news came after the United States became the first country to cross more than 10 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally.  New Jersey joined some other U.S. Northeast states on Monday by reimposing economic restrictions such as closing indoor dining by 10 p.m.  Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, the corporate parent of PIMCO, cautioned that stimulus relief was still required to minimize the pandemic\u2019s economic and social effects. The \u201cinclination is to argue that the fiscal support is no longer needed. That would be wrong,\u201d he tweeted.  Talks for another stimulus bill will likely be affected by polls for two open U.S. Senate seats at play in the Jan. 5 run-off elections in Georgia, said Esty Dwek, head of global macro strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, who cautioned that the U.S. economy remains weak.  \u201cEven with a vaccine we need stimulus,\u201d she said, adding that the risk is that any further relief bills will \u201cbe about politics and not about need.\u201d  LESS DEPENDENT ON STIMULUS  While another stimulus bill would likely extend the market rally, the lack of a relief package now will not sink stocks or investor sentiment as much as before Pfizer\u2019s news, said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager at Villere & Co.  \u201cThe downside risk of what does a world looks like in a no-stimulus scenario is frankly less disastrous to the market than it was yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now appear to have blue skies ahead if all of this is as positive as it looks.\u201d  As investors moved into riskier assets on Monday, stocks hit record peaks while benchmark 10-year Treasury rates jumped to their highest since March, when the U.S. economy froze under lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus.  Expectations for an imminent vaccine will likely push interest rates higher as investors price in an economic rebound next year, said Jabaz Mathai, head of U.S. rates strategy at Citigroup, wrote in a note Monday. \u201cNevertheless, a stimulus package would be ideal to create a bridge for the economy.\u201d  Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Investment Management in Chicago, said a vaccine reduced the need for a stimulus but said if it was not available to the general public until March or April, \u201cwe might need something to bridge that.\u201d  Markets could continue to rally even if new stimulus is pushed to next year, said Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy at Columbia Threadneedle. A stimulus bill will now likely range from $500 billion to $1 trillion, rather than the $2 trillion plus that Democrats had been pushing for, she added.  \u201cPeople were rightly staying away from certain sectors\u201d like hotels and travel, she said.

Several other countries, including Brazil and Argentina, have raised concerns about liability waivers in their negotiations with Pfizer.  World Bank officials said on Tuesday they were working with countries to address the liability waiver issue which they said had emerged as one of the key obstacles to sealing vaccine supply deals.  Peru has hosted trials for COVID-19 vaccines developed by China`s Sinopharm, U.S.-based Johnson & Johnson and British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca Plc and is in negotiations to secure vaccines from other companies, Mazzetti said.  Peru\u2019s foreign minister told a legislative commission last month that Peru had resumed conversations with AstraZeneca after cutting off negotiations in October when it alleged the company had not provided adequate data on its testing.  Peru has also signed up to receive 13.2 million doses of vaccines through the COVAX facility, an alliance led by the World Health Organization and GAVI.

The study did not meet its main goal of the four-week continuous abstinence rate at weeks 9 through 12 for Chantix compared to placebo, Pfizer said.  The side effect profile of Chantix observed in this study was similar to that seen in studies of adults, the company said.  The study is a regulatory post marketing commitment for Chantix for adolescents aged between 12 and 16 in the United States and 12-17 years of age in Europe.

Vaccines have been administered to care home residents, those aged 80 and over and health and social care staff through over 500 vaccination sites, the government said.  British drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc submitted a full data package about its COVID-19 vaccine to the UK\u2019s medicines regulator, Hancock said on Wednesday.

The variant known as the B.1.1.7 lineage may be up to 70% more infectious and more of a concern for children. It has sown chaos in Britain, prompting a wave of travel bans that are disrupting trade with Europe and threatening to further isolate the island country.","1548":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of U.S. pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer Inc. is seen at a branch in Zurich, Switzerland October 2, 2018.

The roughly 150 employees at that facility were informed of that shutdown in the fourth quarter, he said.  The plant in Chennai makes generic injectable cephalosporin, penems and penicillin.

Local output of the two human vaccines is a step change for Biovac, a public-private partnership 47.5%-owned by the South African government with long-term ambitions of expanding sales into the continent.  The new production lines follow years of technology transfers and skills upgrades with partners Sanofi and Pfizer in Africa\u2019s largest pharmaceutical market. The companies were tight-lipped about commercial details of the partnership.  \u201cWe start production of Hexavalent in Q3 2020,\u201d Morena Makhoana, Biovac\u2019s chief executive said at its state-of-the art facility in Cape Town.  The plant, modernized at a cost of around 1 billion rand ($70 million), will produce four million doses of Hexavalent vaccine a year and has capacity to ramp up significantly as it explores new markets in neighbouring Namibia, Mozambique and Angola, he said.  South Africa\u2019s government buys about 95% of the total 25 million doses of vaccine supplied annually by Biovac, covering diseases such as tuberculosis, cervical cancer and influenza.  Biovac\u2019s dose of Hexavalent, a six-in-one vaccine for several diseases including diphtheria, tetanus and polio, is the only one in the world that is fully liquid and unlike other versions on the market, Makhoana said, does not have to be mixed before injecting. This makes it easier to administer in remote and resource-poor clinics across Africa, he added.  \u201cOn this particular six-in-one vaccine we are the only tech transfer partner with Sanofi in the world, so we are very proud,\u201d Makhoana told Reuters.  Sanofi said it will continue to invest in South Africa\u2019s vaccine programme as it looks to bolster its position.  \u201cSouth Africa, and Africa for that matter, is an emerging market and showing strong growth year-on-year and hence will remain a priority for Sanofi,\u201d Merilynn Matthew, who heads Sanofi\u2019s South African vaccines unit, said.  Around one-in-five African children do not get immunized, with measles alone accounting for 61,000 preventable deaths a year on the continent, according to the World Health Organisation.  SECURITY OF SUPPLY  Biovac, the rest of which is owned by a consortium led by local investment holding firm Immunotek, has also made progress preparing Pfizer\u2019s pneumonia vaccine for infants, Prevnar 13, Makhoana said. It expects full output of 3 million doses to start in the first half of 2021.  Under a five-year agreement signed with Pfizer in 2015, Biovac only packaged labelled syringes but it is now acquiring the formulation and filling processes ahead of the new product line launch.  \u201cSecurity of supply is one big issue and the second is the economic benefits local production brings, while making sure that prices are equally benchmarked and South Africa pays a fair price in line with other middle income countries such as Brazil or Turkey,\u201d Makhoana said.  At the partnership launch four years ago, a cabinet minister said the pneumonia vaccine alone used up 40% of South Africa\u2019s total budget for vaccines, with the government then paying around 185 rand ($13.11) per single dose of imported Prevenar 13. Each infant will eventually need three doses. Pfizer did not provide the current cost of the vaccine.  \u201cThe technology transfer process has enabled significant knowledge transfer, job creation and direct investment,\u201d said Rhulani Nhlaniki, Pfizer\u2019s country manager.","1552":"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis has released data showing sharply improved overall survival rates for its breast cancer drug Kisqali, which the Swiss drugmaker hopes will help it chip away at the dominance of Pfizer\u2019s blockbuster Ibrance.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss drugmaker Novartis is seen at its headquarters in Basel, Jan. 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo  Novartis\u2019s Kisqali had $235 million in sales in 2018, well behind the $4.1 billion for Ibrance, as Pfizer\u2019s first-to-market drug captured the lion\u2019s share of women with metastatic HR+\/HER2- cancer.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ibrance in February 2015, two years before Kisqali.  The data released on Saturday showed about 70 percent of pre-menopausal women with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+\/HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer were alive 42 months after getting a cocktail of Kisqali and endocrine therapy.  That compares with 46 percent who received only endocrine therapy, which at the time of the study was the standard of care.  Doctors helping lead Novartis\u2019s Kisqali study, called Monaleesa-7, said the statistically significant benefit it showed was good news for patients facing a challenging disease.  \u201cTo achieve overall survival improvement in an incurable disease, like metastatic breast cancer, is truly an outstanding advancement,\u201d said Dr. Sara Hurvitz, head of breast cancer clinical trials at the University of California Los Angeles.  According to a Refinitiv poll, analysts expect Kisqali - priced at about $130,000 per year - to reap about $1.2 billion annually by 2024.  SURVIVAL ANALYSIS  The Swiss company is hoping its new survival analysis, released at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago, will convince more doctors to consider Kisqali.  \u201cMost physicians would practice evidence-based medicine, and in that case, having statistical significance certainly would have some persuasion in how they would actually move forward,\u201d John Tsai, Novartis\u2019 head global drug developer, said on a call.  Analysis of separate clinical trials is ongoing to determine potential overall survival benefit of taking Ibrance together with endocrine therapy, as well as of endocrine therapy with a similar drug, Eli Lilly\u2019s Verzenio, that had $255 million in sales last year.  Kisqali, Ibrance and Verzenio have not been compared with each other in trials.  In addition to losing the race to market for Ibrance, Novartis\u2019s Kisqali has faced some safety-linked hurdles.  Its label includes warnings for a possible heart condition, called QT prolongation, and liver toxicity that require monitoring that Pfizer\u2019s medicine has avoided.  Kisqali, a CDK4\/6 inhibitor that aims to halt hyperactive cellular machinery that drives tumor growth, is approved as an initial treatment for women with HR+\/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, regardless of whether they have gone through menopause.  Ibrance and Lilly\u2019s Verzenio have somewhat narrower first-line FDA labels, covering initial therapy for HR+\/HER2- breast cancer in women after menopause.","1553":"ZURICH (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer should know in October if a COVID-19 vaccine it is developing works, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Thursday, potentially placing it at the centre of bitter U.S. presidential politics ahead of the Nov. 3 election.

The ministry awarded BioNTech 375 million euros ($445 million) and CureVac 252 million euros in funding, subject to meeting certain milestones, after they applied under a scheme announced in July.  Both BioNTech and CureVac are among the leading developers of experimental COVID-19 vaccines, based on molecules carrying a genetic code called messenger RNA (mRNA).

Health Minister Jens Spahn said it was important to have a broad portfolio of vaccines and that Germany would look to secure more doses of potential COVID-19 vaccines in advance than its population size.  It has already secured 54 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s potential vaccine candidate as part of a European Union deal with the drugmaker for 450 million doses, he said.  Along with the funding for BioNTech and CureVac, Germany has contributed money to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) to bolster the testing of a potential COVID-19 vaccine.  Spahn said the government was due to decide this week whether to contribute to the \u201cCOVAX\u201d global vaccine allocation plan, co-led by the World Health Organization, that aims to help buy and fairly distribute the shots. The deadline to join the programme is Friday.","1557":"As the global race to create vaccines against the novel coronavirus enters a critical stretch, Reuters dedication to speed, accuracy and innovation has put clients ahead when it comes to delivering crucial updates on the fight against COVID-19.

The Japanese yen and Scandinavian currencies were among the biggest movers, while the offshore Chinese yuan hit its strongest in 28 months. The safe-haven yen gave way to the new optimism, weakening to its lowest level in more than two weeks, while the yuan strengthened on confidence in more trade. A Biden presidency is expected to shore up international trade relations and the prospect of a successful coronavirus vaccine is seen as a major tailwind, with global cases continuing to rise. The vaccine news \"provided just a tremendous boost for risk appetite,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange broker OANDA. \"There was a lot of nervousness in investors' expectations for these vaccine trial results, and the first one out of the gates had an amazing 90% effective rate, far exceeding the consensus,\" Moya said. \"The last remaining risk event of the year, it seems like it has been taken off the table. We're seeing a big reflation trade here.\" Bond yields soared in the United States and Europe , and major stock indexes gained as much as 4%. The vaccine news, said Simon Harvey, currency analyst at broker Monex Europe, \"helped boost global growth expectations which took a substantial knock only weeks ago with second wave concerns.\" Also benefiting were the Norwegian and Swedish crowns and other currencies which react more quickly to economic changes. The Swedish crown rose to a 28-month high against the dollar and the euro. It traded at 8.6014 versus the U.S. dollar and reached a 22-month high against the euro. Its Norwegian counterpart strengthened 1.54% against the dollar and rose against the euro as well, to touch two-month highs against each..

The Canadian and Australian dollars both rose as much as 0.8% versus the U.S. dollar, with the latter hitting a seven-week high and the former a nine-month high.

Despite months of preparation, distributing and administering the vaccine to as many as 330 million recipients poses a major logistical challenge, he said. The vaccine has complex shipping requirements and must be stored at -70 Celsius.  \u201cWe have a lot of work to do. We are not taking a victory lap.

Cases are surging in the United States, with thousands of deaths per day, while hospital intensive care units across the country are nearing capacity. More than 295,000 Americans have died of COVID-19.  Doses of the vaccine from U.S.-based Pfizer and German partner BioNTech will be delivered to 145 locations around the country on Monday, Perna said.  The remainder of the 636 delivery locations selected by U.S. states and territories will receive doses on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said, adding that every week going forward Pfizer will have more doses ready for distribution and administration.  Within three weeks, the vaccine program known as Operation Warp Speed should be able to get Pfizer\u2019s shots to any healthcare facility in the country, Perna said.  Pfizer is working with logistics companies United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp to distribute the vaccines. They must coordinate deliveries of doses with shipments of other products needed to store and administer vaccines, such as syringes, dry ice, and protective equipment for healthcare workers.  \u201cThe final mile is going to be the most difficult. Once it hits the hospital or nursing homes, they also have to keep the vaccine under temperature control,\u201d said Cathy Morrow Roberson, a logistics consultant and former UPS analyst.  \u201cThis massive clock is ticking, there is no room for error,\u201d she added.  More U.S. residents will be eligible in January, when those in the highest priority populations are expected to have had an opportunity to receive a vaccine.

An EU-UK trade pact is unlikely to come together this week and negotiations might go into the next, an Irish minister said on Wednesday, confirming a Reuters report that the sides were now set to miss their mid-November deadline.  Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said on Thursday the entire world was watching Brexit negotiations, including U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who was looking forward to a Brexit trade deal being clinched.  Still, Britain has been working hard throughout the trade negotiations with the bloc to secure a deal, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday.  Meanwhile, the top trade representatives for Brazil and the UK held a videoconference on Wednesday to discuss strengthening trade and investment links, including a possible post-Brexit bilateral trade deal.

Multiple vaccines are likely to make it to market and success will depend on a number of factors, including immune response, safety and distribution.  Reuters is tracking the candidates closest to producing results in this tracker: tmsnrt.rs\/36jDuuj","1584":"Feb 17 (Reuters) - A laboratory study suggests that the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce antibody protection from the Pfizer Inc\/BioNTech SE vaccine by two-thirds, and it is not clear if the shot will be effective against the mutation, the companies said on Wednesday.  The study found the vaccine was still able to neutralize the virus and there is not yet evidence from trials in people that the variant reduces vaccine protection, the companies said.  Still, they are making investments and talking to regulators about developing an updated version of their mRNA vaccine or a booster shot, if needed.  For the study, scientists from the companies and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) developed an engineered virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike portion of the highly contagious coronavirus variant first discovered in South Africa, known as B.1.351. The spike, used by the virus to enter human cells, is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines.  Researchers tested the engineered virus against blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine, and found a two- thirds reduction in the level of neutralizing antibodies compared with its effect on the most common version of the virus prevalent in U.S. trials.  Their findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).  Because there is no established benchmark yet to determine what level of antibodies are needed to protect against the virus, it is unclear whether that two-thirds reduction will render the vaccine ineffective against the variant spreading around the world.  However, UTMB professor and study co-author Pei-Yong Shi said he believes the Pfizer vaccine will likely be protective against the variant.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the minimum neutralizing number is. We don\u2019t have that cutoff line,\u201d he said, adding that he suspects the immune response observed is likely to be significantly above where it needs to be to provide protection.  That is because in clinical trials, both the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and a similar shot from Moderna Inc conferred some protection after a single dose with an antibody response lower than the reduced levels caused by the South African variant in the laboratory study.  Even if the concerning variant significantly reduces effectiveness, the vaccine should still help protect against severe disease and death, he noted. Health experts have said that is the most important factor in keeping stretched healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed.  More work is needed to understand whether the vaccine works against the South African variant, Shi said, including clinical trials and the development of correlates of protection - the benchmarks to determine what antibody levels are protective.  Pfizer and BioNTech said they were doing similar lab work to understand whether their vaccine is effective against another variant first found in Brazil.  Moderna published a correspondence in NEJM on Wednesday with similar data previously disclosed elsewhere that showed a sixfold drop antibody levels versus the South African variant.  Moderna also said the actual efficacy of its vaccine against the South African variant is yet to be determined. The company has previously said it believes the vaccine will work against the variant.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic  The drugmakers said their vaccine was more than 90 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, based on data from the first 94 people in the trial to become infected with the coronavirus. [nL1N2HV0TR][nL1N2HV067]  The efficacy rate means that the overwhelming majority of infections occurred among people who received a placebo rather than the vaccine.  The 44,000-volunteer study was initially designed for a first interim analysis of whether the vaccine was working after 32 participants developed COVID-19.  Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer\u2019s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in an interview the companies changed the study plan after discussions with U.S. regulators and ultimately ended up with data on 94 people.  \u201cIt gives you more power and more confidence,\u201d said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. \u201cWhen you triple the numbers and you get a large difference between them, it\u2019s much more likely to be real.\u201d  Others cautioned that many questions remain, including whether the vaccine can prevent severe disease or complications, how long it will protect against infection and how well it will work in the elderly.  They noted that required safety data will not be available until later this month. In addition, Pfizer and BioNTech have yet to submit their data for peer review by other scientists, a key step in determining the quality of the results.  \u2018REALLY ENCOURAGING\u2019 BUT EARLY  \u201cThese are really encouraging but they are the earliest of results possible,\u201d said Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  The full study is designed to show the vaccine is effective after 164 people fall ill. Pfizer said that may happen in the first or second week of December, when a panel of outside advisors to the Food and Drug Administration reviews the study results and decides whether to recommend authorizing its use.  Gruber said he did not yet have a breakdown of how many of the first 94 infections occurred among Black or Latino participants, two communities hit hard by the disease. He also did he know exactly how many elderly people in the trial got sick. Older people with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19  So far, none of the 94 people in the initial analysis developed severe COVID-19. The FDA initially had requested that the interim data include at least five severe cases, but recently relaxed that requirement, Gruber said.  \u201cIf a vaccine is to reduce severe disease and death, and thus enable the population at large to return to their normal day-to-day lives, it will need to be effective in older and elderly members of our society,\u201d said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at Edinburgh University.  Gruber expects there will be some cases of severe disease before the trial ends.  \u201cBottom line is we\u2019re going to have to use the data we have and the high efficacy to give us confidence that we\u2019re going to prevent severe infection,\u201d he said.  Scientists also want to understand whether the Pfizer vaccine fully prevents people from getting infected with the new coronavirus - a huge advantage in reducing transmission - or if it simply reduces the degree to which they become ill.  \u201cIdeally, we want to be able to completely protect from infection, but I think we all accept that these so-called first generation vaccines are more likely to prevent disease,\u201d said Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain\u2019s University of Warwick. \u201cAnd the subtlety there, which is important, is if you\u2019re infected then you can still transmit the virus.\u201d  Pfizer intends to seek a broad approval for individuals aged 16 to 85, but the FDA and an advisory group to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would make decisions about who should be first in line to get the initial doses, which will be scarce.  If Pfizer wins emergency use authorization, Gruber said the company feels ethically bound to inform eligible trial participants who received a placebo that they are not protected against infection, and to offer them the vaccine in hopes of keeping them from dropping out of the trial.","1588":"(Adds Canada seeking more Pfizer vaccine)  OTTAWA, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc\u2019s announcement that its experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective is \u201cvery encouraging\u201d and Canada is looking to secure more doses of it, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday.  \u201cWe hope a vaccine is coming early next year.

As of Sunday, Chile has reported 585,545 cases of coronavirus and a total of 16,154 deaths.","1596":"ZURICH (Reuters) -Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Tuesday he expects a \u201cvery intense\u201d meeting with a U.S. vaccine advisory panel this week but is counting on the outside experts to sign off on his company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.  A needle next to a phial of the Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine jab is seen at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, on the first day of the largest immunisation programme in the British history, in Newcastle, Britain December 8, 2020. Owen Humphreys\/Pool via REUTERS  Bourla, speaking on a call with reporters on Tuesday, also reiterated confidence in Pfizer\u2019s ability to deliver its mRNA vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech, even though it must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius.  He added the companies are working on a \u201cnew formulation\u201d capable of withstanding higher temperatures.  His comments came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released documents raising no new safety or efficacy issues with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, setting the stage for Thursday\u2019s meeting with outside experts to the FDA who will discuss recommending the shot.  \u201cWe have answers to every question they will ask,\u201d Bourla said. \u201cI think they will vote \u2018yes\u2019 given the strength of the data.\u201d  His vaccine, already being delivered in limited quantities in Britain after its emergency approval there, has raised concerns due to the Antarctic temperatures it must be stored at, though Pfizer and BioNTech have sought to reassure that it can survive at 2 and 8 degrees for a limited time.  Bourla said he was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d with the companies\u2019 ability to distribute the vaccine at minus 70 degrees by using special storage boxes developed by their mechanics.  \u201cYou can transport (it) in a normal car, for example, we have GPS and thermometers inside those boxes, so at any point in time, we know where each box is, and the temperature,\u201d Bourla said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve started already in the UK and things are going very well,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everybody will see pretty soon that this is not a challenge, at least in countries where there is basic infrastructure, like a road or a place to store things.\u201d  Bourla said the companies are pursuing changes to make the vaccine potentially more suitable for developing countries including Africa where such infrastructure may not be in place.  \u201cYes, we are working also on a new formulation that will be able to avoid the minus 70 and can be stored in simple refrigeration,\u201d he said.","1597":"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is betting that its coronavirus vaccine candidate will show clear evidence of effectiveness early in its clinical trial, according to the company and internal documents reviewed by Reuters that describe how the trial is being run.  FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a sign outside Pfizer Headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., July 22, 2020. REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri\/File Photo  In recent weeks, Pfizer has said it should know by the end of October whether the vaccine, developed together with Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE, is safe and effective. If the vaccine is shown to work by then, Pfizer has said it would quickly seek regulatory approval. It has not said what data it would use.  President Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election, has said a vaccine to fight the coronavirus pandemic is possible before the Nov. 3 U.S. vote, raising concerns over political interference. Scientists have questioned whether drugmakers will have enough evidence to achieve success by that time.  Pfizer\u2019s clinical trial protocol outlines for the company, scientists and regulators how the drugmaker could show that its vaccine meets efficacy and safety standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  A company\u2019s protocol is submitted to the FDA for review and is overseen by an independent panel of experts known as a Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  The protocol calls for a first assessment of the vaccine\u2019s performance by the monitoring board after 32 participants in the trial become infected with the novel coronavirus. So far, more than 29,000 people have enrolled in the trial that started in July, some receiving the vaccine and the others receiving a placebo.  The FDA has said that a coronavirus vaccine must prove to be at least 50 percent more effective than a placebo in a large-scale trial to be considered for approval. However, a smaller sample of infections in a clinical trial changes the calculation of how that standard is met, according to researchers.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccine would need to be at least 76.9% effective to show it works based on 32 infections, according to its protocol. That would mean that no more than six of those coronavirus cases would have occurred among people who received the vaccine, the documents showed.  If the drugmaker\u2019s vaccine does not meet the 76.9% efficacy target at this first interim analysis, it would face tougher statistical significance thresholds during subsequent interim assessments, biostatisticians who reviewed the protocol said.  Pfizer said its interim analyses were designed to show conclusive evidence \u201cas quickly as possible amid the devastating pandemic if our vaccine meets the stringent standards set by FDA.\u201d Pfizer would not say whether it would use an interim analysis as the basis for seeking approval.  The FDA declined to comment on whether it would consider such data sufficient for approval.  SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE?  Interim analyses typically are used by data and safety monitoring boards to determine whether an experimental drug appears safe and effective enough to continue a trial, or whether it should be stopped if a safety problem arises.  But if a vaccine meets FDA benchmarks at an interim analysis without any serious safety problems, it could make sense to use it as a basis for authorization to help curb a pandemic that has killed about 940,000 people globally, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.  Moderna Inc, another front-runner in the vaccine race, told Reuters it would seek emergency FDA authorization to use its vaccine in high-risk groups if an interim assessment of its trial showed its vaccine was at least 70 percent effective.  Moderna, which made its protocols public on Thursday, said its first interim analysis of 53 infections is likely to come in November.  Some vaccine experts have said drugmakers should wait to reach their final analyses of more than 150 cases before seeking FDA approval. They note the speed at which vaccines are being developed for COVID-19, compressing what can be a decade-long process into months.  Relying on the more limited interim analyses could overstate a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness simply because not enough trial participants fell ill, they have said. Moving more quickly through the trial process also means a drugmaker could miss potential side effects that could materialize if trials were given more time.  \u201cThese interim analyses have a flashing sign of short cuts,\u201d said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. \u201cYou miss safety issues and you may very well exaggerate the benefits.\u201d  In addition to Pfizer and Moderna, Reuters reviewed the clinical trial protocols for vaccine candidates developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson.  AstraZeneca set its first interim analysis when about 40 coronavirus infections are reported among participants. Its U.S. trial is currently on hold after a patient fell ill.  J&J\u2019s first analysis would begin at 20 infections, according to the protocol of their large-scale trial due to begin on Sept. 21.  AstraZeneca and J&J declined to comment.","1598":"LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Britain hopes for millions of doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the year but the final figure will depend on how quickly it can be manufactured, Britain\u2019s business minister Alok Sharma said on Friday.  \u201cWe are starting initially with 800,000 and then let\u2019s see where we end up by the end of the year in terms of the numbers that we acquire.

While final trial data showed that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is 95% effective, many Asian countries are not betting on it partly due to tropical heat, remote island communities and a lack of ultra-cold freezers.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, jointly developed with German partner BioNTech, must be stored and transported at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94F), although it can be kept in a fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.  Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Friday that Malaysia would prioritise \u201chigh-risk groups... including frontliners, senior citizens, and those with non-communicable diseases, such as heart diseases and diabetes\u201d.  Pfizer will deliver the first one million doses in the first quarter of 2021, with 1.7 million, 5.8 million and 4.3 million doses to follow in subsequent quarters.  The deal is expected to cover 6.4 million Malaysians, or 20% of the population, with another 10% to be covered under Malaysia\u2019s participation in the global COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization.  Malaysia, which will distribute the vaccine to its people for free, reported 1,109 new COVID-19 infections on Friday.  The country is also planning to run a Phase 3 trial of an experimental vaccine developed by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The trial will involve 3,000 participants.  Pfizer\u2019s vaccine still requires approvals from regulators including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Malaysia\u2019s Health Ministry before it can be distributed, Muhyiddin said during a televised address.  The FDA plans a meeting on Dec. 10 to discuss whether to authorise the Pfizer vaccine for emergency use.  Pfizer and BioNTech have supply deals with several countries including the United States, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia and Britain.  They expect to produce globally up to 50 million doses of vaccines in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, with 48 in human trials, the WHO says.  This week AstraZeneca said its vaccine developed by Oxford University could be around 90% effective, following positive results from Pfizer, Moderna Inc and Russia\u2019s Sputnik V.
