CITY (Reuters) - General Motors Co is tentatively planning to restart operations at its auto assembly plant in the Mexican city of Silao on May 20, according to a message to workers seen by Reuters on Sunday, as the car industry prepares to exit the coronavirus lockdown.  FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the GM pickup and transmission plant in Silao, Mexico October 9, 2015. REUTERS\/Sergio Maldonado\/File Photo  The reopening of the plant would be a positive signal for the auto sector in North America, whose supply lines are highly interconnected between the United States, Mexico and Canada.  The plant in the central state of Guanajuato has been idled for weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak. Workers had previously been told to plan to return to their jobs on May 18.  A GM spokeswoman said the company could not confirm when it would restart operations at any of its facilities in Mexico because it is awaiting more guidance from the government.  The message to the plant\u2019s workers came after the government on Friday clarified when the industry could begin easing restrictions imposed because of the health emergency.  On Wednesday, the government said automakers could start going back into production from May 18. It then withdrew that advice and suggested the new start date would be June 1.  Finally it indicated the sector, which forms the backbone of Mexican manufacturing, could begin operating as soon as next week if companies had the required safety measures in place.  U.S. officials and its auto industry have pressed Mexico\u2019s government to get its factories open again because American operations depend heavily on parts from south of the border.  However, some politicians are wary of opening too fast. Mexico registered its first case of coronavirus weeks after the United States and Canada and the toll of daily infections and deaths in the country reached new peaks over the past few days.  The Silao production facility, which makes highly profitable pickup trucks for GM, is one of the biggest automotive plants in Guanajuato, a major Mexican carmaking state.","1":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Detroit automakers General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co f.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N lowered their full-year profit forecasts on Wednesday due to escalating tariffs, hitting their stocks as investors bet that escalating trade disputes would hurt margins and sales.  GM cited higher steel and aluminum costs for its 2018 profit forecast reduction as a result of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. GM shares closed down 4.6 percent.  Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said GM put in a \u201csolid performance\u201d in the second quarter \u201cdespite some fairly significant headwinds that have built throughout the year.\u201d  GM would partially offset the commodity hit by negotiating price reductions with suppliers, raising prices on more popular models, and cost cutting, Stevens told analysts.  Ford said tariffs could cost it up to $1.6 billion in 2018 in North America.  The automaker has also been hit by a 22 percent sales drop in China through May of this year and is seen as unlikely to be able to raise prices to offset tariffs there on U.S.-made vehicles, especially its luxury Lincoln models.  After what Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks described as a \u201cvery tough quarter,\u201d Ford cut its full-year earnings forecast for 2018 and its stock fell more than 2 percent in after-market trading.  In FCA\u2019s case, Chinese demand slumped in the quarter ahead of a July cut in import duties, resulting in higher incentive spending and an increase in unsold vehicle stocks that \u201cparticularly affected Maserati,\u201d new Chief Executive Mike Manley told analysts on a conference call.  Manley said \u201cvery, very cost conscious\u201d Chinese consumers sat waiting for prices to come down. A rise in FCA\u2019s inventory will continue to impact results as stocks are cleared ahead of new emissions regulations, he added.  FCA shares fell 15.5 percent and the automaker\u2019s results were overshadowed by news that former CEO Sergio Marchionne, who was abruptly replaced over the weekend due to a health crisis, died after suffering complications from surgery.  FCA said it has fixed-price contracts for most raw steel through 2018, but would see increases in 2019 at current prices.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  The automakers\u2019 warnings come amid growing fears over a trade war. Economists polled by Reuters said the U.S. economy will soon lose momentum on rising interest rates and escalating trade disputes.  GM said commodity costs and unfavorable currency in Brazil and Argentina would have a net impact of around $1 billion on its 2018 results.  Most of Ford and GM\u2019s additional commodity costs affect North America, their main profit driver.  GM buys most of its steel from U.S. producers, who have raised prices in reaction to tariffs on imported steel imposed by the Trump administration.  GM\u2019s U.S. sales performed well in the second quarter and the automaker said its full-size pickup truck plants are still running at more than 100 percent capacity to keep up with demand. GM will start selling its new full-size pickup trucks to customers next month.  Both GM and FCA are betting on redesigned pickup trucks to lift U.S. sales. Around 80 percent of FCA\u2019s second-quarter profit came from the U.S. market and the automaker said its new trucks should help lift its North American pre-tax adjusted margin to 10 percent in the second half of 2018.  GM also said higher costs would reduce adjusted automotive free cash flow by around $1 billion to $4 billion.  FCA said its 2018 net industrial cash flow would fall to 3 billion euros ($3.50 billion) from a previous forecast of 4 billion euros.  GM said it now expects to earn around $6 per share, down from its previous forecast of $6.30 to $6.60.  \u201cThe magnitude is greater than expected and the headwinds could\u2019ve probably been better communicated in advance,\u201d Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said in a research note.  In May, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp 9984.T said it would invest $2.25 billion in GM's autonomous vehicle unit Cruise, sending the automaker's shares up nearly 13 percent.  With the profit warning on Wednesday, all of those share price gains have now been lost.  FCA said it expected 2018 net revenues between 115 billion and 118 billion euros, down from a previous forecast of around 125 billion euros, while adjusted EBIT is expected at between 7.5-8.0 billion euros, down from at least 8.7 billion previously.","2":"FILE PHOTO: Toyota cars are pictured during the Salao do Automovel International Auto Show in Sao Paulo, Brazil November 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker  SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Co 7203.T on Monday said it was suspending auto production in its Brazil plants until at least June 22, joining General Motors Co GM.N which also expects to resume production in the same month.  Most carmakers in Brazil, South America's top auto producer, are currently not producing cars due to the coronavirus crisis. Major Brazil players such as Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI and Volkswagen AG have yet to announce when they expect to resume production.","3":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N President Dan Ammann will take over as chief executive of the automaker's majority-owned Cruise self-driving car subsidiary, trading in the No. 2 job at one of the world's largest automakers for a front-row position in the race to render traditional cars obsolete.  FILE PHOTO: General Motors President Dan Ammann speaks during GM's press conference at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Ammann's move, announced by GM and Cruise on Thursday and effective Jan. 1, underscores the challenges for legacy automakers as they compete for capital and talent with transport companies born from the digital technology and artificial intelligence industries, such as rival Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, or Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  Cruise co-founder Kyle Vogt, who has been the company\u2019s chief executive, will become president and chief technology officer, GM and Cruise said.  \u201cThe CEO title is not the most important thing to me or to the mission\u201d of developing safe, self-driving vehicles, Vogt said in an interview Thursday.  Cruise has a value of about $14.6 billion - equivalent to about 28 percent of GM's market capitalization despite no significant revenue and a product not ready for commercial launch. Japanese technology investment fund SoftBank Group Corp 9434.T and Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co7267.T invested a total of $5 billion for separate minority stakes in Cruise.  Ammann joined GM in 2010 from Morgan Stanley, where he was an adviser to GM\u2019s government-led bankruptcy restructuring in 2009. He became GM\u2019s president in 2014 and led a wide-ranging restructuring of global operations that included the sale of GM\u2019s European Opel unit, an overhaul of the money-losing GM Korea business and, in 2016, the acquisition of Cruise.  UNUSUAL MOVE  Bringing in an executive with experience managing large organizations and dealing with Wall Street to replace entrepreneurial founders is a common move in the technology industry.  However, it is unusual for a top executive at a global automaker to move to a small technology startup, even one as well-funded as Cruise.  \u201cThe scaling of this business is going to be a massive undertaking,\u201d Ammann told Reuters.  Analysts have speculated that GM eventually will sell shares in Cruise or spin it off. Ammann said Cruise has the capital it needs for now. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a lot of flexibility and different opportunities to raise capital,\u201d he said.  Ammann, 46, will take over an operation that is growing rapidly and faces technical and regulatory hurdles to achieve its goal of launching a robo-taxi service by the end of 2019.  Vogt, 33, and Ammann reaffirmed the goal of launching an automated ride service next year.  \u201cFrom a technical standpoint ... we have line of sight to where we need to be for our initial launch in 2019,\u201d Vogt said. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of work to be done.\u201d  Since GM\u2019s acquisition, San Francisco-based Cruise has grown to 1,000 employees from 40, and recently announced plans to expand operations to Seattle. Vogt and Ammann said they expect Cruise to grow substantially as it launches a robo-taxi service and other ventures built around its autonomous driving technology.  \u201cToday no one has a car that can be driven by itself, better than a human and is producible at large scale,\u201d Ammann said. \u201cOnce that exists ... we\u2019re going to be in a very interesting position in terms of how we turn that into a business.\u201d  Cruise has focused on developing automated taxis for cities. GM has not said where Cruise will launch its robo-taxi service, but Ammann and other executives have noted that Cruise is doing most of its testing in San Francisco.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, in a statement, described Ammann\u2019s move as the \u201cnext step towards commercial deployment.\u201d  With Ammann moving to Cruise, GM said that executives running GM\u2019s global auto operations and its GM Financial unit will report to Barra. GM earlier this week announced plans to cut 15,000 employees in North America, including a 25-percent cut in executive ranks.","4":"NEW DELHI\/DETROIT (Reuters) - Delays to General Motors' GM.N sale of its Indian plant to Great Wall Motor 601633.SS due to tensions between India and China are likely to result in hefty unplanned costs for the U.S. automaker, people familiar with the matter said.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Warren Transmission Operations Plant in Warren, Michigan October 26, 2015. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Gaining Indian government approval for China-related deals is now expected to take quite some time and although the sale should still happen at some point, GM has not changed its plan to begin winding down the plant\u2019s operations next month, they said.  \u201cBy next year, it will either be a closed GM site or it will be an operating site with Great Wall,\u201d said one source.  GM had planned to use the expected sale proceeds of $250 million-$300 million to pay off liabilities incurred with its exit from manufacturing in India in what a second source said would have been a \u201cno gain-no loss\u201d situation.  Although money will come through once the deal is done, it will now have to pay out of pocket for severance pay, some of which would never have occurred had the deal proceeded smoothly, as well as other costs - which could amount to a couple hundred million dollars, according to the second source.  Sources also said severance pay costs could be much higher than usual due to lack of clarity about the deal\u2019s prospects and workers\u2019 demands for greater relief given the low chances of finding new jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic.  The sources were not authorised to discuss the deal and spoke on condition of anonymity.  GM stopped selling in the world\u2019s second most populous nation at the end of 2017 after years of low sales but the factory continues to build vehicles for export. Located in the western state of Maharashtra, the plant employs about 4,000.  If workers don\u2019t agree to the severance offered, GM will need local government clearance to lay off staff. That is often a long, bureaucratic process which could help stoke worker protests or political opposition, the sources said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  GM said in a statement it continues to work toward ending production at the plant and closing the deal with Great Wall. Great Wall did not respond to a request for comment.  ENSNARED IN TENSIONS  The sale was announced in January and had been slated to close in the second half of 2020. Just when it might proceed remains highly uncertain.  In April, India introduced stricter rules for investments from China and other neighbouring countries aimed at preventing pandemic-hit Indian companies being taken over at bargain prices. A number of central government ministries are now required to sign off on the deal, instead of just Maharashtra state.  Then in June, a deadly border clash between the two nations resulted in a further clampdown on Chinese businesses and Maharashtra put three investment proposals from Chinese companies, including Great Wall\u2019s, on hold.  Further complicating matters, GM and Great Wall did not seek central government approval until late July, the sources said.  Investment proposals from Chinese companies are unlikely to be approved until tension at the border dissipates, two central government officials told Reuters.  India\u2019s finance and commerce ministries did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.  Great Wall \u201cnow feels it is impossible to finish the transaction this year,\u201d a company source said.  The hold-up has made the Chinese automaker nervous as it had planned to launch its first India-made car in the first half of 2021, said a separate person aware of the plans.  The company, which plans to invest $1 billion in India, has started hiring staff, including executives to run the plant, and is in talks with auto parts suppliers, the person said.  But even after the central government greenlights the project, Great Wall will still need more than three months to finalise investment terms with Maharashtra state and to revamp the plant, the person added.","5":"FILE PHOTO - The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Ramos Arizpe, in Coahuila state, Mexico November 25, 2017. REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N hit 200,000 total electric vehicles sold in the United States by the end of 2018, reaching a threshold that triggers a phase-out of a $7,500 federal tax credit over the next 15 months, a person briefed on the matter said Wednesday.  The largest U.S. automaker reached the figure in the fourth quarter of 2018, which means the credit will fall to $3,750 in April, and then drop to $1,875 in October for six months. The credit will completely disappear by April 2020. The 200,000 figure covers GM\u2019s cumulative EV sales since 2010.  The tax credit is aimed at defraying the cost of electric vehicles that are more expensive than similarly sized internal combustion engine vehicles. In 2009, Congress set the phase-out threshold at 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer.  GM, which said previously it expected to reach the 200,000 sales figure before the end of 2018, declined to comment ahead of the release of its quarterly sales results on Thursday.  GM and Tesla Inc TSLA.O, which hit the 200,000 figure in July 2018, have both lobbied Congress to lift the cap or extend the existing tax credit. Tesla's EV tax credit fell to $3,750 on Tuesday and Tesla said it was cutting prices on its EVs by $2,000 to partially offset the lower tax credit.  In March, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra called on Congress to expand the consumer tax credit for electric vehicles as the company boosted production of the EV Bolt in response to consumer demand. She repeated the request last month during a visit to Capitol Hill.  GM said in November it was doubling resources allocated to developing electric and self-driving vehicles as part of a significant restructuring that includes ending production at five North American plants. GM also announced it would halt production of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt by March.  In November, a congressional report said 57,066 taxpayers claimed $375 million in EV tax credits in 2016. Congress estimates the cost of the EV tax credit at $7.5 billion between the 2018 and 2022 fiscal years.","6":"June 29 (Reuters) - General Motors Co warned on Friday that expansive U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles being considered by the Trump administration could lead to a \u201ca smaller GM\u201d and risks isolating U.S. businesses from the global market.

The announcement came as the United Auto Workers union on Monday sent a letter to GM formally objecting to the decision to end production in 2019 at four U.S. plants, saying it violates commitments made during contract talks in 2015. The decision to close an assembly plant in Ohio has come under fire from President Donald Trump and others.  In the letter seen by Reuters, the UAW asked GM to rescind the decision and resolve the fate of the plants during negotiations next year. Calling the plants \u201cunallocated\u201d does not relieve GM \u201cof its obligation to comply\u201d with a moratorium on plant closings, the UAW letter said. \u201cWe will use all of our resources to enforce our agreements,\u201d the letter said.  GM did not immediately comment.  Since early 2017, GM has cut two of the three production shifts at the Ohio plant that makes the Chevrolet Cruze car, eliminating 3,000 jobs. GM has said it is closing the plants due to sagging demand for cars.  In addition to the plant closings, GM is cutting about 8,000 salaried jobs in North America on top of the 2,250 salaried workers who volunteered to take buyouts.

The largest U.S. automaker said on Monday it would cut thousands from its North American workforce, slash production and eliminate some slow-selling car models. GM also plans to close an assembly plant and a transmission plant in Ohio, along with an assembly plant in Canada.

GM also alleged that Fiat Chrysler\u2019s former chief executive, the late Sergio Marchionne, was central in the scheme.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it will seek \u201csubstantial damages\u201d from FCA that it said would be reinvested in the United States to create jobs, but did not specify an exact amount.  The lawsuit comes at a delicate time for FCA, which is working on a planned merger with French automaker PSA and is negotiating a four-year labor contract with the UAW.  FCA said here late on Wednesday that it would defend itself vigorously against the lawsuit.  \u201cWe are astonished by this filing, both its content and its timing,\u201d FCA had said in a statement earlier. \u201cWe can only assume this was intended to disrupt our proposed merger with PSA as well as our negotiations with the UAW.\u201d  FCA and PSA last month announced the planned 50-50 share merger to create the world\u2019s fourth-largest automaker, seeking scale to cope with costly new technologies and slowing global demand.  GM\u2019s general counsel, Craig Glidden, told reporters at GM\u2019s headquarters that the lawsuit has nothing to do with the planned merger of PSA and FCA and the automaker does not intend to file suit against the UAW.  PSA declined to comment.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Warren Transmission Operations Plant in Warren, Michigan October 26, 2015. Photo taken October 26. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  The UAW has targeted FCA last out of Detroit\u2019s three automakers for contract talks. UAW workers at Ford Motor Co ratified a new contract last week, while GM workers approved a deal in late October that ended a 40-day U.S. strike.  \u201cIt (the lawsuit) can\u2019t help but complicate the already difficult task of getting a UAW-FCA agreement in place,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Michigan.  The UAW said in a statement, \u201cWe are confident that the terms of those contracts were not affected\u201d by the actions of FCA or UAW officials. It said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that these issues can cause doubts about the contracts.  The lawsuit also names as defendants three former FCA executives who have pleaded guilty in an ongoing federal probe into the UAW and FCA. GM said that probe, coupled with its own investigation, resulted in the lawsuit.  RACKETEERING  GM\u2019s Glidden said a \u201cpattern of racketeering\u201d by FCA from 2009 to 2015 left GM paying higher wages than Fiat Chrysler, and allowed the latter to use more temporary workers and lower-paid second-tier workers than GM.  \u201cAs part of this bribery scheme, and to lock in the competitive efficacy of the purchased benefits, concessions and advantages for FCA, GM was denied similar union commitments and support,\u201d the lawsuit states.  The lawsuit claims that among the \u201cbenefits, concessions and advantages illegally purchased by FCA\u201d was UAW support for \u201cWorld Class Manufacturing,\u201d a version of Toyota Motor Corp\u2019s lean production strategy but adapted to the culture of Italian automaker Fiat.  That system has been credited in part for helping to turn around struggling operations like FCA\u2019s plant in Toledo, Ohio, that makes the popular and profitable Jeep Wrangler.  The suit also claims that after a failed bid to take over GM in 2015, FCA corrupted the collective bargaining process by structuring terms through bribed UAW officials that \u201cforced unanticipated costs on GM.\u201d  The lawsuit says that under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), FCA would be liable to pay GM three times the actual damages caused, plus interest, punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.  GM alleges that FCA, under the leadership of former CEO Marchionne, used bribes to UAW officials to corrupt the collective bargaining process from 2009 through 2015. Marchionne died in 2018.  Fiat took control of Chrysler after it emerged from a U.S. government-funded bankruptcy in 2009.  \u201cMarchionne was a central figure in the conceiving, executing and sponsoring of the fraudulent activity,\u201d Glidden said.  When GM rejected a merger bid from FCA, the lawsuit alleges Marchionne conspired to negotiate a new four-year contract \u201cdesigned, through the power of pattern bargaining, to cost GM billions.\u201d  The UAW has been the focus of a spreading federal corruption probe.  Gary Jones, the UAW president who recently had taken a leave of absence, on Wednesday resigned effective immediately just hours after the union said it would seek to remove Jones from office, a union source told Reuters.  Jones\u2019 lawyer Bruce Maffeo told the Detroit News the decision was based \u201con his belief that his continuing to serve will only distract the union.\u201d A UAW spokesman could not confirm the resignation.  Last week, the UAW\u2019s acting president unveiled a series of reforms designed to prevent further scandals.  Glidden said the automaker supports those reform efforts.","13":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co and the United Auto Workers union have reached a tentative agreement for a new labor deal to end a month-long nationwide strike by about 48,000 hourly workers, the union said on Wednesday.

REUTERS\/Bryan Woolston  UAW officials and striking workers on the picket lines had said their focus in the dispute with GM was on jobs, pay equity and fairness for workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy. They also wanted to save factories in Ohio and Michigan GM had threatened to close.  This year\u2019s talks - also occurring with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  The following is a timeline of events leading up to the tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the workers:  Nov. 26, 2018  GM announced the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s biggest restructuring since its 2009 bankruptcy, putting five North American plants on notice for potential closure and saying it would cut nearly 15,000 jobs.  The UAW, which represents U.S. workers at the four U.S. plants targeted, vowed to fight the cuts.  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that GM save the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that was targeted.  Nov. 27, 2018  Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants.  Dec. 5, 2018  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra warned the Detroit company had excess manufacturing capacity, and said the Lordstown plant\u2019s future would be determined during the 2019 labor talks.  Dec. 14, 2018  GM said more than 1,100 of the 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at plants losing production had volunteered to transfer to other plants. That number has risen since then to more than 2,300.  Jan. 3, 2019  The UAW sued GM in federal court, claiming its use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violated its labor deal.  Feb. 22, 2019  GM extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, instead of ending work in June as earlier planned. However, on March 6, the last Chevrolet Cruze small car rolled off the assembly line at the Lordstown plant.  Feb. 26, 2019  The UAW sued GM over its restructuring plan, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.  March 13, 2019  UAW President Gary Jones at the union\u2019s bargaining convention in Detroit said job security and stopping the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico were top priorities for the contract talks.  March 18, 2019  U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged Norwood Jewell, a former high-ranking UAW official in charge of labor relations with Fiat Chrysler, of misusing funds to pay for lavish parties for himself and other union officials. The following month, he pleaded guilty.  May 8, 2019  GM said it was in talks to sell the idled Lordstown plant to a cash-strapped electric vehicle startup, Workhorse Group Inc. GM also said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio plants. The UAW called on GM to put a new product of its own in the plant.

July 16, 2019  GM and the UAW formally kicked off talks for a new four-year labor deal, with Jones calling on the automaker to keep open plants it had slated for shutdown.  Aug. 28, 2019  The FBI conducted searches at the home of Jones and other locations as part of a corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.  Sept. 3, 2019  The UAW said it would target GM first in talks with the Detroit automakers for contracts set to expire on Sept. 14.  Sept. 12, 2019  U.S. prosecutors\u2019 probe of alleged corruption within the UAW expanded with the arrest of a senior union official. In a criminal complaint released the following day, a source said Jones was one of the unnamed officials singled out.  Sept. 16, 2019  The UAW workers went on strike against GM. The automaker disclosed it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in new investments, solutions for the Lordstown and Detroit assembly plants that included a battery plant in Ohio and an electric vehicle for the Michigan plant, a pay increase and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  Sept. 17, 2019  GM shifted health insurance costs for the striking workers to the UAW, prompting an outcry from the union and Democratic politicians. On Sept. 26, GM reversed its decision.  Oct. 1, 2019  The UAW rejected a new offer from GM to end the strike. Five days later, UAW senior negotiator Terry Dittes said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and later called on GM to boost U.S. auto production.  Oct. 10, 2019  The union disclosed that GM\u2019s Barra met with the UAW\u2019s Jones and Dittes at the company\u2019s Detroit headquarters, seeking to speed up talks, as the strike neared its fourth week.  Oct. 11, 2019  GM took the unusual step of appealing directly to striking employees, circumventing UAW\u2019s leadership, in a blog post that laid out the terms of its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, upsetting the UAW in the process.

The No.1 U.S. automaker shared Barra\u2019s letter, sent to its staff on Saturday, with thousands of dealers and suppliers.  Barra also said she was commissioning an inclusion advisory board at the company.  A host of U.S. companies including Intel Corp, Netflix Inc, Nike Inc and Facebook Inc, have taken a stand against Floyd\u2019s death - voicing concerns about discrimination against African-Americans.

REUTERS\/Bryan Woolston\/File Photo  (This version corrects paragraph 3 of September 23 story to read Center for Automotive Research and not Center for Auto Safety)  (Reuters) - The use of temporary workers is a key bargaining issue in negotiations between General Motors Co and the striking United Auto Workers union over a new four-year contract.  Details of their proposals have not been disclosed. The union approved the occasional use of temporary workers by U.S. automakers during the last contract talks in 2015, when the two sides agreed to gradually phase out the existing two-tier wage structure.  Temporary workers represent about 20% of the workforce at Japanese automakers in the United Sates and are paid an average of $50 an hour, according to figures compiled by Automotive News and the Center for Automotive Research. In comparison, GM pays its workers an average $63 an hour. Temp workers, who typically make less than $20 an hour and have limited benefits, account for about 7% of its U.S. workforce.  GM says it can reduce labor costs and safeguard union jobs by using more temporary workers.  The use of temporary workers also allows the Detroit automakers to cover for high rates of absenteeism among UAW workers. The companies want the UAW to agree to stricter rules to discourage workers from failing to show up for their shifts.  The union, which has seen its membership dwindle to less than 400,000 from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979, granted U.S. automakers numerous concessions 10 years ago to help the industry weather the Great Recession and the resulting bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler.  One of the biggest givebacks was an agreement in 2009 to end the controversial jobs bank, which guaranteed laid-off workers would receive up to 90% of their regular pay. The jobs bank was approved in 1984 and expanded in 1990. Ultimately, it cost U.S. automakers billions of dollars to keep unemployed automakers on the payroll.  The two sides also are wrangling over how much union members should pay for spiraling health care costs, which once were covered entirely by the manufacturers.","16":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Monday asked a U.S. federal judge to reinstate a racketeering lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), saying it has new information on foreign accounts used in an alleged bribery scheme involving its smaller rival and union leaders.

FILE PHOTO: Morning commuters travel in rush hour traffic towards Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The move by firms including General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, follows legal challenges by California and 22 states and environmental groups in September.  Those challenges aim to undo the Trump administration\u2019s determination, issued in September, that federal law bars California from setting stiff tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.  In their filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the automakers and the National Automobile Dealers Association said they backed the administration bid to bar individual emissions rules by states.  They asked to intervene, arguing the administration\u2019s rule provided \u201cvehicle manufacturers with the certainty that states cannot interfere with federal fuel economy standards.\u201d  The decision to side with President Donald Trump could prompt a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.  It also poses a risk for automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in next year\u2019s election and reverses Trump\u2019s actions, and also reinstates California\u2019s right to set its own rules and tougher national emissions standards adopted by President Barack Obama.  A spokeswoman for California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said the action \u201cdoesn\u2019t change our resolve to fight as long and hard as necessary to protect our standards.\u201d  She added, \u201cThe courts have upheld our authority to set standards before and we\u2019re hopeful they will yet again.\u201d  Other automakers, such as Ford Motor Co F.N, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, which announced a voluntary deal with California in July on emissions rules, are not joining the bid to intervene on the administration's side.  The group backing Trump also includes Mazda 7261.T, Nissan Motor Co 7201.T, Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS and Subaru Co 9778.T.  John Bozzella, president and chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing major foreign firms, said the companies had little choice but to back the administration.  \u201cIt\u2019s been the federal policy for the better part of 40 years that the federal government has the sole responsibility for regulating fuel economy standards, but it doesn\u2019t have to get to that,\u201d Bozzella told reporters, speaking for an ad-hoc group, the Coalition for Sustainable Automotive Regulation.  \u201cWe can still reach an agreement\u201d on fuel economy rules, Bozzella said, adding that companies still support a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d between California and the administration that would see rising attainable fuel efficiency requirements. He said the Trump administration did not ask the automakers to intervene.  Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, had harsh words for the automakers.  \u201cInstead of choosing the responsible path forged by four automakers and the state of California, one that will move us toward the cleaner, alternative fuel vehicles of the future, these companies have chosen to head down a dead-end road,\u201d Carper said in a statement.  A group of major environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists and Natural Resources Defense Council, sued in September to block the determination.  On Friday, seven U.S. states, including Alabama, Ohio, Texas, Utah and West Virginia, also filed in support of the Trump regulation, arguing that without the rule their residents would have to pay \u201chigher vehicle costs.\u201d  In Aug. 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed freezing fuel efficiency requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.  The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2026, with average annual increases of nearly 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration\u2019s preferred option.  The final rule is expected to modestly boost fuel efficiency from the initial proposal, with some automakers anticipating annual increases of about 1.5%, but still much less stringent than the Obama rules.  The group was not taking a position on what those requirements should be, Bozzella emphasized, but reiterated they should continue to rise annually.  \u201cThe decision to intervene in the lawsuit is about how the standard should be applied, not what the standard should be,\u201d Bozzella said.  The announcement showed an industry split.  After the four automakers, including BMW AG, announced the voluntary California pact, the Justice Department warned them the agreement \u201cmay violate federal antitrust laws,\u201d according to documents seen by Reuters.","18":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N are using fast-payment programs set up with financial lenders to help cash-strapped small suppliers survive production shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  FILE PHOTO: A partially assembled V6 engine, used in a variety of General Motors cars, trucks and crossovers, moves down the assembly line at the GM Romulus Powertrain plant in Romulus, Michigan, U.S. August 21, 2019. Picture taken August 21, 2019. Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Keeping small suppliers afloat financially is critical for the automakers as they try to restart North American factories and generate cash from sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.  The programs pay suppliers up front for bills that typically take 40 to 60 days to settle. For many suppliers, checks for the last work done prior to the shutdown of North American auto plants arrived earlier this month, and no new payments would land until July or August.  GM started its \"Early Payment Program\" last August with Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, and now is using it as a way to support suppliers during the pandemic, especially as they roll out new technologies, GM spokesman David Barnas said. GM operated a similar program with General Electric Co GE.N prior to 2008.  Under the deal, a supplier gets an earlier payment from Wells Fargo for the full invoice, after paying a financing fee. GM later pays Wells Fargo the full amount.  Ford\u2019s program works similarly.  GM said the cost of financing under its program is linked to the automaker\u2019s credit rating and not the supplier\u2019s, allowing the smaller companies to leverage GM\u2019s financial strength and achieve lower costs. It did not disclose other financial details.  Seventeen suppliers have participated in GM\u2019s program and another two dozen are in talks to join as interest has increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, Barnas said.  Some supplier executives and analysts compared the potential cost of taking accelerated payments to credit-card debt. Some of these programs can cost more than a line of credit with interest rates in some cases running as high as 3% to 4% per 30 days.  \u201cIt is not a silver bullet,\u201d said Scott Eisenberg, partner with restructuring advisory firm Amherst Partners.  The pressure on suppliers may only increase in the third quarter as banks pull back on making loans, Eisenberg said. \u201cIf we have this second (coronavirus) wave in the fall, the access to capital that everyone had in March won\u2019t be the same in September and October.\u201d  Bob Roth, co-owner of RoMan Manufacturing, which makes transformers and glass molding equipment in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said companies with stronger balance sheets, like his, can avoid such deals. But others have no option.  \u201cThe cost of such deals compared to the cost of being out of business is not really a choice,\u201d he said.  Ford launched its program late last week, initially with a small group of suppliers that ship to its U.S. plants with the intent of expanding more broadly in the future, spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said.  Ford is working with London-based Greensill, which provides working capital finance for businesses globally, and financial technology company C2FO, she said. Greensill declined to comment.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N said only that it is using \"myriad\" approaches to support struggling suppliers.","19":"(.)  Oct 1 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Tuesday it rejected a new comprehensive offer made by General Motors Co to end a two-week-old strike, saying it came up short on a number of fronts.  The union said it had made a new counterproposal and warned \u201cthere are still many important issues that remain unresolved.\u201d Also on Tuesday, GM said the ongoing strike by U.S. workers forced it to halt production at its pickup and transmission plants in Silao, Mexico, resulting in temporary layoffs of 6,000 workers.  About 48,000 UAW members went on strike on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker\u2019s profit and protection of their healthcare.  UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a letter to members the GM offer \u201ccame up short\u201d on issues like healthcare, wages, temporary workers and job security, \u201cto name a few.\u201d GM is still seeking some concessions, the union added, saying it is committed \u201cto exploring all options in order to reach an agreement.\u201d  GM said in a statement it continues \u201cto negotiate and exchange proposals, and remain committed to reaching an agreement that builds a stronger future for our employees and our company.\u201d  Still, the statements that GM and the UAW are now exchanging \u201ccomprehensive proposals\u201d indicate the talks have shifted into a higher gear as both the automaker and striking UAW workers feel an economic bite from the dispute.  The strike had previously forced GM to lay off at least 2,000 Canadian workers and temporarily close an engine plant in Mexico.  Many suppliers have been forced to halt or scale back some operations.  JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in a research note on Tuesday that the strike has cost GM over $1 billion but it may be able to recover a portion of lost profit in the fourth quarter. He said GM has $82 million a day in lost profit.  GM in Mexico said that \u201cfor the moment\u201d its three other Mexican plants \u2013 Ramos Arizpe, San Luis Potosi and Toluca \u2013 are working normally. A spokesman in Mexico said the plants still had parts available but that the company could not say how many more days the plants would remain open. The spokesman declined to estimate the daily cost of suspending operations at the Silao complex.  The 6,000 affected workers are being paid a percentage of their salary, the spokesman said, with some workers using vacation time to continue receiving their full salaries.

But the deal came into question after a short seller criticised Nikola as a fraud, something Nikola has denied.  The new agreement, a non-binding memorandum of understanding that doesn\u2019t expire until the end of 2021, is subject to negotiation and a definitive deal, Nikola and GM said in separate statements.  Under the new deal, GM will supply its fuel-cell system for Nikola\u2019s Class 7 and Class 8 commercial semi-trucks, Nikola said. The companies are also discussing Nikola\u2019s potential use of GM\u2019s Ultium electric battery system in its commercial trailers.  Nikola officials said the new deal focuses on the fuel-cell side of the business, where they see the greatest potential. They also said they remain confident of signing a deal by year end with an energy partner to build hydrogen-refueling stations.  Nikola\u2019s shares sank almost 25% in afternoon trading, while GM\u2019s fell 1.7%.  J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster said in a research note GM\u2019s decision not to take a stake in Nikola as originally planned would weigh on Nikola\u2019s shares, but longer term, the new agreement was positive for the startup as it could now focus on its commercial truck business.  In addition, the lock-up period preventing the sale of 161 million shares expires on Tuesday. That could put even more pressure on Nikola\u2019s value if they are sold because the stock\u2019s current float is only 117 million shares, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said. Most of the locked-up shares are owned by founder Trevor Milton, who resigned in September.  A spokesman for Milton, who owns 91.6 million shares in Nikola, declined to comment on his intentions for the stake.

REUTERS\/Massimo Pinca  Fiat Chrysler's motion to dismiss GM's civil racketeering lawsuit was expected. The company has said GM's lawsuit is baseless and aimed at disrupting the Italian-American automaker's proposed merger with France's Peugeot SA PEUP.PA.  GM general counsel Craig Glidden told reporters in November the FCA-PSA merger had nothing to do with GM\u2019s legal action.  Fiat Chrysler\u2019s arguments were filed on Friday evening in U.S. District Court in Detroit.  In response, GM said it remained confident in the legal underpinnings of its case and will respond in court.  \u201cWe are confident in the legal and factual underpinnings of our case, which have already been documented in part through the guilty pleas and admissions of FCA executives made in connection with the government\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation\u201d, GM said in a statement.  GM sued Fiat Chrysler in November charging its rival with bribing officials of the United Auto Workers union in order to gain advantages in 2009 and 2015 labor contracts and have the UAW withhold those terms from GM. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s now deceased Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne sat \u201cat the center\u201d of the schemes, GM charged in its lawsuit.  In its response Friday, Fiat Chrysler rejected GM\u2019s claim that Marchionne tried to force a merger between GM and FCA by agreeing to labor contracts that favored the UAW.  GM failed to show \u201cwhy Mr. Marchionne would want to saddle FCA and GM with unfavorable CBAs (collective bargaining agreements) if his ultimate goal was to run the merged company (presumably on a profitable basis).\u201d  GM\u2019s accusations relied in part on revelations from an active federal criminal investigation of corruption within the UAW. That investigation began at Fiat Chrysler but has since spread to past and present UAW officials at GM.  In its motion on Friday, Fiat Chrysler said GM\u2019s lawsuit was \u201cfatally flawed\u201d for several reasons.  The lawsuit was filed after a four-year statute of limitations had expired, Fiat Chrysler argued. GM is not a direct victim of wrongdoing by FCA executives or UAW officials related to labor contracts, and so cannot bring a RICO action, FCA argued in its motion.  The UAW is such a large organization, \u201cthe notion that FCA seized control of the UAW by virtue of the alleged prohibited payments is implausible on its face,\u201d the FCA brief stated.  Further, Fiat Chrysler argued that GM\u2019s allegations about corrupt contract negotiations should be heard by the National Labor Relations Board, not by a federal court.","24":"March 26 (Reuters) - General Motors Co:  * GENERAL MOTORS SAYS GM\u2019S BUSINESS & BALANCE SHEET WAS \u201cVERY STRONG\u201d BEFORE COVID-19 OUTBREAK  * GENERAL MOTORS SAYS STEPS CO IS TAKING NOW WILL HELP ENSURE THAT CO CAN REGAIN MOMENTUM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS OVER  * GENERAL MOTORS SAYS GLOBALLY, ALL GM SALARIED EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE 20% OF THEIR CASH COMPENSATION DEFERRED BEGINNING APRIL 1  * GENERAL MOTORS - DEFERMENT IN SALARIED EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION WILL BE REPAID IN LUMP SUM NO LATER THAN MARCH 15, 2021  * GENERAL MOTORS - EXECUTIVES WILL SEE TOTAL OF 25% REDUCTION AND 30% FOR SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM  * GENERAL MOTORS - BOARD WILL TAKE 20% REDUCTION IN COMPENSATION  * GENERAL MOTORS - HEALTHCARE BENEFITS ARE NOT IMPACTED  * GENERAL MOTORS - ABOUT 6,500 SALARIED EMPLOYEES IN THE U.S. WILL PARTICIPATE IN SPDA IN LIEU OF SALARIED DEFERRAL PROGRAM  * GENERAL MOTORS - SALARIED EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN SALARIED DEFERRAL PROGRAM WILL RECEIVE 75% OF THEIR PAY WHILE ON SDPA  * GENERAL MOTORS - MOST AFFECTED EMPLOYEES ARE IN SALARIED MANUFACTURING\/ENGINEERING ROLES & ARE NOT ABLE TO WORK REMOTELY  * GENERAL MOTORS - COUNTRIES ARE EVALUATING APPROPRIATE USE OF SIMILAR SALARIED DEFERRAL PROGRAMS Further company coverage:","25":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O and General Motors Co GM.N, which have lobbied Congress to lift a cap on electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, could get their way for up to four years under a new proposal from a Republican senator.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  On Thursday, Senator Dean Heller proposed legislation that would lift the current cap on electric vehicles eligible for tax credits. Reuters obtained a copy of the text of the previously unreported bill, which has not been posted on the Senate website.  Under current law, once a manufacturer hits 200,000 EVs sold, the tax credit phases out starting in the following quarter. Heller\u2019s bill lifts the individual manufacturer cap but would phase out the credit for the entire industry in 2022.  Last week, Tesla said orders for cars placed by Monday would be eligible for a full federal tax credit of $7,500 and these customers will get their cars delivered by the end of the year. Tesla said in July it had hit the 200,000 vehicle threshold, which under law will result in the tax credit being reduced by 50 percent for six months and then cut to $1,875 for another six months until it ends.  GM has said it expects to hit the 200,000 threshold by the end of the year.  Both GM and Tesla have lobbied Congress on the issue, according to federal disclosure reports and interviews with lawmakers. Tesla declined to comment.  GM declined to comment on the Heller bill but said it is important \u201cto provide a federal tax credit for consumers to help make electric vehicles more affordable for all customers.\u201d GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has called for lifting the cap.  Other automakers are split over whether to back the effort. Some automakers think the credit should be limited to vehicles below a certain price, while others argue Heller\u2019s bill would penalize automakers that have not started selling EVs in big numbers.  Last week, Senator John Barrasso a Republican who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, proposed legislation to end the EV tax credit entirely and impose a new tax on EVs to fund highway repairs.  Senate Democrats are opposed to Barasso\u2019s measure. \u201cRepealing a policy that helps combat climate change is the absolute wrong decision,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax-writing Finance Committee.  Last month, seven Democratic senators introduced legislation to lift the EV cap and extend it for 10 years. It would also allow buyers to use the tax credit as a \u201cpoint of sale rebate.\u201d","26":"(Adds GM share price, background on air taxis and other automakers)  DETROIT, Sept 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is exploring options in the aerial taxi market, including whether to build the vehicles known colloquially as \u201cflying cars,\u201d as part of a push by the U.S. automaker to look for growth in related transportation markets, two people familiar with the matter said.  Chief Executive Mary Barra on Monday briefly made her first reference ever to Detroit-based GM\u2019s interest in the air taxi market, saying that it fit with development of electric vehicles (EVs) and its Ultium advanced electric battery.  \u201cWe believe strongly in our EV future and not just for vehicles,\u201d she said at an RBC conference. \u201cThe strength and flexibility of our Ultium battery system opens doors\u201d for many uses, she added, \u201cincluding aerial mobility.\u201d  Air taxis are vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that use electric motors instead of jet engines. Designed to avoid the need for long runways, they have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.  Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they could add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.  GM spokesman Stuart Fowle declined to elaborate. \u201cIt\u2019s an area we\u2019re really excited about and looking at.\u201d  GM shares were up almost 2% in midday trading.  Corporate and private investors have poured at least $2.3 billion into more than 100 aerial vehicle startups, including drones and electric air taxis, but the technology still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to investor website PitchBook.  GM is weighing all options - whether to build, supply or partner - as it decides whether to join such automakers as Hyundai Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG and Geely Automobile in the still-developing market, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. GM could make an announcement early next year.  GM\u2019s study of the aerial mobility market is part of the push by GM\u2019s innovation group to explore other transportation markets for growth, one of the sources said. The group is headed by Alan Wexler, who reports to Barra and was hired in July in the newly created position of senior vice president of innovation and growth.  Other efforts that originated in the innovation group include formation of a defense business unit and a $214 million contract to build troop carriers for the U.S. Army based on the Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as a new mobile app for OnStar members.  Hyundai teamed up with Uber Technologies Inc in January to develop electric air taxis and has pledged to invest $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025.  Toyota led a $590 million investment round in air taxi startup Joby in January, while Daimler and Geely have invested in Stuttgart-based Volocopter. Volkswagen\u2019s Porsche brand is working with Boeing to develop a concept electric flying vehicle.  Last year, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called electric supersonic VTOL a \u201chard problem,\u201d and last month said a more powerful battery that could enable electric airplanes was three to four years away. Musk has said \u201cmany exciting things\u201d will be unveiled during Tesla\u2019s Battery Day on Sept. 22.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co shifted health insurance costs for its striking workers to the United Auto Workers union as its members walked the picket line for the second day on Tuesday.  The UAW on Monday launched the first company-wide strike at GM in 12 years, saying negotiations toward a new national agreement covering about 48,000 hourly workers had hit an impasse.  This year\u2019s talks between the union and GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) were expected to be tough, with thorny issues such as healthcare costs, profit-sharing and the use of temporary workers on the table.  The UAW said Tuesday that some progress had been made during talks. As of Tuesday evening, talks were still continuing among some committee-level bargaining groups but no deal was imminent, officials said. The strike has now surpassed the length of the nearly two-day 2007 GM work stoppage.  Workers on picket lines outside GM factories waved signs declaring \u201cUAW On Strike.\u201d In Bowling Green, Kentucky, they blocked the three entrances to the assembly plant, which normally builds the Chevrolet Corvette.  Salina Alexander, who works in the Kentucky plant\u2019s paint shop, said the strike is about GM sharing some of its profits with union-represented employees who helped bail out the carmaker during its bankruptcy. \u201cWe hung in there with them. They can give us something back.\u201d  Meanwhile, GM said coverage for the striking workers\u2019 health insurance reverted to the union, which unsuccessfully sought to have the No. 1 U.S. automaker cover those costs through the end of the month. That places another drain on the union\u2019s strike fund.  \u201cWe understand strikes are difficult and disruptive to families,\u201d GM spokesman Jim Cain said in an email. \u201cWhile on strike, some benefits shift to being funded by the union\u2019s strike fund, and in this case hourly employees are eligible for union-paid COBRA so their health care benefits can continue.\u201d  GM has said in the past that it annually spends about $1 billion a year on healthcare coverage for its hourly workers, suggesting the monthly cost per worker is in the range of $1,700 to $2,000. The UAW on its website said its strike fund covers certain benefits such as medical and prescription drugs, but not dental, vision and hearing. (uaw.org\/strike-faq\/)  Slideshow ( 10 images )  A UAW spokesman had no immediate comment, but Terry Dittes, vice president in charge of the union\u2019s GM department, in a letter to union leaders on Tuesday, said the UAW would review its legal options regarding GM\u2019s decision.  During the walkout, UAW members also receive $250 a week from the union\u2019s strike fund.  Slideshow ( 10 images )  In a statement on Sunday, GM outlined its offer to the union, saying the package included plans for Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products, $7 billion in U.S. investment and a signing bonus of $8,000 per worker. GM also said the union would retain \u201cnationally leading\u201d health care benefits.  Charlie Highlander, 59, who also works in the Bowling Green plant\u2019s paint shop, said the strike was about protecting the rights of younger workers who are paid at a lower wage or are hired as temporary workers.  \u201cI\u2019m out here mostly for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the young people for me.\u201d  The contract talks with GM have been overshadowed by a mushrooming U.S. federal corruption probe of top union officials. The investigation has raised questions about UAW President Gary Jones, who a source said was an unnamed official cited in a federal complaint last week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.  The strike has also become a political issue, and both U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats who want to unseat him in 2020 have weighed in. Trump and Democrats see the votes of UAW members in the Midwest as critical to victory.  GM\u2019s workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the automaker more than $2 billion.","28":"March 17 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday an employee at its Cole Engineering Center in Warren tested positive for coronavirus.

FILE PHOTO: General Motors Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra announces a major investment focused on the development of GM future technologies at the GM Orion Assembly Plant in Lake Orion, Michigan, U.S. March 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  But investors want her to go further. A 10% jump in GM\u2019s shares on Tuesday helped the stock top its post-financial crisis 2010 initial public offering of $33. Some investors want Barra to split up the company so its EV assets can be valued at headier levels like Tesla and other newly public EV automakers.  On Tuesday, GM announced a deal to take an 11% stake in and build electric pickup trucks for Nikola Corp, as well as supply the EV startup with electric batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. Last week, GM also announced a North American alliance with Japan\u2019s Honda Motor Co Ltd to share vehicle platforms, including EVs, in an agreement that could save it billions of dollars.  Barra on Tuesday called the Nikola deal a \u201cstrong validation\u201d of GM\u2019s strategy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong proof point of our commitment to an all-EV future and really creating a platform that others can use that\u2019s going to give us scale and help us drive efficiency costs down,\u201d she told reporters on a conference call.  Barra over the past several years has accelerated a strategy of using profit from internal combustion models to fund development of battery and fuel-cell powered vehicles for tomorrow.  But prior to the recent deals, Morgan Stanley found that of 40 investors surveyed, 72% believe GM will eventually spin off its EV or autonomous vehicle assets and about half thought such a move could be completed by the end of 2021.  During GM\u2019s July 29 quarterly earnings call, Barra said nothing was off the table and there was no impediment to such a move. A person close to the matter who asked not to be identified said the Detroit company is exploring its options.  Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has pushed the idea of some kind of separation at GM for years, said whether it is a spinoff or some other structure, investors want \u201canything different\u201d given GM\u2019s lackluster stock price.  \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to capitalize on these assets, strategically, they should do it because the market\u2019s certainly not giving them much value for a very improved automotive business,\u201d said Michael Razewski, a partner with investment adviser Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which owns GM shares.  OTHER OPTIONS  GM insiders, bankers and industry officials said GM has options beyond a full spinoff of its EV operations, or doing nothing.  Other choices could include a spinoff of just GM\u2019s Ultium battery operations; hiving off the EV assets into a fully owned but separately listed stock, much like GM did in its earlier history with Hughes Electronics and Electronic Data Systems; or breaking out the EV assets within GM as it did with the Cruise self-driving business.  Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner said a spinoff was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d that would unlock shareholder value and create a company worth anywhere from $20 billion to almost $200 billion.  Alastair Bishop, co-portfolio manager of BlackRock\u2019s BGF Future of Transport Fund, declined to discuss GM specifically but said the auto sector stands on the brink of a transformation similar to the one that occurred with utilities when adoption of renewable energy began.  Some traditional utilities spun off their renewable energy assets and others held on to them, but there was no rule for which companies thrived, he said.  \u201cIf you look over the next five, 10 years, something very similar will happen in the automotive space,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cNot every new entrant will be a winner, just as not every incumbent will be a loser. It\u2019s going to be a bit more nuanced.\u201d","31":"FILE PHOTO - The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019.

GM has in recent weeks warned its employees in Brazil that \u201csacrifices\u201d would be necessary for the company to return to profit in the country, raising concerns about layoffs or shuttered assembly lines. Last month, the carmaker told public officials and unions it was in talks with Sao Paulo state about tax incentives.  Valor reported that GM would invest in its product line until 2022, and then the following year, the company would start to enjoy tax rebates. Valor, which also reported that GM\u2019s losses in Brazil last year totaled 1 billion reais despite being the country\u2019s market leader, did not specify the exact amount GM would expect to generate in tax incentives.  GM declined to comment.  Last year, Brazil\u2019s government granted carmakers a 15-year package of tax breaks \u2013 extending subsidies for an industry that has struggled to compete directly with production elsewhere despite high import barriers.

GM plans to announce a broader restructuring of its efforts as it shifts more of its focus toward electrified and autonomous vehicles, the source said.

GM said that despite forecasts of decline in U.S. and China passenger car sales, the company expects 2018 profit to exceed Wall Street expectations, and promised higher earnings per share in 2019. Chief Executive Mary Barra, in her presentation to investors on Friday, stood her ground on cost-cutting actions that have provoked threats of retribution from U.S. President Donald Trump and outrage from unions and elected officials in the affected states.  \u201cBecause of the actions we have been taking for several years, General Motors enters 2019 leaner, more agile and positioned to win,\u201d Barra told investors at the New York presentation.  The market cheered GM\u2019s forecast, sending the company\u2019s stock up nearly 8 percent.  \u201cWe\u2019re very much looking forward to the execution of what they\u2019ve announced,\u201d said Tim Piechowski, portfolio manager with ACR Alpine Capital Research, which owns GM shares. Piechowski said GM\u2019s core business, its stake in ride services company Lyft and its Cruise self-driving car unit are together worth more than the company\u2019s recent share price indicates.  Barra also said proposals from Ohio officials that GM sell its Lordstown, Ohio, small car factory to Tesla are \u201cmoot\u201d because Tesla is \u201cnot interested in our GM workforce represented by the UAW,\u201d the United Auto Workers union.  As Barra spoke with investors in New York, hundreds of GM workers demonstrated in Windsor, Ontario, across the Detroit River from GM headquarters, protesting the company\u2019s plan to shut its Oshawa, Ontario, vehicle assembly plant. The UAW is suing GM in connection with U.S. plant shutdown plans, and on Friday called on GM to build its new electric vehicles in the United States.  GM's bullish outlook coincided with new cost-slashing actions by rival Ford Motor Co F.N, which on Thursday outlined plans to cut thousands of jobs in its European operations and kill an experiment in providing van rides. Ford executives are scheduled to meet with investors next week on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.  Barra and her lieutenants have spent the last two years pushing a strategy to exit unprofitable markets in Europe and developing markets, restructuring money-losing operations in South Korea, and killing unprofitable car lines in North America. In November it put five North American factories, including four in the United States, on notice for closure, and cut almost 15,000 jobs.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cWe are no longer investing in things that don\u2019t make money,\u201d GM President Mark Reuss told investors on Friday. \u201cThe future is coming fast. We are doing everything we need to do as fast as we can.\u201d  ELECTRIFYING CADILLACS  That includes making the Cadillac brand \u201cthe tip of the corporate spear\u201d on electrification, Reuss said. He outlined plans to launch a new generation of electric vehicles that would be \u201cprofitable ... and attainable.\u201d  The automaker said Cadillac will become GM\u2019s lead electric vehicle brand as the largest U.S. automaker gears up to introduce a new model under that luxury brand to challenge Tesla, a development first reported by Reuters on Thursday.  Tesla\u2019s market capitalization is higher than GM\u2019s, even though the electric carmaker has never posted a full-year profit.  GM is relying on profit from sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America to fund its electrification push. The battle in that lucrative market is intensifying among the Detroit Three automakers as sales of small cars in the United States shrivel. Both GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N have launched revamped pickup trucks in a bid to take more share in the U.S. auto industry's most profitable segment.  Still, GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara emphasized to investors on Friday that the large pickup market is a three-company oligopoly protected by \u201ccompetitive moats.\u201d Those include a 25 percent U.S. tariff on imported trucks that predates the Trump administration\u2019s trade actions.  GM's biggest market by vehicle sales volume is China, and the economic slowdown in the world's largest auto market has rattled investors across industries. Apple Inc AAPL.O, for instance, last week took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast, blaming slowing iPhone sales in China.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  GM\u2019s China president, Matt Tsien, told investors on Friday that industry-wide auto sales in that country should stay roughly flat in 2019 after the 2018 decline. GM is taking actions to cut costs, including increasing automation in its Chinese plants and pushing down purchasing costs, he said. Cost-cutting coupled with 20 new or redesigned vehicles that will launch in China this year will sustain the company\u2019s profit, he said.  \u201cOverall, GM is in a good position to mitigate the headwinds\u201d in China, Tsien said.  Kyle Martin, research analyst with Westwood management in Dallas, Texas, which owns GM shares, said GM\u2019s macroeconomic assumptions are \u201cnot conservative, for sure. For China to be flat, you\u2019re going to need some stimulus.\u201d  GM, with its Chinese partners, sells more vehicles in China than in the United States. The automaker builds locally most of the vehicles it sells in China.  BULLISH EARNINGS OUTLOOK  GM said it expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $7.00, above the $5.86 expected by analysts according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  \u201cBottom line, we believe management just reset the bar higher for earnings and cash flow despite increased macro concerns among investors,\u201d Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note.  The company said it expects adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2019 to come in between $4.5 billion and $6 billion.  Still, CEO Barra faces pressure to lift GM\u2019s share price, which has lagged broader market performance. The company has confronted challenges from activist shareholders twice during the past four years.  GM shares rose as much as 9.3 percent on Friday and were still up 7.8 percent at $37.45 in afternoon trading.","34":"March 19 (Reuters) - General Motors Co:  * GM ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE MOVES IN CANADA AND MIDDLE EAST  * GENERAL MOTORS CO - MARIO SPANGENBERG, CURRENTLY PRESIDENT AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GM AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST OPERATIONS, HAS ELECTED TO RETIRE JULY 1  * GENERAL MOTORS CO - JOHN ROTH, NAMED PRESIDENT AND MANAGING DIRECTOR OF GM AFRICA AND MIDDLE EAST OPERATIONS, EFFECTIVE JUNE 1  * \u200dGM SAYS SCOTT BELL, CURRENTLY DIRECTOR OF SALES OPERATIONS FOR CHEVROLET IN THE U.S., HAS BEEN NAMED VP, GM CANADA MARKETING, SALES AND SERVICE\u200b Source text : [bit.ly\/2FRU7P3] Further company coverage:","35":"(Adds GM not commenting, background)  WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co chief executive Mary Barra may go to Ohio with President Donald Trump to attend a meeting in the state where the largest U.S. automaker has ended production at a car assembly plant, an aide to Trump said Friday.

GM has been in talks to sell the Ohio plant to electric vehicle startup Workhorse Group Inc and an affiliated, newly formed entity.

On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said motor vehicle and parts manufacturing employment had fallen by 900 jobs to 995,000 over the last year but was up by more than 40,000 jobs since Trump took office in 2017.  Last week, Trump criticized GM on Twitter, writing that the company \u201cwhich was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there.\u201d  Trump appeared to be referring to a Bloomberg News story last week that reported GM\u2019s hourly workforce of 46,000 U.S. workers had fallen behind that of Fiat Chrysler as the smallest of the Detroit Three automakers. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s tally includes temporary workers, but GM has not disclosed its comparable figure.  The president previously attacked GM for building vehicles in Mexico and for ending production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland.

General Motors debuts the new 2019 GMC Sierra Denali pickup truck at the Russell Industrial Center in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  That battle will be fought in truck-heavy states like Texas, where consumers aspire to luxury pickup trucks more than luxury car brands such as Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz and BMW BMWG.DE.  \u201cThe whole (luxury truck) segment is going to be exceptionally competitive for at least the next 24 months, because Ford and Fiat Chrysler will not take this lying down,\u201d IHS Markit auto analyst Tom Libby said of GM unit GMC\u2019s new Sierra Denali.  Detroit\u2019s automakers dominate the U.S. pickup truck market.  \u201cThere has been some softness in the (overall) market, but the market for these trucks is still very strong,\u201d GM\u2019s global product development chief Mark Reuss said at the event on Thursday.  Unlike some past GMC vehicles, the new 2019 Sierra Denali pickup, a premium version of the standard Sierra, has been designed from scratch. GMC has been criticized previously for simply selling glorified Chevrolet models at higher prices, a common industry practice.  The new Sierra Denali \u2014 GMC uses the Denali sub-brand on luxury trucks, SUVs and crossovers \u2014 has striking lines and features including a high-tech tailgate that opens six different ways.  The new Denali also features leather seats with heating and cooling functions, and a new infotainment system with a smartphone-like display screen. The pickup also has added leg-room in the back and luxury wood trimmings, though GM executives say the pickup has lost none of its functions as a heavy-duty work vehicle.  But even the old Sierra Denali\u2019s most striking detail was its price. Last year, the pickup truck\u2019s average transaction price was around $56,000, according to J.D. Power.  \u201cAs you can imagine, the Denali is a huge profit contributor to GM,\u201d GMC brand chief Duncan Aldred said. He declined to provide targets, but said GMC expects to grow its share of the luxury market. The 2019 Sierra Denali will go on sale late 2018.  A sticker price over $50,000 qualifies as \u201cpremium.\u201d  Slideshow ( 7 images )  According to Kelley Blue Book (KBB), the average transaction price in 2017 for all GMC Sierra models was $49,615. For Ford Motor Co's F.N F-Series trucks, it was $49,439, and a Fiat Chrysler Automobile NV (FCA) FCHA.MI Ram pickup averaged $46,789.  Those averages include far-cheaper models, but are still higher than the average for luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series, Audi's NSUG.DE A4 and Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T Lexus ES. For a graphic, see tmsnrt.rs\/2F11cR9  REVAMPED  Last month GM unveiled a revamped Chevrolet Silverado truck and forecast higher profits in 2019 thanks to its new high-margin pickup trucks.  The F-series has been the best-selling model line for 41 years, with 2017 sales of nearly 900,000 vehicles. GM sold a total of 947,972 of its four Chevrolet and GMC pickup models, two of which are mid-sized.  Around a third of Ford\u2019s F-Series pickup trucks count as premium, meaning around 12 percent of Ford\u2019s 2017 total U.S. sales were luxury trucks. Luxury models make up about 30 percent of FCA\u2019s pickup truck sales.  Pickup prices range from around $25,000 to as much as $100,000. Industry analysts estimate gross margins for some top-of-the-line trucks can exceed $50,000.  Margins matter more in a declining market.  U.S. new vehicle sales fell more than 2 percent in 2017 - and should drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones.  Passenger car sales declined 11 percent last year. But SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks rose 4.3 percent.  Major automakers posted lower U.S. new vehicle sales for February on Thursday as consumer demand continued to cool following a lengthy boom, despite strong crossovers and SUV sales.  Luxury pickups are \u201cthe perfect storm for\u201d Detroit\u2019s automakers, said Jeff Schuster, consultancy LMC Automotive\u2019s head of forecasting. \u201cConsumers want them and they provide the biggest margin boost in a flat-to-falling market.\u201d  Texas consumers want them more.  According to KBB, in 2017 through November, Texans bought 260,000 pickup trucks, 20.7 percent of the state\u2019s total vehicle sales. Nationally, pickups account for 12 percent of sales.  GM sells a third of its trucks in its south-central division - Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas - and 80 percent of its high-end Sierra Denali versions are sold there.  \u201cIf you think about this segment, there are not that many competitors,\u201d GMC\u2019s Aldred said. \u201cThat obviously gives us a better share of market and enables us to stand out more.\u201d  IHS Markit\u2019s Libby said luxury versions of GM\u2019s and FCA\u2019s pickups grew as a share of sales from 2016 to 2017.  \u201cThe economy is doing well and that will help the industry in general, but it will help more with vehicles like these,\u201d Libby said.","37":"BOWLING GREEN, Ky. - (Reuters) - While striking workers at General Motors Co\u2019s U.S. auto plants continue walking picket lines for a third week to demand better pay and benefits, the financial pressure has mounted for union members like Frank Lee.

For GM, which had $24 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 30, that cost is likely manageable.  But it\u2019s a different story for some strikers.  Frank Lee, a United Auto Workers union member at GM\u2019s Corvette assembly plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is fending off bill collectors.  \u201cUntil yesterday, I was negative in my bank account,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI called the bank to try and stop an insurance payment from coming out. I failed to do that; it was too late.\u201d  Adding to the difficulty of his situation, union regulations prohibit Lee from seeking outside employment while on strike. If he finds another job, or supplements the weekly $250 strike pay, he will lose the benefits with the union.  Negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors Co continued talking on Wednesday, with no word on when a deal would be agreed that would get the automaker\u2019s U.S. assembly lines rolling again.  GM and the UAW said they traded what were described as comprehensive proposals on Tuesday. The union rejected GM\u2019s plan, saying it fell short on wages, healthcare, job security and the treatment of temporary workers, which has become a central issue for the UAW.  Lee is a temporary worker who was hired at the Bowling Green plant three years ago. The 47-year-old has trained to work at more than 30 positions within the assembly plant.  But even after three years on the job, Lee does not qualify for the same pay and benefits as full-time UAW workers, who earn $7 to $14 an hour more than temporary workers in the same factories.  Lee lives with his son, Isiah, in a trailer home thirty miles south of the Bowling Green plant.  \u201cBefore the strike even happened, the money I make as a temporary [employee] is week to week; paycheck comes in, paychecks go out, and we barely survive,\u201d said Lee, making his comments in between phone calls with bill collectors.  On Friday, union members at GM will mark their second payday without a check.  \u201cI\u2019ve got bills that are behind already. I\u2019ve got bill collectors; they\u2019re already calling me,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere\u2019s a stack of bills that seemed to have doubled. Rent is due. I don\u2019t know where that money is coming from.\u201d  Lee has called his credit card providers, explaining that paying rent and buying groceries would need to take priority.  The UAW is working with charities in communities affected by the strike to get additional help for strikers, a union spokesman said.  Lee said financial pressure had increased for him not because of the strike but due to the way General Motors treats temporary employees. He had believed his temporary position would lead to a job with full pay and benefits.  Slideshow ( 14 images )  Despite the stress and financial hardship, Lee finds inspiration in his son, Isiah.  \u201cI\u2019m in this for my son, and we are survivors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get through this.\u201d  At the bargaining tables in Detroit, the issue of how temporary employees are treated is based on the union\u2019s principle that workers at the same plant should get similar wages for similar work.  High absenteeism poses a problem for GM management as the company tends to rely on temporary workers to fill in for missing full time workers.  The union has urged GM to give temporary workers a pay rise and an easier path to jobs at full UAW pay and benefits. GM pays temporary workers between $15.78 and $22 an hour depending on when they were hired, according to a summary of the now expired contract. Full time assembly workers can earn a base pay of nearly $30 an hour or more.  GM management has talked up the $63 hourly average labor costs at its U.S. operations, which is higher than the average $50 an hour paid by Asian and European automakers at their non-union auto factories in the United States.  Non-union plants tend to employ a much higher number of temporary workers, who can be laid off or hired back more quickly as demand ebbs and flows.","38":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Large pickup trucks that tow most of the profits in to Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are holdovers from another century - with heavy ladder frames and big internal combustion engines in the front driving the wheels in the back.  Now, Ford and GM are racing to design radical new takes on their most profitable models, replacing petroleum-fueled engines with batteries in a bid to outflank Tesla Inc\u2019s plan to eclipse their brands. Ford\u2019s F-150 pickup and GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado are the top selling vehicles in the U.S. market.  \u201cThis is going to be a real watershed for the whole industry,\u201d Ford Chairman Bill Ford told Reuters in a recent interview. The automaker has disclosed few details about the electric F-series, but Bill Ford hinted the truck could have load-carrying space under the hood in addition to the traditional bed in the back.  \u201cYou pick up all that extra space where the engine compartment has been,\u201d Ford said. An electric F-Series could be a work truck - with its batteries functioning as a job site power source, he said. And it could be positioned as a high-performance vehicle next to the gas-fueled, 450 horsepower Raptor pickup truck.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company has said it will invest $11.5 billion electrifying its vehicles by 2022, including adding 16 fully electric models, all of which will be profitable.  Ford and GM have more than one reason to take chances on electric pickups - a concept that some analysts and industry executives say could be a small niche.  Electric pickups could help Ford and GM generate the significant sales of EVs they will need to meet tougher emission standards and electric vehicle mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but the electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.  Governments and corporations - major buyers of pickups - could view electric pickups as a way to show a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Competition from Tesla and EV startups Rivian Automotive and Workhorse Group Inc is another factor, although Ford recently mitigated some of that risk by investing $500 million in Rivian.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Three years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk declared he wanted to attack the heart of the Detroit automakers\u2019 franchises with a Tesla electric pickup he has described as a \u201ccyberpunk\u201d truck with the performance of a Porsche 911 sports car. Tesla is expected to unveil a prototype this year, with analysts forecasting a 2022 debut. Musk declined to comment for this story.  Officials familiar with Ford and GM\u2019s plans said their electric pickups will be introduced by early 2022.  \u201cOur strategy is very clear,\u201d Ted Cannis, Ford\u2019s director of electrification, told Reuters at the No. 2 U.S. automaker\u2019s product development center outside Detroit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play to our strengths. We\u2019re good at pickups.\u201d  Ford\u2019s electric truck will be built on a company EV platform separate from the vehicles it will offer later on a Rivian platform.  Ford has said it will introduce a hybrid F-150 next year. Bill Ford said the all-electric F-150 \u201cwon\u2019t be too far after that.\u201d  GM\u2019S ELECTRIC PICKUP PUSH  At GM, Chief Executive Mary Barra said in April the automaker would make an electric full-size pickup, but provided no further details. The company has said it plans to invest $8 billion to develop electric and self-driving vehicles, launching 20 new EVs globally by 2023.  Officials have not discussed plans for the electric pickup, but GM is pushing to introduce it within two years, according to several people familiar with the plans.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The lead engineer is Josh Tavel, who was the chief engineer for the Chevy Volt, Cadillac ELR, and Spark and Bolt EVs as well as executive chief engineer for full-size pickups, GM said.  Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe believes positive reaction last fall for his company\u2019s R1T electric truck, due in fall 2020, shows the potential demand.  \u201cThe question is how large is the demand and does it translate across all price points or does it stay more isolated in the higher price points?\u201d he told Reuters at the company\u2019s Plymouth, Michigan, headquarters.  Ford officials will not discuss sales expectations for the electric F-150. But Bill Ford said the electric pickup could outperform conservative expectations - if prospective customers try it.  Ford has broken with pickup segment conventions before - substituting a turbo-charged six-cylinder \u201cEcoBoost\u201d engine for the traditional V-8, and then giving the current generation of the truck an aluminum body instead of steel, the chairman said. The aluminum F-series is the best-selling pickup truck line in the United States, and about half are equipped with six-cylinder engines.  \u201cLike it was with EcoBoost and like it was with aluminum, it\u2019s important we get people in the vehicle to try it,\u201d Ford said.  Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said customers are already asking about the truck.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to be shocked,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the electric pickup truck has a huge future.\u201d  Not everyone is so sanguine. Industry tracking firm IHS Markit has estimated the entire full-size electric truck segment will account for fewer than 30,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 2.3 million sales overall.  \u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted waters,\u201d IHS Markit principal analyst Stephanie Brinley said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking niche in the beginning.\u201d  Detroit\u2019s other big automaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , has no current plans for an all-electric Ram, while Toyota Motor Corp is betting more heavily on a hybrid Tundra pickup.  \u201cThe sliver of volume that\u2019s going to be electric pickups is not worthy of a business case,\u201d said one person familiar with Toyota\u2019s plans.  The Detroit automakers ultimately want to defend a segment they see as their own.  \u201cWhy would we let Tesla beat us with a pickup truck?\u201d said one person familiar with Ford\u2019s plans. \u201cThat\u2019s our turf.\u201d","39":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Hyundai Motor is pictured at the second media day for the Shanghai auto show in Shanghai, China April 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  MOSCOW (Reuters) - South-Korean automaker Hyundai Motor has completed the acquisition of a General Motors factory in Russia\u2019s St. Petersburg, Hyundai spokeswoman Yulia Tikhonravova told reporters at an online conference on Tuesday.  The GM factory with a capacity of up to 100,000 cars per year was built in Shushary in the suburbs of St. Petersburg in 2008 but closed in 2015 as part of GM\u2019s decision to reduce its international operations.  The deal was closed in early November, Tikhonravova said, adding that it was too early to say when production would start due to the pandemic.  \u201cIf we talk about the plant in Shushary - yes indeed, it is our second plant, now we are working on possible scenarios to use this asset,\u201d said Alexey Kalitsev, head of Russia\u2019s Hyundai unit.  Hyundai and its partner Kia already have a factory in Russia with a manufacturing capacity of more than 200,000 vehicles per year. The two carmakers sold more than 400,000 vehicles in Russia last year.  The Association of European Businesses (AEB), which tracks sales of new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in Russia, expects the country\u2019s car market to fall by 13.5% to 1.522 million vehicles this year.  According to Kalitsev, the market will decline by about 10% to 1.55-1.6 million cars compared to 2019, and Hyundai itself wants to sell 163,000 units.","40":"BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is backtracking on an aggressive promotion of three-cylinder engines in China that saw some Buick and Chevrolet models offered only in that option - a move which proved highly unpopular and helped sales slide, people familiar with matter said.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen in Warren, Michigan, U.S. on October 26, 2015. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Three-cylinder gasoline engines are cleaner and more fuel efficient than their conventional four-cylinder counterparts, and automakers are keen to promote them, particularly in China which has some of the world\u2019s most stringent fuel economy and emission rules.  GM went further than competitors, discontinuing four-cylinder versions for many models in the world's largest auto market. By comparison, Honda Motor Co 7267.T and BMW BMWG.DE also offer three-cylinder cars in China, but the models are an option in addition to four-cylinder versions.  Many Chinese consumers, however, perceive cars with three-cylinder engines as noisier and prone to vibrating, and sales began to tumble in third quarter of 2018. Last year, GM\u2019s China sales fell 15% to 3.09 million vehicles, its second straight year of steep declines and the lowest level since 2012.  The move was \u201ctoo quick, too radical and lacked sophisticated planning,\u201d a senior Shanghai-based sales manager at a Buick dealership told Reuters.  The sales manager, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified, said his company was among hundreds of dealers which lobbied GM to change the plan at dealer conferences.  GM China President Matt Tsien told investors in New York on Wednesday that consumers have been reluctant to accept three-cylinder engines, and confirmed that later this year the automaker will offer four-cylinder engines in certain models currently offered only with the smaller engines.  By resurrecting four-cylinder options for key models, the hope is that GM, which reports fourth-quarter earnings later on Wednesday, can regain some of the ground it has lost at a time when the new coronavirus is threatening to sink sales in the first quarter.  The outbreak is only adding to pain caused by to a slowing economy, U.S.-China trade tensions, and new emission rules, as well as fierce competition from Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE.  SAIC-GM, the Detroit automaker's main venture with SAIC Motor 600104.SS, is seeking approval for four-cylinder versions of two mass-market sedans, Buick's Excelle GT and Chevrolet's Cruze, government documents show.  Those two versions are slated to hit the market sometime in the second quarter, two people with knowledge of the matter said, adding that four-cylinder versions of the Buick Verano sedan and Encore GX sport utility vehicle were also under consideration.  A Shanghai-based GM spokeswoman said the automaker will continue to offer three- and four-cylinder engines in the future but declined to comment on product plans.","41":"DETROIT (Reuters) - The two largest U.S. automakers on Thursday announced measures to shore up their finances as the coronavirus pandemic takes a deep economic bite, with Ford Motor Co F.N aiming to resume production next month of its most profitable vehicles while cutting costs further.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  General Motors Co GM.N, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, said it planned to keep its plants closed indefinitely and was reducing the pay of salaried employees and executives and suspending some future product programs to conserve cash.  GM\u2019s chief executive and chief financial officer issued a stark warning to company employees in an internal video, saying that \u201csignificant austerity measures\u201d were needed to preserve the company\u2019s long-term viability.  To generate cash, Ford said it was poised to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back such profitable vehicles as its top-selling F-150 full-sized pickup, the Transit commercial van and SUVs. The plants that produce those vehicles are located in the U.S. states of Michigan and Kentucky and in Mexico.  To save cash, Ford said it was temporarily cutting top executives\u2019 salaries, among other actions. This came a day after Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the Dearborn, Michigan-based company\u2019s debt to \u201cjunk\u201d status and warned more downgrades could be necessary.  \u201cThe actions we\u2019re taking now are wide-ranging and substantial,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, told employees in an email early on Thursday. \u201cWe hope they will be enough to give Ford the financial flexibility to ride out the economic and business effects of the coronavirus.\u201d  The pandemic, which has killed more than 21,000 people globally, has forced the shutdown of auto plants around the world as entire cities have gone into lockdown to stem the spread of the virus.  Ford previously drew down credit lines to build its cash position and suspended its dividend. GM also drew down its credit line, but did not suspend the dividend.  The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a $2 trillion economic rescue package to help unemployed workers and companies, including the auto industry, hit hard by the outbreak. The measure has been sent to the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday.  President Donald Trump, concerned about the economic repercussions of an extended shutdown, has said he wants America to get back to business by Easter, which is April 12.  GENERATING CASH  To get more cash coming in, Ford said it would restart key plants, while introducing additional safety measures to protect returning workers from the coronavirus. It said it would provide details on the new measures later.  To conserve cash, Ford said its top 300 executives would defer 20% to 50% of salaries for at least five months starting May 1, with the executive chairman deferring his entire salary. Hackett will defer half his salary.  However, Ford employees will continue to get healthcare coverage and those exposed to the virus and placed in quarantine will get paid time off, he added.  General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N previously said they would shut their North American operations through March 30 and reassess after that.  FCA on Thursday extended its shutdown through April 13, while its parts distribution centers will continue to operate with paid volunteers. Mexico\u2019s status is subject to a separate announcement.  GM on Thursday extended its shutdown indefinitely and said it would evaluate on a week-to-week basis.  GM\u2019s chief executive, Mary Barra, and chief financial officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, told company employees in the internal video, which Reuters heard a recording of, that it was essential that GM take immediate, aggressive steps to cut costs.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t take significant austerity measures, we will do serious damage to the long-term viability of our company,\u201d Suryadevara said. She noted that GM has very little revenue coming in \u201cand we are preparing to operate the company temporarily on credit if necessary.\u201d  Barra said GM was \u201caggressively taking costs out of the business,\u201d including cutting its marketing budget \u201dand hundreds of other actions.\u201d  To save cash and avoid layoffs, the automaker said salaried employees would have 20% of their pay deferred, executives 25% and senior leaders 30%, starting April 1. GM said the deferred money would be repaid in a lump sum no later than March 15, 2021. Health-care benefits are not affected.  GM also said 6,500 salaried employees, mostly in manufacturing and engineering, who are not able to work remotely are being paid 75% of their salary as part of a \u201cdowntime paid absence\u201d program in lieu of collecting unemployment benefits.  In an email to employees on Thursday, seen by Reuters, Barra said GM for years has been making \u201cdifficult decisions to strengthen our business and make it more resilient,\u201d and now those moves \u201cwill be put to the test.\u201d  United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble said Thursday the union viewed announcements like Ford\u2019s with concern, and any decision to restart production should be based on data and each state\u2019s position with regards to the coronavirus outbreak.  The UAW has said three union members who worked at FCA plants have died due to the coronavirus.  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an order on Monday barring non-essential businesses from operating until April 13.  Ford plans to begin production on one shift at its Hermosillo, Mexico, assembly plant, where it builds the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans. It will restart production on April 14 at its Dearborn plant that builds the F-150 and a Kentucky plant that makes the Super Duty version of the pickup as well as the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs.

DETROIT, June 27 (Reuters) - At Planet Ford, which boasts it is the No. 1 Ford volume dealer in the Houston area, customers shopping for a 2019 F-150 pickup truck can get discounts from Ford Motor Co of more than $8,000 - and that is just the start.  The dealership\u2019s website lists a dozen other ways for truck buyers to get a price cut: being a student, a member of the military or a first-responder organization, a season-ticket holder for the National Football League\u2019s Houston Texans, or a member of the Farm Bureau.  \u201cFord is a sponsor of the Houston Rodeo, and offers an additional $1,000 rebate on the F-150 to people who volunteer with the rodeo,\u201d said Aaron Smith, general sales manager at Planet Ford.  Rodeo fans would feel right at home watching the frenzied competition in the U.S. large pickup truck market.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) , General Motors Co and Ford escalated a price war in June in one of the few vehicle market segments on the planet that offers substantial profits - and one in which the three Detroit automakers enjoy an oligopoly, shielded by heavy tariffs on foreign competition.  During the past month, dealers for FCA\u2019s Ram truck brand, GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks and Ford\u2019s F-series truck line have been offering discounts of up to 30% or more off the list price. The GMC brand is promoting June as \u201cTruck Month,\u201d signaling to consumers that deep discounts are on offer until the close of the sales reporting period, July 1.  U.S. automakers report June and second-quarter sales next week.  DRAMATIC DISCOUNTS  While the heavy discounts are available in much of the country, not all dealers are offering such deals. More popular limited-production models such as Ford\u2019s F-150 Raptor are selling for full retail price.  Overall, discounts on light-duty pickup trucks in June have averaged $5,250, 11% higher than the year-to-date average of $4,726, according to market research firm J.D. Power.  The price-cutting is unusual because FCA\u2019s Ram brand and GM\u2019s Chevrolet and GMC brands launched new versions of their large pickups within the last year. Normally, automakers avoid major discounts on freshly redesigned vehicles.  But these are not normal times. FCA Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said last year he wants to move the Ram pickup line into second place in U.S. sales, displacing Silverado and closing the gap with Ford\u2019s F-series, the segment leader for 42 years.  The new Ram has received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch (30.5 cm) display screen, and sales are up nearly 22% this year through May, selling 22,000 more vehicles than the Silverado.  \u201cClearly, FCA is trying to grab market share while GM is still ramping up,\u201d said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs.  FCA said in a statement on Thursday the automaker will \u201cstick with what works for us.\u201d  BALANCED APPROACH  GM is under pressure to deliver as much as $10 billion in free cash flow in the final three quarters of 2019 to hit its full-year target, amid stagnant U.S. demand and plummeting industry sales in China.  GM will report second-quarter U.S. sales on July 2. Automotive News estimated Silverado sales fell 11.8% through May, while sales of the higher-priced GMC Sierra were up 4%.  \u201cWe will defend our franchise and we will do it the right way,\u201d said Barry Engle, head of GM\u2019s North American operations. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to just roll over and allow our truck business to be taken away from us.\u201d  Engle said Silverado sales numbers in part reflect an effort to build more higher-margin Sierras aimed at buyers willing to spend extra dollars on a luxury truck.  Ford, which has the oldest pickup truck in the market, had flat F-series sales through the end of May.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit unprecedented,\u201d said Ford\u2019s truck marketing manager, Todd Eckert, of the heavy discounting so early in the life cycle of his rivals\u2019 trucks.  Ford will defend its position, but not at any cost, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s about having a balanced approach.\u201d  Because incentives erode profit margins, the automakers continue to juggle discounts against diminished margins.  \u201cThis is a segment that has been profitable for all of us,\u201d said GM\u2019s Engle. \u201cWe\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d","43":"SHANGHAI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s China sales fell 14.9 percent in the third quarter of the year, hit by a wider slowdown in the market and faltering Chinese economic growth amid a whipsawing trade war with the United States.  The U.S. car maker sold 835,934 vehicles in the July-September quarter, down from the same period the year before, which the firm said was due to a \u201csoftening\u201d vehicle market and issues shifting to a new engine system with its Buick brand.

GM, which has some 16,000 employees in South Korea, also asked staff to \u201cactively consider\u201d a previously announced voluntary redundancy plan which has a Friday deadline, a separate letter showed.  The automaker this month shocked South Korea when it said it would shut one of its factories in the country and decide the fate of three remaining plants in the coming weeks.  The letters underscore the difficulties GM faces as it tries to wrangle concessions on wages from an angry labor union and win financial support from a South Korean government that is set to conduct due diligence on what it has called GM Korea\u2019s \u201copaque\u201d management.  Although talks with unions have come much earlier than expected with union leaders under pressure to make concessions to prevent more factory closures, a union official told Reuters that initial discussions on Wednesday had not made any progress.  According to one of the letters sent to staff, GM Korea plans to cut the number of executives ranked managing director or more senior by 35 percent and reduce the number of directors and team leaders by 20 percent.  A GM Korea spokesman confirmed the plan, noting that the unit had around 150 executives including 100 directors and hundreds of team leaders.  \u201cChanging our leadership structure is another of many initiatives to move forward the viability of the company,\u201d he said.  The unit also plans to shrink the number of so-called \u201cinternational service personnel\u201d executives, who have been dispatched from GM headquarters and other affiliates overseas, by 45 percent.

In a separate letter, GM Korea stressed to employees that they only had until Friday to apply for the redundancy program and urged them to apply. It is offering South Korean workers three times their annual base salary, money for college tuition and more than $9,000 toward a new car as part of the redundancy proposal.  Nearly 200 subcontractors at GM\u2019s Gunsan plant have been also asked to leave the factory by the end of March, union officials said on Wednesday.  In talks with the union, GM is proposing a base wage freeze and no bonuses this year along with a suspension of some benefits such as the payment of university tuition for employees\u2019 children and gold medals for long-serving workers.  The talks on Wednesday ended after just a couple of hours, the union official said.  \u201cManagement is demanding unilateral sacrifice by the union, but the company should come up with a turnaround plan,\u201d he said, adding that demands by the union for executives\u2019 wages to be disclosed had been rejected.  GM workers held another protest on Wednesday, holding signs calling for the withdrawal of the plant closure, before marching toward the presidential office.  Overseas unions, including the United Auto Workers, also joined the protest.  \u201cThe automotive sector will go through a major change in the next decade ...

The sensor failure could result in unintended activation of the driveline protection system, and cause unintended braking of the wheel on the opposite side of the failed sensor. That could cause the vehicle to pull to one side unexpectedly, increasing the risk of a crash, the Detroit automaker said.  GM said it was not aware of any crashes relating to the issue but found 150 field claims alleging the condition caused unintended braking or lateral-vehicle motion.  A GM dealer in May submitted a warranty report relating to the issue in a 2018 GMC Yukon, and two day later, a GM brand quality manager submitted the report to GM\u2019s Speak Up For Safety program that tracks potential safety issues, which prompted a GM investigation and testing.","48":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Wednesday it has tapped a former Trump administration economic and trade adviser to head its public policy efforts.

GM buys most of its steel from U.S. producers, which have raised prices in reaction to the tariffs on imported steel.  In June, GM said it would go ahead with its plan to manufacture the new Chevrolet Blazer SUV in Mexico, despite Trump\u2019s criticisms of U.S. companies making vehicles abroad.

The UAW on Sunday launched the first company-wide strike at GM in 12 years, saying negotiations toward a new national agreement covering about 48,000 hourly workers had hit an impasse.  Workers took to picket lines outside GM factories, waving signs declaring \u201cUAW On Strike.\u201d During the walkout, UAW members will get $250 a week from the union\u2019s strike fund.  The UAW confirmed Monday morning that talks had resumed and GM said the talks were continuing more than five hours later. Lost production could cost GM up to $50 million a day in pretax profit, RBC Capital Markets estimated in a note Monday. GM could make up the lost production with overtime work after a settlement.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a note Monday the critical issue is whether GM will \u201csecure the operating flexibility necessary\u201d to address challenges including higher hourly costs than foreign automakers, a potential severe downturn in U.S. auto sales and the need for automakers \u201cto begin transitioning to the production of more electric vehicles that will likely require fewer workers to assemble.\u201d  Company and union officials say there are a number of issues to be resolved and that no immediate resolution on Monday is expected.  Contract talks with GM have been overshadowed by a mushrooming U.S. federal corruption probe into top union officials. The investigation has raised questions about UAW president Gary Jones, who a source said was an unnamed official cited in a searing federal complaint last week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.  The strike quickly became a political issue, as both U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats who want to unseat him in 2020 weighed in. Trump and Democrats see the votes of UAW members in the Midwest as critical to victory.  Trump on Monday told reporters he hoped the strike was a short one after taking to Twitter to urge the UAW and GM to \u201cget together and make a deal!\u201d GM spokesman Tony Cervone said the automaker \u201ccouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d with Trump\u2019s call.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra met with Trump ahead of the strike deadline. Trump has attacked GM for Barra\u2019s decision to stop building small cars at an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The state is pivotal to Trump\u2019s re-election.  The union wants to stop GM from closing Lordstown and an assembly plant in Detroit. The UAW has said workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.  GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in southern U.S. states.  GM initially insisted the UAW dramatically boost its share of healthcare costs but largely dropped that demand, union and company officials said.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  In a statement Sunday, GM outlined its offer to the union, saying the package included solutions for the Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products, $7 billion in U.S. investment and a signing bonus of $8,000 per worker.  A person familiar with GM\u2019s offer said the company could produce a future electric pickup truck at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant that now has no future assignment.  GM could also build an electric vehicle battery plant in Lordstown, and go through with the proposed sale of the plant to a group affiliated with electric vehicle start-up Workhorse Group Inc.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  A new battery plant could give some UAW workers at Lordstown the chance to remain with GM.  The UAW\u2019s top negotiator at GM said the company\u2019s proposal came just two hours before the strike deadline, and laid blame for the strike on the automaker.  \u201cHad we received this proposal earlier in the process, it may have been possible to reach a tentative agreement and avoid a strike,\u201d UAW Vice President Terry Dittes wrote in a letter to GM on Sunday, according to a copy viewed by Reuters.  GM shares closed down 4.3% on Monday.  ECONOMY COULD FEEL IMPACT  A strike will very quickly shut down GM\u2019s operations across North America and could hurt the broader U.S. economy. Prolonged industrial action would also cause hardship for GM hourly workers on greatly reduced strike pay. Suppliers of parts and services to GM\u2019s U.S. operations could also suffer from a long shutdown, as could dealers and consumers.  GM\u2019s workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.  The UAW has framed the plant closures as a betrayal of workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy.  Some of those concessions are now matters of disagreement. The union wants to limit GM\u2019s use of temporary workers in its plants, and narrow the pay gap between new hires and veteran workers.  The strike will test both the union and GM at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing slowing sales and rising costs associated with launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.  The impact of the strike on dealers and car shoppers will be delayed. GM started off the strike with healthy levels of inventory of some its key, high-margin vehicles.  A prolonged strike could delay the planned introduction next spring of GM\u2019s redesigned full-size SUVs in Arlington, Texas. Among the company\u2019s most profitable vehicles, they include the Cadillac Escalade, the GMC Yukon and the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban.","50":"SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors GM.N confirmed details of a proposed investment in its loss-making South Korean business on Friday, but said it was subject to support from Seoul and GM's Korean union.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  Chief Executive Mary Barra on Monday briefly made her first reference ever to Detroit-based GM\u2019s interest in the air taxi market, saying that it fit with development of electric vehicles (EVs) and its Ultium advanced electric battery.  \u201cWe believe strongly in our EV future and not just for vehicles,\u201d she said at an RBC conference. \u201cThe strength and flexibility of our Ultium battery system opens doors\u201d for many uses, she added, \u201cincluding aerial mobility.\u201d  Air taxis are vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft that use electric motors instead of jet engines. Designed to avoid the need for long runways, they have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.  Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they could add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.  GM spokesman Stuart Fowle declined to elaborate. \u201cIt\u2019s an area we\u2019re really excited about and looking at.\u201d  GM shares were up almost 1.7% in midday trading.  Corporate and private investors have poured at least $2.3 billion (\u00a31.8 billion) into more than 100 aerial vehicle startups, including drones and electric air taxis, but the technology still faces significant roadblocks to commercialization and profitability, according to investor website PitchBook.  GM is weighing all options - whether to build, supply or partner - as it decides whether to join such automakers as Hyundai Motor Co005380.KS, Toyota Motor Corp7203.T, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, Volkswagen AGVOWG_p.DE and Geely Automobile 0175.HK in the still-developing market, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. GM could make an announcement early next year.  GM\u2019s study of the aerial mobility market is part of the push by GM\u2019s innovation group to explore other transportation markets for growth, one of the sources said. The group is headed by Alan Wexler, who reports to Barra and was hired in July in the newly created position of senior vice president of innovation and growth.  Other efforts that originated in the innovation group include formation of a defense business unit and a $214 million contract to build troop carriers for the U.S. Army based on the Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as a new mobile app for OnStar members.  Hyundai teamed up with Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N in January to develop electric air taxis and has pledged to invest $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025.  Toyota led a $590 million investment round in air taxi startup Joby in January, while Daimler and Geely have invested in Stuttgart-based Volocopter. Volkswagen's Porsche brand is working with BoeingBA.N to develop a concept electric flying vehicle.

Ford said on Friday it looks \u201cforward to reaching a fair agreement that helps Ford enhance its competitiveness and preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs.\u201d  Unlike GM, Ford has not signaled it wants to close plants, but executives have said future electric vehicles would require 30% fewer labor hours to build. UAW leaders have expressed concern about the impact of EVs on their members.  GM also did little to lower its share of the UAW\u2019s healthcare plans, which could be more costly to Ford since it employs about 55,000 UAW members in the United States.  The UAW had previously agreed to a temporary contract extension with Ford while it focused on GM.  While the talks between GM and the UAW grew tense at times, with the union accusing the automaker of trying to \u201cstarve ... workers off the picket lines,\u201d Ford historically has had an easier relationship with the union.

GM will attempt to make up some of that production in the coming months.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  The union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers.  UAW leaders had recommended that the members at GM, who have remained on the picket lines, ratify the deal reached on Oct. 16.  The GM strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers.  The strike at GM likely slashed at least 46,000 jobs from October\u2019s nonfarm U.S. payrolls, the Labor Department said on Friday.  Under the deal, GM will invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. The Detroit company said it will also create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which will be new, a source previously said.

He also said the deal package \u201cpaved the way for GM to operate continuously beyond 10 years\u201d, referring to concerns that GM may leave after 10 years.  The Detroit car maker and state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) already have a preliminary deal on $7.15 billion of investments, including $2 billion of capital spending by GM and a $2.8 billion debt-for-equity swap for existing loans GM Korea owes to its parent, to rescue the unit.  As a sign of its long-term commitment, GM plans to set up a new Asia-Pacific headquarters in South Korea, although that excludes China, the government said on Thursday.  GM will also buy more parts from South Korean suppliers for its overseas operations, boosting procurement from about 2 trillion won ($1.85 billion) a year at present, it said.

Kudlow told reporters on Tuesday that the administration had helped GM with fuel efficiency standards and other regulations.  \u201cWe\u2019ve done this to help you and I think his disappointment is, it seems like that they kind of turned his back on him,\u201d Kudlow said.  It was not the first time that Trump made threats against a U.S. company. In June he threatened Harley Davidson with higher taxes after the motorcycle maker announced it would move some production overseas. Trump has also threatened to take action against Amazon.com Inc, saying repeatedly in April, without providing evidence, that the online retailer was not paying the U.S. Postal Service a fair rate and saying that he would look at policies to address what he said were Amazon\u2019s unfair business advantages.  Trump has not followed up on these threats.  WORKERS DISCUSSING \u201cMASS ACTIONS\u201d  Trump also criticized GM for not closing facilities in Mexico or China.  \u201cGeneral Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) - don\u2019t think that bet is going to pay off. I am here to protect America\u2019s Workers!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  GM currently builds just one vehicle in China that it exports to the United States, the Buick Envision, and had sold about 22,000 through September. GM sold nearly 2.7 million vehicles in China through September, nearly all built in China.  White House spokesman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that the president is looking at options.  \u201cThe president wants to see American companies build cars here in America not build them overseas and he is hopeful that GM will continue to do that here,\u201d she said.  GM has been lobbying Congress, along with Tesla Inc, to lift the current cap on electric vehicles eligible for tax credits, but any action by Congress before 2019 is a long shot, congressional aides said.  Currently, once a manufacturer sells 200,000 electric vehicles, the tax credit phases out starting in the following quarter. GM has said it expects to hit the 200,000-vehicle threshold by the end of the year. Tesla hit the cap in July.  In Canada, workers returned to the assembly line at General Motors\u2019 Oshawa, Ontario, plant on Tuesday, as their union president met with Trudeau and said he was ready for \u201cmass actions\u201d at GM facilities. GM said on Monday that the Oshawa plant would close in December 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a corporation that doesn\u2019t have any respect for Canadian and American workers, and I think we should treat them in the same vein,\u201d said Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, which represents GM workers in Canada. Dias said he would meet with the United Auto Workers on Wednesday and discuss the possibility of \u201cmass actions\u201d in GM plants across the two countries.  Democrats are seizing on the plant closing and have repeatedly attacked Republicans in the past two days for giving large companies a tax cut.  Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer on Tuesday criticized Trump for \u201coverpromising\u201d as a candidate about protecting against plant closures if he was elected. \u201cGM pocketed the tax break we gave them and are closing up shop anyway, with nary a word from the president until after the fact,\u201d Schumer said.  GM declined to comment on Schumer\u2019s remarks.","60":"SAO PAULO\/DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it would invest $2.7 billion in two Brazilian factories over the next five years, sparing them from a shakeup of the automaker\u2019s operations, a decision hailed by the governor of Brazil\u2019s largest state.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Sao Paolo state Governor Joao Doria told a joint news conference with GM executives that the plants in Sao Caetano do Sul and Sao Jose dos Campos had been slated for closure last December, and said he convinced GM to reverse the decision, saving jobs.  Last November, GM said it would slash thousands of jobs around the world and would close two unspecified plants outside of North America by the end of 2019.  The company declined to say whether its restructuring plans had referred to the two Brazilian factories, and declined to comment on whether the two plants had been slated for closure as Doria claimed.  Sitting next to Doria at the news conference, GM\u2019s CEO for South America, Carlos Zarlenga, also did not directly address Doria\u2019s recounting of the negotiations with GM.  Doria, a former businessman and reality TV show host, took office in January and became a vocal advocate for the state\u2019s auto industry. Earlier this year, he said he would find a buyer for a Ford Motor Co plant that is slated to close, after the U.S. automaker said it had tried and failed to find one.  At Tuesday\u2019s news conference, Doria said GM told him in a call days before his inauguration that it planned to close the plants.  \u201cI thought it was going to be good news,\u201d Doria said. \u201cBut to my surprise I was told that the next day GM CEO Mary Barra would announce the closing of two factories in Sao Paulo. I fell off my chair.\u201d  He said he dispatched his future state finance minister to fix the situation and landed a meeting in Miami with GM executives. He said 65,000 workers employed directly and indirectly by GM would have lost their jobs without his intervention.  Earlier this month, Doria announced an incentive plan granting automakers a 25 percent reduction in value added taxes if they created at least 400 jobs and invested at least 1 billion reais. At the news conference, GM announced it was creating 400 new jobs.  Zarlenga said the future of its Sao Paulo factories had presented GM \u201ca really serious problem,\u201d but did not confirm that the automaker had considered closing them down.  GM, the sales leader in Brazil, South America\u2019s largest market, had warned local employees it was dealing with heavy losses and \u201csacrifices\u201d would be necessary.  As announced, the plan pales in comparison to GM\u2019s most recent investment plan in Brazil in 2014, which totaled $4 billion. However, the announcement does not include potential future investments in the automaker\u2019s plants elsewhere in the country.","61":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T said on Thursday they would jointly develop two new electric vehicles for Honda and are exploring more ways to expand their alliance.  The new vehicles will use GM batteries and be assembled in GM plants in North America, the companies said. Honda plans to begin selling the vehicles in the United States and Canada in 2024.  \u201cWe are in discussions with one another regarding the possibility of further extending our partnership,\u201d Rick Schostek, executive vice president of American Honda said in a statement.  The relationship between GM and its smaller Japanese rival reflects industry pressures to share technology and development costs to meet demands for cleaner vehicles. Those pressures were significant before the COVID-19 pandemic slammed global vehicle demand, and promise to intensify as the crisis saps cash from manufacturers\u2019 accounts.  GM and Honda already collaborate on autonomous vehicles and fuel cell vehicle technology. The companies worked together on the design of an autonomous vehicle called Cruise Origin for GM\u2019s majority-owned Cruise Automation unit.  As part of the latest agreement, Honda will use GM\u2019s hands-free driver assistance technology, marketed by GM as Super Cruise. Honda also will incorporate GM\u2019s Onstar telematics services into the electric vehicles developed with GM.","62":"Slideshow ( 4 images )  FLINT, Mich. (Reuters) - General Motors Co president Mark Reuss said on Wednesday that the automaker is investing about $150 million at its Flint Assembly plant, Michigan, to boost production of heavy duty trucks by another 40,000 vehicles a year.  Reuss announced the investment at the Flint truck assembly plant wearing a United Auto Workers pin.  The Detroit automaker announced in February it was adding 1,000 jobs in Flint to build a new generation of heavy-duty pickup trucks.  GM did not say that the latest investment would add more jobs at the plant, but Reuss said there could be opportunities to add workers as the launch of the automaker\u2019s new trucks progresses.  GM has been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump and lawmakers of both parties to add jobs in the United States after it said last November it would idle a small car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and had no new products for three other U.S. manufacturing plants.  The Flint investment will include upgrades to the plant\u2019s conveyors and other new tooling, and will be completed in the first half of 2020. GM has invested more than $1.6 billion in the plant since 2013.  Last month, GM said it would invest $24 million to increase truck production at its assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, which makes Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models.  Sales of heavy-duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600,000 vehicles a year, up more than 20 percent since 2013, according to industry data. Prices for luxury models can easily top $70,000.  GM\u2019s Chevrolet and GMC brands have long trailed Ford Motor Co\u2019s F-series heavy duty trucks in the lucrative segment. The new Chevrolet and GMC heavy duty trucks have been re-engineered to tow heavier trailers, and keep pace in what has become an arms race among the Detroit Three automakers to claim superior torque and towing capability.","63":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co on Thursday said it has no plan to cut the sticker price on its electric Chevrolet Bolt sedan after a federal tax credit drops by half to $3,750 on Monday.

GM has laid out an aggressive electric vehicle strategy, vowing to bring at least 20 EV models to market by 2023.  In January, Tesla Inc cut the prices of its EVs by $2,000 after its EV tax credit fell from $7,500 to $3,750 after it hit the 200,000 EV sales milestone.  Asked why GM is not cutting the price to account for the lower tax credit, spokesman Jim Cain said \u201cit is easier to react to the market by working with dealers and your marketing team than it is to change sticker prices.\u201d  Tesla aggressively urged buyers to take advantage of the full credit shortly before it expired. \u201cReminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days!\u201d Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted in December.  Last week, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra announced the company would invest $300 million in a suburban Detroit assembly plant, adding 400 jobs to build a new Chevrolet EV based on the Bolt platform. Barra said GM planned to boost EV marketing soon, but made no mention of the tax credit phaseout.  Michelle Krebs, an analyst at AutoTrader, calls government incentives a big factor in consumer purchase decisions. \u201cTax credits make a difference,\u201d she said.  GM will offer new incentives next week for EVs as the current monthly incentives expire, the company said.  GM is currently offering an incentive on Bolt EVs of 14 percent of the suggested retail price, Cain said.  Cain said GM is \u201csensitive to affordability\u201d of EVs for customers but declined to specify what future incentives GM will offer.  Both GM and Tesla have been lobbying Congress for more than a year to extend or expand the EV tax credit.  GM\u2019s credit drops to $1,875 in October and will completely disappear by April 2020, while Tesla\u2019s credit falls to $1,875 in July and expires at the end of the year.

General Motors assembly workers picket outside the General Motors Bowling Green plant during the United Auto Workers (UAW) national strike in Bowling Green, Kentucky, U.S., October 10, 2019. REUTERS\/Bryan Woolston  GM urged the UAW to agree to around-the-clock negotiations to try reach a deal, while the union insisted on dealing with five specific issues first before it responded to a broader proposal from the company.  The UAW began strike action on Sept. 16, with the union\u2019s 48,000 members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker\u2019s profit and protection of healthcare benefits.  Apart from costing GM more than $1 billion, the work stoppage has forced it to idle U.S. operations along with nearly 10,000 workers in Canada and Mexico.  A day after senior union officials met with GM Chief Executive Mary Barra for the first time, the company late Thursday evening sent a letter expressing its frustration with the union\u2019s lack of response to an offer it made on Monday.  Details of that offer have not been made public. GM said the day before the strike began that it had offered to make $7 billion in new U.S. investments in eight facilities in four states, but did not specify timing, location or products with the exception of a planned electric truck. Since then, it has offered additional concessions, but has not disclosed any details.  \u201cAs we have urged repeatedly, we should engage in bargaining over all issues around-the-clock to get an agreement,\u201d Scott Sandefur, GM vice president of North American labor relations, wrote in the letter sent to the UAW.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  \u201cYour members and our employees lives are being disrupted and they deserve our commitment to getting any remaining issues resolved as quickly as possible,\u201d Sandefur added. \u201cWe object to having bargining placed on hold pending a resolution of these five areas.\u201d  UAW Vice President Terry Dittes, who heads the union\u2019s GM department, said in a letter earlier on Thursday evening to GM that the union would not reply to GM\u2019s latest proposal until committees discussing five specific issues had completed their work.  Those committees are discussing issues including the fate of four U.S. factories that GM has indicated could close, cutting 15,000 jobs in North America, and future technological changes to production.  Dittes said he did not know when the five issues would be resolved, suggesting a final deal may not be close.  UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers, and battery production may result in workers getting paid less than at existing transmission plants.  Reuters previously reported GM told the UAW it could build a new battery plant near the now-shuttered Lordstown, Ohio, factory, and build the electric truck at its Detroit Hamtramck plant.  U.S. President Donald Trump and many lawmakers have also waded in, urging GM to build more vehicles in the United States and shift work from Mexico. The UAW\u2019s membership is largely in the Midwest, in states that could be critical to both sides in the 2020 presidential election.  GM declined to comment on the talks between Barra, Dittes and UAW President at GM\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday. The UAW said both sides continued to meet at all levels.  Barra\u2019s goal was to get the talks moving again, sources briefed on the matter said. UAW officials had previously urged Barra to involve herself in the negotiations.  On Sunday, the UAW said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and on Tuesday urged GM to boost U.S. vehicle production.

Striking United Auto Workers (UAW) members rally in front of General Motors World headquarters in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., October 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  UAW officials and striking workers on the picket lines had said their focus in the dispute with GM was on jobs, pay equity and fairness for workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy. They also wanted to save factories in Ohio and Michigan GM had threatened to close.  This year\u2019s talks - also occurring with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  The following is a timeline of events leading up to the tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the workers:  Nov. 26, 2018  GM announced the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s biggest restructuring since its 2009 bankruptcy, putting five North American plants on notice for potential closure and saying it would cut nearly 15,000 jobs.  The UAW, which represents U.S. workers at the four U.S. plants targeted, vowed to fight the cuts.  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that GM save the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that was targeted.  Nov. 27, 2018  Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants.  Dec. 5, 2018  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra warned the Detroit company had excess manufacturing capacity, and said the Lordstown plant\u2019s future would be determined during the 2019 labor talks.  Dec. 14, 2018  GM said more than 1,100 of the 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at plants losing production had volunteered to transfer to other plants. That number has risen since then to more than 2,300.  Jan. 3, 2019  The UAW sued GM in federal court, claiming its use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violated its labor deal.  Feb. 22, 2019  GM extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, instead of ending work in June as earlier planned. However, on March 6, the last Chevrolet Cruze small car rolled off the assembly line at the Lordstown plant.  Feb. 26, 2019  The UAW sued GM over its restructuring plan, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.  March 13, 2019  UAW President Gary Jones at the union\u2019s bargaining convention in Detroit said job security and stopping the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico were top priorities for the contract talks.  March 18, 2019  U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged Norwood Jewell, a former high-ranking UAW official in charge of labor relations with Fiat Chrysler, of misusing funds to pay for lavish parties for himself and other union officials. The following month, he pleaded guilty.  May 8, 2019  GM said it was in talks to sell the idled Lordstown plant to a cash-strapped electric vehicle startup, Workhorse Group Inc. GM also said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio plants. The UAW called on GM to put a new product of its own in the plant.  June 5, 2019  Barra defended GM\u2019s proposed sale of the Lordstown plant and said the automaker did not plan to add a new vehicle there.  July 16, 2019  GM and the UAW formally kicked off talks for a new four-year labor deal, with Jones calling on the automaker to keep open plants it had slated for shutdown.  Aug. 28, 2019  The FBI conducted searches at the home of Jones and other locations as part of a corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.  Sept. 3, 2019  The UAW said it would target GM first in talks with the Detroit automakers for contracts set to expire on Sept. 14.  Sept. 12, 2019  U.S. prosecutors\u2019 probe of alleged corruption within the UAW expanded with the arrest of a senior union official. In a criminal complaint released the following day, a source said Jones was one of the unnamed officials singled out.  Sept. 16, 2019  The UAW workers went on strike against GM. The automaker disclosed it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in new investments, solutions for the Lordstown and Detroit assembly plants that included a battery plant in Ohio and an electric vehicle for the Michigan plant, a pay increase and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  Sept. 17, 2019  GM shifted health insurance costs for the striking workers to the UAW, prompting an outcry from the union and Democratic politicians. On Sept. 26, GM reversed its decision.  Oct. 1, 2019  The UAW rejected a new offer from GM to end the strike. Five days later, UAW senior negotiator Terry Dittes said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and later called on GM to boost U.S. auto production.  Oct. 10, 2019  The union disclosed that GM\u2019s Barra met with the UAW\u2019s Jones and Dittes at the company\u2019s Detroit headquarters, seeking to speed up talks, as the strike neared its fourth week.  Oct. 11, 2019  GM took the unusual step of appealing directly to striking employees, circumventing UAW\u2019s leadership, in a blog post that laid out the terms of its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, upsetting the UAW in the process. The union accused GM of undermining the talks.  Oct. 15, 2019  The sides near a deal after Barra and GM President Mark Reuss join the bargaining table.

The senators also asked if GM will produce additional electric cars or shift to building EV SUVs and crossovers.  The letter asks GM to disclose how many people at its suppliers in Ohio will lose their jobs if GM closes its Lordstown Assembly plant as well as how much it will cost to close the plant. GM plans to discontinue U.S. production of the Chevrolet Cruze, which is made in Lordstown.  GM is unlikely to build a new vehicle at Lordstown once it halts Cruze production in March, company officials say, and GM executives have told Congress it would take two years or longer to develop and prepare the plant to assemble a new vehicle.

The pandemic has killed over 3,300 people in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, and caused the government to lock down parts of the country to contain the spread.

GM Korea is responsible for supplying some of GM\u2019s small SUVs to the U.S. market to meet a consumer shift away from sedans. Like peers industry-wide, however, it is grappling with shrinking exports as demand suffers from governments globally restricting movement to slow the spread of the virus.  GM Korea will run its BP1 plant in Incheon, near Seoul, for seven business days this month and idle it for the remaining 11, showed its internal production plan seen by Reuters.  A spokeswoman said the automaker has suspended the line until May 5 due to the virus impact on parts procurement and U.S. sales, and that its production plan for the rest of May is subject to change.  GM Korea started producing the Trailblazer in January and shipping it to the United States in February, but is yet to begin U.S. sales, she said. The model is currently sold only in South Korea.  On parts, the government\u2019s virus response in the Philippines since mid-March has disrupted supplies of wiring harnesses, company officials said.  South Korea recorded some of the earliest infections after the virus spread from China, where it was first reported at the end of last year. The export-reliant economy has since managed to control the outbreak and allowed manufacturers to resume production - only to be met with slumping overseas demand.

The plan would mark a change of tack for GM, which currently produces all of the vehicles it sells in China within the country, which is set to be the only major economy to grow this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  GM, China\u2019s second-biggest foreign automaker, is aiming to offer four models as it looks to improve its brand image and support a sales recovery: Chevrolet\u2019s Tahoe and Suburban, Cadillac\u2019s Escalade and the GMC Yukon Denali.

The automaker sees opportunities for such vehicles, partly because Chinese families are expanding, he added.  \u201cWe are looking into a variety of market sales plans for these vehicles, including online sales, leasing and others,\u201d he said, declining to give a detailed timeframe for the plan.

The country has seen an auto sales pick up in recent months following a COVID-19-induced slump, and authorities say they have largely brought the epidemic under control following its emergence in the central city of Wuhan at the end of last year.

Markets should be pretty happy that growth will continue.\u201d  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suggest that there is going to be any dramatic uptrend (in construction.) But it also doesn\u2019t suggest a significant weakening from the path we\u2019ve been on... The issues on trade are certainly putting on hold investment plans in that space until people know how the terms of trade are going to be set. So if you\u2019re thinking about construction of warehouse space or facilities related to the moving of goods in the trade space, it\u2019s pretty reasonable that you wouldn\u2019t see any growth in that space.\u201d  MICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON  \u201cThe report itself is really strong. The top-line number came in well above the average jobs gains we\u2019ve seen all year, revisions were higher, unemployment rate ticked down, average hourly earnings ticked up and then areas that were previously weak or struggling like manufacturing and retail trade rebounded a bit and other job gains were pretty broad. Health care continues to be a strength of the jobs market.  \u201cOverall this was a very solid report and should put those fears of recession firmly in the rear view.  \u201cNot only the jobs data, but most economic data will continue to take a back seat to the U.S.-China trade negotiations and that the Dec. 15th date continues to loom over markets in terms of whether we\u2019ll make some significant announcement or progress in terms of delaying those tariffs that are scheduled into effect on Dec. 15.

There\u2019s not much in here to look at and say the labor market is slowing meaningfully.\u201d  \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been really interesting is that the participation rate has been grinding higher. Not only do you have an improving labor market but you have more people coming in off the sidelines. The 12 month average for the participation rate is 63%. The current number is 63.2 and last time it was 63.3. Now those might not sound like big improvements but when you\u2019re talking about an economy as big as the U.S. every little bit helps.\u201d  \u201cIt was a really good number and a lot of our forecast for 2020 is built off the back off the U.S. consumer continuing to spend. This jobs report reinforces that outlook and shows investors they should continue to make sure they\u2019re maintaining their equity allocations while not leaning out over their skis and that they should fight urge to get too defensive too early.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve stocks up and yields up and the dollar.

I think they are feeling really good right now that they\u2019ve decided to put this thing on pause.\u201d  JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO  \u201cKind of a blowout report, to put the 3-month average back above 200,000 is pretty amazing, with some of the revisions.

GM is not expected to disclose on Friday additional details, including precisely when the Cadillac EV will be built, whether it will be a crossover or sedan, or where it will be assembled, the sources said.  A GM spokesman declined to comment.  GM had previously focused on making electric vehicles under its mass market Chevrolet brand, including its plug-in Chevrolet Volt and battery electric Bolt. GM announced last year it was ending production of the plug-in Volt as well as a low-selling plug-in Cadillac CT6, even as it moved to boost EV spending.  GM said in November as part of its restructuring efforts it was doubling resources for electric and autonomous vehicle programs over the next two years.  Last month, two Ohio senators asked GM to commit to building all future electric vehicles for U.S. buyers within the country.  GM said in 2017 it planned by 2021 to introduce a new dedicated flexible electric vehicle architecture and an advanced battery system to support the development of at least 20 new models in the United States and China.  GM said in 2017 that a new electric vehicle platform in 2021 will serve as a base for at least nine derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large seven-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van.

GM officials said the announcement was planned well before Trump\u2019s series of angry GM tweets that started on Saturday. Trump called GM CEO Mary Barra on Sunday to raise the decision to end production at the Ohio plant, which is in a crucial state for the 2020 presidential election. He again ripped the company in a speech in Ohio on Wednesday.  GM has shown no indication it will reverse course and reopen the Lordstown plant.  Reuters reported on Thursday on GM\u2019s investment plans for the plant in Orion Township, outside Detroit.  Last year, GM said it would end production at five North American assembly plants and eliminate about 15,000 jobs, prompting outrage and a two-day visit by Barra to Capitol Hill to answer questions about the job cuts.  GM did not disclose the name or timing of the new GM EV but said it would be built on the same platform as the existing Chevrolet Bolt EV. GM did not disclose the name of the new EV or the timing of production.  The automaker said in total it is investing $1.8 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations this year, creating 700 new jobs and supporting 28,000 jobs across six states.  Additional product information and timing for the new Chevrolet EV will be released closer to production.  GM said producing the vehicle in a U.S. manufacturing plant supports the rules of origin provisions in the proposed United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement.  In February, GM disclosed that it had hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm run by Brian Ballard, a fundraiser for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.

Although GM\u2019s presence in the South Korean market is small with most cars made there destined for export, the slide in sales highlights uncertainty hanging over its operations after the automaker said it would shut one plant and decide the fate of three others in the coming weeks.  Its South Korean retail sales dropped 48 percent to just 5,804 in February, while wholesale sales of cars for export slid 9 percent to just over 30,000 vehicles.  \u201cConsumers appear to be concerned about everyday-life repercussions of owning a GM vehicle if its presence shrinks in South Korea, especially weaker after-service,\u201d said Esther Yim, an analyst at Samsung Securities.

GM Korea likely made an operating loss of 800 billion won ($740 million) last year, a fourth consecutive year of losses since the Chevy brand was pulled from Europe in 2013, South Korea\u2019s financial regulator said this week.  GM only has 7 percent of the South Korean market, trailing far behind South Korea's two biggest automakers, Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS and Kia Motors Corp 000270.KS, which have a combined share of 68 percent.

Khirfan, who has run his shop next to the GM truck plant for 32 years, said the strike could have political repercussions.  \u201cI take the pulse of the workers here. A lot of them feel abandoned by (U.S. President Donald) Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHe promised manufacturing jobs would come back, and it\u2019s not happened.\u201d  The United Auto Workers union strike is spreading pain throughout Michigan, a battleground for the November 2020 election where the economy was slowing before more than 23,000 UAW workers walked out of GM\u2019s Michigan plants in mid-September. The total number of UAW strikers nationwide is 48,000.  Unemployment in the state is 4.2%, and it has been rising even as the national rate continues to fall. The state\u2019s job growth has slowed dramatically, said Chris Douglas, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint. The strike has cost a total of $228 million in lost wages in the state between Sept. 16 and Oct. 6, according to the East Lansing, Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group.  The health of Michigan\u2019s economy matters to rivals in the 2020 U.S. presidential race.  Trump, a Republican, carried Michigan by less than 11,000 votes in 2016, an unexpected victory that along with wins in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin propelled his ascent to the White House. Trump\u2019s tough stance on trade and his promises to win back manufacturing jobs resonated with many UAW members.  Some of Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals have tried to use the GM strike to win back UAW votes. They have joined GM strikers on picket lines and echoed their calls for GM to share profit more fairly and invest more in U.S. plants.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  A HISTORY OF CONFLICT  Flint, a city of about 100,000 people located 70 miles (113 km) northwest of Detroit, has a long history of labor conflict. In 1936, workers at a GM factory here staged a sit-down strike that forced the automaker to recognize the United Auto Workers union, a milestone in U.S. labor relations.  Some workers picketing outside GM\u2019s Flint truck this week remembered the UAW\u2019s 1998 strike against GM parts-making plants in Flint that lasted 54 days and cost the company $2 billion. In the years following that bitter clash, GM sold or closed several of its Flint operations, shedding thousands of UAW jobs and battering the city\u2019s economy.  Today, Flint is one of the most impoverished cities in America. Nearly 40% of the city\u2019s residents live below the poverty line, according to U.S. Census data published in 2018. Flint suffered a prolonged water crisis that began in 2014, when it emerged that lead had leeched into its water supply, exposing many residents to elevated lead levels.  The sprawling GM truck assembly plant offered hope for better times. The new heavy-duty pickup trucks assembled at the plant are highly profitable, and GM President Mark Reuss earlier this year traveled to Flint to say the plant would hire 1,000 additional workers to build them.  The strike halted production just as the truck plant was ramping up to deliver vehicles to dealers.  DOUGHNUTS AND $250 A WEEK  Instead of earning overtime pay, GM truck plant workers are getting by on $250 a week in UAW strike pay.  On the picket line, strikers acknowledged the frequent horn blasts from passing drivers honking in solidarity. One truck driver arrived with free doughnuts for the strikers, while another group set up an impromptu hot dog stand.  Russ Van Buren, 47, a striking worker outside the Flint plant, describes himself as a political independent. He has not decided whom he will vote for next year, but said if the Michigan economy turns worse, Trump will be in trouble.  \u201cIf our economy goes down the toilet, people will desert Trump,\u201d Van Buren said. A third of UAW workers backed Trump in 2016, the union has said. \u201cPeople are going to look for another person to run this country,\u201d Van Buren said.  Standing nearby, Jeremy Henman, 32, a striking forklift driver, said he likes Trump\u2019s idea of a border wall and his support of gun owners, and thinks the economy is doing great.  \u201cI\u2019m thrilled with what he\u2019s done,\u201d Henman said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely voting for him again.\u201d","88":"The Honda logo is seen during the first press day of the Paris auto show, in Paris, France, October 2, 2018.

The redesign of the Ford F-series trucks, launched in 2014, set a new standard for fuel economy and lightweight vehicle construction. But armed with stopwatches and trained eyes, the GM engineers believed they saw problems.  \u201cThey had a real hard time getting those doors to fit,\u201d Tim Herrick, the executive chief engineer for GM truck programs told Reuters.  His team did more intelligence gathering. They bought and tore apart Ford F-series doors sold as repair parts. Their conclusion: GM could cut weight in its trucks for a lower cost using doors made of a combination of aluminum and high strength steel that could be thinner than standard steel, shaving off kilograms in the process.  These pounds and penny-based decisions will have major implications in the highest stakes game going in Detroit: dominance in the world\u2019s most profitable vehicle market, the petrol-fueled large pickup segment. What\u2019s more, GM is banking on strong sales of overhauled 2019 Silverados and GMC Sierras to fund its push into automated, electric vehicles \u2013 a business many investors see as the auto industry\u2019s long term future.  The risks are high given the hits automakers have taken from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies.  Rising aluminum prices spurred by Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up costs on the Ford\u2019s F-series, while rising steel and aluminum prices drag on GM results. GM also has a significant risk should the United States, Mexico and Canada fail to agree on a new NAFTA trade deal, given GM trucks built at its Silao, Mexico factory could face a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA collapses.  Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2IgOECU  Interviews with GM executives and a tour at its factory here in northwest Indiana provide a detailed look inside GM\u2019s plan for the most important vehicles in its global lineup.  These big pickups are everything Tesla Inc\u2019s Model 3 or a Chevy Bolt electric car is not.  The mostly steel body is bolted to the truck\u2019s steel frame, rather than the one-piece body and frame electric vehicles. The majority of trucks will have a V-8 gasoline engine in front powering the rear wheels \u2013 like the classic GM cars of the 1950s. Some Silverados will have new four-cylinder engines, but there is no electric or hybrid offering as of now. The new Silverado - GM\u2019s top-selling vehicle in the United States - is a technology achievement of a different kind.  It is taller and has a longer wheelbase than its beefy predecessor, which can help it more easily meet federal fuel efficiency rules. But it is 450 pounds lighter, and its V-8 engine achieves 23 mile per gallon on the highway that rivals smaller SUVs.  Wall Street investors give Tesla and its electric vehicles a higher value than GM\u2019s shares. GM is betting that its core customers in the American heartland will keep paying premium prices - 27 percent of GM trucks sell for more than $55,000 - for these vehicles capable of hauling a trailer by day and substituting for a luxury sedan by night.  Large pickups generate at least $17,000 a vehicle in pre-tax profit for GM, the company has indicated in disclosures to investors. GM executives told Reuters that with the new trucks, GM will have a big cost advantage they can use to chop at Ford\u2019s leading market share.  \u201cWe think we have thousands of dollars advantage (over Ford) just in the aluminum costs. It\u2019s big,\u201d said Herrick during a walk through the Fort Wayne plant, which began shipping the new Silverados and Sierras late last month.  He said GM plans to use its Silverado cost advantage to put more safety or entertainment technology in the trucks, fund programs such as a promised fleet of electric cars and return money to shareholders.  At Ford, truck marketing manager Todd Eckert said the company plans to stick to its game plan. For 41 years, the F-series trucks have been the best-selling single model line in the United States. For the first half of this year, the F-series line \u2013 which ranges from the light-duty F-150 to medium duty commercial trucks \u2013 has a 59,000 vehicle lead over the combined Chevrolet and GMC large pickups.  \u201cThere\u2019s always been competition in this segment and there always will be,\u201d Eckert said.  Ford\u2019s purchasing director Hau Thai-Tang at an investor conference on Wednesday called the F-series pickup \u201cone of our profit pillars,\u201d and said Ford plans to increase the share of its 2018-2022 product development budget allocated to trucks and commercial vehicles to 29 percent from 24 percent in its prior 2015-2019 plan.  A LIGHT METAL DUEL  For decades, Ford and GM matched each other\u2019s moves closely and built trucks that were similar in design, technology and capability.  With the launch of GM\u2019s new trucks, the rivals\u2019 technology strategies have diverged.  Ford in 2014 launched a new generation of F-series trucks with all-aluminum body structures for its big pickup trucks, and challenged rivals to find a better way match the fuel efficiency and towing power achieved using the lightweight metal and turbo-charged, six-cylinder engines.  Rising pressure from the U.S. government to slash carbon dioxide emissions made Ford\u2019s move look smart.  The debate within GM over whether to follow Ford\u2019s aluminum strategy \u201cwas a really hotly contested item for us,\u201d said Herrick. He recalled skeptical questions when he sought approval from GM\u2019s board for the billions of dollars required to launch the new Silverados at three factories.  \u201cSon, it really costs this much to build all those trucks?\u201d the 58-year-old executive recalled being asked by a member of the board.  Herrick, and Global Product Development chief Mark Reuss, said the shareholders\u2019 billions would be better spent on what they call a \u201cmulti-material\u201d strategy.  The new Silverado and Sierra got close to the Ford truck\u2019s weight using seven different grades of steel in the cab, aluminum hoods, door exterior panels and tailgates. Reuss pushed development of a novel carbon fiber plastic that will be molded to make load beds for certain high-priced GMC models \u2013 and perhaps be used in different ways in future GM models, Reuss said.  Before GM\u2019s direction was clear, a supplier to Ford sent Reuss a box of the rivets his competitor was using to fasten the F-series aluminum body panels together, anticipating he\u2019d be ordering them, too.  \u201cThey\u2019re still on my desk,\u201d Reuss said in an interview.  The combination of weight reduction and engine technology produces a rear-wheel drive 2019 Silverado with a 5.3 liter V-8 and an eight-speed automatic transmission that averages 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway, with a combined rating of 19 miles per gallon.  A Ford F-150 with a 3.5 liter turbo six cylinder is rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city, 21 on the highway and 19 combined, according to the government.  FOUR DOORS FOR PROFIT  In some crucial ways, GM is following Ford.  GM previously could not keep pace with demand for crew cab pickups \u2013 models with four, sedan-style doors in the cab. Ford used its lead in crew cab design to develop luxury truck models, such as the F-450 Limited, that have sticker prices as high as $100,000.  Average selling prices in the segment are around $42,000 to $45,000 - higher than the industry average.  GM has now dedicated two factories to building light duty pickups - in Fort Wayne and Silao, Mexico - which have the flexibility to build \u201cdarn near 100 percent crew cabs if we wanted,\u201d Herrick said.  The GMC marketing division, meanwhile, is putting more emphasis on its Denali luxury truck brand, while Chevrolet will market more luxurious versions of the Silverado such as the frontier-themed High Country, which has leather seats and a Bose sound system. GM executives said they want to increase the company\u2019s share of trucks sold at prices above $55,000 from the current 27 percent.  John Bergstrom, who owns a multi-brand network of dealerships based in Neenah, Wisconsin, said the new GM trucks should pull in buyers who currently don\u2019t drive a pickup.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the technology we needed,\u201d Bergstrom said. With the new truck, \u201cwe\u2019ve got that. They almost magically figured out how to get fuel economy out of these things.\u201d","90":"(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors Co GM.N, the top two U.S. automakers, have more than two dozen new battery electric vehicles (EVs) in the pipeline, according to their executives and suppliers familiar with the companies' plans.  FILE PHOTO: The corporate logo of Ford is seen at Brussels Motor Show, Belgium January 9, 2020. REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir  Their combined production in North America is expected to total 325,000 in 2026, according to data from AutoForecast Solutions. That will represent about 5% of their total North American production and less than Tesla Inc TSLA.O, the world leader in electric vehicles, produced last year.  Here is a detailed look at Ford and GM\u2019s plans for future electric vehicles:  FORD  Ford has said it will introduce the Mustang Mach-E, a battery-powered crossover with sports car styling, later this year, as well as an all-electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup in 2021. Also on tap next year: An electric edition of the full-size Transit van, the company said.  Ford also has confirmed plans to build a luxury Lincoln crossover on a battery-powered platform provided by Rivian, the Michigan-based electric vehicle startup that is also supplying Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. The big Lincoln is due in 2022, according to suppliers.  The automaker also has plans to introduce two new midsize electric crossovers, one each for the Ford and Lincoln brands, in 2023, suppliers said.  GM  GM has revealed one of its future EVs \u2014 the Cruise Origin self-driving shuttle \u2014 and shared details in early March with analysts and media of 13 other future EVs for the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. Suppliers familiar with GM\u2019s plans have shared additional details.  Buick is planning to introduce a midsize crossover and a companion SUV in 2023, the automaker said. It also expects to launch a compact crossover about the same time, according to suppliers.  Cadillac showed off three upcoming EVs \u2014 the Lyriq midsize crossover, the Celestiq luxury sedan and a large, unnamed SUV about the size and shape of its Escalade. The crossover and SUV are likely to arrive in 2023, while the big sedan could be pulled forward to 2022, suppliers said. Two other crossovers, a compact model about the size of the XT4 and a large seven-passenger model about the size of the XT6, are due in 2024, GM said.  Chevrolet said a facelifted Bolt EV and a slightly larger model, the Bolt EUV, will go into production next year. The next-generation Bolt is due in 2023. GM displayed a midsize Chevrolet SUV, due in 2023, that will be joined a year later by a compact crossover, according to suppliers. GM has said a full-size electric pickup is just around the bend \u2014 2023, suppliers said.  The GMC brand is getting a new sub-brand \u2014 Hummer \u2014 on two electric models, a large pickup truck and a slightly smaller SUV, GM has said, the former in late 2021, the latter in early 2023. Look also for a 1,000-horsepower performance variant of the Hummer pickup in 2022, which GM has teased. GMC also expects to get compact and midsize electric crossovers in 2025, according to suppliers.  PRODUCTION  Ford and GM have provided few details of where their electric vehicles will be made.  Production in North America will be spread among six plants, according to research firm AutoForecast Solutions, which monitors automakers\u2019 plans.  Ford will run four plants, including two in Mexico, where electric and gas-engine vehicles will be built under the same roof. GM will run two dedicated EV plants, both in Michigan.  In comparison, the two companies expect to build nearly 40 different trucks and SUVs in North America, most of them powered by gas engines, in 2026. GM and Ford are expected to build more than 5 million trucks and SUVs in at least 25 plants in North America by mid-decade, according to AutoForecast data.","91":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Tuesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted by revaluations of shares it holds in ride-hailing company Lyft Inc and France\u2019s Peugeot SA.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s shares were down 2.7 percent in morning trading.  The earnings came after a 7 percent decline in U.S. new-vehicle sales in the first quarter, in which smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\u2019s pickup trucks outsold GM\u2019s.  \u201cWe remain concerned with the U.S. auto cycle, both from a pricing and volume perspective,\u201d Buckingham Research analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note. \u201cMoreover, specific to GM, we are concerned about recently monthly pick-up truck and market share stats.\u201d  GM\u2019s sales in China also dropped almost 20 percent and profit there declined 37 percent. Auto sales in China industrywide fell 2.8 percent last year and were down again in the first quarter.  GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters that the Chinese market remains \u201cvolatile.\u201d  \u201cFrom an economic standpoint, there are green shoots,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have yet to see that translate to vehicle demand.\u201d  GM will launch 20 new models in China in 2019, most of them in the second half of the year.  In the United States, the automaker had around four months supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck on the ground as of the beginning of April, a high level in an auto market that overall is expected to decline in 2019.  CFO Suryadevara said that the company\u2019s inventory would be brought down over the course of the year without use of heavy consumer discounts.  She said that tariffs and higher commodity prices would cost GM around $1 billion in 2019.  As recently as late last year, GM executives insisted the automaker\u2019s Cruise self-driving unit would launch a commercial ride-hailing service by the end of 2019.  However, when asked several times on Tuesday when that service would launch, neither CFO Suryadevara nor Chief Executive Mary Barra would provide a date, repeatedly responding that GM\u2019s efforts would be \u201cgated by safety.\u201d  GM said it is \u201cbullish\u201d on pickup truck sales for the rest of 2019 as more versions of its new Silverado hit dealer showrooms and its heavy-duty trucks launch in the second half of the year.  Last week, rival Ford Motor Co reported a higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on strong pickup truck sales in its core U.S. market and said it was confident its 2019 results would be better than those of last year.  Ford said last week it will invest $500 million in U.S. electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive LLC, joining Amazon.com Inc in backing the potential rival to Silicon Valley\u2019s Tesla Inc. According to sources, GM had previously been in talks with Rivian about a possible investment.  GM CEO Barra told analysts on Tuesday the automaker will produce a full range of electric vehicles, including an all-electric pickup truck, but she did not provide details.  General Motors has preferred shares in Peugeot from when it sold its German Opel unit to the Paris-based automaker in 2017. Lyft completed an initial public offering at the end of the first quarter and the value of GM\u2019s stake rose $300 million. The increased value of those stakes added 31 cents per share to GM\u2019s first-quarter profit.  GM reported a first-quarter net profit of $2.2 billion, or $1.48 per share, up from $1.05 billion, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-items, the company earned $1.41 per share.  Analysts on average expected $1.11.  The company\u2019s revenue for the quarter fell to $34.9 billion from $36.1 billion a year earlier.  GM reiterated its full-year 2019 profit outlook for earnings per share of between $6.50 and $7.","92":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N Chief Executive Mary Barra plans to visit Capitol Hill next week to discuss its plans to halt production at five plants in North America next year and cut up to 15,000 jobs, two congressional aides said on Friday.

She added that GM \u201chas to be the most thoroughly disliked company in Washington DC right now.\u201d She also criticized GM\u2019s handling of the layoffs.  GM said this week that many workers at plants that are ending production will be able to transfer to open jobs at other plants.  Barra has been calling lawmakers this week to explain the decision to end production. Trump has threatened to revoke subsidies for GM for electric vehicles.  Barra also will speak at a forum next week at Harvard University in Massachusetts for new incoming members of Congress.  GM plans to halt production next year at three assembly plants: the Lordstown small-car factory near Youngstown, Ohio; the Detroit-Hamtramck complex in Detroit; and the Oshawa, Ontario, assembly complex near Toronto. It will also stop building several models now assembled at those plants, including the Chevrolet Cruze, the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse.  Additionally, GM plans to shutter the Warren transmission plant outside Detroit and a plant that makes electric motors and drivetrains outside Baltimore, Maryland.  GM could opt to add additional new products to those plants at a later date after it holds contract talks next summer with the United Auto Workers union.

The preliminary agreement with GM calls for the state-run bank to regain the power to block the sale of more than 20 percent of the unit\u2019s assets, a KDB official has previously said. The veto right, which had been in place since 2002 when GM acquired failed Daewoo Motors, expired in October.  GM is expected to extend loans of up to $3.6 billion while KDB is set to inject $750 million, the finance minister said.  A GM Korea spokesman declined to comment, saying talks are ongoing. KDB also declined to comment.  Kaher Kazem, GM Korea\u2019s CEO, said in an internal letter on Tuesday that it plans to reach a binding, final agreement with the government on Friday.  GM relies on its plants as a key export hub, building vehicles for the United States and other countries but production needs dropped after GM decided in 2013 to pull its Chevy brand from Europe.  The U.S. automaker has said it will introduce two new models to South Korea to boost sagging utilization rates.","98":"WASHINGTON\/DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday invoked emergency powers to require General Motors Co to build much-needed ventilators for coronavirus patients after he accused the largest U.S. automaker of \u201cwasting time\u201d during negotiations.  Trump, who has been on the defensive for not moving faster to compel the production of medical equipment, for the first time invoked the Defense Production Act, saying GM was not moving quickly enough even though earlier on Friday the largest U.S. automaker announced it would begin building ventilators in the coming weeks.  Asked about negotiations with GM over ventilators, Trump expressed anger with the company\u2019s decision to close an assembly plant in politically important Ohio. He also criticized GM\u2019s prior decisions to build plants outside the United States.  \u201cI didn\u2019t go into it with a favorable view,\u201d Trump told a news conference of the GM talks. White House adviser Peter Navarro said the administration ran into \u201croadblocks\u201d with GM this week.  GM said in a statement in response to Trump that it has been working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems and GM suppliers \u201caround the clock for over a week to meet this urgent need\u201d and said its commitment to Ventec\u2019s ventilators \u201chas never wavered.\u201d  The act grants the president power to expand industrial production of any key materials or products for national security and other reasons. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other Democrats have urged him to invoke the act, but the president had been reluctant to do so until now.  Democratic U.S. Senator Ed Markey said, \u201cAbout time. Now, tell us every day: which companies will be making more of this equipment, how much is being made, and where the equipment is going.\u201d  On Friday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States topped 100,000, the highest in the world according to a Reuters tally. The U.S. death toll topped 1,550. [L1N2BK21G]  Trump also said countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Italy need ventilators and that if the excess volume is not needed, the United States can export them.  Earlier, Trump lashed out at GM and Ford Motor Co for moving too slowly just hours before GM said it would build medical equipment at an Indiana plant.  Trump criticized the U.S. automakers and said he expected the United States would make or obtain 100,000 additional ventilators within the next 100 days.  The attack on the automakers coincided with rising tension between Trump and the Democratic governors of New York and Michigan, who have criticized the administration\u2019s response to the COVID-19 epidemic. On Thursday evening, Trump questioned in an interview on the Fox News network whether New York state needed 30,000 ventilators to cope with rising numbers of coronavirus patients, as Cuomo had said.  GM and Ford separately announced earlier this week they were working with medical equipment companies to help boost ventilator production.

REUTERS\/Caitlin Ochs\/File Photo  GM and its partner Ventec confirmed after Trump\u2019s tweets that the No. 1 U.S. automaker would deploy 1,000 workers to build ventilators at its Kokomo, Indiana, parts plant and ship as soon as next month. It was aiming to build more than 10,000 per month with the ability to go higher. Suppliers in the effort were told the target was 200,000 ventilators.  But early Friday, before GM issued its release, Trump attacked the automaker and Chief Executive Mary Barra on Twitter, reviving his grievance with Barra for closing and selling a car factory in Ohio, a state critical to the president\u2019s re-election campaign.  \u201cGeneral Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!! FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday.  \u201cThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed ventilators, \u2018very quickly\u2019,\u201d Trump said on Twitter of GM and Ventec\u2019s effort. \u201cNow they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar.\u201d  Trump\u2019s comments about GM and Ford came after a New York Times story Thursday suggested the White House had backed away from announcing a major ventilator deal with GM and Ventec because the price tag was too high. That drew criticism from Democrats.  Following Trump\u2019s tweets, Ford said it was moving as fast as it could to gear up its ventilator manufacturing efforts and was in \u201cactive conversations\u201d with the Trump administration seeking approvals. Ford said it has \u201cteams working flat-out with GE Healthcare to boost production of simplified ventilators.\u201d  Other automakers have said they are working to produce ventilators, masks and other medical equipment.  On Friday, Toyota Motor Corp said it was \u201cfinalizing agreements to begin working with at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity.\u201d  New York City Mayor Bill be Blasio on Friday said on Twitter that Tesla Inc had agreed to donate hundreds of ventilators to hospital intensive care units in New York City and the state of New York.  Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk in response said the electric carmaker was helping locate and deliver existing ventilators.  Tesla on Friday did not respond to a request for comment on where it got the ventilators and whether the company was producing any ventilators of its own, something Musk has said the company will do.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) and Ferrari previously said they were exploring making ventilators in Italy.","99":"TURIN\/PARIS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Thursday brushed off a shock lawsuit from General Motors Co and said it was confident of reaching a binding merger deal with Peugeot owner PSA Group by the end of this year to create the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker.  Chairman and CEO of Exor and Chairman of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles John Elkann attends an investors day held by the holding group of Italy's Agnelli family in Turin, Italy November 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Massimo Pinca  GM filed the lawsuit in the United States on Wednesday, alleging FCA had bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars.  FCA said the suit, seeking substantial damages, was \u201cmeritless\u201d and appeared intended to disrupt the Italian-American company\u2019s planned $50 billion merger with France\u2019s PSA.  \u201cThe GM lawsuit will be dealt with in appropriate places, but as we\u2019ve said already it is absolutely groundless and so it does not worry us,\u201d FCA Chairman John Elkann told reporters at a strategy briefing for Exor, the holding company of the Agnelli family which is FCA\u2019s largest shareholder.  \u201cLooking at how teams are working, both in FCA and PSA, I am encouraged to say that between now and year-end, we\u2019ll have a binding memorandum signed,\u201d he added.  JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a research note that GM could seek at least $6 billion in damages, but added a trial could be years away. He also noted that if GM\u2019s allegations were vindicated, Ford Motor Co could have a claim. Ford declined to comment.  At a Barclays auto conference in New York on Thursday, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra defended the lawsuit, noting she has often said: \u201c\u2018Give us a level playing field, and General Motors will compete, and we\u2019ll win.\u2019 And so when we saw facts indicated that was not the case, we felt it was in the best interest of all of our stakeholders in the company.\u201d  GM shares fell 1.7% to close at $34.67 on Thursday, while Fiat Chrysler shares fell 0.5% to $14.92 in New York. PSA closed nearly unchanged at 22.47 euros.  PSA declined to comment on the lawsuit and any potential impact on the merger talks.  LONG-TERM INVESTORS  FCA and PSA announced plans last month to combine forces to better tackle the cost of new technologies such as electric and self-driving vehicles as well as a downturn in auto markets.  The merger would create a group with 8.7 million in annual vehicle sales, overtaking GM and putting it fourth globally behind Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Toyota Motor Corp and the Renault-Nissan alliance.  In a letter to employees about the GM lawsuit, FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley said: \u201cWe are astonished by this filing, both its content and its timing.

GM rebuffed FCA\u2019s advances.  GM on Wednesday alleged that after it rejected a merger bid from FCA, Marchionne conspired to negotiate a new four-year contract with the UAW \u201cdesigned, through the power of pattern bargaining, to cost GM billions.\u201d Marchionne died in 2018.  FCA will vigorously defend itself against this \u201cmeritless\u201d lawsuit, Manley said in the letter to staff, seen by Reuters.  \u201cWe will not be slowed down by this act,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s keep the performance up as it has clearly got some of our competitors worried.\u201d  Manley was not named in the GM complaint and a source close to FCA said he was not linked to the case.  Elkann, a scion of the Agnelli family, also said Exor and the Peugeot family were committed to providing maximum support to the merged company and would provide stability for it in the years ahead.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been stable investors in the auto industry for the past 120 years, so, yes, I still see ourselves as stable investors in the auto industry in the next 10 years,\u201d Elkann said of Exor.","100":"FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019.

REUTERS\/Joseph White\/File Photo  The recall is expected to cost the Detroit automaker $1.2 billion.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said GM must recall 5.9 million 2007-2014 model year trucks and SUVs because the inflators \u201care at risk of the same type of explosion after long-term exposure to high heat and humidity as other recalled Takata inflators.\u201d  GM has estimated in securities filings it would cost $1.2 billion if it were required to replace air bag inflators it had sought to avoid fixing. The company confirmed the estimated cost Monday. GM said it will recall 7 million vehicles worldwide, including 544,000 in Canada.  The company had argued the recalls were unnecessary because they did not pose a safety risk.  GM said on Monday it still believed \u201ca recall of these vehicles is not warranted based on the factual and scientific record.\u201d The company said it \u201cwill abide by NHTSA\u2019s decision and begin taking the necessary steps.\u201d  The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying - especially after long-term exposure to high humidity -- prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 63 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators by 19 major automakers have been recalled.  The recall includes some Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Suburban, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra and GMC Yukon vehicles built over an eight-year period.  In total, 18 U.S. deaths have been reported tied to Takata air bag inflators, though none of those involved GM vehicles.  To date, 15 U.S. deaths have been reported in Honda vehicles, two in Ford Motor Co vehicles and one in a BMW since 2009.  GM first filed a petition in 2016 seeking to avoid the recall. NHTSA noted that in nearly 30 years, it has only granted one petition deeming a \u201cdefect is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety\u201d and \u201cin a vastly different set of circumstances.\u201d  GM argues the 5.9 million vehicles are different from other vehicles with Takata inflators. The automaker estimates that 66,894 Takata passenger air bag inflators have deployed in the vehicles under review without a reported rupture.  Peter Prieto, a lawyer representing consumers in Takata lawsuits, said the decision \u201cproves that GM\u2019s Takata inflators are neither unique nor special.

The Trump administration is reviewing whether Obama administration emissions standards that called for roughly doubling average U.S. vehicle fuel efficiency by 2025 are appropriate.  \u201cWe feel tax credits should be expanded so our customers continue to receive the benefit going forward,\u201d Barra told an energy conference in Houston. \u201cWe believe in an all-electric future.\u201d  GM has sold more than 160,000 plug-in and full-electric vehicles eligible for the credit. The $7,500 consumer tax credit phases out over a 12-month-period soon after an automaker hits the 200,000 mark and the largest U.S. automaker is expected to hit the mark later this year. The tax credit is aimed at helping defray the cost of pricier electric vehicles.  Introduced in October 2016, the Bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles (320 km) between charges, and sell at a sticker price of under $40,000.  Electrically powered vehicles account for a just a fraction of GM\u2019s overall sales. In 2017, an analyst estimated GM loses $7,400 on every Bolt it sells. GM does not disclose individual vehicle profitability, company spokesman Pat Morrissey said by phone.  GM sold about 26,000 Bolt EVs worldwide last year, mostly in the United States. The company declined to say how much it would hike production when it adds production later this year at an assembly plant north of Detroit.  Tesla Inc TSLA.O said last month it expected to reach the 200,000 figure later this year.  Congress opted not to kill the tax credit as part of a tax overhaul passed in December, but did not act on a proposal that would have lifted the cap entirely but then sunset the credit in a few years.  GM said in October it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide more specifics.

In 2004, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed its earlier decision allowing the taking of homes, calling it \u201ca radical departure from fundamental constitutional principles and over a century of this court\u2019s eminent domain jurisprudence.\u201d The court said it was acting to \u201cprotect the people\u2019s property rights, and preserve the legitimacy of the judicial branch as the expositor-not creator-of fundamental law.\u201d  GM tried to revive the Hamtramck plant in 2008, as it neared financial collapse, by giving it the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car to build. GM touted the Volt as a symbol of its technological promise, and a reason for the government to step in and rescue the company.  In 2010, then U.S. President Barack Obama visited the plant and even drove a Volt for about 10 feet. Some Republicans and conservative critics pilloried the Volt as the \u201cObama car.\u201d  In the years after the federal bailout of GM, gas prices fell and the Volt did not hit GM\u2019s ambitious sales targets. U.S. Volt sales are down 14 percent for the year through October to just 14,897 cars - about one-third the number of Chevrolet Silverado pickups GM sells in a month. Since 2010, GM has sold about 150,000 Volts - about half the capacity of a typical car plant running at full speed.  GM on Monday did not definitively say the Hamtramck plant will be closed but instead called the factory \u201cunallocated,\u201d meaning it has no products to build after 2019.  It is possible GM could reach an agreement with the local union to put a vehicle in the plant in talks next year.","114":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N on Wednesday stepped up efforts to cut costs in response to tariff and market pressures, even as it reported third-quarter profit that blew past Wall Street expectations.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker said on Wednesday it is offering buyouts to salaried employees with 12 or more years of service, as Chief Executive Mary Barra told them in an email: \u201cOur structural costs are not aligned with the market realities.\u201d  GM shares jumped more than 8 percent to $36.34, their highest in almost six weeks.  The Detroit automaker had previously promised investors it would cut $6.5 billion in costs this year, and the buyouts would add to that total, a company spokesman said on Wednesday.  The company said in a separate statement that it would consider layoffs after it sees the impact of the buyouts and other cost cutting efforts.  About 18,000 of the company\u2019s 50,000 salaried employees in North America are eligible for the buyouts, the company spokesman said. They do not affect the hourly workers on GM\u2019s production lines.  GM\u2019s move to cut staff stood in contrast to an upbeat profit outlook and its recent success in raising prices, which boosted profit before tax by $1 billion overall in the quarter, mostly in North America.  In her email to employees, Barra focused on the fact that GM has burned through $300 million in cash in its automotive operations during the first nine months of 2018. She also noted that the company\u2019s stock price is still stuck near the $33 a share price at which it debuted in 2010 after a bankruptcy restructuring.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  HIGHER MATERIALS COSTS  For Detroit\u2019s automakers, rising materials costs caused by new tariffs on foreign metals imposed by the Trump administration are converging with a slowly deflating U.S. market and a sharper falloff in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market.  GM and rivals Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI have all in recent weeks forecast substantial hits from steel and aluminum costs driven by tariffs.  In the third quarter, GM said it was able to raise prices by $900 million in North America, in part because it is launching a new generation of its large pickup trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. Ford, however, has an older product line, and said its net pricing in North America fell by $318 million in the third quarter.  The pricing gains are \u201cabsolutely sustainable,\u201d GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said.  GM said it still sees a full-year profit in the range of $5.80 to $6.20 a share, but said it now expected to finish at the high end of the range with potential to finish even higher. It cited a favorable tax rate and its strong performance. Wall Street has been expecting $5.88 per share, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.  In July, GM lowered its full-year forecast, citing higher steel and aluminum costs due to tariffs.  The company said it still expects about $4 billion in free cash flow for the year before the impact of $600 million in pension contributions.  Excluding the effect of any cost cutting it achieves, GM\u2019s Suryadevara reaffirmed GM\u2019s commodity costs in 2019 will increase by $1 billion over 2018. Ford has said it expects tariffs to reduce profits by $1 billion in 2018 and 2019, and Fiat Chrysler has warned rising metals costs could cost it 850 million euros ($963 million) this year and next year.  PRESSURE INCREASE  The rise in materials costs is increasing pressure on automakers to cut costs ahead of a predicted decline in U.S. vehicle demand after an unusually long bull market.  Earlier this month, Ford said it would cut its 70,000-strong global salaried workforce by an unspecified number and hoped to complete the cuts by the end of June 2019. This week, the No. 2 U.S. automaker is holding three days of meetings to discuss ways to flatten the structure of its salaried workforce and get managers to oversee larger numbers of employees.  GM has cut production at car plants over the last two years and its hourly workforce fell by 4,000 workers last year, according to GM\u2019s annual report. In addition, GM in June ended the second shift at its Lordstown, Ohio assembly plant, cutting 1,500 jobs.  In China, GM\u2019s largest market by vehicle sales, the automaker said it booked a record $500 million in income from its joint ventures. That result was in spite of the sharpest industry sales drop in nearly seven years during September.  The impact of the sales drop hit harder in China\u2019s interior, and demand remains strong in larger cities and for luxury vehicles, including GM\u2019s Cadillac models, Barra said on a conference call with analysts.  GM reported third-quarter net income of $2.53 billion, or $1.75 a share, compared with a loss last year of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 a share. Last year\u2019s quarter included a charge related to Europe.  Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.87 a share in the third quarter, easily beating the $1.25 average analyst estimate, according to I\/B\/E\/S data from Refinitiv.

Ford, however, helped offset some of those losses by posting gains of slightly over 7 percent. It also sold the highest number of vehicles in the month.  Higher interest rates and protracted cycle of sales growth has contributed to the slight tailing off of sales, said David Adams, president of the Global Automakers of Canada.  The Bank of Canada has raised here interest rates four times so far this year and signaled more rate hikes to come as the country grapples with the pressures of rising inflation.

The automaker gave notice to its lenders that it would borrow an existing credit facility almost in its entirety on Tuesday.  But the decision to draw down on its facilities comes as the company is undergoing its customary refinancing discussions for US$16.5bn in debt led by JP Morgan.  GM is on a rocky road as it readies to suffer a significant revenue loss due to the shutdown of its North American plants that could extend beyond March 30.  On Wednesday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service announced it could downgrade GM\u2019s Baa2 bank credit facility rating and its Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating into junk territory.  \u201cA severe disruption in automotive demand due to the coronavirus combined with the possibility of a follow-on economic recession, will place considerable pressure on GM\u2019s cash flow and credit metrics,\u201d Moody\u2019s said in a report.  GM said it expects to borrow amounts on its revolver as a proactive measure to shore up liquidity and strengthen its financial position due to global market uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The company and its lead banks are currently debating the best outcome for both parties through a crisis of unprecedented magnitude that has created a playing field that is much different from the one in which lenders originally committed to lend.  On Wednesday, Congress reached an agreement on a US$2trn economic stimulus bill to alleviate the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The much-anticipated spending bill does not make specific mention of automakers, but sets aside US$454bn to make loans or loan guarantees for companies across all sectors, according to Reuters.  \u201cThey want to show liquidity,\u201d a banking source said. \u201cIn order to qualify for the government bailout you need to keep your employees on the payroll.\u201d  Companies use revolving credit facilities, known as revolvers, as backstop financing in case short-term commercial paper lines that cover for expenses such as payroll fail to roll over. Borrowers can draw down, repay, and re-borrow these funding lines at will. For the most part, these facilities pay low rates and remain undrawn.  But as the coronavirus crisis intensifies in the US, more and more corporations are drawing down on their facilities to strengthen their liquidity position in case cash dries out.  \u201cYou have made a commitment to a company that you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to look like in three months, six months,\u201d the banking source said. \u201cEvery company is now a different company. This situation is unprecedented. It\u2019s a game changer for the entire market.\u201d  GM could go ahead with the transaction as it was originally offered, reduce the overall size of the financing, or address only near-term maturities, three banking sources said.  The company has two upcoming maturities, including a US$4bn, three-year loan and a US$2bn, 364-day loan, both set to mature in April 2021, according to a second filing with the SEC.  GM may ultimately decide to put the refinancing on hold, the three banking sources said.  The car maker also has a US$10.5bn credit facility that matures in April 2023.  The debt refinancing was meant to extend maturities, but leave pricing unchanged. It\u2019s an exercise the car maker performs every two years, according to bankers.  The deadline for commitments was Wednesday. Target closing for the financing is mid-April, the banking sources said.  GM drew down on its revolving line of credit to ensure it had access to those funds during this uncertain situation, a GM spokesperson said in an email.  The company, which prior to the draw was projected to have between US$15bn-US$16bn of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the quarter, did not have any immediate cash needs when it made the decision, the spokesperson said in the email.  A JP Morgan spokesperson declined to comment.  FORD\u2019S CHOICE  GM\u2019s decision to borrow as early as Friday comes on the heels of a similar choice by rival Ford Motor Co that canceled a debt refinancing transaction after it also announced plans to draw down on its credit facility, two banking sources said.  In February, Ford also asked its JP Morgan-led bank group to refinance US$15.4bn in revolving credits but in March decided to draw down on the facility and postponed its refinancing plans as market conditions deteriorated, two banking sources said.  Ford drew US$13.4bn under its corporate credit facility and US$2bn under its supplemental credit facility, for a total of US$15.4bn. The borrowings will be used to \u201coffset the temporary working capital impacts of the coronavirus-related production shutdowns and to preserve Ford\u2019s financial flexibility,\u201d according to a March 19 Ford press release.  Ford has said it would revisit its refinancing plans as early as September, two banking sources said. GM could decide to do the same, they said.  On Wednesday, Moody\u2019s downgraded Ford further into junk territory, cutting the company\u2019s rating to Ba2, from Ba1, citing \u201cthe severe shock of the coronavirus pandemic combined with Ford\u2019s already-weak operating performance and a years-long restructuring that is a drain on cash flow.\u201d  Also on Wednesady, S&P Global downgraded the company\u2019s credit rating into junk, lowering its long-term issuer credit rating to BB+ from BBB-.  Fitch on Monday cut Ford\u2019s credit rating one notch to BBB- with a negative outlook.  A Ford spokesperson referred questions to the March 19 news release.  Due to its reliance on international supply chains, automakers were one of the sectors expected to be hit hardest by coronavirus.  Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said March 18 they would shut down their North American plants to stop the spread of the virus, as they bowed to pressure from the union representing about 150,000 hourly workers at those facilities, Reuters reported.  On Monday, trade groups representing automakers including GM, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp said in a letter to congressional leadership that the US Congress should set up facilities to provide loans and loan guarantees to large employers, medium-size manufacturers and small businesses facing revenue losses due to COVID-19. The trade groups expect retail sales to be down by as much as 40% in March compared to the same month in 2019.  GM and Ford join a list of companies that have funded their credit lines in order to boost liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Lenders have been acquiescing to the borrowing requests so far.  GM\u2019s 364-day loan pays 12.5bp undrawn, the three-year pays 15bp undrawn and the five-year pays 17.5bp.  The drawn margin on the three facilities is 125bp over Libor.  GM has a separate US$3bn, three-year revolving credit line that is not part of the refinancing effort.  As of December 31, GM had US$17.3bn in cash available under credit facilities and total available liquidity of US$37.2bn, according to the second SEC filing.

Wall Street analysts have viewed the strike costs as a tradeoff for three U.S. plant closures agreed to with the union that will boost GM\u2019s profitability. Shares in GM were up 4.3% in midday trading.  \u201cThe underlying business was strong this quarter,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters at GM\u2019s headquarters, describing the strike as a \u201cone-time impact.\u201d  Last Friday, the 48,000 United Auto Workers union members at GM ratified a new four-year labor deal with the Detroit company, ending a 40-day strike. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak in a research note called the deal\u2019s financial impact \u201cmanageable.\u201d  The Detroit-based automaker reported a 6% increase in third-quarter U.S. sales, led by its highly-profitable full-size pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers that helped it race to a strong profit margin of almost 11% in North America. It\u2019s that underlying business that has investors excited.  \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m as emboldened as ever,\u201d said Chris Susanin, co-portfolio manager at Levin Easterly Partners, which owned more than 4 million GM shares at the end of June. \u201cI don\u2019t see why this stock isn\u2019t north of $100 (a share) in a couple years.\u201d  Virtually all of the pre-tax profits came from its North American business and its captive finance arm.  In China, where GM reported a 17.5% drop in third-quarter sales, the company\u2019s equity income fell 40% to $300 million.  It was the fifth straight quarterly sales decline for GM in China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, where the industry is expecting a second consecutive annual sales drop.  The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects a 5% decline in industry sales in 2019, then contracting or growing slowly over the next three years.  \u201cIt (China) remains volatile,\u201d GM CFO Suryadevara said. Last week, GM\u2019s smaller U.S. rival, Ford Motor Co, cut its forecast for operating profit for the year after a disappointing quarter hurt by higher warranty costs, bigger discounts and weaker-than-expected performance in China.  GM said the strike by the UAW had cost it $1 billion in pre-tax profits in the quarter, or 52 cents per share. CFO Suryadevara said the automaker lost around 300,000 units of vehicle production during the strike. GM will not recover most of that loss in 2019 and any recovery next year will be dependent on U.S. market demand.  The union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike.  Under the deal, GM will invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 billion directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker said the full-year impact of the strike would be around $2 per share, or around $3 billion.  GM said it now expected full-year adjusted earnings per share between $4.50 to $4.80, down from its previous forecast of $6.50 to $7 per share.  The company said it now expected full-year adjusted automotive free cash flow in a range from zero to $1 billion, down from its previous forecast of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. GM\u2019s adjusted automotive free cash flow stood at $2.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. The strike reduced cash flow for the year by about $5.5 billion.  GM also cut its projected 2019 capital expenditures to around $7.5 billion from its previous outlook of $8 billion to $9 billion. Suryadevara said no plans were cut and the lower spend was due to operating efficiencies.  GM will provide more detailed forecasts for 2020 early next year, but Suryadevara said one expected 2020 challenge will likely be lower U.S. industry sales.  The automaker posted third-quarter net income of $2.3 billion, or $1.60 a share, down from $2.5 billion, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $1.72 a share. Analysts had expected $1.31, on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell slightly to $35.47 billion from $35.79 billion, above analysts\u2019 estimates of $33.82 billion.","121":"(Corrects Ohio location to Moraine instead of Lorain, paragraph 4)  WASHINGTON\/TORONTO May 8 (Reuters) - Under political pressure not to cut jobs, General Motors Co announced on Wednesday it would maintain some operations at a Canadian factory, and U.S. President Donald Trump touted the automaker\u2019s expected sale of its Lordstown, Ohio, plant to an electric truck-building company.  The decisions came after GM faced months of criticism over its plan announced in November to close five North American plants and cut 15,000 jobs. GM\u2019s decision to close the small-car Ohio assembly plant in a key state in the 2020 election had already become fodder for several Democratic presidential candidates.  GM did not immediately comment but said it planned to make an announcement later in the day.  Trump, in a tweet, said the sale of the Ohio plant to Workhorse Group Inc will require the approval of the United Auto Workers union. Trump said GM will invest $700 million in three other Ohio facilities and add 450 jobs. A person briefed on the matter said GM will make investments in its Toledo, Parma and Moraine operations.  Trump spoke to GM Chief Executive Mary Barra earlier on Wednesday before the company announced plans to keep some operations in place in Canada.  Trump in June 2017 advised workers in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, that factory jobs were not leaving. \u201cDon\u2019t move, don\u2019t sell your house,\u201d he said.  GM does not yet have a final agreement to sell the plant to Workhorse and there are many issues that will need to be resolved before a sale could be completed, two sources said.  It is not clear how many people Workhorse may employ, whether they would make as much as the UAW workers at Lordstown or if GM will have a continuing business relationship with Workhorse. It is likely it would take at least a year or two before the plant, which halted production in March, could reopen, the sources said.  Workhorse shares jumped nearly 70 percent on Trump\u2019s tweet and were briefly halted. At midday on Wednesday the shares were up 43.6 percent at $1.21.  Separately, GM and the largest union representing Canada\u2019s auto workers have reached a deal to partly rescue an Ontario car-making plant slated to close this year by turning it into a parts-making facility, the automaker said in a statement.  The transformation of GM\u2019s Oshawa site, which would also be used to conduct advanced vehicle testing, would save 300 jobs and have \u201cthe potential to grow and generate significant additional jobs in the coming years, as the business attracts new customers,\u201d the U.S. automaker said in a statement.  Canadian union Unifor, which had fiercely opposed the shutting of the plant\u2019s doors, had previously said the closure was contrary to a contract that stipulates there would be no plant closure.  \u201cThere are 300 families that are better off than they would have been in December,\u201d said Unifor President Jerry Dias in Toronto.  Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers\u2019 Association, said, \u201cGM\u2019s decision to keep their Oshawa facility operating is unexpected and allows for the emerging automotive technology ecosystem they are building locally to perhaps lift that region again one day.\u201d (Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington, Tyler Choi in Toronto and Allison Lampert in Montreal Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit Editing by Matthew Lewis)","122":"DETROIT, July 29 (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra said Wednesday \u201cnothing is off the table\u201d when it comes to maximizing the value of the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s electric vehicle efforts, including a possible spinoff of those assets.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette will attend the event featuring the pre-production vehicle on Thursday in the politically important state of Ohio.  \u201cOhio has always been an auto state, an auto parts state... and really this is the future,\u201d Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said of Lordstown Motors\u2019 \u201cEndurance\u201d electric truck on Wednesday.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  U.S. District Court Judge Paul Borman called on GM CEO Mary Barra and FCA CEO Mike Manley to meet in person to try to resolve a case that could drag on for years.  \u201cWhat a waste of time and resources now and for the years to come in this mega-litigation if these automotive leaders and their large teams of lawyers are required to focus significant time-consuming efforts to pursue this nuclear-option lawsuit if it goes forward,\u201d Borman said at the end of a hearing during which FCA asked the judge to dismiss GM\u2019s lawsuit.  Borman said instead, the companies need to focus on building cars and keeping people employed at a time when the coronavirus has hurt the U.S. economy and the country is also dealing with issues of racial injustice after the death of George Floyd, a Black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis triggered worldwide protests.  GM filed the racketeering lawsuit against FCA last November, alleging its rival bribed United Auto Workers (UAW) union officials over many years to corrupt the bargaining process and gain advantages, costing GM billions of dollars. GM is seeking \u201csubstantial damages\u201d that one analyst said could total at least $6 billion.  Barra and Manley should meet, taking into account social distancing to keep them safe, to \u201cexplore and indeed reach a sensible resolution,\u201d Borman said in the hearing, which was broadcast online.  It is common for judges to order parties to try to resolve disputes out of court. But it is unusual that the chief executives of two big companies be instructed to meet face-to-face, not just to settle their differences but also to serve a greater good.  A GM spokesman said the No. 1 U.S. automaker has a strong case and \u201cwe look forward to constructive dialogue with FCA consistent with the court\u2019s order.\u201d  FCA officials said in a statement they still believe the lawsuit is meritless but acknowledged Borman\u2019s concerns and said they \u201clook forward to meeting to discuss them and ideally put this matter behind us.\u201d  Borman said he wanted to hear from Barra and Manley personally at noon on July 1 to provide him with results from their discussion.

GM declined to comment for this story, but the company\u2019s executives privately express frustration with the market\u2019s reluctance to see it as anything more than a manufacturer tied mainly to auto market sales cycles.  GM\u2019s profitable North American truck and SUV business and its money-making China operations are valued at just $14 billion, excluding the value of GM\u2019s stake in its $14.6 billion Cruise automated vehicle business and its cash reserves from its $44 billion market capitalization.  The recent slump in the Chinese market, GM\u2019s largest, and plateauing U.S. demand are ratcheting up the pressure.  GM is one of the few global automakers without a founding family or a government to serve as a bulwark against corporate raiders.  In 2015, a group led by investor Harry Wilson pressed GM to launch a $5 billion share buyback, and commit to what is now an $18 billion ceiling on the level of cash the company would hold. In 2017, GM fended off a call by hedge fund manager David Einhorn to split its common stock shares into two classes.  Einhorn, whose firm still owned more than 21 million shares at the end of June, declined to comment about GM\u2019s stock price.  Other investors said there were no clear alternatives to Barra\u2019s approach.  \u201cI\u2019m clearly a frustrated investor,\u201d said Michael Razewski, a partner with Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which owned 2.57 million GM shares at the end of September. \u201cGM is a name that I am still particularly bullish about despite years of disappointment.\u201d  Some investors said they would welcome a spinoff or partial float of Cruise, or the creation of a tracking stock, as a way of calling attention to the potential value of GM\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology.  \u201cIn the near term, really the only way to drive this stock higher is via Cruise,\u201d Razewski said.Some investors have given up waiting.

The alliance announced in September included plans for GM to supply Nikola with fuel cells for its large commercial trucks and in return receive an 11% stake and payments up to $700 million for building the startup\u2019s Badger electric pickup.

United Auto Workers (UAW) Vice President Terry Dittes told union members in a statement issued late in the day that \u201call unsettled proposals are now at the Main Table and have been presented to General Motors.  \u201cWe are awaiting their response,\u201d Dittes said, adding: \u201cThis back and forth will continue until negotiations are complete.\u201d  There are still significant issues that need to be addressed, a person briefed on the matter said. More meetings were set for the evening, but the source said no deal was expected Wednesday.  UAW members went on strike at GM on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker\u2019s profit and protection of their healthcare benefits.  The strike has cost GM about $100 million a day, analysts said.  IHS analyst Joe Langley said at a conference on Wednesday the company could lose about 70,000 vehicles of production from a two-week strike and be challenged to make up the loss over the short term.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  The walkout - the longest autoworker strike in nearly 30 years - has become a political event, attracting the attention of Democratic politicians, who have been visiting the striking workers and voicing their support.  The Democratic presidential candidates have echoed the striking workers in saying GM employees deserve fair treatment from the Detroit automaker they helped through bankruptcy.  President Donald Trump, a Republican, convinced numerous UAW members to vote for him in 2016, helping him win Michigan, Ohio and other states. He has repeatedly demanded GM find a new vehicle for its now-shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, a key state for him in the 2020 presidential election.  GM officials have tried to counter charges that they are abandoning U.S. workers, releasing details of an offer to the UAW that included the promise of investing $7 billion in U.S. plants, annual raises in a new four-year deal, increased profit sharing and retention of existing healthcare insurance.  However, the sources familiar with the negotiations said some of the bigger remaining issues relate to how fast newer hires progress to the top UAW pay scale of about $31 an hour. Currently, it takes eight years to reach that level for newer hires and the union wants a faster ramp to the top.  Another big issue is the use of temporary workers, who have no pathway to full-time job status and few rights related to sick time or vacation days, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the talks are ongoing.  GM has said it can reduce its cost disadvantage with the international automakers in the U.S. market and safeguard union jobs by using temporary workers. The use of temps also allows Detroit automakers to cover for high rates of absenteeism among UAW workers.","131":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and electric truck startup Nikola Corp NKLA.O will join forces to build electric pickup trucks and fuel cell commercial trucks to take on Tesla Inc TSLA.O, in a deal that lifted shares in both companies on Tuesday.  As part of a multi-part, multibillion-dollar deal, GM received an 11% stake in Nikola, valued at about $2 billion. In return for the Nikola shares, GM will supply Nikola with batteries, a chassis architecture, fuel cell systems and a factory to build the startup\u2019s proposed Nikola Badger pickup. GM will also supply fuel cell technology for Nikola\u2019s planned Class 7 and 8 commercial tractor-trailers.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of General Motors is pictured at its plant in Silao, in Guanajuato state, Mexico, November 9, 2017. Picture taken November 9, 2017. REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido  The administration in May launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles pose a national security threat, and U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose a 20 percent vehicle import tariff.  The largest U.S. automaker said in comments filed with the U.S. Commerce Department that overly broad tariffs could \u201clead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less \u2014 not more \u2014 U.S. jobs.\u201d  Higher tariffs could also hike vehicle prices and reduce sales, GM said.  Its comments echoed those from two major U.S. auto trade groups on Wednesday, when they warned that tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported vehicles would cost hundreds of thousands of auto jobs, dramatically raise prices on vehicles and threaten industry spending on self-driving cars.  Even if automakers opted not to pass on higher costs \u201cthis could still lead to less investment, fewer jobs, and lower wages for our employees. The carry-on effect of less investment and a smaller workforce could delay breakthrough technologies,\u201d GM said.  GM operates 47 U.S. manufacturing facilities and employs about 110,000 people in the United States. It buys tens of billions of dollars worth of parts from U.S. suppliers every year, and has invested over $22 billion in U.S. manufacturing operations since 2009.  Still, 30 percent of the vehicles GM sold on the U.S. market in 2017 were manufactured abroad, according to the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research. Eighty-six percent of those vehicles came from Canada and Mexico, while others came from Europe and China.  Detroit automakers Ford Motor Co and Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles NV also import many of the vehicles they sell in the United States.  \u201cThe overbroad and steep application of import tariffs on our trading partners risks isolating U.S. businesses like GM from the global market that helps to preserve and grow our strength here at home,\u201d GM said.  Some aides have said that Trump is pursuing the national security probe to put pressure on Canada and Mexico to agree to concessions in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement.  GM shares closed down about 2.8 percent on Friday at $39.40.  Toyota Motor Corp filed separate comments opposing the tariffs on Friday saying they would \u201cthreaten U.S. manufacturing, jobs, exports, and economic prosperity.\u201d  The company noted that Trump has repeatedly praised the Japanese automaker for investing in the United States, including a new $1.3 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama with Mazda.  \u201cThese investments reflect our confidence in the U.S. economy and in the power of the administration\u2019s tax cuts,\u201d Toyota said.  Toyota noted that international automakers assembling vehicles in the United States are based in countries including Japan, German and South Korea \u201cthat are America\u2019s closest allies.\u201d  The Commerce Department plans two days of public hearings next month and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said last week he aimed to wrap up the probe into whether imported vehicles represent a national security threat by late July or August.  \u201cWe have received approximately 2,500 comments already,\u201d Ross said in a statement on Friday, adding that he expected more before a midnight deadline.  \u201cThe purpose of the comment period and of the public hearing scheduled for July 19th and 20th is to make sure that all stakeholders\u2019 views are heard, both pro and con.

(Reuters) - Long before the pistons for General Motors Co V-6 engines reach the U.S. No. 1 automaker\u2019s Romulus, Michigan plant, they are seasoned international travelers.  Powdered aluminum from Tennessee is shipped to Pennsylvania and forged at high temperatures into connecting rods for the pistons, which are then sent to Canada to be shaped and polished. They are then shipped to Mexico for sub-assembly and finally the finished pistons are loaded onto trucks bound for Romulus to become part of a GM V-6 engine.  The parts make four international border crossings in all, without a single tariff levied.  \u201cThey already have their passports,\u201d said Jim Bovenzi, GM\u2019s executive director of global supply chain on a recent tour of the Romulus plant. \u201cWe look at North America as a borderless region. We have parts and components coming back and forth across the border all the time.\u201d  GM\u2019s V-6 engine is just one example of how GM and rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have used the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to shift work to lower-cost facilities across the continent, cutting expenses and boosting returns from the region that represents the bulk of their global profits.  U.S. President Donald Trump now seeks to replace NAFTA with the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed by the countries\u2019 leaders last November, which he says will boost American jobs.  U.S. automakers have lobbied hard for the new treaty to preserve NAFTA\u2019s effective lack of borders, and say they can work with it because it does just that.  However, if Trump follows through on his repeated threats to pull the United States out of NAFTA if the U.S. Congress does not ratify USMCA, automakers would be forced to pay a patchwork of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules.  That would destroy the cost advantages of their cross-border supply chains - which include U.S. companies employing American workers - and would likely force automakers to redesign their manufacturing models and find cheaper alternatives elsewhere, industry experts say.  The uncertainty means automakers and manufacturers are holding off on key investments.  \u201cA lot of our production is very, very capital intensive and when you\u2019re deploying that much capital you want to have a clear sense of what the rules are,\u201d said Everett Eissenstat, GM\u2019s vice president for global public policy. \u201cIt\u2019s quite important for us to get those (USMCA) rules in place so we can have some stability and predictability to continue to produce and invest here in the United States.\u201d  Slideshow ( 20 images )  U.S. business investments fell 3% in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter, due to concerns over mounting trade tensions, including the issue of NAFTA and tariffs worldwide.  \u201cBusinesses are already becoming more cautious about investments,\u201d said Michael Gregory, head of U.S. economics at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cIf we get to the point where the administration is actively talking about tearing up NAFTA, I think that would trump any concern about China.\u201d  Democrats, who are pushing for more labor and environmental protections in the new treaty, say they are making progress toward passing USMCA in 2019. But if that does not happen, it risks being postponed in 2020 ahead of the next presidential election, which would mean an extended period of uncertainty.  JOURNEY OF A PISTON  GM\u2019s Romulus Powertrain plant makes about 400,000 V-6 engines a year for high-margin Cadillac SUVs, light pickup trucks and other GM vehicles  The pistons that end their long journey there are only a small part of the 70-plus trucks bearing parts such as engine blocks or cylinder heads, that arrive there daily.  The Romulus-built V-6 uses 235 parts from 100 primary suppliers. Sixty-seven ship from factories in the United States, 13 from Mexico, 8 from Canada and 12 from elsewhere in the world. Most of the electronics come from Asia.  All told, GM spends $71 billion a year on materials, sourcing 133,000 different parts from 3,100 primary suppliers.  At Romulus, five trucks daily carrying 288 100-pound (45 kg) engine blocks - the heart of the V-6 engine - each come from either a GM casting operation in Saginaw, Michigan, or a supplier in Mexico.  The Mexican parts are cheaper, GM\u2019s Bovenzi said, but using dual suppliers reduces the risk of relying on one plant for a critical part like the engine block.  Slideshow ( 20 images )  The more labor intensive it is to make, the more likely a part is sourced from Mexico, according to James Rubenstein, a professor of geography at Oxford, Ohio-based Miami University who has studied the automobile industry and NAFTA.  \u201cFinal assembly costs don\u2019t affect the overall cost of a vehicle that much,\u201d he said. \u201cFocusing on labor-intensive parts further down the chain is what really makes a difference.\u201d  MARRIAGE OF PARTS  When the V-6 engines - now weighing around 500 pounds - are unloaded at GM\u2019s Spring Hill plant near Nashville, an even bigger marriage of components takes place.  As individually labeled V-6 engines move down the line - for Cadillacs and Acadias - about 200 parts from 88 different suppliers are attached. Fifty-eight are American, 12 Mexican, 5 Canadian and 13 from elsewhere.  Spring Hill workers install an automatic transmission from a GM plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a starter and generator made in Tennessee by Japanese supplier Denso Corp, an air conditioning compressor made by Denso in Michigan, a drive belt made by Gates Industrial Corp Plc in Mexico, tensioners and a pulley made by Gates in Canada, converters made in Tennessee by Tenneco Inc and battery cables from China.  Ford and Fiat Chrysler, alongside other major automakers like Japan\u2019s Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, have all built up similar international supply chains to support their North American assembly operations.  The lower costs achieved by such diverse sourcing means better margins on higher-priced vehicles like the Cadillac XT6. The SUV retails for $55,490, almost $20,000 above the average U.S. new car price, and is one of GM\u2019s higher-margin vehicles.  The use of lower-cost countries for more labor intensive parts is now \u201cpart of the recipe to compete in the global market,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Michigan.  European automakers, for instance, have similarly moved production of parts to cheaper, tariff-free countries within the European Union.  Tearing up NAFTA or imposing tariffs would hurt U.S. automakers\u2019 competitiveness, according to Dziczek.  CAR estimated in June that the average price of a U.S.-made vehicle would rise $1,100 if Trump carried out his threat of levying tariffs of up to 25% on Mexican imports over illegal immigration.  North American tariffs would force automakers to move sourcing of lower-cost parts from Mexico to other cheap markets like Vietnam, Dziczek said.  That would be bad for Mexican suppliers, but would also hurt U.S. suppliers and defeat Trump\u2019s aim to boost U.S. jobs, as shuttling parts back and forth between Asia and the United States would not be cost effective.  \u201cIf we weren\u2019t getting it from Mexico, we\u2019d be getting it from somebody else\u2019s \u2018Mexico\u2019,\u201d Dziczek said. \u201cAnd the further away that \u2018Mexico\u2019 is, the less likely it is American suppliers would benefit from that business.\u201d","136":"(Reuters) - Auto technology supplier Aptiv Plc APTV.N forecast better than expected results for the year on Thursday and gave a bullish outlook for growth for its electrification and assisted driving technology, lifting its shares as much as 4%.  Chief Executive Kevin Clark said sales of high voltage electrification technology were growing by 40% a year as automakers respond to demand for cleaner, all or partially electric vehicles.  \"This year we have seen a real change in trajectory\" for vehicle electrification,\" Clark told Reuters. Automakers that had held back from developing electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles are now responding to the success of electric vehicle maker Tesla IncTSLA.O.  China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, will be the largest electric vehicle market, Clark said. Aptiv expects half the vehicles in China will be battery electric or high-voltage hybrids by 2025, up from 9% today.  At the same time, Clark said Aptiv expects strong growth in sales of its assisted driving technology over the next five years.  Aptiv, which counts General Motors Co GM.N and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE among its biggest customers, said it expects net sales to be between $12.5 billion and $12.7 billion in 2020, above analysts' estimate of $12.3 billion.  Sales in the signal and power components unit, which is the company\u2019s biggest business, making connectors, wiring assemblies and electrical power and signal distribution systems for cars, rose about 3% to $2.65 billion in the third quarter.  Net sales rose about 3% to $3.7 billion.  Sales growth in Europe, Asia and China was offset by a dip of 3% in North America.  Adjusted net income attributable to Aptiv dipped to $320 million, or $1.13 per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $325 million, or $1.27 per share, a year earlier.  Aptiv reported spending $30 million in the third quarter on coronavirus-related safety measures within its operations - a cost that will likely continue \u201cwell into next year,\u201d Clark said. Aptiv also faces costs related to labor shortages and other disruptions within its own global supply network, he said.","137":"WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union and General Motors Co are set to resume contract talks at 10 a.m. EDT on Monday, hours after the union is set to go on strike, a union spokesman said.

REUTERS\/Chris Bergin  Many of the ventilators assembled by the automakers and other manufacturers have gone into a U.S. government stockpile as doctors shifted away from using invasive ventilators with COVID-19 patients. The government currently has 108,000 ventilators in its medical equipment stockpile, and 12,000 deployed at U.S. hospitals, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said Tuesday.  GM and medical equipment maker Ventec Life Systems are in the \u201chome stretch\u201d toward completing a contract to deliver 30,000 critical care ventilators by the end of August under a $489 million contract with the federal government, the automaker said.  GM and Ventec have already delivered more than 20,000 machines, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.  Ford has assembled about 47,000 of the 50,000 ventilators it agreed to supply to partner General Electric Co, Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said. GE has a $336 million contract with the government.  HHS said it has received more than 69,000 ventilators assembled by GM and Ford and their partners, and \u201cboth of these delivery schedules are nearly complete.\u201d  Ford and GM earlier this year said they would employ a total of as many as 1,500 people on ventilator assembly lines. Automakers likened the efforts to their switch from making cars to tanks and planes during the Second World War.  With North American car and truck factories back in operation, the Detroit automakers are winding down their forays into ventilator manufacturing, but continuing to make respiratory masks.  GM has said it plans to transfer the ventilator-making operations at a factory in Kokomo, Indiana, to its partner Ventec on Sept.1. Union-represented GM workers employed at the plant will return to the automaker, and temporary workers will remain with Ventec.  Ford transferred full-time workers who were building ventilators back to their home plants in May, and the majority of the temporary workers still assembling ventilators will have opportunities to land jobs building the new Ford Bronco SUV at a factory near Detroit, a company spokeswoman said Tuesday.  The automakers\u2019 efforts to build ventilators and other medical equipment were launched in a politically charged atmosphere as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic swamped the U.S. economy and healthcare system. The shortage of ventilators became a symbol of the nation\u2019s struggle to respond.  U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on the automakers as part of a broader push to secure more than 130,000 ventilators by the end of 2020.  The automakers used the medical equipment assembly operations set up in the spring to test safety protocols they later used to reopen their vehicle-making operations.","139":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N is looking to buy General Motors Co's GM.N credit card unit as it looks to double down on its consumer banking arm, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

FILE PHOTO: A Nissan car dealership is pictured in Northwich, following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Northwich, Britain, May 30, 2020. REUTERS\/Jason Cairnduff  Honda Motor Co also said Friday its output in Japan could be affected by a shortage of semiconductors.  Automakers and electronic makers are facing a global shortage of chips as consumer demand has been bouncing back from the coronavirus pandemic, causing manufacturing delays.  Credit Suisse analyst Daniel Levy said in a research note that the chip supply issues may limit near-term auto production for the industry, but industry officials said they are prioritizing production of higher-profit vehicles.  Major auto chip suppliers such as NXP Semiconductor said auto production rebounded faster than expected from the pandemic, leaving them struggling to catch up.  Meantime, chip manufacturing capacity has been stretched thin globally as laptops fly off shelves for working from home, and PCs and gaming consoles sell heavily, leading chip firms such as Nvidia Corp to warn of supply constraints.  And a move by U.S. regulators to blacklist China\u2019s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, that country\u2019s largest contract chipmaker, has sent chip firms around the world scrambling to find new partners.  U.S. automaker Ford said it would idle its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant, which builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair SUVs, pulling ahead a scheduled week-off from later in the year.  Fiat Chrysler said it will delay the restart of production at its Toluca, Mexico plant, where it builds the Jeep Compass, and idle its Brampton, Ontario plant that builds the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger cars.  The Mexican plant had been due to restart production next week, but now both plants will be shut through the end of the month, FCA said.  Toyota will cut production of its Tundra full-size pickup truck at its San Antonio, Texas, plant, but spokesman Scott Vazin did not immediately know how many units would be lost. \u201cWe\u2019ll throttle back production,\u201d he said, adding no other U.S. vehicles were affected.  Ford declined to identify the chip supplier and spokeswoman Kelli Felker said the company hopes to have the plant operating again the following week. \u201cWe are working closely with suppliers to address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage,\u201d she said.  Nissan said it planned to reduce production of the Note, a hybrid electric car, at its Oppama Plant in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan but did not give details of the scale of the output cut.  The Nikkei newspaper reported that Nissan would slash its Note production at Oppama to about 5,000 units in January, from an initially planned 15,000 units.  Germany\u2019s Volkswagen said last month it faced a shortage in the supply of semiconductors and would adjust production at facilities in China, North America and Europe.  Honda has also begun \u201cseeing some impact in the parts supply,\u201d a company spokesman said. It will first shrink its production by about 4,000 units this month, mainly affecting the Fit subcompact made at a plant in the city of Suzuka in Mie prefecture, the Nikkei newspaper said Friday.  A massive fire at a chip plant owned by Asahi Kasei Microdevices Corp (AKM), a unit of Asahi Kasei Corp, in southern Japan in October has also damaged semiconductor supply.  Separately, China\u2019s GAC said its joint venture with Honda had received warnings on supply of certain models but gave no details.  China\u2019s Dongfeng Motor, which also has a partnership with Honda, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  General Motors Co and BMW AG said on Friday that they have not been affected yet by the chip shortage but are monitoring the situation closely.","141":"DETROIT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is expected to announce on Tuesday significant investments to expand production of electric vehicles at a factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee and potentially other sites.

Kaher Kazem (L), chief executive of GM Korea, and Barry Engle (2nd L), head of GM's international operations, attend a news conference in Incheon, South Korea, April 23, 2018. Yonhap via REUTERS  The deal will pave the way for nearly $500 million in fresh capital injection by the South Korean government, providing much-needed liquidity to GM Korea to pay employees and its suppliers, but slumping vehicle sales and low factory run-rates raise questions about its longer-term future.  The concessions by GM Korea\u2019s powerful auto union are expected to heap pressure on other auto unions for similar moves, at a time when South Korea\u2019s auto industry is grappling with higher labor costs and sluggish demand from the United States and other markets.  \u201cThrough the latest agreement, GM Korea will be a competitive manufacturing company,\u201d Kaher Kazem, chief executive of GM Korea, said in a statement in Korean.  GM shocked South Korea in February when it unveiled a major restructuring plan for the money-losing unit, which involved shuttering one of its four plants in the country and voluntary redundancies for 2,600 workers.  The automaker had sought wage concessions from the union as well as government funding and incentives to save its remaining three South Korean factories.  The board of GM Korea delayed a decision on whether to file for court-managed bankruptcy protection until Monday evening after the automaker failed to reach a wage deal with its labor union in time to meet a Friday deadline.  \u201cHUGE CONCESSIONS\u201d  The union accepted the company\u2019s request to freeze base wages and skip bonuses for this year as well as trim benefits, according to the agreement seen by Reuters.  Future base wage increases and performance pay \u201cwill be dependent upon the company regaining profitability\u201d, while the base wage rises will not exceed inflation, it said.  Regarding its 680 remaining workers at the Gunsan factory, which is scheduled to be shuttered in May, the company will \u201cimplement options including a voluntary redundancy program and transfers\u201d to other plants to avoid layoffs.  \u201cThe labor union made huge concessions to save the company,\u201d Hong Young-pyo, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party who mediated the agreement, said at a news conference after the deal.  The union was absent from the press conference where Hong and GM executives were present.  A union spokesman declined to comment, saying union members are expected to vote on the preliminary deal on Wednesday and Thursday.  \u201cClearly it sets an example that a labor union cannot help but make concessions to overcome its company\u2019s crisis,\u201d Kim Soo-wook, a professor of operations management at Seoul National University, said.  \u201cThis will influence further labor conflicts and activities case by case depending on how bad the situations are for companies or how the global economy goes.\u201d  Hyundai Motor, South Korea\u2019s biggest automaker, is bracing for its annual talks with its labor union, after it posted a fifth straight drop in annual earnings last year as a lack of sport utility vehicles in the United States and a diplomatic row with China hurt earnings.  Adding further pressure on Hyundai, U.S. activist hedge fund Elliott Management said on Monday a restructuring plan proposed by the auto group to end circular shareholding structure was not enough, and recommended it create a holding company and increase dividend, among other things.  DOUBTS LINGER  The deal would pave the way for the Korea Development Bank (KDB) [KDB.UL] to provide support and for GM to allocate two new models to South Korea to help turn around GM Korea, the unit said in a statement.  State-run KDB is GM Korea\u2019s second-largest shareholder with a 17 percent stake. The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea, while GM\u2019s main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, controls the remaining 6 percent.  The government had stepped up pressure on GM and the union to reach an agreement, saying without a swift deal some 150,000 jobs at the automaker and its suppliers would be at risk.  GM Korea still needs to negotiate with KDB on terms of the latter\u2019s financial support to the unit, while trying to secure tax and other incentives from the industry ministry. KDB\u2019s chairman told Reuters last week the lender may sign a preliminary agreement by April 27.  Some analysts said the fate of GM Korea is still uncertain.  The unit\u2019s strength is small cars but GM is scaling down its presence in that segment, said Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade. \u201cGM has extended the lifeline of GM Korea, but not sure how long it will last.\u201d  The South Korean unit, once the backbone of GM\u2019s Asian strategy, has been hobbled by labor costs and hurt by the automaker\u2019s decision to pull its Chevrolet brand from Europe, a key export market. It posted a net loss of $1.1 billion in 2017, its fourth straight year in the red.  The unit still makes more than 1 million assembled or partially assembled vehicles for the United States, European and emerging markets.

Ammann did not say when the company now expects to deploy a ride-hailing service using self-driving vehicles. It had earlier hoped to deploy such a service here by the end of 2019, but in April, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra declined to repeat that goal.  Cruise has raised $7.25 billion during the past year from investors including SoftBank, Honda Motor Co and investment firm T. Rowe Price. As GM and Cruise executives have done in the past, Ammann said Cruise would launch its commercial service when it was sure the vehicles would be safe.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re working on the large scale deployment of mission critical safety systems, the mindset of \u2018move fast and break things\u2019 certainly doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d Ammann wrote in a post on Medium on Wednesday.  Ammann alluded in his post to broader concerns about the trustworthiness of \u201cBig Tech\u201d and said Cruise was in talks with regulators about how to measure when its technology \u201cwill have a net positive impact on safety on our roads.\u201d  Cruise\u2019s decision to formally postpone deployment of self-driving cars this year comes as rival autonomous vehicle companies and automakers acknowledge it will take more time and money than they had expected to make autonomous vehicles safe for unrestricted use on public roads.  The capital and technology challenges of self-driving cars are pushing automakers to forge alliances to share the cost burdens. Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co earlier this month said they would partner to develop autonomous vehicles, and invest in self-driving technology company Argo AI. German automakers BMW AG and Daimler AG also have struck self-driving car partnerships.  Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo robo-taxi unit has begun offering rides for hire in Arizona, but continues to operate its vehicles with human attendants ready to take the wheel.

The state-funded South Korean Development Bank said on Monday it had begun a due-diligence review of GM\u2019s South Korean unit as part of its decision whether to inject more capital into the money-losing operation.  GM officials have outlined plans to invest up to $2.8 billion in the South Korean operations and convert into equity about $2.7 billion in debt owed by the unit to the parent company, according to Korean government officials and a GM letter reviewed by Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Ramos Arizpe, state of Coahuila, Mexico October 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  The company originally went out to its JP Morgan and Citigroup-led bank group in early March requesting to push maturities on the US$16.5bn in revolving credit facilities as part of its regular-way liability management operations.  The transaction was meant to roll over maturities, but leave pricing unchanged, several sources familiar with the discussions said.  But GM\u2019s decision to refinance came at a time when the company is facing a longer than expected shutdown of its plants and considerable revenue losses amid a crisis of extraordinary magnitude that has created a playing field much different from when it last underwent refinancing discussions in 2019.  Complicating negotiations further, the company decided to draw down US$16bn on its revolver on March 27 while the refinancing talks with its bank group were taking place.  \u201cTo shore up liquidity and strengthen its financial position due to global market uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the company said on March 24 about its plans to draw down the facility.  The originally proposed refinancing included a US$2bn 364-day loan and a US$4bn three-year loan. It also included a US$10.5bn, five-year facility, said several sources familiar with the original refinancing discussions.  The new plan is expected to only address the short-term maturities, including the US$2bn one-year loan, and the US$4bn three-year loan, the sources said.  The one-year loan is looking to pay 25bp undrawn, while the three-year loan may pay 40bp undrawn.  When fully drawn, the loans could pay 175bp over Libor, the sources familiar with the transaction said.  An option to convert the one-year revolving credit into a term loan after one year is also expected to be removed, the sources said.  GM\u2019s 364-day loan currently pays 12.5bp undrawn, the three-year pays 15bp undrawn.  The drawn margin on the two facilities is 125bp over Libor.  The new refinancing plan will leave in place the US$10.5bn credit facility. Pricing on the five-year is expected to stay unchanged at 125bp over Libor and 17.5bp undrawn.  Commitments are due April 10.  GM also has a US$3bn revolving credit it entered into in January 2019 when it refinanced the other three tranches. The new loan increased the company\u2019s borrowing capacity to US$19.5bn.  A Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment.

FILE PHOTO: An undated handout photo shows the new Cadillac Lyriq, one of the electric vehicles that General Motors Co said on October 20, 2020, that its Spring Hill, Tennessee, factory will begin to produce. General Motors Co\/Handout via REUTERS  Over time, GM plans to offer electric vehicles across its lineup, from below $30,000 to over $100,000, with a goal of \u201cputting everyone in an electric vehicle,\u201d Barra told investors Thursday during a conference sponsored by Barclays.  Barra said EVs could help GM expand sales in the United States by as much as 280,000 vehicles a year in coastal states where the company\u2019s brands are weak. \u201cWe want to be No. 1 in EVs in North America,\u201d Barra said.  GM plans to increase spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $27 billion by 2023, up 35% from previous disclosed plans, she said. The automaker also plans to speed the launch of a dozen new electric models.  GM's ambitions to be the leading electric vehicle producer put it on a collision course with Tesla and German automaker Volkswagen AGVOWG_p.DE, which last week outlined an $86-billion electric vehicle investment plan. GM and VW compete head to head in China.  GM shares rallied into positive territory after Barra outlined her EV strategy. Tesla shares were up 3% on Thursday, pushing the carmaker toward a $475-billion market capitalization that is almost eight times greater than GM\u2019s.  Some investors have pressed Barra to separate GM\u2019s electric vehicle operations from the automaker\u2019s profitable, legacy internal combustion business. Asked about a spinoff of GM\u2019s skateboard or battery operations, Barra said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think it has to be separated.\u201d  Instead, Barra emphasized the advantages she sees in integrating internal combustion and electric vehicle businesses, noting that EVs can share up to 70% of the components used in traditional vehicles.  GM will boost battery-making capacity at the plant it is building in northeast Ohio with South Korea's LG Chem051910.KS and will increase the number of plants in which it builds electric vehicles, Barra said.  Tesla\u2019s soaring market capitalization, and growing pressure from regulators to phase out carbon-emitting gasoline engines, has put pressure on established automakers to accelerate production of electric vehicles, even though for now those models promise less profit than current trucks and SUVs.  GM was criticized by Democrats and environmentalists last year when it sided with U.S. President Donald Trump in backing efforts to strip California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules and later on Trump\u2019s decision to cut Obama-era efficiency requirements.  GM confirmed it will speed up the rollout of new EVs, and will offer 30 models globally by 2025, expanding on a prior target of 20 electric models by 2023. Barra said GM wants to exceed its prior target of annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025.  GM\u2019s pitch to investors focuses on the company\u2019s Ultium battery technology, which GM said will now offer electric driving range of up to 450 miles on a single charge, up from 400 previously stated.  The second generation of Ultium batteries, available mid-decade, should close most of the cost gap with gasoline engines, GM global product development chief Doug Parks said on a call with reporters.  GM also said it was creating an umbrella organization for its electric vehicle and digital marketing efforts called Ultifi.","158":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors CoGM.N will use embedded Google technology to power navigation, voice activated controls and other vehicle infotainment functions starting in 2021, in a win for Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O in the race with Amazon.com and other technology companies to control dashboards.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Roosevelt Cassio  GM said it will offer Google Assistant, Google Maps and other applications available through the Google Play app store in all its vehicle brands outside China, which is GM\u2019s largest single market. GM said the first vehicles with built-in Google infotainment technology will launch in 2021, with more models rolling out in the following years.  Google has previously struck deals to embed infotainment technology in cars built by allied automakers Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Volvo Cars, owned by China\u2019s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group.  Amazon is wooing automakers to embed its rival Alexa voice assistant technology in vehicles.  For years, GM and other automakers were reluctant to share dashboard space with Google, Apple Inc AAPL.O and other tech companies. Automakers feared losing control of valuable data, and having their brands eclipsed by powerful Silicon Valley names.  Consumers are, however, forcing automakers to shift gears. Connecting smartphones and apps to cars can be a clumsy experience because of automakers\u2019 poor technology, but having functionality built in from internet giants has begun to make for a smoother experience.  \u201cWe have the ability today to give commands to vehicles with embedded voice assistants. It is very limited,\u201d Santiago Chamorro, GM\u2019s vice president for Global Connected Customer Experience, said in an interview. \u201cWith Google voice assistant it is a better experience for them.\u201d  Patrick Brady, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering, said the issue of harvesting and monetizing data is \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d when it comes to cars.  \u201cWe are working to bring services into the car,\u201d he said. Google will not have access to data about the way an individual drives, or data about the vehicle\u2019s maintenance needs, he said.  GM could though enable customers to schedule vehicle maintenance using Google\u2019s voice commands, Chamorro said.  The automaker said pricing for packages that include Google services will be set closer to vehicle launches. GM will continue to offer Apple Inc\u2019s CarPlay and AndroidAuto to allow consumers to project a version of their smartphone screen onto a dashboard screen.  GM was a pioneer in offering drivers an on-board concierge service through its Onstar telematics system, which connects drivers to human operators. Some of the services those operators provide, such as turn-by-turn navigation, Google technology delivers with its automated system.  Chamorro said GM will continue the Onstar service, which GM has promoted recently as a form of insurance, connecting motorists to an operator who can help in an emergency. \u201cThat is fundamentally a human activity,\u201d Chamorro said. \u201cWe have 100 trained technicians\u201d who can respond when an Onstar customer is in danger.  For Google, the GM agreement offers the potential of embedding technology in as many as 3.6 million cars annually - the number of vehicles GM sold outside China last year. The Renault-Nissan alliance sells more than 10 million vehicles a year. Google\u2019s Brady said the company is discussing deals with other automakers but for now is focused on launching embedded systems with GM, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Volvo.  \u201cWe are mostly focusing on making those partnerships successful,\u201d he said.","159":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it was extending production cuts at three North American plants until at least mid-March due to the global semiconductor chip shortage, while vehicles at two other factories would only be partially built.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen in Warren, Michigan, U.S. on October 26, 2015. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  GM\u2019s U.S. rival Ford Motor Co also said Tuesday that it was in limited cases parking partly assembled vehicles due to the chip shortage.  GM, whose shares dipped 1.1% after the announcement, did not disclose the impact on volumes or say which supplier and vehicle parts were affected by the chip shortage.  But it said it would focus on keeping production running at plants building its highest-profit vehicles: full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. GM said it intended to make up as much lost production as possible once the shortage chip eased.  \u201cSemiconductor supply remains an issue that is facing the entire industry,\u201d GM spokesman David Barnas said. \u201cGM\u2019s plan is to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products.\u201d  GM said it was extending downtime at its U.S. plant in Fairfax, Kansas; its Canadian factory in Ingersoll, Ontario; and its Mexican facility in San Luis Potosi until mid-March when it would reassess the situation, he said.  In addition, GM said it would build but leave incomplete for final assembly vehicles at Wentzville, Missouri, and its Mexican plant at Ramos Arizpe.  GM vehicles affected by the idled plants include the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, Cadillac XT4 SUV, Chevy Equinox, and GMC Terrain SUVs. Vehicles to be left incomplete for now included the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon pickups and Chevy Blazer SUV.  This week, GM had said it was idling the three factories where it has now extended downtime and said it would halve production at a plant in South Korea.  Ford\u2019s chief product platform officer, Hau Thai-Tang, at a conference on Tuesday raised the possibility that Ford might have to park vehicles that would need parts added later because of the chip shortage. Kelli Felker, a Ford spokeswoman, later said the company was doing that \u201cin limited cases,\u201d but did not say what vehicles were affected.  The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as auto manufacturers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies.  Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tight chip supplies. They have also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies.  The chip shortage has affected many automakers, including Toyota, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Renault, Subaru, Nissan, Honda and Mazda.  VW said Tuesday it expects chip supply to remain tight in the first half of the year.  AutoForecast Solutions on Tuesday updated its estimate for lost production this year, saying the global industry could lose almost 1.3 million vehicles as a result of the shortage. GM could lose an estimated 111,450 vehicles, the forecasting firm said.  Honda and Nissan said on Tuesday they would sell 250,000 fewer cars in total this financial year due to the chip shortage.  Ford said last week the shortage was hitting production of its highly profitable F-150 pickup trucks, saying it could lose 10% to 20% of planned first-quarter vehicle production and earnings could fall by $1 billion to $2.5 billion.  Taiwan, home to the world\u2019s largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), is at the center of efforts to resolve the shortage. U.S. officials discussed the issue with their Taiwanese counterparts last week.  Chinese officials said on Tuesday they had met with auto and chip companies, asking them to help ease the shortage. French state officials meet with auto and electronics industry leaders on Wednesday to discuss the issue.  The Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) said this week that chip shortages had hurt national auto production in January, and it would likely dampen output during the first half of 2021.  The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents technology and auto companies, wrote U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urging action to address the shortage, including providing \u201csubstantial funding\u201d to ensure there will be enough chips.","160":"(Reuters) - Several auto parts makers and suppliers have lowered their full-year forecasts and disclosed hits to quarterly earnings from the 40-day strike at No.1 U.S. carmaker General Motors GM.N.

Revved up to take on high-performance European rivals with the all-new model dubbed the C8, top GM executives plan a glitzy evening presentation in Orange County outside Los Angeles of the long-awaited eighth generation of the 66-year-old \u201cVette\u201d to enthusiasts, dealers and media.  The launch comes at a challenging time for GM, which along with other global carmakers faces slowing sales and new financial pressures related to global trade, electrification and unresolved emission standards.  Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell said the sports car gives the Detroit automaker a sorely needed shot in the arm after a difficult year.  \u201cA Corvette is not going to help pad margins the way a Silverado would,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cBut from an image and excitement standpoint ... that halo effect the Corvette fills is unique.\u201d  The Chevy Silverado full-size pickup truck, a perennial best-seller, ranks among GM\u2019s most profitable vehicles.  Since 2013, GM has sold over 100,000 C7-model Corvettes in the United States, according to Edmunds. The car ceased production this summer.  Bidding adieu to the front-engine configuration that has marked the famed two-seater since its appearance in 1953, GM has opted for a mid-engine architecture for better handling and weight distribution, the choice of many European sports carmakers.  Expected to cost far below the $113,000 starting price for the rear-engine Porsche 911, the Corvette\u2019s price could attract a younger buyer lured in recent years to high performance vehicles from Tesla Inc and others.  The hangar where the gasoline-fueled Corvette was set to take the stage is less than 40 miles (64 km) from Tesla\u2019s Southern California design center, where Chief Executive Elon Musk in 2017 unveiled a prototype of a new electric Roadster - dubbed \u201cthe quickest car in the world\u201d by the automaker.  Whether the Corvette can generate enough excitement to attract even the loyal buyers of the pricier European brands from Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, McClaren and Lotus - remains to be seen.  GM has teased the launch for months. In April, Corvette Chief Engineer Tadge Juechter and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra drove a camouflaged C8 Corvette through New York\u2019s Times Square during rush hour in a high-profile tease.  Almost mythic in the American imagination, the car has been immortalized in television and film from \u201cRoute 66\u201d and \u201cHot Rods to Hell\u201d in the 1960s to \u201cCorvette Summer\u201d in 1978.

The cuts at Cruise, which had 1,800 full-time employees, come just a week after GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s commitment to Cruise was \u201cunwavering\u201d and it was growing the business.  \u201cCruise is well capitalized,\u201d she told analysts on a May 6 conference call after GM posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit. \u201cWe have and will continue to grow our team by recruiting and retaining the very best engineering and leadership talent.\u201d  The email said layoffs at Cruise include staff at an engineering team in Pasadena, California, that works on Lidar, a sensor technology that uses pulsed laser light to sense objects, similar to the way radar uses radio waves. The email was sent by Cruise CEO Dan Ammann on Thursday.  Lidar start-ups had mushroomed when self-driving car tech drew billions of dollars in investments.  The cuts at Cruise echo pain felt elsewhere in the industry.  Starsky Robotics, a five-year-old San Francisco start-up focused on automating long-haul freight delivery, closed its doors in mid-March due to lack of funding. And Zoox, a self-driving tech firm based in Silicon Valley, also has laid off staff during the pandemic.","170":"BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N announced their quarterly sales in China fell, albeit at a slower pace sequentially, as the U.S. automakers were hit by a slowing economy amid the Sino-U.S. trade war.  GM\u2019s vehicle sales in China for the quarter ended June 30 dropped 12.2%, while Ford\u2019s sales slumped by 21.7%. While GM also suffered from heightened competition in its key mid-priced SUV segment, Ford was hurt by the limited new models for customers to choose from.  For the first quarter of this year, Ford\u2019s sales in China tumbled 35.8 percent while GM\u2019s skid 17.5 percent.  Still, the numbers from GM, the second biggest international automaker in China by sales, and Ford portend more uncertainty for the industry which is trying to rebound from a downward spiral that led to its first annual sales decline last year in more than two decades.  GM delivered 1.57 million vehicles in China in the January-June period this year, while Ford delivered 290,321 vehicles.  China\u2019s factory activity shrank more than expected in June, highlighting the need for more economic stimulus amid higher U.S. tariffs and weaker domestic demand.  Annual car sales in China fell last year for the first time since the 1990s, and they are expected to fall this year too. Sales tumbled 16.4% in May from the same month a year prior, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said. That marked the 11th consecutive month of decline and followed falls of 14.6% in April and 5.2% in March.

Over the same period, German car makers\u2019 share has risen to 23.3% from 20.9% and Japanese auto makers\u2019 to 21.3% from 17.3%.  CAAM is set to announce June sales next week, which industry analysts forecast will be negative.  NEW MODELS  In China, GM has a joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp 600104.SS, in which the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac are made. It also has another venture, with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group, in which they make no-frills minivans and have started to make higher-end cars.  Sales of GM\u2019s affordable brand Baojun dropped 31.8% for the latest quarter. But luxury brand Cadillac\u2019s sales jumped 36.6%.  GM sold 3.64 million units in China last year, down from 4.04 units in 2017.  Ford makes cars in China through its joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd 000625.SZ and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) 000550.SZ. It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd 000980.SZ to sell lower priced cars.  The Dearborn, Michigan automaker has been struggling to revive sales in China, its second biggest market globally, after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017.  GM, Ford and rivals are launching new models or sprucing up older ones to attract customers. GM has laid out plans to introduce around 20 new models or variants of older ones this year.  \u201cAround two-thirds of the about 20 new and refreshed models will arrive in the second half with a sharpened focus on luxury vehicles and mid-size to large SUVs,\u201d a GM spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that more than half of the new launches will be new models.  Ford has said it plans to localize its luxury brand Lincoln in China and would launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which over a third will be electric vehicles.  It has launched new models such as Focus and Territory to boost volumes in China.","171":"FILE PHOTO: Visitors walk past the logo of Kia Motors at its pavilion at the India Auto Expo 2020 in Greater Noida, India, February 5, 2020.

NHTSA said it had received 74 reports of sudden, unexpected loss of headlights in model year 2011-2013 Kia Sorento vehicles including some while drivers were making a turn or traveling on the highway.  Reports allege headlights can turn off for some time until they correct themselves or the driver turns the vehicle off and on again. Some owners complain they have taken vehicles to dealerships for service several times but that the problem returned.  Kia did not immediately comment.  NHTSA is also probing 781,000 Chevrolet Equinoxes and GMC Terrain SUVs from 2010 to 2012 after receiving 52 complaints over a condition that could cause increased friction in the steering system. The friction may result in drivers feeling as if the steering wheel was sticking, the agency said, and added vehicles can still be turned but may require increased effort.  GM previously issued a service bulletin to address the issue and offered extended-warranty coverage to address it.  NHTSA said there was one report of an injury crash. The agency said it is reviewing vehicles that had the steering gear replaced under GM\u2019s special coverage but months later had additional steering concerns.  The issue is \u201ca slight feeling of friction in the steering system that can be an annoyance to customers,\u201d GM spokesman Dan Flores said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reviewed this issue internally and have reviewed it with NHTSA previously. We do not consider it to be a safety issue.\u201d","172":"NEW YORK\/BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N said it would wind down its Australian and New Zealand operations and sell a Thai plant in the latest restructuring of its global business, costing the U.S. auto maker $1.1 billion.  The moves will accelerate GM\u2019s retreat from unprofitable markets, making it more dependent on the United States, China, Latin America and South Korea, and give up an opening to expand in Southeast Asia.  They come after the company told analysts this month that restructuring GM\u2019s international operations outside of China to produce profit margins in the mid-single digits would represent \u201ca $2 billion improvement\u201d on two years ago.  GM has forecast a flat profit for 2020 after a difficult 2019, and is facing ballooning interest in electric car rival Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  GM is \u201cfocusing on markets where we have the right strategies to drive robust returns, and prioritizing global investments that will drive growth in the future of mobility,\u201d especially in electric and autonomous vehicles, GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said in a statement late on Sunday.  The latest changes - a continuation of GM\u2019s retreat from Asia that began in 2015 when it announced it would stop making GM-branded cars in Indonesia - will lead to cash and non-cash charges of $1.1 billion. Some 600 jobs will be lost in Australia and New Zealand, while GM said about 1,500 jobs would be affected by the sale in Thailand.  Barra has prioritized profit margins over sales volume and global presence since taking over in 2014.  In 2017, she sold GM's European Opel and Vauxhall businesses to Peugeot SA PEUP.PA and exited South Africa and other African markets. Since then, Barra has decided to pull GM out of Vietnam, Indonesia and India.  \u201cTHE END OF AN ERA\u201d  Like Britain, Australia and New Zealand are right-hand drive markets. With sales of GM\u2019s Australian Holden brand plummeting, the company could not justify the investment to continue building right-hand drive vehicles, GM President Mark Reuss said.  The move stoked anger in Australia, where GM Holden long ranked among the country\u2019s best selling car companies after the first locally made mass-production car rolled off the assembly line with a Holden badge in 1948.  Amid continuous decline in new car sales, GM said it was ending Australian factory production in 2017 and last year called time on former best-seller the Commodore as part of a shift towards more compact SUVs and utility vehicles.  Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday he was disappointed and angry at the decision, although not surprised.

GREAT WALL GOING ABROAD  Great Wall, one of China\u2019s biggest sport-utility vehicle makers, said it will sell cars from the Thai manufacturing base, which also has an engine plant, in Southeast Asia and Australia as it seeks global sales amid a slowing domestic market.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cThere is no choice, if we don\u2019t go global, we will not survive,\u201d Wei Jianjun, chairman of the Baoding-based automaker, said last year when Great Wall opened a plant in Russia.  It also signed an agreement in January to buy GM\u2019s car plant in India. The Thai transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.  \u201cSuch an acquisition could give Great Wall quick access to the ASEAN market, and Thailand is a good choice for its production base amid the country\u2019s established supply chain in the automotive industry,\u201d said Shi Ji, analyst at Haitong International.  Great Wall is likely to face fierce competition from Japanese automakers which dominate Thailand\u2019s domestic car sales. Thailand produces around 2 million vehicles each year, with just over half exported.  Great Wall may consider also building pickup trucks and SUVs in Thailand, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters .  The firm, which is building a car plant with BMW BMWG.DE in China, sold 1.06 million cars last year, including 65,175 units for export.","173":"DETROIT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union sued General Motors Co in federal court on Thursday, claiming the automaker\u2019s use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violates its labor deal.

The largest U.S. automaker is recalling more than 550,000 2019 light-duty Chevrolet Silverado 1500, Cadillac CT6 and GMC Sierra 1500 vehicles due to a potential software glitch that could disable vehicle brake systems and notifications.  The error, which GM said was rare, may result in the vehicle\u2019s electronic stability control or anti-lock brake system becoming disabled. GM said the vehicle\u2019s diagnostic system will not illuminate the instrument cluster alert. Dealers will reflash the software to address the issue.  GM is also recalling more than 400,000 2019-2020 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500 trucks because battery positive cable rings may have been manufactured with excessive glue, potentially resulting in a fire risk or stalling.  GM dealers will inspect vehicles for glue or other contamination and replace damaged components if necessary.  One fire has been reported and no injuries linked to the campaign.

Sales of traditional passenger cars in North America have been declining for the past six years and are still withering. After GM ends production next year at factories in Michigan, Ohio and Ontario, it will still have four U.S. car plants, all operating at less than 50 percent of rated capacity, according to figures supplied by LMC Automotive.  In comparison, Detroit-based rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will have one car plant each in North America after 2019.  The Detroit Three are facing rapidly dwindling demand for traditional passenger cars from U.S. consumers, many of whom have shifted to crossovers and trucks. Passenger cars accounted for 48 percent of retail light-vehicle sales in the United States in 2014, according to market researchers at J.D. Power and Associates. This year, sedans will account for less than a third of light vehicle sales.  That shift in turn has left most North American car plants operating far below their rated capacities, while many SUV and truck plants are running on overtime.  The collapse in passenger-car demand is a challenge for nearly all automakers in the United States, including Japan\u2019s Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, which have the top-selling models in the compact and midsize car segments. Toyota executives said last month they are evaluating the company\u2019s U.S. model lineup. But Toyota also plans to build compact Corolla sedans at a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Alabama with partner Mazda Motor Corp.  The obstacles facing GM in its plans to close more auto factories became apparent on Tuesday as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to block payment of government electric vehicle subsidies to GM. While it is not certain that Trump unilaterally has the power to do that, he made it clear he intends to use his office to pressure the company to keep open a small car plant in Ohio that GM says will stop building vehicles in March.  Asked whether GM\u2019s plans to close factories and cut jobs might not solve the demand problem for its sedans, GM spokeswoman Kimberly Carpenter said on Tuesday: \u201cWe continuously look at our operations for opportunities to improve our efficiency and capacity utilization. We believe the actions announced yesterday move us in the right direction and we will continue to monitor the market and consumer trends and adjust accordingly.\u201d  Shares of the No. 1 U.S. automaker closed 2.5 percent lower at $36.69 on Tuesday, after rising nearly 5 percent the previous day.

REUTERS\/Alan Freed\/File Photo  ABANDONMENT ISSUES  GM executives have said they do not intend to abandon cars to the extent that Ford and FCA have. GM car plants that will remain open include Fairfax, Kansas, which builds the Chevrolet Malibu and Cadillac XT4 compact SUV. But that plant is operating at 48 percent of capacity, well below the 80 percent that GM Chief Executive Mary Barra is targeting as the average for North America.  A GM plant in Lansing, Michigan, that builds the Cadillac ATS and CTS and Chevrolet Camaro is running at just 33 percent capacity, while the GM Orion Township, Michigan, facility that builds the Chevrolet Bolt electric car and the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact runs at 34 percent capacity. A Bowling Green, Kentucky, plant that builds the Chevrolet Corvette sports car works at just 27 percent of its potential output, according to LMC data.  \u201cUntil GM gets more flexibility in its platforms, it will continue to have to play whack-a-mole with its plants as the market transitions \u2013 and it will happen again,\u201d said LMC analyst Bill Rinna.  In all, the four GM car plants that will remain open have a combined capacity of more than 800,000 vehicles a year, but are expected to produce only 360,000 cars this year, according to LMC.  Industry analysts have said the general break-even point for running an assembly plant profitably is around 80 percent. Barra said on Monday GM\u2019s North American plants are running at 70 percent capacity - including truck and SUV plants that are working overtime.  Ford plans to end production in March of the Taurus at its Chicago plant, which also builds the Explorer and Aviator SUVs. That will leave the automaker with only one U.S. car plant, in Flat Rock, Michigan, which currently builds the Ford Mustang and the Lincoln Continental. The Mustang is due for a mild redesign around 2021, but the Continental is scheduled to be phased out then, according to two sources familiar with the company\u2019s plans. Flat Rock is running at just 49 percent of capacity, but Ford has said it plans to add new products to the plant, including its first automated vehicle, in 2021.  Fiat Chrysler still builds the full-size Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger and Challenger at its Brampton, Ontario, plant.

The union and GM restarted bargaining on Monday.  GM has relatively high inventories of its high-margin vehicles, but the strike is expected to shut down all of its North American facilities quickly and could hurt the U.S. economy.  Most of GM\u2019s profits come from the U.S. market.  Like many others on the picket line in Flint or outside the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant Monday morning, Chaz Akers, 32, of Ferndale, Michigan, said he wants he wants temporary workers to be hired full-time.  \u201cI work right across from a temporary employee who\u2019s been there for two and a half years,\u201d said Akers, who has worked at GM 3-1\/2 years. \u201cI install the passenger side headlight.

If you\u2019re going to pay people to do a job, pay them all the same.\u201d  Akers and other workers outside the Detroit plant, which does not have product allocated beyond the end of the year, said getting another product for the plant is not enough if GM does not address the disparities in worker pay.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  U.S. automakers use temporary employees, who are paid less and receive fewer benefits, to be more cost-competitive versus their Asian and European counterparts with non-unionized plants in the U.S. South.  The mood on the picket lines in Flint and Detroit at the start of the widely anticipated strike was good-humored and morale among picketers was high. Most drivers passing by honked their horns to cheers from strikers under a gray, cool fall sky. Outside the Detroit plant, a large red city fire engine did the same and turned on its emergency lights.  \u201cWe stood up to help GM through bankruptcy, we made concessions and we\u2019ve built good product for them,\u201d said Marty Chovanec, 61, who was hired at GM\u2019s Flint truck plant at the age of 19.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been patient and we haven\u2019t had a raise in 12 years,\u201d he added. \u201cNow that GM is making record profits, we deserve a cut and a fair share.\u201d  Harrison Bowyer, 50, showed up to show his support and to picket in Flint even though he is not scheduled to be on duty until Friday.  \u201cGM works the crap out of temp workers and then throws them away, so I\u2019m fighting for jobs for future generations\u201d he said. \u201cNo one walks out on a paycheck for no reason, but as much as it\u2019s going to hurt us, if the strike lasts a while, it will hurt GM more.\u201d  The last time the UAW struck against GM, in 2007, the strike was over in two days. A more painful strike occurred in Flint in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the automaker more than $2 billion.  While workers on the picket lines said they hope the strike is over quickly, they said they have been socking away cash to help make ends meet. Union strike pay for workers is $250 per week, a fraction of their normal wage.  Outside the Detroit plant, Dawn Bryant, 39, of Detroit, whose husband works at a GM plant in Romulus, said she took a temporary job on the assembly line about six months ago because she felt it would lead to a full-time position.  \u201cIf this goes on for weeks, how will we survive?\u201d she said. \u201cNo one could live off $250 a week.

Luxury sport utilities built on the underpinnings of big pickup trucks represent one of the most profitable segments in the global auto industry. Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer prices could range from $60,000 to $100,000, Meunier said. That is comparable to the Escalade and Yukon lineups.  Most such vehicles are sold in North America and in certain Middle Eastern markets. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Jeep brand has not had an entry in this segment for decades.

GM had announced earlier on Friday, however, that it would begin quickly building ventilators.  On Sunday, GM vowed to move forward and released photos of its efforts to build ventilators at its Kokomo, Indiana plant.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  The custom-built Cadillac produced by General Motors Co GM.N appeared for the first time in public on Sunday -- along with an identical version that travels in the motorcade -- when it ferried President Donald Trump around New York ahead of this week's United Nations General Assembly meetings.  The previous version of the limo first appeared in January 2009 just before Barack Obama took office. Obama told Jerry Seinfeld in 2015 that the limo is \u201ca Caddy basically on a tank frame.\u201d Obama said he \u201ccould call a nuclear submarine right here\u201d from a phone in the car.  GM won contracts worth $15.8 million for two phases of the development of the limo from 2014 through 2017, according to federal contracting records, but it is not clear if that represents all development costs. In 2010, GM won a $35 million contract from the Secret Service for additional presidential limousine vehicles.  GM declined to discuss specifics of the new vehicle.  The Secret Service posted a photo on Monday of two new limousines on Twitter. \"The Secret Service is ready to roll into #UNGA 2018!\" the agency wrote here. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Experts say the presidential limousine has run-flat tires, bulletproof glass and a completely sealed interior to ward off a chemical attack, among many other high-tech security features. It also has extensive electronic communications equipment.  Car and Driver magazine said the headlights from the new version appear to be borrowed from a Cadillac Escalade SUV, and the new grille appears to be influenced by its 2016 Escala concept.

The U.S. automaker announced last week it would shut down a factory in Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, and that it was mulling the fate of its three remaining plants in South Korea.  GM owns 77 percent of its South Korean unit GM Korea, while state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) owns a 17 percent stake. GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS, controls the remaining 6.0 percent.  The official, who had direct knowledge of the matter, said GM had asked South Korea to inject funds into GM Korea through KDB. On the basis of its shareholding, KDB would provide around $476 million in investment.  The $2.8 billion investment proposal is separate from a roughly $2.7 billion debt-for-equity swap GM is offering to get financial support and tax benefits from Seoul, the official and a lawmaker said. Reuters first reported the details of that part of the plan on Tuesday.  A GM Korea spokeswoman said she cannot confirm details of the investment.  South Korea\u2019s trade minister, Paik Un-gyu, told parliament on Wednesday the government had first asked for an audit into GM\u2019s \u201copaque\u201d operations in the country, which directly employ some 16,000 workers.  \u201cBy opaque we mean the high cost of goods, interest payments regarding loans and unfair financial support made to GM\u2019s headquarters,\u201d the minister said.  Paik said the South Korean government needed reassurance from GM on its long-term commitment to the country before it can commit funds.  MOUNTING LOSSES  The head of GM Korea\u2019s union said workers will go on a full strike if the U.S. automaker decides to completely pull out of the country.  For now, the 14,000-member union will focus on putting pressure on GM to come up with a concrete turnaround plan, Lim Han-taek, said in an interview.  Lim said the union will discuss a full strike and other options at a meeting on Thursday.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go as far as a full strike,\u201d he said, citing negative public views of South Korea\u2019s auto unions.  \u201cBut if GM says it will completely withdraw from South Korea, we will down our tools.\u201d  GM\u2019s decision to close it Gunsan plant was the latest in a series of steps it has made to put profitability ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015, GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, South Africa and Russia.  A South Korean lawmaker earlier confirmed GM had put forward a proposal including the investment plan and the debt-to-equity swap.

On Tuesday, Barry Engle, head of GM\u2019s international operations, met with a government-appointed task force in Bupyeong and told reporters the company wanted to stay in South Korea.  Engle has asked for a meeting on Thursday with the trade minister, trade minister Paik told lawmakers.  GM\u2019s international operations head met KDB\u2019s chairman and the Korean union leader, according to the bank and the GM Korea union. The union chief said Engle hoped to wrap up this year\u2019s annual wages talk as soon as possible. KDB did not provide further details about the talk.  Officials from the government and KDB have said that the automaker has not shared sufficient information about its finances or the cause of its mounting losses in the country.  A KDB official said GM and KDB had agreed to appoint audit firm Samil PwC to conduct due diligence on GM Korea\u2019s financial situation.  South Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its global output at its peak.  But the automaker\u2019s decision to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe.

The GM strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers.  Under the deal, GM would invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. The Detroit company also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which would be new, a source previously said. The contract offers $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Suryadevara\u2019s journey from the Midwest to California underscores the chasm between old school manufacturing and new age tech.  Stripe was founded in 2009; GM is 100 years older. GM reported revenue of $137 billion last year; Stripe in 2018 reported revenue of $529 million. GM has 164,000 employees; Stripe has 2,800. GM has a market cap of $42 billion; Stripe is valued at $36 billion, according to investor website PitchBook, and has raised nearly $2 billion from investors.  Suryadevara, who was GM\u2019s CFO for just under two years, was held in high regard by Wall Street analysts, who had speculated on her potential to secure a chief executive officer position outside the auto industry.  Her GM compensation package last year totaled $6.8 million.  Stripe did not say how much she would be paid.  In a statement on Tuesday by Stripe, Suryadevara said: \u201cI really enjoy leading complex, large-scale businesses and I hope to use my skills to help accelerate Stripe\u2019s already steep growth trajectory.\u201d  GM named John Stapleton, currently CFO of North American operations, as acting global finance chief, effective Aug. 15. Stapleton joined GM in 1990 and has held a series of finance roles in the company.  Suryadevara succeeded Chuck Stevens as GM\u2019s CFO in September 2018. Before that, she was vice president of corporate finance. She joined GM in 2004 as a senior financial analyst in the Treasurer\u2019s Office.  GM said it would conduct internal and external searches for a permanent successor to Suryadevara.","202":"The main gate to GM Korea's Gunsan factory is seen in Gunsan, South Korea February 13, 2018.

Barra has been restructuring GM\u2019s operations and stressing her goals of readying GM for a future of \u201czero emissions and zero accidents\u201d for several years.  Still, GM shares trade just above the $33 share price of its 2010 initial public offering. That has left it with a market capitalization of about $49 billion, below Tesla\u2019s valuation of about $130 billion.  \u201cThe market\u2019s got it wrong,\u201d said Chris Susanin, co-portfolio manager with Levin Easterly Partners, which owns shares in GM but not Tesla. \u201cGM should be the $150 billion market cap, not Tesla.\u201d  The bulk of GM\u2019s profits is still derived from the fuel-hungry pickup trucks and SUVs sold in the United States. The Chinese market has been the source of a steady $2 billion in profits a year, but that is threatened by a market slowdown, rising costs for electrification and now the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  While China will deliver lower equity income to GM in the near term, it remains a solid contributor that is profitable and dividend paying, and will play a key role in the development of EVs globally, officials said. GM also sees growth for its Cadillac brand in China.  \u2018HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO\u2019  Barra\u2019s challenge now is to assure investors that GM can make the leap across the gap separating its profitable internal combustion present and an uncertain electric future.  While gasoline-powered vehicles will make up a large portion of U.S. sales into the 2030s, GM has said it will spend more on developing electric vehicles than those with internal combustion engines over the next five years.  GM laid out a more detailed plan for the development of EVs and self-driving vehicles at the investor day, including its Cruise self-driving unit.  Some analysts have suggested GM should spin off Cruise, but Suryadevara said GM has no plans to do that. She added that spending in 2020 on that business will roughly match last year\u2019s $800 million.  Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said the self-driving market opportunity totals $8 trillion.  One of the audiences for the investor day is potential employees as GM competes with Tesla and other automakers globally to hire top engineers and software developers outside of Detroit, highlighting technical centers in Ontario and Israel.  Barra, asked whether Tesla\u2019s eventual electric pickup offering could squeeze GM\u2019s margins, said her company understands that business. \u201cI think we can have our cake and eat it too,\u201d she said.  GM also said it will offer its Supercruise partially automated driving system on 22 models by the end of 2023, GM President Mark Reuss said.  GM also laid out its plan to reduce manufacturing complexity this year by eliminating 25% of the parts used in its plants. Barra also said GM targets sourcing all of its global electricity from renewable sources by 2040, a decade sooner than previously promised.  In December, GM and South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS said they would invest $2.3 billion to build an EV battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world's largest battery facilities.  That same month, GM\u2019s Cadillac chief said most if not all of the vehicles offered by the luxury brand would be electric by 2030.  GM said last week it would invest $2.2 billion in its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to build electric trucks and SUVs.","204":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is set to announce plans on Wednesday to put into production an interchangeable \"family\" of electric vehicle (EV) drive systems and motors, boosting manufacturing efficiencies as it transitions to a fully electric lineup.  Drive Unit Testing in the Dyno Chamber at the General Motors Global Propulsion Systems Center in Pontiac, Michigan, in an undated photo. Courtesy GM\/via REUTERS  The move, which follows earlier GM initiatives on next-generation batteries, comes as the Detroit automaker looks to build a vertically integrated electric car business, comparable to Tesla TSLA.O, inside its ongoing operations.  According to a GM media release viewed by Reuters, the automaker is set to announce that it has designed and plans to produce on its own five interchangeable drive units and three motors, which it calls the \u201cUltium Drive\u201d system.  GM said its new electric drive systems, sometimes referred to as e-axles in the industry, will have a versatile enough power output to allow them to be used with vehicles ranging from beefy pickup trucks to performance vehicles.  GM already has some EV partnerships, such as with truck startup Nikola Corp NKLA.O, but has chosen here to design its own e-drive technology, rather than buy from suppliers that might be able to offer greater scale and lower cost.  Adam Kwiatkowski, GM\u2019s executive chief engineer for global electrical propulsion, said that by designing its own e-axles, GM could better integrate them with an EV\u2019s battery and the rest of the car. E-axles combine gear, motor and power electronics into a single system and help convert the electricity from batteries efficiently to propel the vehicle.  GM \u201cdesigned these drive units simultaneously with a full gambit of electric vehicles that fill out our portfolio,\u201d Kwiatkowski told Reuters in an interview last week.  \u201cThey become synergistic and make them a really efficient package that\u2019s good for the performance of the vehicle, good for driving customer enthusiasm, and most importantly it\u2019s good for cost efficiency,\u201d he said.  The new self-designed technology means \u201cmore of the battery energy now goes to the road\u201d, which helps make GM\u2019s EVs more economical, Kwiatkowski said.  That in turn meant GM could give its EVs greater driving range, or vehicles could have less batteries, he added.  Other benefits include size, leading to a smaller drive train and more room for passengers, and also a more spontaneous motor response, Kwiatkowski said.  \u201cThere is very very little, totally imperceptible motor lag, so as soon as you touch the accelerator pedal the vehicle responds in a very smooth fashion.\u201d  The new technology highlights GM\u2019s effort to transform itself and catch up with Tesla, whose share price has jumped over 400% this year as it has reported improved profitability.  GM will still consider purchasing drive units and components from suppliers in some cases, said Detroit-based company spokesman, Phil Lienert.  However, it will continue to lead the design, development and manufacturing of Ultium Drive units, he said.","205":"SEOUL, Feb 27 (Reuters) - General Motors\u2019 South Korean unit plans to resume wage talks with its labour union on Wednesday, a union official told Reuters on Tuesday.

This year\u2019s talks on a new four-year contract between the union and the Detroit automakers are expected to be contentious, as U.S. auto sales are slowing after a long boom.  Rising healthcare costs, job security and the use of temporary workers are also expected to be major sticking points.  GM in particular has been a target of union ire since announcing the closure of five North American plants late last year.  That move drew widespread condemnation, including from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump. Criticism has persisted despite GM\u2019s stated efforts to seek jobs at other plants for all displaced workers.  Workers from GM\u2019s Lordstown, Ohio, plant, wearing red shirts emblazoned with \u201cInvest in Lordstown,\u201d greeted UAW officials with applause as they arrived at the event on Tuesday.  GM is in talks to sell the Lordstown plant to electric vehicle startup Workhorse Group Inc and an affiliated, newly formed entity.  Workers in Lordstown built the Chevrolet Cruze, a sedan, sales of which had plummeted in the last few years as Americans abandoned passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in remarks before a formal handshake with Jones that the pace of change in the auto industry has intensified as automakers invest heavily in the race to develop electric vehicles and self-driving cars.  \u201cWe are not here just to survive ... we are here to win,\u201d Barra said. Winning \u201crepresents growth and that means jobs,\u201d she added.  The UAW and Ford Motor Co officially launched negotiations on Monday, where Jones had struck a similarly adversarial tone, vowing that workers should share in automakers\u2019 profits and to prevent their jobs being outsourced to Mexico or China.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told employees on Friday the No. 1 automaker is asking all employees and contract workers to work remotely, noting the company has faced crises before.  \u201cFor many of us, it\u2019s our first experience of this type. But disruption and trying circumstances are not new to us,\u201d she said in an email.  Barra said the remote-work policy applied globally apart from China, which has existing protocols in place. \u201cOur IT tools and systems have been extensively stress-tested; it\u2019s vital that we leverage them to continue delivering,\u201d she said.  Ford will shift most of its global white-collar workforce outside China, where recovery has begun, to working remotely, CEO James Hackett said in an email to employees.  \u201cIn recent days ... we\u2019ve concluded the coronavirus issue has taken on a different dimension \u2013 and we need to be proactive to keep our people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work,\u201d he said.

Ford\u2019s Hackett told employees that in the event a worker tests positive for the virus they will be told to get medical attention and self quarantine at home. Ford will identify others who may have been in contact with that person and instruct them to seek medical attention and self quarantine for 14 days.

However, some parts of the U.S. market have seen customer traffic at dealers hurt by the outbreak, he added.  On Thursday, FCA said an employee at its Indiana transmission plant had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but he was being treated and the plant was still operating while anyone exposed to that worker was quarantined.  Manley said in the letter to employees on Thursday that FCA is focused on worker safety and keeping its plants running.  \u201cClearly, we are now moving beyond regional hotspots and into planning for how this will impact every area of our business across the world,\u201d he said.

Barra had met with UAW President Gary Jones and the union\u2019s lead GM negotiator, Terry Dittes, on Oct. 9 to push for a swift resolution to the strike. Prior to that, UAW officials had been urging Barra to get involved in the negotiations.  The strike began on Sept. 16, with about 48,000 hourly workers of the UAW union at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues on the table included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, and the use of temporary workers.  After GM angered UAW negotiators last week by appealing directly to workers and revealing details of the Detroit automaker\u2019s latest offer, the sides have continued talking. The UAW made a counter offer to GM on Friday.  Details of GM\u2019s revised offer emerged over the weekend and included an increase of its proposed ratification bonus by $1,000 to $9,000. GM also proposed 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is intensifying its attack on rival Ford Motor Co's F.N lead in sales to U.S. commercial fleets to prop up profit margins amid weakening consumer demand, according to executives at the No. 1 U.S. automaker.  Chassis Cab trucks sit in a lot waiting to be upfitted for commercial use in Flint, Michigan, U.S., October 17, 2018. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  GM is counting on new medium-duty Silverados - outfitted as tow trucks, utility bucket trucks and delivery trucks - to lift demand for its light-duty trucks and cars. Automakers estimate for every medium-duty truck a corporate customer buys, they purchase up to six pickup trucks, SUVs, or passenger cars.  The need for automakers to bolster U.S. sales and keep plants humming was highlighted last week when GM slated five North American factories for potential closure, including two making the type of sedan that has fallen out of favor with American consumers. Ford announced it would shuffle workers from slower to busier plants.  Most major automakers on Monday also reported lower U.S. November sales.  But a 24.1 percent jump in commercial fleet sales in November versus the same month in 2017 helped GM offset a 1 percent retail sales drop, according to a source briefed on figures GM does not make public on a monthly basis.  GM North America chief Alan Batey told Reuters in a recent interview the automaker has pursued a long-term strategy to cut lower-margin rental fleet sales and boost more lucrative commercial sales.  GM\u2019s rental sales are around 10 percent of total sales this year, down from 15.8 percent in 2013, according to industry data. In the same period, GM\u2019s commercial sales have risen to more than 11 percent from 7.8 percent of sales.  Batey said production of GM's medium-duty trucks, which begins this week under a partnership with truck maker Navistar International Corp NAV.N as an extension of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck model line, is a milestone in the automaker's move to increase market share.  GM exited the segment during its bankruptcy in 2009. It originally announced the planned Navistar venture in September 2015.  GM and Ford compete for business from companies like engineering-services firm U.S. Infrastructure Co, which has around 9,000 vehicles, mostly light-duty Chevrolet Colorado pickup trucks. USIC\u2019s workers mark cable lines, water pipes and other underground infrastructure before contractors start digging holes in the ground.  USIC fleet manager Phil Samuelson said in a recent interview the company needs around 20 medium-duty trucks, fast. GM won his order by promising to accelerate production of his trucks.  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Otherwise, Samuelson would have tried Ford or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. FCHA.MIFCAU.N  \u201cWe have a great relationship with GM and we saw no reason not to continue that,\u201d he said.  Satisfying customers like USIC could help GM next year when Ford launches its Ranger pickup, a direct competitor for the Colorado.  Rising commercial fleet sales have lifted GM\u2019s net profit by $1 billion over the last five years, according to sources familiar with GM\u2019s financials.  BOOST FROM TAX OVERHAUL  Commercial fleet sales are increasingly important as consumer vehicle sales are set to weaken over the next couple of years after an eight-year recovery.  Ford, GM and FCA control around 77 percent of commercial fleet sales for Classes 1 through 6 - from passenger cars to the biggest medium-duty trucks - though Ford dominates at 40 percent, according to data compiled by Cox Automotive for Reuters from non-public sources. GM has around 25 percent market share.  Ford executives say they have no special plans to counter GM\u2019s expanded truck portfolio. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to do what we always do,\u201d said John Ruppert, Ford\u2019s general manager for commercial vehicle sales.  Through November, GM\u2019s commercial fleet sales rose 13.5 percent compared with a 5.1 percent increase at Ford.  U.S. auto retail sales are forecast to fall over the next two years. But commercial fleet sales should rise, partly because of tax write-offs in the 2017 U.S. federal tax overhaul.  \u201cIf retail sales come down, your factories are still humming ... if you\u2019re selling to commercial fleets,\u201d said Zohaib Rahim, Cox Automotive\u2019s economic and industry insights manager.  DESPERATE NEED  GM\u2019s decision to re-enter the medium-duty truck segment was driven by commercial customers that seek several types of vehicle in package deals.  \u201cIf I want a medium-duty truck I end up going to Ford and the chances are I\u2019ll also buy my pickup truck from Ford instead of GM,\u201d said Kenny Vieth, president of sales forecasting firm ACT Research.  \u201cDealers desperately need these trucks to go after industries we haven\u2019t been able to go to with existing product,\u201d said John Schwegman, GM\u2019s commercial product director.  Keith McCluskey, owner of McCluskey Chevrolet in Cincinnati, Ohio, said his commercial fleets now account for 10 percent of his sales, down from 40 percent when he last sold GM medium-duty trucks.  McCluskey has built a new $8 million service facility partly for commercial customers and aims to sell 1,000 medium-duty trucks annually.","221":"FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019.

Aug 2 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is seeking an exemption to a 25 percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility, the automaker said on Thursday, in a move to prevent the key model in the brand\u2019s U.S. lineup from becoming a victim of the U.S.-China trade war.  The midsize SUV, priced starting at about $35,000, has become a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio. The Envision, assembled only in China, last year accounted for about 19 percent of Buick brand sales in the United States.  GM said in a statement that it filed the request on July 30 with the U.S. Trade Representative. An official notice was posted on Thursday on the regulations.gov website, which is tracking requests for exclusions from the so-called Section 301 tariff on certain imported goods from China.  GM, the largest U.S. automaker, argued in its request that Envision sales in China and the United States would generate funds \u201cto invest in our U.S. manufacturing facilities and to develop the next generation of automotive technology in the United States.\u201d  GM said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Envisions, about 200,000 a year, are sold in China. About 41,000 were sold last year in the United States.  Because of the lower U.S. sales volume, \u201cassembly in our home market is not an option\u201d for the Envision, which competes with such mid-size crossover vehicles as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Cadillac XT5.  GM has taken other steps to soften the blow of tariffs, which hit just as the automaker had lowered the price of the Envision to make it more competitive.  Ahead of the July 6 start for higher import tariffs, GM shipped in a six-month supply of Envisions at the much lower 2.5 percent tariff rate.  Envision sales from April through June plunged to just 7,000 vehicles, while inventories climbed to more than 13,000 vehicles at the end of June. At the current sales rate, the Envision supply should be enough to keep many dealers stocked through the end of the year.  GM had lowered prices by as much as $2,500 on the 2019 models, which it started shipping in late April. That means Buick\u2019s 2,000 U.S. dealers should have lower-priced Envisions to sell well into the fall.  \u201cThe previous price point was too high\u201d on the 2018 Envision, said Casey Clark, sales manager at Serra Buick GMC Cadillac in Washington, Michigan, in an interview. \u201cThat put off some customers.\u201d  With help from GM, Casey said, the mid-Michigan dealership has been able to offer hefty discounts on Envision of $5,000 and more.  GM has announced no plans to stop U.S. sales of the Envision or to relocate production of U.S.-bound models to another plant outside China, a source familiar with the company\u2019s strategy said on condition of anonymity.  GM has provided Buick dealers with incentives to keep Envisions in stock. These include financial offers to put Envisions into fleets of vehicles loaned to customers whose cars are being repaired, the source said.  This year, GM plans to cut Envision imports to around 35,000 vehicles, more than half of which will be hit with the higher tariff, the source said.

It was the first time that the new designation has been used since the category was first introduced in June last year, the trade ministry said.  The move comes on top of central bank plans to grant 40 billion won ($38 million) in aid to mid-to-small sized companies that have been hit by the planned shutdown of the GM plant.  The government has also said it would offer about 240 billion won in loan guarantees and low-interest loans to regions hit by corporate restructuring, including the Gunsan area.","226":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is holding talks with General Motors Co GM.N on the automaker's petition to deploy a limited number of self-driving vehicles on American roads without steering wheels or other human controls, the head of the agency said on Friday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Acting NHTSA Administrator James Owens said his agency aims to make a decision soon on GM's January 2018 petition as well as a request by Softbank Corp-backed 9434.T driverless delivery startup Nuro to deploy a limited number of low-speed, highly automated delivery vehicles without human occupants.  The agency\u2019s review comes at a time of heightened concerns about the safety of automated piloting systems in vehicles and aircraft, a potential revolution in ground and air transportation.  \u201cI expect we\u2019re going to be able to move forward with these petitions soon - as soon as we can,\u201d Owens told Reuters, adding action \u201cdefinitely\u201d would come next year.  \u201cThis will be a big deal because this will be the first such action that will be taken,\u201d Owens said.  GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, confirmed it has been in talks with NHTSA about the petition. Nuro also confirmed it is in talks with NHTSA.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao last week met and discussed the petition at a high level, officials said, but significant work remains at the technical level. Owens said NHTSA officials are \u201ccrawling through these petitions because we want to make sure\u201d they are at least as safe as cars on the roads.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of back and forth between us and the companies,\u201d Owens said during a Reuters interview that also included Chao and other Transportation Department officials. \u201cWe\u2019re sharing with them thoughts and ideas and concerns. They come back to us with additional information.\u201d  Chao said it is important that the NHTSA take its time in reviewing the GM petition. Chao suggested that some auto industry officials and analysts were too optimistic about the timing for deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.  \u201cI think the complexity was far greater than what a lot of very optimistic advocates were thinking,\u201d Chao said.  In GM's petition, NHTSA is for the first time looking at a vehicle in which all driving decisions are made by a computer rather than a human driver. Nuro, which partnered with Kroger Co KR.N last year to deliver groceries, seeks approval not to include a windshield in the vehicle.  The petitions - formal applications for action by the agency - seek exemptions from U.S. vehicle safety rules largely written decades ago that assumed human drivers would be in control of a vehicle. The petitions are for up to 2,500 vehicles per manufacturer.  GM initially said it hoped to win approval to deploy the vehicles by the end of this year. But in July its self-driving unit, Cruise, said it was delaying commercial deployment of cars as more testing of the vehicles was required without specifying a new target date.  Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo unit this year began offering some rides with no human driver in its limited autonomous ride-hailing service in Arizona, but with steering wheels and employees watching remote feeds of the vehicles' cameras.  \u201cWe\u2019re in communication with them about how they are ensuring the safe operation of the vehicle,\u201d Owens said. \u201cWe will continue having a back and forth with them.\u201d","227":"SAO PAULO, March 19 (Reuters) - General Motors said on Tuesday it would invest 10 billion reais ($2.65 billion) in two of its Brazilian plants located in the state of Sao Paulo.

FILE PHOTO: The General Motors Co. headquarters is seen in Detroit, Michigan, from across the Detroit River in Windsor, Ontario, Canada January 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  The largest U.S. automaker preemptively released two fact sheets on its U.S. operations and details about its 2009 U.S. government bailout ahead of the debates, which could feature Democrats using its high-profile job cuts to attack U.S. President Donald Trump.  GM announced in November it would cut a total of about 15,000 jobs and end production at five North American plants, included eliminating about 8,000 salaried workers.  The company came under withering criticism from Trump and many members of Congress for the cuts, which came a decade after the company was rescued by a $50 billion U.S. government bailout.  One of the plants slated for closure, Warren Transmission, is just north of Detroit and will end operations on Wednesday. The last transmission was built on Friday but there is some remaining work this week for maintenance and service parts, GM said.  On Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez and Representative Dan Kildee will hold a press conference with workers across the street from the Warren plant \u201cto highlight Trump\u2019s broken promises on the economy,\u201d the DNC said in a statement. In October 2016, Trump came to Warren and said: \u201cIf I\u2019m elected you won\u2019t lose one plant\u2026 you\u2019re going to have jobs again.\u201d  The UAW plans a separate media event with Warren workers on Tuesday.  GM said the end of production \u201cis an emotional time for our Warren Transmission team members\u201d and emphasized it wants \u201cthem to stay with the company.\u201d  GM said last year that about 335 workers were employed at Warren Transmission, including 265 hourly workers. It said it has job opportunities for nearly all hourly employees at the plant and many have already transferred or accepted offers to transfer.  Warren is in Macomb County, which has historically been a key presidential electoral battleground in Michigan. Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, or a 0.23% margin.  Another of the factories set to close, GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant, won a temporary reprieve in February when GM extended production into January 2020.  Of 2,800 U.S. hourly workers impacted by the decisions to end production at some plants, GM says it has placed more than 1,700 employees in jobs at other locations.  In May, Trump praised GM's disclosure that it was in talks to sell an idled northeastern Ohio plant to cash-strapped electric truck-building Workhorse Group Inc WKHS.O and a new entity. The United Auto Workers has criticized that decision and some lawmakers have raised concerns about the plan.  In March, GM removed a Mexican-made Chevrolet Blazer from a display at Comerica Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, after some workers objected.  \u201cGM\u2019s operations in Mexico are not a threat to U.S. jobs,\u201d one company fact sheets states, noting GM has invested $23 billion in U.S. operations since 2009 compared with $5 billion in Mexico.

All of the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s profit came from North America, where those lucrative models helped overcome an overall drop in the number of vehicles it sold. The company\u2019s operations in China and South America combined added nothing to the company\u2019s bottom line in the quarter. Shares rose 1.4 percent.  The stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, driven by strong U.S. results, stood in contrast to the job cuts GM has begun to make in its salaried and hourly workforces.  The Detroit automaker has received political blowback, including from U.S. President Donald Trump, after announcing in late November it would not allocate new product to five plants in North America that mostly produce less-popular sedan models, indicating they will likely close.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has made it clear that, despite the criticism, the cutbacks are necessary for the automaker\u2019s long-term financial stability and to pay for the development of electric and self-driving vehicles.  \u201cWe can\u2019t run at a 70 percent utilization,\u201d Barra said Wednesday about the company\u2019s plant usage rate. \u201cWe had to improve that ... It\u2019s a transition we have to go through.\u201d An industry rule of thumb is that automakers\u2019 lose money when plants operate below 80 percent capacity.  Barra also cited the company\u2019s efforts to shift many of the affected hourly workers to other plants, lessening the impact of the cuts among blue-collar workers.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  GM said Monday it was starting to cut about 4,000 salaried workers in the latest round of restructuring announced in November.  It said then it would take pre-tax charges of $3 billion to $3.8 billion to pay for the cutbacks, but expected the actions to improve annual free cash flow by $6 billion by the end of 2020. GM has said commodity and trade costs would hurt 2019 results by $1 billion.  GM said on Wednesday that China\u2019s $300 million in operating earnings in the fourth quarter was offset by other international markets. It sold fewer vehicles in China, its largest market by volume, and said weak currencies in South America had also impacted results.  \u201cOur outlook for China overall is for the auto industry to be flat year over year,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters. \u201cIf you take a look at some of these economic indicators coming out of China, there are early signs of stabilization.\u201d  Buckingham Research analyst Joseph Amaturo said in a research note he remains concerned longer-term about vehicle pricing in China and North America, as well as demand in China. If China slumps, GM would be challenged to hit its financial targets, he said.  Late last month, rival Ford Motor Co posted a lower fourth-quarter profit as losses in every region except North America weighed on results.  Earlier Wednesday, Toyota Motor Corp posted a slightly higher profit as demand for its bread-and-butter car models from cost-conscious Chinese buyers helped offset weak North American sales of its marquee sedan models such as the Corolla and Camry.  U.S. new vehicle sales are expected to drop in 2019 due to rising interest rates and competition from a surfeit of cheaper, nearly-new used vehicles on the market.  On Wednesday, GM reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.1 billion, or $1.40 per share, versus a loss of $5.2 billion, or $3.65 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.43, above the $1.22 analysts polled by Refinitiv IBES had expected.  It reported a fourth-quarter loss in 2017 to adjust for an overhaul of the U.S. tax system. Excluding those charges, the automaker had reported net income of $2.4 billion.  The company maintained its full-year 2019 adjusted earnings forecast of between $6.50 and $7 per share.","231":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is exploring options in the aerial taxi market, including whether to build the vehicles known colloquially as \"flying cars,\" as part of a push by the U.S. automaker to look for growth in related transportation markets, two people familiar with the matter said.

Designed to avoid the need for long runways, they have rotating wings and, in some cases, rotors in place of propellers.  Electric air taxis are likely to fly low-level routes, relieving traffic congestion on roads. But they could add to air traffic congestion as they become more popular.  GM spokesman Stuart Fowle declined to elaborate. \u201cIt\u2019s an area we\u2019re really excited about and looking at.\u201d  GM shares rose as much as 5.4% and were still up 1.4% in afternoon trading.

He noted that companies like Amazon.com and Walmart are pushing to use package delivery drones, but said transporting people with flying cars will take a lot longer to develop as a business.  GM\u2019s study of the aerial mobility market is part of the push by GM\u2019s innovation group to explore other transportation markets for growth, one of the sources said. The group is headed by Alan Wexler, who reports to Barra and was hired in July in the newly created position of senior vice president of innovation and growth.  Other efforts that originated in the innovation group include formation of a defense business unit and a $214 million contract to build troop carriers for the U.S. Army based on the Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as a new mobile app for OnStar members.  Hyundai teamed up with Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N in January to develop electric air taxis and has pledged to invest $1.5 billion in urban air mobility by 2025.

As part of that push, GM said Monday it will hire 3,000 employees across engineering, design and information technology through the first quarter.  Chief Executive Mary Barra said last week GM will boost capital spending over the next three years to speed development of EVs. The Detroit company plans to more fully outline its EV strategy during an appearance by Barra on Nov. 19 at a Barclays conference.  In March, GM executives hosted a private showing for analysts and media of the company\u2019s future portfolio of EVs, including prototypes of a full-size Hummer pickup and SUV, a full-size Cadillac SUV about the size of the combustion-engine Escalade, a mid-sized Cadillac crossover called Lyriq and a large Cadillac luxury sedan called Celestiq.  The Hummer EV pickup will be launched in late 2021, followed by the Lyriq crossover in 2022. GM has promised 20 new electric vehicle models globally by 2023, to be built in North America and China.","233":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N on Wednesday forecast flat profits for 2020 and reported a better-than-expected fourth quarter result as it kicked off a new effort to win over investors stampeding into shares of electric car rival Tesla Inc TSLA.O.  The automaker\u2019s shares were up 1.8% in early trading.  GM said it expects earnings per share for 2020 in a range from $5.75 to $6.25, excluding one time items, taxes and interest. Analysts are expecting GM to earn $6.23 this year on a comparable basis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The automaker forecast $6 billion to $7.5 billion of automotive free cash flow this year, a range that extends above the $6.5 billion GM\u2019s auto operations could have generated in 2019 excluding the costs of the 40-day United Auto Workers strike last fall.  GM expects U.S. car and light truck sales to fall by about 500,000 vehicles from last year\u2019s 17.1 million.  \u201cGood enough,\u201d J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote about GM\u2019s 2020 guidance in a note Wednesday morning.  GM appeared to be getting better treatment from Wall Street than rival Ford Motor Co's F.N, whose shares slumped Wednesday after the company on Tuesday delivered a weaker-than-expected 2020 forecast. Ford warned of higher warranty costs, lower profits at its credit arm and continued investments in future technology such as self-driving cars.  GM\u2019s fourth quarter profits took a $3.6 billion hit from a 40-day United Auto Workers strike that shut down the automaker\u2019s profitable U.S. operations. Profits from its operations in China also fell.  The company said pre-tax profits were 5 cents a share for the latest quarter excluding certain restructuring costs, down from $1.43 a year earlier. Analysts had forecast pre-tax income of a penny a share for the latest quarter.  Including restructuring costs, GM had a fourth quarter net loss of $194 million, or 16 cents a share.  Revenue in the quarter fell nearly 20% to $30.8 billion.  GM said income from its joint ventures in China fell to $200 million in the fourth quarter from $300 million a year earlier, as wholesale vehicle deliveries fell by 20%.  The Detroit company said \u201cslower adoption of new fuel-efficient technology\u201d by Chinese customers hit fourth quarter results from the world\u2019s largest auto market. The company is backtracking from an effort to sell vehicles with three-cylinder engines in China, and will offer more four-cylinders.  GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said Wednesday the automaker had \u201cpeople working around the clock here to mitigate the impact\u201d of disruptions to production and parts supply from China\u2019s deadly coronavirus outbreak. GM will make decisions to restart idled operations in China \u201cplant by plant,\u201d Suryadevara said.  But even before the virus outbreak, GM expected the Chinese market to be volatile this year. China\u2019s auto market is maturing, Suryadevara said, which means more competitive pressure on prices and slower growth than in the past.  \u201cWe are bullish on the Chinese industry and our position in China long term,\u201d she told reporters ahead of presentations to analysts.","234":"July 7 (Reuters) - U.S. auto safety regulator on Tuesday disclosed it has opened an investigation into complaints of fuel leaks in older Chevrolet Cobalt compact cars and HHR wagons, manufactured by General Motors Co.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The union turned to Ford to negotiate a new four-year agreement after ratifying a contract last week with GM following a 40-day U.S. strike that shut down almost all of that company\u2019s North American operations. Ford and the UAW quickly reached a tentative deal on Wednesday.  \u201cThis contract continues a strong pattern that gives all workers a path to traditional wages and maintains the job security and benefits our members deserve,\u201d UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement.  Ford confirmed the deal in a statement and declined further comment.  The deal now must be ratified by the 55,000 UAW workers at Ford, with voting running through Nov. 15. While GM\u2019s deal was approved, ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract.  Detailed terms of the Ford deal echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. The UAW said the deal included agreements by Ford to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs.  The spending includes a $1.1 billion investment in Ford\u2019s Wayne, Michigan, pickup truck plant; $1 billion for the Louisville, Kentucky, plant, where Ford makes pickups and SUVs; and $900 million in an Ohio plant where it produces heavy-duty pickup trucks. A new unnamed vehicle will be added to the Ohio plant in 2023.  The deal also includes building hybrid and fully electric versions of various SUV models and the best-selling F-150 pickup truck, the union said.  Full-time UAW members at Ford will receive a signing bonus of $9,000, but the deal will allow the Dearborn, Michigan, company to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan.  The deal includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage.  Once the Ford deal is ratified, the UAW will turn to Fiat Chrysler to complete its quadrennial talks with the Detroit automakers.  The talks have at times been overshadowed by an ongoing federal corruption probe that has involved several UAW senior leaders and been linked to Jones. A UAW spokesman on Friday declined to address the probe.","237":"File Photo: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Roosevelt Cassio  NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Motors Co has reached a $120 million settlement with owners who claimed that their vehicles lost value because of defective ignition switches, which have been linked to 124 deaths.  The preliminary settlement was filed on Friday night with the federal court in Manhattan and requires approval by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman. It would resolve the last major piece of litigation stemming from ignition switches that could cause GM vehicles to stall and prevent airbags from deploying.  The automaker denied liability in agreeing to settle, court papers show.  GM has recalled more than 2.6 million vehicles since 2014 over the switches, covering vehicles dating back more than a decade earlier. It has also paid more than $2.6 billion in penalties and settlements, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case.  Friday\u2019s settlement resolves claims by owners who said they suffered economic losses from buying vehicles they thought were defect-free, only to see the ignition switch problem hurt GM\u2019s brand, reputation and resale values.  GM will contribute up to $70 million toward the settlement, while a trust set up in connection with the Detroit-based automaker\u2019s 2009 bankruptcy will contribute $50 million.  In addition, GM will pay as much as $34.5 million to cover legal fees and expenses of the owners\u2019 lawyers.  \u201cGM believes the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate,\u201d the automaker said. \u201cGM took the lessons it learned from the ignition switch recalls and has transformed its culture to focus on customer safety.\u201d  Prior to Friday\u2019s settlement, GM had resolved or obtained dismissals of most of the more than 3,000 personal injury and wrongful death claims overseen by Furman.","238":"Oct 25 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Friday its members ratified a new four-year labor contract with General Motors Co , ending the strike with the No. 1 U.S. automaker after 40 days.  The union, which wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers, said 57% of the members voted to approve the deal. [nL2N27215D  UAW officials and striking workers on the picket lines had said their focus in the dispute with GM was on jobs, pay equity and fairness for workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy. They also wanted to save factories in Ohio and Michigan GM had threatened to close.  This year\u2019s talks - also occurring with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  The following is a timeline of events leading up to the deal.  Nov. 26, 2018  GM announced the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s biggest restructuring since its 2009 bankruptcy, putting five North American plants on notice for potential closure and saying it would cut nearly 15,000 jobs.  The UAW, which represents U.S. workers at the four U.S. plants targeted, vowed to fight the cuts.  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that GM save the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that was targeted.  Nov. 27, 2018  Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants.  Dec. 5, 2018  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra warned the Detroit company had excess manufacturing capacity, and said the Lordstown plant\u2019s future would be determined during the 2019 labor talks.  Dec. 14, 2018  GM said more than 1,100 of the 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at plants losing production had volunteered to transfer to other plants. That number has risen since then to more than 2,300.  Jan. 3, 2019  The UAW sued GM in federal court, claiming its use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violated its labor deal.  Feb. 22, 2019  GM extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, instead of ending work in June as earlier planned. However, on March 6, the last Chevrolet Cruze small car rolled off the assembly line at the Lordstown plant.  Feb. 26, 2019  The UAW sued GM over its restructuring plan, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.  March 13, 2019  UAW President Gary Jones at the union\u2019s bargaining convention in Detroit said job security and stopping the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico were top priorities for the contract talks.  March 18, 2019  U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged Norwood Jewell, a former high-ranking UAW official in charge of labor relations with Fiat Chrysler, of misusing funds to pay for lavish parties for himself and other union officials. The following month, he pleaded guilty.  May 8, 2019  GM said it was in talks to sell the idled Lordstown plant to a cash-strapped electric vehicle startup, Workhorse Group Inc . GM also said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio plants. The UAW called on GM to put a new product of its own in the plant.  June 5, 2019  Barra defended GM\u2019s proposed sale of the Lordstown plant and said the automaker did not plan to add a new vehicle there.  July 16, 2019  GM and the UAW formally kicked off talks for a new four-year labor deal, with Jones calling on the automaker to keep open plants it had slated for shutdown.  Aug. 28, 2019  The FBI conducted searches at the home of Jones and other locations as part of a corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.  Sept. 3, 2019  The UAW said it would target GM first in talks with the Detroit automakers for contracts set to expire on Sept. 14.  Sept. 12, 2019  U.S. prosecutors\u2019 probe of alleged corruption within the UAW expanded with the arrest of a senior union official. In a criminal complaint released the following day, a source said Jones was one of the unnamed officials singled out.  Sept. 16, 2019  The UAW workers went on strike against GM. The automaker disclosed it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in new investments, solutions for the Lordstown and Detroit assembly plants that included a battery plant in Ohio and an electric vehicle for the Michigan plant, a pay increase and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  Sept. 17, 2019  GM shifted health insurance costs for the striking workers to the UAW, prompting an outcry from the union and Democratic politicians. On Sept. 26, GM reversed its decision.  Oct. 1, 2019  The UAW rejected a new offer from GM to end the strike. Five days later, UAW senior negotiator Terry Dittes said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and later called on GM to boost U.S. auto production.  Oct. 10, 2019  The union disclosed that GM\u2019s Barra met with the UAW\u2019s Jones and Dittes at the company\u2019s Detroit headquarters, seeking to speed up talks, as the strike neared its fourth week.  Oct. 11, 2019  GM took the unusual step of appealing directly to striking employees, circumventing UAW\u2019s leadership, in a blog post that laid out the terms of its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, upsetting the UAW in the process. The union accused GM of undermining the talks.  Oct. 15, 2019  The sides near a deal after Barra and GM President Mark Reuss join the bargaining table.  Oct. 16, 2019  The UAW and GM announce they reached a tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the members before the strike will officially end.  Oct. 17, 2019  The UAW released highlights of the tentative four-year deal, which includes pay raises, better coverage for temporary workers and other benefits, but also will allow the automaker to close three plants, including the idled car plant in Lordstown, Ohio.  Oct. 25, 2019  The UAW said 57% of its members voted to ratify the deal, ending the strike after 40 days.","239":"July 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s self-driving unit, Cruise, said on Wednesday it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past 2019 as it requires more testing of the vehicles.

The GM strike began on Sept. 16 with the 48,000 UAW members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker\u2019s profit and protection of healthcare benefits. The sides have been meeting daily and talks continued on Saturday, and representatives for both sides declined to discuss details.  One of the major remaining issues includes the UAW\u2019s desire to reduce the time it takes newer hires to earn the top wage scale of about $31 an hour from the current eight-year period, said the source, who asked not to be identified because the talks are ongoing.  Another issue is a desire by the union for a higher pension payout, meaning an enhanced formula for those members hired before 2007 who would be covered by a pension, and a higher contribution to the 401(k) plans of members hired after 2007, the source said.  The UAW said late Friday it had made \u201cgood progress\u201d in the negotiations on such issues as health care and the status of temporary workers.

GM announced on Tuesday it will shutter the plant in Gunsan, in South Korea\u2019s southwest, by May and decide within weeks on the fate of the remaining three plants in the country.  Unionised workers at the Gunsan plant, which employs 2,000 out of GM\u2019s 16,000-strong South Korean workforce, wore red headbands saying \u201cSolidarity, Fight\u201d and held leaflets demanding the withdrawal of the closure plan, pictures from local media show.  \u201cWe can\u2019t accept this.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday used GM\u2019s decision to close the plant to launch fresh criticism of the U.S.-South Korea trade agreement.  After Trump took office, trade tensions rose between Washington and its key ally South Korea, with their bilateral free trade deal now under renegotiation.  Trump recently approved tariffs on South Korean washing machines, while South Korea has vowed to take countermeasures through the World Trade Organisation (WTO).  South Korea\u2019s trade ministry said on Wednesday it will also take a dispute to WTO against the United States for imposing high anti-dumping duties on South Korean steel and transformers.

But Dang of GM Korea\u2019s union blamed the company for reducing output, saying lower wages were not acceptable.  GM\u2019s move is the latest in a series of its steps to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015 GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia.

That battle will be fought in truck-heavy states like Texas, where consumers aspire to luxury pickup trucks more than luxury car brands such as Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes-Benz and BMW .  \u201cThe whole (luxury truck) segment is going to be exceptionally competitive for at least the next 24 months, because Ford and Fiat Chrysler will not take this lying down,\u201d said IHS Markit auto analyst Tom Libby said of GM unit GMC\u2019s new Sierra Denali.  Detroit\u2019s automakers dominate the U.S. pickup truck market.  Unlike some past GMC vehicles, the new 2019 Sierra Denali pickup, a premium version of the standard Sierra, has been designed from scratch. GMC has been criticized previously for simply selling glorified Chevrolet models at higher prices, a common industry practice.  The new Sierra Denali \u2014 GMC uses the Denali sub-brand on luxury trucks, SUVs and crossovers \u2014 has striking lines and features including a high-tech tailgate that opens six different ways.  The new Denali also features leather seats with heating and cooling functions, and a new infotainment system with a smartphone-like display screen. The pickup also has added leg-room in the back and luxury wood trimmings, though GM executives say the pickup has lost none of its functions as a heavy-duty work vehicle.  But even the old Sierra Denali\u2019s most striking detail was its price. Last year, the pickup truck\u2019s average transaction price was around $56,000, according to J.D. Power.  \u201cAs you can imagine, the Denali is a huge profit contributor to GM,\u201d GMC brand chief Duncan Aldred said. He declined to provide targets, but said GMC expects to grow its share of the luxury market. The 2019 Sierra Denali will go on sale late 2018.  A sticker price over $50,000 qualifies as \u201cpremium.\u201d  According to Kelley Blue Book (KBB), the average transaction price in 2017 for all GMC Sierra models was $49,615. For Ford Motor Co\u2019s F-Series trucks, it was $49,439, and a Fiat Chrysler Automobile NV (FCA) Ram pickup averaged $46,789.  Those averages include far-cheaper models, but are still higher than the average for luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series, Audi's A4 and Toyota Motor Corp's Lexus ES. For a graphic, see tmsnrt.rs\/2F11cR9  Last month GM unveiled a revamped Chevrolet Silverado truck and forecast higher profits in 2019 thanks to its new high-margin pickup trucks.  The F-series has been the best-selling model line for 41 years, with 2017 sales of nearly 900,000 vehicles. GM sold a total of 947,972 of its four Chevrolet and GMC pickup models, two of which are mid-sized.  Around a third of Ford\u2019s F-Series pickup trucks count as premium, meaning around 12 percent of Ford\u2019s 2017 total U.S. sales were luxury trucks. Luxury models make up about 30 percent of FCA\u2019s pickup truck sales.  Pickup prices range from around $25,000 to as much as $100,000. Industry analysts estimate gross margins for some top-of-the-line trucks can exceed $50,000.  Margins matter more in a declining market.  U.S. new vehicle sales fell more than 2 percent in 2017 - and should drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones.  Passenger car sales declined 11 percent last year. But SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks rose 4.3 percent.  Major automakers posted lower U.S. new vehicle sales for February on Thursday as consumer demand continued to cool following a lengthy boom, despite strong crossovers and SUV sales.  Luxury pickups are \u201cthe perfect storm for\u201d Detroit\u2019s automakers, said Jeff Schuster, consultancy LMC Automotive\u2019s head of forecasting. \u201cConsumers want them and they provide the biggest margin boost in a flat-to-falling market.\u201d  Texas consumers want them more.  According to KBB, in 2017 through November, Texans bought 260,000 pickup trucks, 20.7 of the state\u2019s total vehicle sales. Nationally, pickups account for 12 percent of sales.  GM sells a third of its trucks in its \u201csouth-central\u2019 division - Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas - and 80 percent of its high-end Sierra Denali versions are sold there.  \u201cIf you think about this segment, there are not that many competitors,\u201d GMC\u2019s Aldred said. \u201cThat obviously gives us a better share of market and enables us to stand out more.\u201d  IHS Markit\u2019s Libby said luxury versions of GM\u2019s and FCA\u2019s pickups grew as a share of sales from 2016 to 2017.  \u201cThe economy is doing well and that will help the industry in general, but it will help more with vehicles like these,\u201d Libby said.","252":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth likely accelerated in November as former striking workers returned to General Motors' GM.N payrolls, which would confirm that the economy remained on a moderate expansion path despite a prolonged manufacturing slump.  FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is pictured at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Ramos Arizpe, state of Coahuila, Mexico October 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  The Labor Department\u2019s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday is also expected to show steady wage gains and the unemployment rate holding near a 50-year low.  The report would validate the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision last month to cut interest rates for the third time this year, but signal a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008. U.S. central bank policymakers are expected highlight the economy\u2019s resilience when they meet on Dec.10-11.  Recent reports on the trade deficit, housing and orders for big-ticket goods have offered a fairly beat assessment of the economy, but trade tensions continue to loom over the longest expansion, now in its 11th year.  According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 180,000 jobs in November, with manufacturing recouping the 36,000 positions lost in October, and bring job gains back in line with the trend for this year.  The 40-day strike by about 46,000 workers at GM plants in Michigan and Kentucky restricted employment gains to 128,000 jobs in October. Employment growth has averaged 167,000 per month this year.  \u201cWe are experiencing a Goldilocks economy, neither too hot nor too cold,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, a business economist at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. \u201cBut I continue to worry that the recession in manufacturing and poor business confidence could eventually hurt job growth and economic activity.\u201d  Manufacturing activity contracted for a fourth straight month in November. The factory malaise has been blamed on the Trump administration\u2019s 17-month trade war with China, which has bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure.  Though Washington and Beijing are working on a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal, the United States has ratcheted up tensions with other trade partners including Brazil, Argentina and France. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the U.S. was having meetings and discussions with China \u201cthat are going well.\u201d  MODERATE GROWTH  Economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter are converging around a 1.8% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. Economists estimate speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at between 1.7% and 2%.  Employment gains in November could, however, come below expectations. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s measure of manufacturing employment contracted in November for the fourth straight month. The ADP National Employment report showed a sharp deceleration in private payrolls growth last month and consumers\u2019 perceptions of the labor market were less upbeat.  Temperatures were cooler than normal in November, which could have impacted hiring at construction sites, mines and transportation companies. Job openings have been trending lower.  Though the labor market has been resilient despite the business investment downturn, hiring has slowed from last year\u2019s average monthly gain of 223,000 because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers. The government has said it could cut job growth for the 12 months through March 2019 by at least 500,000 when it publishes its annual revision next February.  Still job creation is well over the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.6% percent. The jobless rate stalled since dropping from 4.0% in January as strong labor market conditions lured in workers from the sidelines.  The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, is at a more than more than six-year high of 63.3%.  The tight labor market is a generating steady wage gains, which last month likely received a boost from a calendar quirk. Average hourly earnings after forecast increasing 0.3% in November after rising 0.2% in October. That would keep the annual increase in wages at 3.0% in November.  \u201cUpdates on hiring, the unemployment rate and earnings growth will provide financial market participants and policy watchers alike the latest indication of a tight labor market will continue to bolster consumer spending, and thereby support the Fed\u2019s view that monetary policy remains sufficiently accommodative,\u201d said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Manufacturing employment was forecast rebounding by 38,000 jobs as GM strike returnees boosted payrolls in the auto sector. Snow storms in the Midwest and cold weather in other parts of the country likely curbed hiring in the construction industry last month after payrolls rose by 10,000 jobs in October.  Government employment likely bounced back after dropping in October as temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census departed after completing their assignments.","253":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors GM.N will \"work very closely\" with Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL) 300750.SZ as it ramps up electric production in the world's biggest auto market, a senior executive said.

The single-passenger Cadillac - technically, a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone - will be able to travel from urban rooftop to urban rooftop at speeds up to 55 miles per hour.  It is fully fully autonomous and all-electric, with a 90kW motor, a GM Ultium battery pack and an ultra-lightweight body with four pairs of rotors.

GM, which controls about 70% of the large sport utility market in North America with six models, unveiled the redesigned Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the first of a new generation of large SUVs whose profits will help fund development of electric vehicles that the automaker promises for the future.  The 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe, revealed at the arena where the Detroit Red Wings hockey team plays in downtown Detroit, is 6.7 inches longer than the current Tahoe and can carry as much as 122.9 cubic feet of cargo. Passengers in the third row of seats get 10 inches more legroom and a better ride thanks to a more car-like independent rear suspension.  The new Chevy Suburban will grow by 1.3 inches to 225.7 inches long - making it one of the longest passenger vehicles on the market. GM\u2019s big SUVs will be powered by eight cylinder gasoline engines or six cylinder diesel motors.  The vehicles have a new digital electronic architecture that enables over-the-air software updates and new revenue opportunities, Reuss told Reuters.  \"It's huge,\" Reuss said of the potential to sell customers new digital functions or avoid warranty repairs with a software update. Electric car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O has used over-the-air upgrades as money makers and to fix problems at low cost.  As the industry moves toward electric vehicles, profits from large SUVs will help pay for investments, Reuss said. Those include GM\u2019s plans to build a new battery plant and offer an electric pick-up truck.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  The new SUVs are assembled at a complex in Arlington, Texas, a state where many of them will be sold. GM has invested $1.4 billion to expand the Arlington operation, and that gives the company the option to manufacture additional models, Reuss said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest that much..and not have agility,\u201d he said.  The Tahoe and Suburban unveilings cap a substantial investment by GM over the past five years in its largest pickup trucks and SUVs. GM's Detroit rivals, Ford Motor CoF.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, are also expanding their large SUV lineups, even as they promise more electrified cars for the future.  Detroit automakers are doubling down again on big SUVs for a simple reason: It pays.  The Arlington, Texas factory is running 24 hours a day to meet demand, and profit margins on large SUVs can be as high as 30%, or more than $15,000 a vehicle, industry executives and analysts said. Barclays estimated large pickup trucks and SUVs accounted for 72% of GM\u2019s North American profit in 2018.  GM did not disclose pricing or fuel consumption data on the new SUVs, but the average Tahoe sold for $57,414 in November, according to data from ALG, a unit of TrueCar.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  U.S. fuel economy rules, instituted under President Barack Obama, encourage automakers to make sport utilities even bigger. Vehicles that have a larger \u201cfootprint\u201d because they are long and wide have easier mileage and CO2 emissions targets to meet.  President Donald Trump has said he wants to ease vehicle CO2 standards but has not released a final plan. GM has sided with Trump on fuel economy policy in a dispute with California, which has sued to maintain the stronger Obama era standards.  GM\u2019s sales of big utilities through the end of November were roughly steady year over year, according to sales figures from Automotive News.  But GM faces tougher competition in the segment going forward. Ford has boosted sales of its competing Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator large utilities by 45% through Nov. 30.

While emphasizing GM\u2019s commitment to the collective bargaining process, the letter, signed by Gerald Johnson, executive vice-president for global manufacturing, circumvents United Auto Workers (UAW) leadership and points to frustration at a lack of progress on ending a conflict that has already cost the company more than $1 billion.  The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union\u2019s 48,000 members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profits and protection of healthcare benefits. Credit Suisse estimated the loss could hit about $1.5 billion.  As part of its revised offer, GM boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion, a source familiar with the offer said.  Of the new total, $7.7 billion would be invested directly in GM plants, with the rest going to joint ventures including a potential battery plant near the Lordstown, Ohio, factory that has been idled, the source said.  GM said the offer also includes increased compensation through wages and one-time payments, preserving industry-leading healthcare benefits without increasing workers\u2019 costs, enhanced profit sharing with unlimited upside and a higher ratification bonus than the $8,000 previously offered.  For temporary workers, GM said its offer would create a path to permanent employment and include a ratification bonus.  \u201cThe strike has been hard on you, your families, our communities, the company, our suppliers and dealers,\u201d GM\u2019s letter read, saying the latest offer increased compensation and promised a path to full-time jobs for temporary workers.  \u201cWe have advised the union that it\u2019s critical that we get back to producing quality vehicles for our customers. ... Our offer builds on the winning formula we have all benefited from over the past several years.\u201d  A UAW spokesman declined to comment on the new offer.  In a Thursday letter to UAW leaders, GM urged the union to agree to around-the-clock negotiations to try reach a deal, while the union insisted in its own letter on dealing with five specific issues first before it responded to the broader proposal made to the union negotiators Monday.  GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra met Wednesday with UAW President Gary Jones and lead GM negotiator Terry Dittes to urge a faster response by the union to the company\u2019s last offer.  One of the five issues the committees are discussing is the fate of four U.S. factories that GM has indicated could close; another is future technological changes to production, according to the UAW letter. Dittes said he did not know when the issues would be resolved, suggesting a final deal may not be close.  UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers, and that workers in battery production plants may earn less than those at existing transmission plants.  Reuters previously reported GM told the UAW it could build a new battery plant near the now-shuttered Lordstown factory, and assemble an electric truck at its Detroit Hamtramck plant.  On Sunday, the UAW said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and on Tuesday the union urged GM to boost U.S. vehicle production. Union workers are angry about production of trucks and sport-utility vehicles in Mexico.  The UAW\u2019s membership is largely in the Midwest, in states that could be critical to both sides in the 2020 presidential election, so the strike has drawn the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, his rivals seeking the Democratic nomination, and U.S. lawmakers. They have urged GM to build more vehicles in the United States and shift work from Mexico.

According to three company officials familiar with the matter, Harry Sze, who last month left BMW Group Designworks Shanghai as a creative director, is expected to be officially named as early as early next week as head of GM\u2019s studio.  Competition among established and startup companies in China has led to a bull market for top vehicle designers.  Sze, an American national, has worked at BMW Group Designworks for six years in Shanghai and Newbury Park, California. Prior to BMW, Sze spent several years with startups such as Fisker Automotive based in Anaheim, California.  Sze would replace Colin Phipps, who recently resigned as the studio\u2019s director. It was not immediately clear why Phipps left GM, but according to his LinkedIn account, Phipps in August joined electric car startup Nio as head of design in Shanghai.  GM\u2019s Shanghai studio is one of four such studios and is tasked with working on design concepts for the company\u2019s future models, including those for electric vehicles. The other three are in Melbourne, Los Angeles and Warren, Michigan.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  The union, which wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers, said 57% of the members voted to approve the deal.  UAW officials and striking workers on the picket lines had said their focus in the dispute with GM was on jobs, pay equity and fairness for workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy. They also wanted to save factories in Ohio and Michigan GM had threatened to close.  This year's talks - also occurring with Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI - have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  The following is a timeline of events leading up to the deal.  Nov. 26, 2018  GM announced the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s biggest restructuring since its 2009 bankruptcy, putting five North American plants on notice for potential closure and saying it would cut nearly 15,000 jobs.  The UAW, which represents U.S. workers at the four U.S. plants targeted, vowed to fight the cuts.  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that GM save the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that was targeted.  Nov. 27, 2018  Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants.  Dec. 5, 2018  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra warned the Detroit company had excess manufacturing capacity, and said the Lordstown plant\u2019s future would be determined during the 2019 labor talks.  Dec. 14, 2018  GM said more than 1,100 of the 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at plants losing production had volunteered to transfer to other plants. That number has risen since then to more than 2,300.  Jan. 3, 2019  The UAW sued GM in federal court, claiming its use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violated its labor deal.  Feb. 22, 2019  GM extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, instead of ending work in June as earlier planned. However, on March 6, the last Chevrolet Cruze small car rolled off the assembly line at the Lordstown plant.  Feb. 26, 2019  The UAW sued GM over its restructuring plan, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.  March 13, 2019  UAW President Gary Jones at the union\u2019s bargaining convention in Detroit said job security and stopping the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico were top priorities for the contract talks.  March 18, 2019  U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged Norwood Jewell, a former high-ranking UAW official in charge of labor relations with Fiat Chrysler, of misusing funds to pay for lavish parties for himself and other union officials. The following month, he pleaded guilty.  May 8, 2019  GM said it was in talks to sell the idled Lordstown plant to a cash-strapped electric vehicle startup, Workhorse Group Inc WKHS.O. GM also said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio plants. The UAW called on GM to put a new product of its own in the plant.  June 5, 2019  Barra defended GM\u2019s proposed sale of the Lordstown plant and said the automaker did not plan to add a new vehicle there.  July 16, 2019  GM and the UAW formally kicked off talks for a new four-year labor deal, with Jones calling on the automaker to keep open plants it had slated for shutdown.  Aug. 28, 2019  The FBI conducted searches at the home of Jones and other locations as part of a corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.  Sept. 3, 2019  The UAW said it would target GM first in talks with the Detroit automakers for contracts set to expire on Sept. 14.  Sept. 12, 2019  U.S. prosecutors\u2019 probe of alleged corruption within the UAW expanded with the arrest of a senior union official. In a criminal complaint released the following day, a source said Jones was one of the unnamed officials singled out.  Sept. 16, 2019  The UAW workers went on strike against GM. The automaker disclosed it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in new investments, solutions for the Lordstown and Detroit assembly plants that included a battery plant in Ohio and an electric vehicle for the Michigan plant, a pay increase and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  Sept. 17, 2019  GM shifted health insurance costs for the striking workers to the UAW, prompting an outcry from the union and Democratic politicians. On Sept. 26, GM reversed its decision.  Oct. 1, 2019  The UAW rejected a new offer from GM to end the strike. Five days later, UAW senior negotiator Terry Dittes said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and later called on GM to boost U.S. auto production.  Oct. 10, 2019  The union disclosed that GM\u2019s Barra met with the UAW\u2019s Jones and Dittes at the company\u2019s Detroit headquarters, seeking to speed up talks, as the strike neared its fourth week.  Oct. 11, 2019  GM took the unusual step of appealing directly to striking employees, circumventing UAW\u2019s leadership, in a blog post that laid out the terms of its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, upsetting the UAW in the process. The union accused GM of undermining the talks.  Oct. 15, 2019  The sides near a deal after Barra and GM President Mark Reuss join the bargaining table.  Oct. 16, 2019  The UAW and GM announce they reached a tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the members before the strike will officially end.  Oct. 17, 2019  The UAW released highlights of the tentative four-year deal, which includes pay raises, better coverage for temporary workers and other benefits, but also will allow the automaker to close three plants, including the idled car plant in Lordstown, Ohio.  Oct. 25, 2019  The UAW said 57% of its members voted to ratify the deal, ending the strike after 40 days.","268":"DETROIT, Feb 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will close one of four vehicle assembly plants in South Korea, and will decide the future of the remaining operations within weeks, based on the outcome of talks with the government and labor unions, GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters on Monday.  \u201cTime is short and everyone must move with urgency,\u201d Ammann said.  On Tuesday in Korea, GM will announce plans to close its compact vehicle assembly plant in Gunsan, which employs about 2,000 workers, Ammann said. That factory built just 33,982 vehicles in 2017, or about 20 percent of its full production capacity, GM said.  The automaker\u2019s three other assembly plants in South Korea built 485,403 vehicles last year. GM sells Chevrolet and Cadillac brand vehicles in the Korean market, and more than half the vehicles built by GM\u2019s Korean plants are exported.  GM\u2019s move to shrink its South Korean operations is the latest in a series of steps over the past three years to put profitability and investments in new technology ahead of sales and production volume. GM has since 2015 exited unprofitable markets in rapid succession, including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra has said she will focus GM\u2019s engineering and capital on profitable markets, mainly the United States and China, and new technologies such as electric and automated vehicles.  The automaker\u2019s decisions to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe. Declining sales of small cars in the U.S. have also hurt demand for Korean-made Chevrolets.  GM\u2019s long-term presence in South Korea will depend on the government\u2019s willingness to offer funding or other incentives, and on whether Korean unions will agree to cut labor costs, Ammann said.  GM is in talks with South Korean government officials about ways to make GM\u2019s Korean operations profitable. South Korea\u2019s state-run development bank owns a 17 percent stake in GM Korea. The Detroit automaker owns 77 percent of the operations while GM\u2019s main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, controls 6.0 percent.  South Korean officials said last week they are discussing several options to help GM deal with high labor costs and slow sales that have left the automaker\u2019s plants in the country operating far below full capacity.  Investments in new models for the South Korean plants to build depend on new cost-cutting agreements, Ammann said.  \u201cIf we are successful in working with our stakeholders to restructure and get to a viable cost structure, we would see an opportunity to invest\u201d in new vehicles, Ammann said.","269":"(This July 31 story corrects name of GM unit to GM Financial in paragraph 8)  FILE PHOTO: General Motors Co. displays the new Chevrolet 2020 Silverado HD pickup truck at the GM Flint Assembly Plant in Flint, Michigan, U.S. February 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co's GM.N investors will see on Thursday how the Detroit carmaker is weathering declining sales and mounting price pressures in its largest markets when it reports second-quarter earnings.  Slumping industry demand in China, the world's largest auto market, and an escalating price war in the lucrative U.S. pickup truck segment are ratcheting up the pressure on GM. Other automakers, including U.S. rival Ford Motor Co F.N and Germany's Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, offered disappointing forecasts last week.  In April, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said her \u201cconfidence in the year ahead remains strong,\u201d citing the company\u2019s new full-size pickup truck launch and the automaker\u2019s ongoing business transformation.  Investor David Kudla, chief investment strategist for Michigan-based Mainstay Capital Management, said GM must \u201ccarefully juggle\u201d its restructuring with the rollout of its high profit vehicles even as it invests for the industry\u2019s future while facing such headwinds as declining global sales.  For the full year, GM has forecast adjusted earnings of $6.50 to $7 a share and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion.  For the second quarter, analysts expect GM to earn $2.08 billion, or $1.44 a share, on revenue of $36.1 billion, according to IBES data provided by Refinitiv.  GM must deliver as much as $10 billion in cash flow in the final three quarters of 2019 to hit its full-year target, amid stagnant U.S. demand and plummeting industry sales in China. It reported a negative cash flow of $3.9 billion in the first quarter.  In April, GM said it would hit its full-year target through strong performance, and annual dividends from China and GM Financial.  In 2018, the Detroit company reported negative cash flow of $3.3 billion in the first quarter, but ended the year at positive $4.4 billion.  Auto sales in China, GM\u2019s largest market, are headed for a decline for the second year running after demand contracted for the 12th straight month in June.  In the second quarter, GM\u2019s China sales slid 12%, a slight improvement over the 17.5% decline in the first quarter.  GM has laid out plans to introduce around 20 new models or variants of older ones this year, most in the second half. Profit pressure could increase as it launches a series of lower-margin electric vehicles over the next several years.  Last week, Ford posted a lower-than-expected profit and provided investors with a full-year earnings forecast that fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations, and luxury carmaker Daimler reduced its 2019 sales outlook for Mercedes-Benz cars.  GM's profits in the lucrative pickup truck market have also been pressured by an escalating price war with Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) FCHA.MI. The three Detroit automakers dominate the segment.  GM executives previously said they were \u201cbullish\u201d on sales in the segment for the rest of the year, and have cited the introduction of more profitable models as the launch continues.  GM Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg said this month that U.S. industry sales were strong in the first half and should remain so in the second half and get even more support if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as expected.  The company\u2019s U.S. inventory of Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks at the end of July was 108 and 110 days, respectively, according to Automotive News. In comparison, inventory for the Ford F Series and FCA RAM trucks stood at 88 and 75 days, respectively.  GM no longer discloses monthly sales data and a company spokesman said the Automotive News estimates were incorrect. He added that truck inventories were approaching \u201coptimal levels\u201d and GM tries to maintain about a 100-day supply because of the complexity of truck offerings.  Last week, GM backed off the target for commercial deployment of cars by its Cruise self-driving unit beyond 2019, citing a need for more testing.","270":"HANOI, June 28 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will transfer its Vietnamese operation to local automobile manufacturer Vinfast Trading and Production LLC, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday.

Ohio lawmakers urged GM to reconsider. Republican Senator Rob Portman told GM chief executive Mary Barra on Monday that the company should bring a new product to the plant and he also urged GM \u201cto at least reallocate some of the production and employees to the Toledo GM plant.\u201d  In July 2017, Trump made a speech in Youngstown, Ohio near the GM plant and vowed jobs were \u201call coming back.\u201d He told local residents: \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t sell your house.\u201d  Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, seized on Trump\u2019s 2017 remarks. \u201cSo far President Trump has been asleep at the switch and owes this community an explanation,\u201d Ryan said Monday. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve gotten instead are broken promises and petty tweets.\u201d  Trump separately told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that General Motors Co should stop making cars in China and make them in the United States instead.  Trump told reporters he told Barra he was unhappy with the announcement. He said the decision to halt sales of the Chevrolet Cruze had \u201cnothing to do with tariffs\u201d but was because of poor sales. \u201cGet a car that is selling well and put it back in,\u201d Trump said.  GM currently builds just one vehicle in China that it exports to the United States - the Buick Envision. The company has sold about 22,000 through September and in August sought an exclusion from 25 percent U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese vehicle imports. The Trump administration has not yet ruled on the request.  GM sold nearly 2.7 million vehicles in China through September, nearly all of them built in China for the market.","272":"(Reuters) - Sales of light vehicles in Canada dipped 0.6 percent in March according to data released on Tuesday, amid signs that the economy was on track for a weaker-than-expected first quarter.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  The recall covers 2014-2018 model year vehicles, including some Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Tahoe, GMC Sierra, Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon vehicles.  In late June, GM recalled 310,000 vehicles in Canada for the same issue. GM did not immediately explain why the Canadian recall occurred more than two months before it called back the vehicles in the United States.  The recall was triggered because the amount of vacuum created by the vacuum pump may decrease over time, GM told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in documents posted on Wednesday.  The NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into the issue last November, and said it had reports of nine related crashes and two injuries. It provided GM in July with additional field reports that prompted the automaker to open an investigation.  GM said it could affect braking in \u201crare circumstances.\u201d The NHTSA said in a statement the \u201cvehicles may experience brake boost failure, which would require increased brake pedal effort, leading to a hard brake pedal feel, and potentially increased stopping distance.\u201d  GM said dealers will reprogram the electronic brake control module to improve how the system utilizes the hydraulic brake boost assist function when vacuum assist is depleted.  GM said the vacuum assist pump, which is lubricated with engine oil that flows into the pump through a filter screen, can in some cases lose effectiveness over time, as debris such as oil sludge can accumulate on the filter screen.  GM told NHTSA that prior model years used a different brake assist system design, and vehicles manufactured after 2018 were not equipped with the affected pump design.  Separately, GM said on Wednesday it is recalling 270,000 additional U.S. vehicles in three smaller recalls, including 177,000 2018 Chevrolet Malibu cars with 1.5L turbo engines because an error in the engine control module software may result in the fuel injectors being disabled.  It is also recalling 91,000 2019 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vehicles because the seatbelt-unfastened warning light will not illuminate for approximately five seconds after the ignition is moved to the \u201con\u201d or \u201cstart\u201d position, which means they are not in compliance with federal motor safety regulations.","274":"March 4 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker General Motors Co on Wednesday launched Ultium, a battery with higher capacity and fast charging capabilities, to power its upcoming line of electric vehicles.

Some large locals are casting their votes on Thursday and Friday on whether to ratify the deal, and the union is scheduled to announce the final results after 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) on Friday. The UAW recommended that the 48,000 members at GM, who have remained on the picket lines, ratify the deal reached on Oct. 16.  In 2015, rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV rejected the first version of a contract before it was eventually approved.  The GM strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers.  Under the deal, GM would invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. The Detroit company also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which would be new, a source previously said. The contract offers $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.  Among the larger plants with workers voting on the deal on Thursday are Wentzville, Missouri; Detroit-Hamtramck and Romulus, Michigan; Tonawanda, New York; and Fairfax, Kansas. Plants in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Arlington, Texas; and Lansing Delta Township in Michigan will finish voting on Friday.  If the deal is approved by the workers, the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor Co or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.

Trump referred to GM\u2019s announcement that it would close an auto factory in South Korea, and then turned to the subject of the U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement, where the concerns of U.S. automakers are a central issue.  \u201cWe have a very bad trade deal with Korea,\u201d Trump said during a meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to discuss steel and aluminum imports. \u201cWe\u2019ll either negotiate a fair deal or we\u2019ll terminate the deal - but before we do that, already General Motors is coming back into Detroit. That is a really significant statement.\u201d  GM did not say that it plans to move production of vehicles to the United States from South Korea as part of its restructuring of operations there.  \u201cThe announcement is related to our need to restructure our business in South Korea. Depending on the outcome of those restructuring efforts there could be broad global implications but as we said yesterday we need the full engagement of all stakeholders with a sense of urgency,\u201d the automaker said in a statement after Trump\u2019s comments.  The White House did not immediately provide clarification on whether Trump had been told by GM that vehicle production would be moved from South Korea to Detroit.  The U.S. automaker said it would decide the future of its remaining South Korean operations within weeks, and is in talks with the South Korean government and labor unions on how to cut costs and make the business profitable.  \u201cTime is short and everyone must move with urgency,\u201d GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters.  South Korean officials said on Tuesday that financial aid to GM Korea will depend on the automaker\u2019s willingness to commit to new investment in the operations that remain.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Ammann told Reuters GM will invest \u201cif we are successful in working with our stakeholders to restructure and get to a viable cost structure.\u201d  GM\u2019s move is the latest in a series of steps to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015 GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia.  GM\u2019s plan places South Korean President Moon Jae-in in an uncomfortable spot. Just as Trump has done in the United States, Moon has pledged to create more jobs and provide job security as his top economic policy.  Opposition lawmakers criticized Moon\u2019s administration on Tuesday for the potential job losses from GM\u2019s strategy for the country.  The South Korean government said in a statement it regretted GM\u2019s \u201cunilateral\u201d decision to close the plant. It said it wanted to conduct an audit of the automaker\u2019s local arm, GM Korea, as it weighed options to help with the restructuring plan.  GM said in a statement it would take an $850 million charge to reflect the restructuring costs, including $375 million in cash related to employee expenses. Most of the financial writedowns would be recorded by the end of the second quarter.  South Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its global output at its peak. But sharp rises in labor costs, weakening demand for sedans, which GM Korea mainly produces, and big investments in neighboring China hurt the South Korean business\u2019s competitiveness.  The plant shutdown is part of its broader Asia business restructuring. Excluding profits from China, GM said its Asian operations lost money in 2016. GM Korea posted a total of 1.9 trillion won ($1.8 billion) in net losses between 2014 and 2016.  The automaker\u2019s decisions to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe. Declining sales of small cars in the United States have also hurt demand for Korean-made Chevrolets.  HIGH LABOR COSTS, LOW OUTPUT  The first step in the South Korean restructuring plan is the closure of GM\u2019s plant in Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, which employs 2,000 out of GM\u2019s 16,000-strong South Korean workforce.  The factory was running at about 20 percent of its full production capacity last year, GM said.  South Korea's state-run development bank owns a 17 percent stake in GM Korea. The Detroit automaker owns 77 percent of the operations while GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS, controls 6.0 percent.","278":"BEIJING, April 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s vehicle sales in China fell 43.3% in the first three months this year compared with the same period last year, as the coronavirus pandemic hit the world\u2019s biggest auto market.  GM, China\u2019s second-biggest foreign automaker, delivered 461,716 vehicles in the country in the first quarter this year, the company said in a statement, after it reported a second straight decline in annual sales in 2019.","279":"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N said on Thursday it was gradually restarting the transmission and motor lines at its Mexican facilities in Silao and Ramos Arizpe, while U.S. auto parts maker Lear Corp LEA.N also geared up for production.

The steps to restart production are welcome news for the North American auto sector, with supply lines highly interconnected among the United States, Mexico and Canada.  Automotive factories in Mexico have been idled for weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected 59,567 people and killed 6,510 in Mexico so far.  GM staff returning to work in Mexico must use personal protective equipment at all times, keep a \u201csafe distance\u201d of 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) from each other, and have their temperatures checked when entering the plant, a message to workers showed.  The government said last week that Mexico\u2019s automotive industry could exit the coronavirus lockdown before June 1 if firms had approved safety measures in place.  Auto parts makers that are crucial to the supply chains are also taking steps to reopen, such as Lear Corp, whose clients include Ford Motor Co. F.N  Some employees at Lear\u2019s Rio Bravo plant in Ciudad Juarez on Mexico\u2019s northern border were told on Thursday to return to work on Friday for activities including safety training, according to a message seen by Reuters.  Four workers at the plant, which supplies car-seat trim covers for Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Mercedes-Benz and Ford's Mustangs and Explorers, said they were told to return on Friday.  Lear said all facilities in Mexico are currently closed, and that it is implementing health and safety protocols in preparation for reopening.  One of 42 sites Lear operates across Mexico, the Rio Bravo plant employs about 3,000 people and saw a coronavirus outbreak that killed 18 workers, the company has said.  Mexico\u2019s government issued guidelines on Monday for restarting operations in carmaking, mining and construction even as coronavirus deaths hit new highs.  \u201cThe reopening is happening as the pandemic is hitting the country hard,\u201d said Mauricio Usabiaga, economic development minister for Guanajuato, the state where Silao is located. \u201cWe have to be very careful, prudent and conscientious.\u201d","280":"MEXICO CITY, Oct 25 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will gradually restart operations at two of its plants in Mexico this coming weekend, after workers for the U.S. automaker ratified a new labor contract, the company\u2019s Mexican unit said in a statement on Friday.

Sales for the Spark slumped 36 percent to 22,589 units in the United States last year.  The production plan for the new crossover is dependent on support from the South Korean government and concessions for its local union, a GM Korea spokesman said. The new model is tapped for production in 2022.  General Motors had said in February it plans to shut down one of its factories in South Korea, and was rethinking the operational viability of three other plants in the country.  The move also comes as sales of GM\u2019s Opel brand in Europe might put a dent on the demand for Spark, which is being exported to Europe as Opel\u2019s Karl.  Opel earlier said it will shift production from South Korea to Europe and import nearly 200,000 less vehicles per year from South Korea by 2020.","283":"DETROIT\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co expects to spend more on developing and selling electric vehicles (EVs) than gasoline-powered cars over the next five years, Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Tuesday.  Barra was responding to a question from an analyst on the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s earnings conference call when she said she believed EVs would see more of the research and development and capital spending dollars in that time period.  She also said EVs will require \u201csomewhat less\u201d labor than gas-powered cars. The United Auto Workers union, which just ratified a new four-year labor deal with the Detroit automaker, has expressed concern about U.S. employment levels in the future as EVs make up a larger share of the market.  Barra emphasized gas-powered vehicles will make up a large portion of U.S. sales into the 2030s. She added that the company\u2019s engine and transmission plants will not be threatened and EVs will have needs for components as well.  Barra also said the new UAW labor deal does not limit how many EVs the company can build. GM plans to invest $3 billion in its Detroit-Hamtramck plant to build electric trucks and vans and battery modules, according to a letter it sent to the UAW this month as part of contract talks.  GM has been shifting more resources to EVs from gasoline-powered vehicles for more than a year. It restructured much of its engineering and white-collar workforce after it cut about 8,000 salaried jobs, or roughly 15% of its North American white-collar workforce.  Dan Nicholson, GM\u2019s vice president for global electrification, said in February at a national ethanol conference that at one point he led an 8,000-person global organization that was entirely focused on internal combustion engines and \u201cthen we moved to about a 70% ICE, 30% electrification split. Now are we are flipping that from 70% ICE to just 30% ICE and focusing 70% on electrification.\u201d","284":"DETROIT (Reuters) - The UAW and General Motors Co GM.N on Tuesday formally kicked off contract talks, with the union's president calling on the automaker to keep open plants it has slated for closure and to invest in its workforce after the union helped it through a government-led bankruptcy a decade ago.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  \u201cWe invested in you, now it\u2019s your turn to invest in us,\u201d United Auto Workers\u2019 President Gary Jones said at a joint event with GM executives in downtown Detroit.  This year\u2019s talks on a new four-year contract between the union and the Detroit automakers are expected to be contentious, as U.S. auto sales are slowing after a long boom.  Rising healthcare costs, job security and the use of temporary workers are also expected to be major sticking points.  GM in particular has been a target of union ire since announcing the closure of five North American plants late last year.  That move drew widespread condemnation, including from Republican U.S. President Donald Trump. Criticism has persisted despite GM\u2019s stated efforts to seek jobs at other plants for all displaced workers.  Workers from GM\u2019s Lordstown, Ohio, plant, wearing red shirts emblazoned with \u201cInvest in Lordstown,\u201d greeted UAW officials with applause as they arrived at the event on Tuesday.  GM is in talks to sell the Lordstown plant to electric vehicle startup Workhorse Group Inc WKHS.O and an affiliated, newly formed entity.  Workers in Lordstown built the Chevrolet Cruze, a sedan, sales of which had plummeted in the last few years as Americans abandoned passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable pickup trucks and SUVs.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in remarks before a formal handshake with Jones that the pace of change in the auto industry has intensified as automakers invest heavily in the race to develop electric vehicles and self-driving cars.  \u201cWe are not here just to survive ... we are here to win,\u201d Barra said. Winning \u201crepresents growth and that means jobs,\u201d she added.  The union and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MI also formally launched talks on Tuesday at the automaker's Auburn Hills, Michigan, headquarters. In opening remarks, the UAW's Jones called on FCA to allocate new products to under-utilized assembly plants.  The UAW and Ford Motor Co F.N officially launched negotiations on Monday, where Jones had struck a similarly adversarial tone, insisting that workers should share in automakers' profits and vowing to prevent their jobs being outsourced to Mexico or China.","285":"LIUZHOU, China\/BEIJING (Reuters) - By many measures, General Motors\u2019 China brand Baojun has been an exceptional success story, growing at breakneck speed by selling low-cost no-frills vehicles in smaller cities and rural areas.  Employees work on Baojun RS-5 cars at a final assembly plant operated by General Motors Co and its local joint-venture partners in Liuzhou, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, February 28, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  But as Chinese consumer tastes shift away from basic and affordable, Baojun is engineering a different image for itself - launching mid-market models that will sport a redesigned logo and be sold through new or revamped showrooms.  The move is aimed at ensuring Baojun has offerings in the 100,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan ($15,000-$22,300) range that holds the most potential for the brand, said Mike Devereux, executive vice president at SGMW, GM\u2019s venture with Chinese partners SAIC Motor Corp and Guangxi Automobile Group.  \u201cWhen you look at what might happen in terms of some of the shrinking segments, you are going to make sure you don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview.  The first model off the block is the RS-5 SUV, which went on sale last week.  More sleekly designed than other Baojun vehicles, it is the first to feature semi-autonomous driving technology and will be priced from 96,800 yuan to 132,800 yuan. By comparison the most expensive model under Baojun\u2019s old badge is priced from 85,800 yuan to 117,800 yuan.  Another three models will be rolled out this year, Devereux said, declining to provide further details on the cars.  GM executives and analysts see Baojun\u2019s move upmarket as a natural progression as the brand seeks to stay relevant to younger consumers.  It is also supported by a large existing customer base. Most of Baojun\u2019s sales are in smaller and less economically developed cities, but those were areas few Western automakers sought to target and the brand, which only got its start in 2011, rocketed to sales of almost 1 million in 2017.  Amid a slowing economy, sales slipped last year to around 840,000, accounting for 23 percent of GM vehicles sold in China.  For a graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs\/2X5Th9E  Slideshow ( 11 images )  Han Dehong, senior sales manager at SGMW, said the venture had been exploring a makeover of the Baojun brand since 2014 in tandem with a wide-ranging overhaul of its R&D, supply chain and distribution system.  \u201cYounger groups have become the main force of consumer spending in our society and we need to respond to this new younger wave with brand upgrades and revamped models,\u201d he said.  NEW SHOWROOMS, BIGGER CITIES  Compared to 10 years ago when there few models in the mid-market price range, competition has become fierce. Popular models include Toyota Motor Corp\u2019s Corolla and Volkswagen\u2019s Lavida. VW\u2019s newly launched Jetta brand, which like Baojun is a China-only brand, is expected to also be sold in the same range.  \u201cBaojun will need a competitive edge,\u201d said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, noting that Volkswagen is known for quality, Geely Automobile Holdings is known for design while Great Wall Motor vehicles offer roomy interiors.  To set itself apart, the revamped Baojun brand will emphasize self-driving technology and internet connectivity, GM officials said.  The new models will be sold in 365 new or refurbished showrooms, equivalent to 60 percent of Baojun stores across China. The brand will also strengthen its presence in bigger cities like Chengdu, Tianjin and Nanjin.  A new mobile phone app was also recently launched, allowing customers to arrange a test drive and buy the new models online.  GM officials declined to say how much the automaker had invested in the new models, the logo redesign and new stores.  The move upmarket for Baojun is partial as some cheaper models will still carry the old Baojun badge although others will be folded into the Wuling brand, - the other marque sold by SGMW, said Matt Tsien, GM\u2019s chief in China.  Tsien said GM had little concern that a more upmarket Baojun might eat into sales of GM\u2019s Chevrolet as Chinese customers interested in buying a Chevy tend not to be attracted to domestic brands.  Roughly equivalent vehicles would also be priced differently. Whereas the most expensive version of the RS-5 will cost 132,800 yuan, the Chevy Equinox SUV will start from 174,900 yuan.  \u201cNo matter how far you take Baojun, Baojun is still going to be domestic, it\u2019s going to focus on the local market here and it\u2019s going to still represent very good value for customers,\u201d said Tsien.","286":"DETROIT (Reuters) - As Lyft Inc cruises toward an initial public offering this month, one of the big winners will be General Motors Co, whose stake in the ride-hailing firm could be worth as much as $1.27 billion.  The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Roosevelt Cassio  GM is not talking about its plans for that investment, and investors polled by Reuters, owning a collective 35.7 million shares, do not have a consensus view.  Some believe the No. 1 U.S. automaker should hold on to it for strategic reasons, while others want the money returned to shareholders through buybacks or a special dividend.  \u201cUnless GM can leverage its investment in Lyft to accelerate its own robo-taxi ambitions with Cruise, we believe it would be appropriate to cash out its stake to repurchase its own under-valued shares,\u201d said Michael Razewski, a partner with Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which owned about 2.6 million GM shares at the end of 2018.  Cruise Automation is GM\u2019s self-driving car unit.  Lyft on Monday launched the investor \u201croadshow\u201d for the March 29 IPO, and it said it to sell Class A shares at $62 to $68 a share.  GM owns more than 18.6 million Class A shares, according to the Lyft filing, meaning its investment at the outset could be worth $1.16 billion to $1.27 billion. GM invested $500 million in Lyft in January 2016.  With a 180-day lock-up period during which GM cannot sell and the expected April IPO of larger rival Uber Technologies Inc further stoking interest in the ride-hailing sector, the value could subsequently rise.  GM spokesman Tom Henderson said the automaker is happy with its Lyft stake, but declined to discuss future plans for the shares. Lyft spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna had no comment.  Several shareholders would like to see GM sell the stake and use the proceeds to repurchase shares or pay a special dividend.  \u201cIf I want to buy Lyft, I\u2019ll go do it myself,\u201d said Scott Schermerhorn, managing principal with Granite Investment Advisors, which owns more than 210,000 GM shares. \u201cTake the proceeds and invest it in something that\u2019s core to their business or give it back to shareholders.\u201d  However, Jacques Elmaleh, portfolio manager with Steinberg Global Asset Management, with almost 24,000 GM shares at the end of 2018, said it is too early to write off the relationship.  \u201cI\u2019d be inclined that they hold onto it and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.  Some of GM\u2019s larger investors - the United Auto Workers retiree healthcare benefits trust, hedge fund manager David Einhorn and T. Rowe Price Group Inc - declined to comment. Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc did not respond to a request for comment.  GM\u2019s former president, Dan Ammann, joined Lyft\u2019s board as the companies eyed developing networks of self-driving cars together. However, there have been few signs of cooperation. Ammann - who now leads Cruise - left the Lyft board in June 2018.  Analysts have speculated GM will eventually sell shares in Cruise or spin it off, and the incentive plan disclosed last month for Ammann pointed toward a possible IPO.  Kyle Martin, analyst with Westwood Holdings, which owns more than 30,000 GM shares, would just as soon see GM sell the Lyft stake and use that money in Cruise.  \u201cThat\u2019s a meaningful amount of money that could certainly help them close the gap with Waymo and put them even further ahead of Ford,\u201d he said, referring to technology leader Alphabet\u2019s Waymo and GM rival Ford Motor Co.","287":"April 27 (Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s top executive, Mary Barra, was paid just under $22 million in 2017, slightly less than she received the previous year, according to the automaker\u2019s proxy statement released on Friday.

California and 22 other states and environmental groups challenged the Trump administration\u2019s determination that federal law bars California from setting stiff tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.  Barra was among corporate and labor leaders who met virtually last week with Biden.  Speaking on Monday, Barra said she was \u201cconfident that the Biden Administration, California, and the U.S. auto industry, which supports 10.3 million jobs, can collaboratively find the pathway that will deliver an all-electric future.\u201d  Biden said in a statement: \u201cGM\u2019s decision reinforces how shortsighted the Trump Administration\u2019s efforts to erode American ingenuity and America\u2019s defenses against the climate threat truly are.\u201d  The Trump administration in March finalized a rollback of fuel-efficiency standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026, well below the 5% yearly boosts in Obama administration rules it discarded.  Other automakers, such as Ford Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Volkswagen AG, which announced a deal with California in 2019 on emissions requirements that was finalized in August, did not intervene on the administration\u2019s side in the California fight.  GM\u2019s announcement on Monday that it was withdrawing from the lawsuit caught off-guard automakers that had joined with GM in backing Trump, as they only learned of the decision minutes before the company made it public.  Toyota said on Monday that \u201cgiven the changing circumstances, we are assessing the situation, but remain committed to our goal of a consistent, unitary set of fuel economy standards applicable in all 50 states.\u201d  Other automakers backing the Trump administration include Hyundai Motor Co , Mazda, Nissan Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Subaru Co.  GM had drawn the ire of many California officials and environmental groups.  Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign, said, \u201cGM tried to prevent California from protecting its people from tailpipe pollution. They were wrong. Now the other automakers must follow GM and withdraw support for (President Donald) Trump\u2019s attack on clean cars.\u201d  In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state planned to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035 in a bold move to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  California is the largest U.S. auto market, accounting for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales, and many states choose to adopt its green vehicle mandates.","291":"SEOUL (Reuters) - Korea Development Bank (KDB) may sign a preliminary agreement by April 27 to financially support General Motors Co's GM.N troubled South Korean unit, provided interim due-diligence on the unit is satisfactory, the chairman of the lender said.  An employee works at an assembly line of GM Korea's Bupyeong plant in Incheon, South Korea March 29, 2018. REUTERS\/Kim Hong-Ji  This is the first time KDB has offered a time-frame for a decision on whether to financially back GM Korea, in which the state-run lender has a 17 percent stake. The bank and government officials have so far been non-committal.  GM proposed in February an investment of $2.8 billion into its money-losing South Korean operations over 10 years, days after announcing a sweeping restructuring. It has asked Seoul to provide a share of the funds for the overhaul.  The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea, while GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS, controls the remaining 6 percent.  KDB may offer about 500 billion won ($468.42 million), proportional to its stake, to help fund GM\u2019s pledged investment in the unit, KDB Chairman and CEO Lee Dong-gull told Reuters.  GM\u2019s president told Reuters last week that common ground must be reached on a long-term restructuring of GM Korea by this Friday, and if there was none, the operation would likely seek bankruptcy protection.  GM shocked South Korea in February with plans to close one local plant and leaving the fate of three others unclear. It is seeking government funding and incentives as well as labor cost cuts to save the unit, which in 2017 posted a net loss of $1.1 billion, its fourth straight year in the red.  \u201cIf GM injects equity into the unit, we will inject equity. If GM extends loans to the unit, we will extend loans as well,\u201d Lee said, adding KDB prefers to take part in a rights offering rather than lending to the unit.  \u201cWe may be able to reach a very meaningful agreement by April 27, whether it is a verbal promise or conditional MOU,\u201d he said, referring to a memorandum of understanding.  KDB\u2019s interim due diligence report on GM Korea is scheduled to be out on Friday, but GM Korea has so far not submitted sufficient documents for South Korea to assess its financial viability, Lee added.  He said the bank would be able to sign a legally binding deal with the automaker after a final report is out in late April or early May.  \u201cWe are in continued discussions with the KDB and the government with intent to inject new funds and convert debt into equity,\u201d a GM Korea spokesman said.  LEGAL ACTION  Lee said KDB would have no choice but to consider taking \u201cappropriate legal action\u201d should the U.S. automaker opt to liquidate its unit without consulting the bank.  Lee said GM should offer a long-term commitment to South Korea to get government support.  He said many South Koreans believe GM may eventually leave South Korea when government subsidies dry up, as the U.S. automaker did in Australia and Europe.  \u201cThey have to show a commitment to remaining as a good corporate citizen,\u201d Lee said.  \u201cWhat GM really needs to know is that anti-GM sentiment is very strong in South Korea. I told GM that they need to make me feel comfortable before I can make some kind of decisions.\u201d  Lee had a series of meetings with Barry Engle, head of GM\u2019s international operations, who visited South Korea to discuss a restructuring plan with the government and the GM Korea union.  GM Korea was one of GM\u2019s major manufacturing and engineering bases in Asia after its 2002 purchase of failed South Korean car maker Daewoo Motors. But the unit has struggled in recent years since GM pulled its Chevy brand from Europe, hitting exports to GM Korea\u2019s major market.  \u201cThe mutual trust hit rock bottom. We have to enhance trust and this will not happen overnight,\u201d Lee said.  GM Korea and its union plan to hold another round of talks on a restructuring deal on Wednesday morning, a union spokesman said. \u201cWe are trying to resolve the problem with a dialogue.\u201d  On Tuesday, Hong Young-pyo, a ruling party lawmaker, met GM and union officials and called for the two sides to reach an agreement by April 20 to pave the way for government support.  \u201cThe time bomb is ticking,\u201d he told reporters.","292":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  TORONTO (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is planning to close all operations at a plant near Toronto and an announcement is expected on Monday, a local TV news channel reported on Sunday  Citing multiple sources, CTV News reported that the plant closure in Oshawa in the province of Ontario was expected to affect \u201cthousands\u201d of high-paying jobs.

Company executives are expected to make the case that the new EV - originally considered for one of GM\u2019s Chinese plants - is being built in the United States because of the new trade deal that is still awaiting approval by the U.S. Congress.  GM has come under harsh attacks from President Donald Trump over its decision to end production at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant.

Ford\u2019s first self-driving vehicles will be assembled nearby at an as-yet-undisclosed location.","294":"(Repeats to fix story link in paragraph 2)  Oct 25 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Friday its members ratified a new four-year labor contract with General Motors Co , ending the strike with the No. 1 U.S. automaker after 40 days.  The union, which wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers, said 57% of the members voted to approve the deal.  UAW officials and striking workers on the picket lines had said their focus in the dispute with GM was on jobs, pay equity and fairness for workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy. They also wanted to save factories in Ohio and Michigan GM had threatened to close.  This year\u2019s talks - also occurring with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  The following is a timeline of events leading up to the deal.  Nov. 26, 2018  GM announced the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s biggest restructuring since its 2009 bankruptcy, putting five North American plants on notice for potential closure and saying it would cut nearly 15,000 jobs.  The UAW, which represents U.S. workers at the four U.S. plants targeted, vowed to fight the cuts.  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that GM save the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that was targeted.  Nov. 27, 2018  Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants.  Dec. 5, 2018  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra warned the Detroit company had excess manufacturing capacity, and said the Lordstown plant\u2019s future would be determined during the 2019 labor talks.  Dec. 14, 2018  GM said more than 1,100 of the 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at plants losing production had volunteered to transfer to other plants. That number has risen since then to more than 2,300.  Jan. 3, 2019  The UAW sued GM in federal court, claiming its use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violated its labor deal.  Feb. 22, 2019  GM extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, instead of ending work in June as earlier planned. However, on March 6, the last Chevrolet Cruze small car rolled off the assembly line at the Lordstown plant.  Feb. 26, 2019  The UAW sued GM over its restructuring plan, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.  March 13, 2019  UAW President Gary Jones at the union\u2019s bargaining convention in Detroit said job security and stopping the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico were top priorities for the contract talks.  March 18, 2019  U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged Norwood Jewell, a former high-ranking UAW official in charge of labor relations with Fiat Chrysler, of misusing funds to pay for lavish parties for himself and other union officials. The following month, he pleaded guilty.  May 8, 2019  GM said it was in talks to sell the idled Lordstown plant to a cash-strapped electric vehicle startup, Workhorse Group Inc . GM also said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio plants. The UAW called on GM to put a new product of its own in the plant.  June 5, 2019  Barra defended GM\u2019s proposed sale of the Lordstown plant and said the automaker did not plan to add a new vehicle there.  July 16, 2019  GM and the UAW formally kicked off talks for a new four-year labor deal, with Jones calling on the automaker to keep open plants it had slated for shutdown.  Aug. 28, 2019  The FBI conducted searches at the home of Jones and other locations as part of a corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.  Sept. 3, 2019  The UAW said it would target GM first in talks with the Detroit automakers for contracts set to expire on Sept. 14.  Sept. 12, 2019  U.S. prosecutors\u2019 probe of alleged corruption within the UAW expanded with the arrest of a senior union official. In a criminal complaint released the following day, a source said Jones was one of the unnamed officials singled out.  Sept. 16, 2019  The UAW workers went on strike against GM. The automaker disclosed it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in new investments, solutions for the Lordstown and Detroit assembly plants that included a battery plant in Ohio and an electric vehicle for the Michigan plant, a pay increase and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  Sept. 17, 2019  GM shifted health insurance costs for the striking workers to the UAW, prompting an outcry from the union and Democratic politicians. On Sept. 26, GM reversed its decision.  Oct. 1, 2019  The UAW rejected a new offer from GM to end the strike. Five days later, UAW senior negotiator Terry Dittes said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and later called on GM to boost U.S. auto production.  Oct. 10, 2019  The union disclosed that GM\u2019s Barra met with the UAW\u2019s Jones and Dittes at the company\u2019s Detroit headquarters, seeking to speed up talks, as the strike neared its fourth week.  Oct. 11, 2019  GM took the unusual step of appealing directly to striking employees, circumventing UAW\u2019s leadership, in a blog post that laid out the terms of its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, upsetting the UAW in the process. The union accused GM of undermining the talks.  Oct. 15, 2019  The sides near a deal after Barra and GM President Mark Reuss join the bargaining table.  Oct. 16, 2019  The UAW and GM announce they reached a tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the members before the strike will officially end.  Oct. 17, 2019  The UAW released highlights of the tentative four-year deal, which includes pay raises, better coverage for temporary workers and other benefits, but also will allow the automaker to close three plants, including the idled car plant in Lordstown, Ohio.  Oct. 25, 2019  The UAW said 57% of its members voted to ratify the deal, ending the strike after 40 days.","295":"FILE PHOTO: The General Motors assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada November 26, 2018.

Asked about Trump\u2019s comments, Barra did not directly answer but said she understood the strong reaction in Washington.  \u201cI understand this is something that impacts the country and I understand that there is a lot of emotion and concern about it,\u201d Barra said.  GM said last week it would close five North American assembly plants next year and cut up to 15,000 jobs as it blames slow selling car sales for the need to restructure.  The CEO said GM planned to add other products at U.S. plants next year and that the automaker would have some jobs to fill at other Ohio facilities in 2019.  Slideshow ( 6 images )  She cast the decision as critical to keep GM competitive. In the interview, she said GM wanted to \u201cdo the right thing for our employees but also make sure General Motors is strong and lean in the future.\u201d  Senator Rob Portman said Barra made no promises about the future of the Lordstown plant in Ohio, where the soon-to-be-discontinued Chevrolet Cruze sedans are manufactured.  Barra said the plant\u2019s ultimate status will be determined during contract talks next year with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.  \u201cWe\u2019re not asking for charity.\u201d Portman said, adding the members are asking for a new product for the plant to build.  GM has come under harsh criticism from lawmakers and from President Donald Trump since Nov. 26, when the No. 1 U.S. automaker announced the biggest restructuring since its bankruptcy a decade ago.  Portman said he spoke to fellow Republican Trump on Wednesday about GM.  Barra is in Washington for meetings with lawmakers, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer as well as lawmakers from Ohio and Maryland. She was also expected to meet with lawmakers from Michigan on Thursday, among other meetings. After GM announced its plans, Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation.  Administration officials later said they wanted to end subsidies for electric cars in 2020 or 2021, affecting GM and other automakers.  Trump also said new auto tariffs were being studied, asserting, without evidence, that they could prevent job cuts such as those planned by GM.  The UAW has objected to GM\u2019s plan to end production in 2019 at four U.S. plants, saying it violates commitments made during contract talks in 2015. The union has asked GM to rescind the decision and resolve the fate of the plants in talks for a new labor contract next year.","306":"SEOUL, April 20 (Reuters) - General Motors\u2019 South Korean unit and its labour union failed to reach a wage deal, a spokesman of the unit said on Friday, after talks that sought to stave off a threat of bankruptcy for the loss-making unit.

FILE PHOTO: GM's planned Cruise AV driverless car features no steering wheel or pedals in a still image from video released January 12, 2018. General Motors\/Handout via REUTERS  Custom-designed vehicles could be owned or leased by individual customers, including those outside of large cities, and used in peer-to-peer car sharing applications, said Mike Abelson, GM\u2019s vice president of global strategy.  GM is \u201cthinking about several models\u201d to drive revenue from self-driving cars, according to Abelson, speaking at Citi\u2019s Car of the Future conference in New York.  Abelson, one of the key architects of GM\u2019s future transportation business, said self-driving cars used for ride sharing \u201care going to evolve quickly into purpose-built vehicles\u201d that do not look like conventional cars.  While GM initially is using specially modified versions of the Chevrolet Bolt EV for its robotaxi fleet in 2019, the U.S. automaker\u2019s next wave of driverless vehicles will do away with the steering wheel and pedals, and could feature different seating arrangements.  The design of the vehicles would be continually adjusted to provide customers with \u201ca more appealing experience,\u201d he said.  Others have speculated that hoods could shorten, while passengers sit under a glass bubble.  Early leaders in deploying self-driving cars, such as GM and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo, \"will have the opportunity to take a lead in new business models that will drive their companies' profitability,\" said John Hoffecker, vice chairman of consultants AlixPartners.  Abelson said GM believes personally owned self-driving vehicles \u201cwill be a big business in the future,\u201d especially in sparsely populated rural areas where ride sharing may not reach for years.  GM\u2019s commercial ride sharing business is expected to drive down the cost of self-driving cars in the future, Abelson said.  Affordability is seen as the biggest challenge in extending ownership of self-driving cars to individuals. But they might elect to put their vehicles into a peer-to-peer sharing service, such as those proposed by Tesla Inc TSLA.O and GM, and share revenue with the companies that operate those services.  Hoffecker said costs are \u201cgoing down dramatically,\u201d to the point where individuals should be able to buy self-driving cars by 2023-25.","308":"FILE PHOTO: The General Motors Co. headquarters is seen in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2019.

It sold one of its two factories in the country to China\u2019s SAIC Motor Corp and continued to build vehicles for export at its second plant until Dec. 24.  In January 2020, it agreed to sell its second factory in the state\u2019s Talegaon district to Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co, but tensions between India and China have delayed completion of that deal.  GM said it planned to seek a reversal of the state\u2019s order as soon as possible.  \u201cEffectively, the state\u2019s decision amounts to a requirement that GM either produce vehicles for which there are no customer orders, or pay workers indefinitely for doing no work.

An undated handout photo from General Motors shows one of its six new different types of electric vehicles that can accommodate the automaker's flexible battery pack. General Motors\/Handout via REUTERS  The two biggest U.S. automakers will make more than 5 million SUVs and pickup trucks in 2026, but only about 320,000 electric vehicles, according to detailed production plans for North America seen by Reuters.  That will be about 5% of their combined vehicle production in North America, but less than Tesla Inc TSLA.O, the world leader in electric vehicles, produced last year.  The plans show that Detroit\u2019s Big Two are betting their short-term future on satisfying America\u2019s demand for bigger, petroleum-fueled vehicles which they can sell at a higher profit margin than mostly smaller, expensive-to-develop electric vehicles.  Large SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than midsize cars, meaning the plans will most likely wipe out any gains in overall fuel efficiency or reduction in auto emissions that were targeted over the next six years, according to industry experts.  The recent collapse of oil prices - pointing toward cheap gas for the foreseeable future - and a dip in demand caused by the coronavirus may only serve to strengthen automakers\u2019 commitment to the strategy.  Detroit has tried to latch onto the consumer and investor excitement over electric vehicles made by Tesla, whose market value is double that of GM and Ford combined, even though its sales are much smaller.

The data has not previously been reported.  Graphic Greener vehicles: how soon?  AutoForecast\u2019s data is based on planning information provided to suppliers by the automakers, and is widely used across the industry. GM and Ford executives interviewed by Reuters did not dispute the accuracy of the data.  \u201cGM and Ford understand that buyers want more SUVs and trucks, but they\u2019re also trying to play to Wall Street, which thinks the future is all about electric vehicles,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president, global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast. \u201cThe Detroit automakers would love to get a little of that Tesla magic and money.\u201d  \u2018DON\u2019T VIOLATE THE LAWS OF ECONOMICS\u2019  Internal production plans from other industry sources seen by Reuters support AutoForecast\u2019s numbers, which show GM and Ford expect to produce about 320,000 pure electric vehicles - powered solely by a battery - in North America in 2026. That is nearly 10 times the 35,000 they have planned to build in 2020, but fewer than the 367,500 Tesla delivered last year.  It is only a fraction of the 5.2 million SUVs and pickups that GM and Ford expect to make in North America in 2026, according to the AutoForecast data, up 14% from 4.6 million SUVs and pickups in 2019. SUVs and pickups will account for about 87% of vehicles made by GM and Ford in the region in 2026, compared with about 82% last year.

Read a summary of GM and Ford\u2019s electric-vehicle plans here.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  CHEAP GAS, BIGGER TRUCKS  The long-term battle between electrons and petroleum to be the primary energy source for future transportation took an unexpected turn with a crash in oil this month that sent fuel-pump prices to 20-year lows, with no signs of rising, making the cost of running internal combustion vehicles even more attractive to buyers.  The spread of the coronavirus will put more financial pressure on automakers, according to analysts, limiting their capacity to develop and build money-losing vehicles. A global recession triggered by the epidemic \u201ccould add strain to balance sheets and ability to fund aggressive technology shifts,\u201d said Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas.  In such an environment, automakers are not looking to depart from their winning formula.  They make more profit on each luxury SUV - such as GM\u2019s $80,000 Cadillac Escalade or Ford\u2019s $76,000 Lincoln Navigator - than they do on a dozen compact cars, according to analysts.  Because of that, automakers are replacing compact sedans with small SUVs that share many of the car\u2019s mechanical parts, but sell for more. Ford discontinued the Focus compact sedan in the United States, which gets 31 miles per gallon of gas. Ford customers who want a similar-sized vehicle now can buy a 26 miles-per-gallon Ford Escape compact SUV, whose starting price is $6,000 higher.  That may be good for automakers\u2019 finances, but probably not for the environment.  SUVs and pickups burn more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than comparable sedans, and those with larger \u201cfootprints,\u201d - the area between the points where the wheels touch the ground - are subject to looser emissions standards.  Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to roll back tougher fuel economy and emissions standards proposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, removing an incentive for automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles.  That all indicates that any overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions enabled by new electric vehicles will be largely, or entirely, offset by the continued substitution of gasoline-fueled SUVs for cars, experts say.  The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of this outcome in October, in a report that showed growing demand for SUVs across the world was the second-largest contributor to the increase in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2010 to 2018.  \u201cIf consumers\u2019 appetite for SUVs continues to grow at a similar pace seen in the last decade, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars,\u201d said the IEA report. The IEA declined to comment on this story.  The Obama White House predicted that doubling average car and truck fuel efficiency from 2011 to 2025 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion tons. That does not look likely to happen.  Trump\u2019s White House is planning to follow through on its plan to roll back the Obama rules by the end of March, administration officials have told Reuters.  The Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates U.S. auto emissions, did not respond to a request for comment.","317":"WARREN, Mich (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T will invest $2.75 billion and take a 5.7 percent stake in General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise self-driving vehicle unit, to jointly develop autonomous vehicles for deployment in ride services fleets around the world.

The deal calls for Honda to provide engineering expertise, and extends cooperation between the pair in a technology that has enormous costs and risk but no market-ready products.  Other global automakers are forging similar alliances to share the uncertainty and huge price of developing technologies that have yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance.  Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and SoftBank said on Thursday they were teaming up to develop car services that rely on self-driving technology.  In May, SoftBank said it would buy stakes in Cruise totaling 19.6 percent for $2.25 billion.

GM acquired the San Francisco-based startup in March 2016 for a reported $1 billion.  By comparison, analysts have pegged the value of Waymo as high as $175 billion.  In a media briefing on Wednesday, GM President Dan Ammann said 2019 \u201cremains the goal\u201d for GM Cruise to launch a self-driving ride services fleet.  He added: \u201cThe longstanding relationship we have with Honda will allow us to move very quickly in ramping up our efforts.\u201d  GM shares closed up 2 percent on Wednesday. Honda shares were little changed on Thursday.  In January, GM filed a petition seeking U.S. approval for a fully self-driving car, one without a steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal, to enter the automaker\u2019s first commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019.  Ammann declined on Wednesday to provide a more specific timeline for the vehicle.  GM has been \u201cvery selective\u201d in its approach to investors in Cruise and \u201cwe will evaluate other investment opportunities as they come along\u201d, he said.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Ammann later told analysts: \u201cWe\u2019re moving as quickly as we can to get to the point where we can initially deploy the technology and then scale it ... This is an effort that requires very, very significant resources to pull off.\u201d  Ammann said Honda will contribute its engineering know-how and will help GM Cruise build a global ride services business.  Honda executive Seiji Kuraishi said: \u201cThis investment is based on a shared vision and their (GM\u2019s and Cruise\u2019s) superior technologies in this area.\u201d  GM Cruise has a test fleet of more than 100 self-driving versions of the Chevrolet Bolt, rebadged as Cruise AV.  GM CEO Mary Barra said the automaker is still focused on testing self-driving vehicles in San Francisco before expanding to other markets.  RUSH FOR TIE-UPS  GM Cruise and Waymo are often described as leading the pack of technology and auto companies competing to create self-driving cars and integrate them into ride services fleets.  Waymo has agreements with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI and Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL] to buy and equip tens of thousands of vehicles with its self-driving systems.  Other automakers are exploring similar tie-ups to help mitigate risk and cost, according to Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs, who said the GM-Honda deal \u201cdemonstrates that global partnerships like these ... are necessary to take on these expensive ventures that likely will not return a profit in the near term.\u201d  BMW BMWG.DE, which has a development partnership with suppliers Intel Corp INTC.O, Aptiv PLC APTV.N and Magna International MG.TO, expects some rivals and ride services companies to join its consortium for developing self-driving cars as auto industry profits come under increasing pressure, board member Klaus Froehlich said on Tuesday.  At the Paris Auto Show on Wednesday, the heads of Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and Renault RENA.PA said the two companies may expand their cooperation to batteries, self-driving vehicles and mobility services.  The GM-Honda announcement extends a partnership that includes joint development of electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020. In June, Honda also said it would buy advanced batteries from GM in a move that could significantly reduce the cost of future electric vehicles at both automakers after 2020.","318":"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Great Wall Motor 601633.SS has agreed to buy General Motors' (GM) GM.N car plant in India, the companies said on Friday, as the Chinese automaker expands overseas amid slowing domestic demand.

Great Wall, one of the biggest sellers of sports-utility vehicles (SUV) in China, plans to enter India with its Haval and electric vehicle brands and will announce detailed plans at the Delhi auto show in February, Liu said in the statement.  Chinese automakers are accelerating plans to build cars in India to combat slowing sales at home and have been encouraged by the initial success of rival SAIC Motor 600104.SS in the country, sources have told Reuters.  Although car sales in India are also stuttering, the market is expected to become the world\u2019s third biggest by 2026, behind China and the United States, according to consultancy LMC Automotive.  However, Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI, Ford Motor F.N and GM are scaling back in India after battling it out in one of the world's most competitive markets, which is dominated by smaller, low-cost cars made by Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS and Hyundai Motor 005380.KS.  GM, which stopped selling cars in India at the end of 2017, has already sold its other plant to SAIC, where the Chinese automaker builds cars under its British brand, MG Motor.  Although the American automaker continued to build small cars for export at its plant in Talegaon in Maharashtra state, it has been exploring strategic options for the site, Julian Blissett, senior vice president, GM International Operations said in the statement.  \u201cOur decision to cease production at Talegaon is based on GM\u2019s global strategy and optimization of our manufacturing footprint around the world,\u201d Blissett said, adding that the company will provide support to employees affected by the decision.  Great Wall is expected to upgrade and modify GM\u2019s plant to suit its needs and set up a base for its suppliers, said one of the sources, adding that the automaker expects to begin production within a year.  The plant is expected to have an annual production capacity of about 150,000-160,000 vehicles, the source said.","319":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N persuaded the U.S. federal judge who oversees nationwide litigation over defective ignition switches to narrow claims by owners who said their vehicles lost value because of the defect, which has been linked to 124 deaths.

He said the owners\u2019 failure to show the fair market value of their vehicles, despite testimony from an expert witness, created an \u201cabsence of evidence on an essential element\u201d of their claims, making it impossible for a jury to assess damages.  The Manhattan-based judge also said that while damages could be measured by costs to repair defective vehicles, they could end up being zero if GM footed the bill.  GM spokesman David Caldwell said the Detroit-based automaker was pleased with the decision, saying it dismissed the owners\u2019 largest remaining claim.  Furman\u2019s 44-page decision is a defeat for owners who said they suffered economic losses from buying vehicles they thought were defect-free, only to see the ignition switch problem hurt GM\u2019s brand, reputation and ultimately resale values.

Like rivals Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, GM is banking on highly profitable pickup trucks to boost margins, as U.S. consumers abandon traditional passenger cars in favor of larger, more comfortable trucks, SUVs and crossovers.  \u201cWe believe the stock will be under pressure today given,\u201d GM\u2019s lower pre-tax profit and a \u201csignificant cash burn\u201d during the first quarter,\u201d Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note.  Executives said GM will reduce spending on traditional sedans in North America, while introducing new low-cost passenger cars next year in China and South America.  During the first quarter, the process of retooling assembly plants to make GM\u2019s new pickup trucks resulted in a drop in production of 47,000 units. GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said the production drop had reduced pre-tax profit by up to $800 million.  Earlier this year, GM said 2018 profits would be flat versus 2017, but its all-new pickup trucks would boost margins later this year and in 2019. On Thursday, GM reiterated its full-year 2018 forecast for adjusted earnings in a range from $6.30 to $6.60 per share.  The automaker said first-quarter capital expenditures were more than $500 million higher because of investments in the pickup trucks and a family of low-cost compact vehicles under development with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS.  The new GEM (Global Emerging Markets) vehicles, which include sedans and crossovers, will launch in 2019 in China and South America, with annual production ramping up to 2 million by late 2021, Stevens said.

GM executives have said in the past that matching Tesla\u2019s use of over-the-air updates would require new vehicle electrical systems, and robust cybersecurity to assure that vehicles could not be tampered with by hackers.  GM did not specify what vehicle systems and features would be open to over-the-air updates, but said the new system \u201cenables the adoption of functionality upgrades throughout the lifespan of the vehicle.\u201d  In 2016, GM President Mark Reuss, who at that time was head of global product development, said the company would not use over-the-air updates for safety-critical systems such as brakes.

This year\u2019s talks between the union and GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) were always going to be tough, with thorny issues such as healthcare costs and profit-sharing on the table at a time when sales of U.S. new vehicles are declining.  Normally when the four-year contracts with Detroit\u2019s automakers expire, the question is will contract talks be extended or will union workers go out on strike?  This time things are more complicated.  Over the last two weeks, the longstanding federal investigation into corruption at the union has raised questions about UAW president Gary Jones, who a source said was an unnamed official mentioned in a searing federal complaint this week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.  The union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.  The spreading probe raises fresh questions about the union\u2019s options and its leaders\u2019 standing with rank-and-file members. Last month, more than 96% of GM\u2019s hourly workers voted to authorize a strike if necessary, meaning if no deal is reached Jones could call for a walkout without further approval.  GM\u2019s workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.  But the recent strike authorization vote was held before the dramatic events of the last few weeks, which included a late August FBI raid on Jones\u2019s home and other locations as part of the corruption probe.  Sources briefed on the matter this week said GM may seek a temporary extension of the contract and pursue other options including seeking assistance from a third party. While the UAW has not granted that to GM, it has extended the deadline indefinitely with Ford and FCA.  It was not clear if the talks will continue with the current UAW president under investigation, the sources said.  Elected in 2018, Jones was chosen as an outsider with a clean slate because he ran the union\u2019s Region 5 - which includes 17 western and southwestern U.S. states far from the epicenter of scandal in Detroit.  But the federal complaint this week against Vance Pearson, Jones\u2019 former second in command and successor as head of Region 5, listed lavish parties and spending by union leaders in that region, including \u201cUAW Official A.\u201d  Sources have confirmed that Jones is Official A. According to the complaint, agents seized $30,000 in cash from Official A\u2019s residence.

Reuss did not elaborate on what would happen if the multi-year effort to make the Cadillac brand more profitable failed.  But GM has demonstrated repeatedly over the last two years a willingness to exit unprofitable markets and kill weak car lines in North America. In November it put five North American factories, including four in the United States, on notice for closure and cut almost 15,000 jobs.

Appointed in 2014, he outlined bold plans to reshape Cadillac\u2019s lineup with a $12 billion product program.  He moved Cadillac\u2019s headquarters to New York in 2015, saying the brand\u2019s executives should be closer to the urban customers who had for years shunned it.  In a belated bid to catch up with rapidly shifting U.S. consumer preferences, Cadillac said in 2017 it would shrink its lineup of sedans and add sport utility vehicles and hybrid and electric vehicles.  Cadillac U.S. sales fell more than 1 percent in 2018.  Late Sunday GM unveiled its new 2020 Cadillac XT6 SUV that goes on sale later this year and will be built in Spring Hill, Tennessee.  GM said in 2017 it planned by 2021 to introduce a new dedicated flexible electric vehicle architecture and an advanced battery system to support the development of at least 20 new models in the United States and China. Much of Cadillac\u2019s future growth is expected to come from China, the world\u2019s largest car market.  Reuss said \u201cone of the first\u201d fully electric Cadillac models using the new platform would be on the market around 2022.

Supplier sources said previous plans to make the Cadillac brand all electric by 2030 are being sped up, possibly to 2025, and other sources said that acceleration will be repeated in other brands and in segments such as commercial vans.  Asked about the Thursday appearance, a GM spokeswoman called talk of increased spending speculative and declined to give details.  The Detroit automaker is also expected to discuss a new timeline for many of the EVs to follow those already identified, such as the GMC Hummer EV pick-up and Cadillac Lyriq crossover, people familiar with the plans said.  Lyriq is slated to go into production in late 2022, but GM officials have been stung by criticism the automaker was bringing the vehicle to market too late, one source said.  \u201cThe pull-ahead in programs is real and the organization is really doubling down on speeding up product development,\u201d the source said.

GM\u2019s plants in Brazil have been shuttered since March 23. On March 30 the company put its workers on furlough, but kept their pay intact as it made employees use up vacation days.  But as the pandemic has worsened globally and holiday allotments have dried up, GM has had to look for more drastic measures in South America\u2019s top auto producer. Now its factories in Brazil, where for several years Chevrolet has been the country\u2019s best selling brand, will be shut down at least until mid June.  The timeline puts Brazil behind the schedules set by automakers in Europe, where companies have said they might begin building vehicles by the end of this month. In The United States, automakers including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI and Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T are hoping to restart production in early May.  To be sure, GM has not set reopening start dates elsewhere in the world.  Brazil has more coronavirus cases than any country in Latin America and its right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has been criticized for minimizing the severity of the disease.  GM said all its Brazilian workers except for one have agreed to the shutdown and for a plan to cut salaries by up to 25%. The remaining union, based in Sao Jose dos Campos in Sao Paulo state, will finish voting on the proposal on Thursday night.  If the crisis does not allow workers to resume auto production within 60 days, GM may extend the shutdown to 90 days, according to a document shared with workers and seen by Reuters.","332":"DETROIT\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. automakers General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N said on Friday they will have most of their white-collar workforce working remotely as of Monday to protect against the spread of the coronavirus.

REUTERS\/Francois Lenoir  Fears over the spread of the virus led hourly employees at Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N minivan assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, to stop working for a time, a spokeswoman said.  The FCA workers had been concerned about possible exposure to the virus through secondary contact, but were convinced there was no risk and they returned to work Friday afternoon after about 24 hours, a spokeswoman said.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told employees on Friday the No. 1 automaker is asking all employees and contract workers to work remotely, noting the company has faced crises before.  \u201cFor many of us, it\u2019s our first experience of this type. But disruption and trying circumstances are not new to us,\u201d she said in an email.  Barra said the remote-work policy applied globally apart from China, which has existing protocols in place. \u201cOur IT tools and systems have been extensively stress-tested; it\u2019s vital that we leverage them to continue delivering,\u201d she said.  Ford will shift most of its global white-collar workforce outside China, where recovery has begun, to working remotely, CEO James Hackett said in an email to employees.  \u201cIn recent days ... we\u2019ve concluded the coronavirus issue has taken on a different dimension \u2013 and we need to be proactive to keep our people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work,\u201d he said.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also is accelerating its deployment of remote work for white-collar employees beyond the most affected countries of China, South Korea, Japan and Italy, CEO Mike Manley said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters on Friday.  Ford\u2019s Hackett told employees that in the event a worker tests positive for the virus they will be told to get medical attention and self quarantine at home. Ford will identify others who may have been in contact with that person and instruct them to seek medical attention and self quarantine for 14 days.  He added Ford will close any facility exposed to a confirmed case, and a spokeswoman confirmed that includes manufacturing plants.  However, Ford has seen \u201climited\u201d impact to its global operations due to the epidemic, with some employees testing positive for the virus in China and Germany but none so far in the United States, spokesman Mark Truby said.  The No. 2 U.S. automaker has not lost any vehicle production outside of China and it is taking steps to keep its plants operating, he said. However, some parts of the U.S. market have seen customer traffic at dealers hurt by the outbreak, he added.  On Thursday, FCA said an employee at its Indiana transmission plant had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but he was being treated and the plant was still operating while anyone exposed to that worker was quarantined.  Manley said in the letter to employees on Thursday that FCA is focused on worker safety and keeping its plants running.  \u201cClearly, we are now moving beyond regional hotspots and into planning for how this will impact every area of our business across the world,\u201d he said.  Changes include allowing for greater space between employees at several plants, and stepping up cleaning and availability of face masks, Manley said.  FCA said this week it was temporarily halting operations at some Italian plants and would reduce production rates in response to the outbreak.","333":"WASHINGTON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to announce on Wednesday that it has tapped a former Trump administration economic and trade adviser to head its public policy efforts, a person briefed on the matter said.

REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\/File Photo  Navistar is one of several companies globally, including Tesla Inc, Nikola Corp, Daimler AG and Hyundai Motor Co that are developing zero-carbon long-haul trucks. Moves by regulators to phase out internal combustion engines have energized a race to develop commercial vehicles powered by either batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.  Navistar said it plans to offer its International RH Series fuel-cell truck - powered by GM fuel cells - in model year 2024. The target driving range is more than 500 miles, with a hydrogen fueling time of less than 15 minutes. Financial terms were not disclosed.  Hydrogen fuel company OneH2, in which Navistar will take a undisclosed minority stake, will supply a fueling solution and incorporate more than 2,000 of the trucks into existing customer fleets. In addition, J.B. Hunt Transport Services will be the first customer to use the truck.  \u201cHydrogen fuel cells offer great promise for heavy-duty trucks in applications requiring a higher density of energy, fast refueling and additional range,\u201d Navistar Chief Executive Persio Lisboa said.  Hydrogen backers say it is cleaner than other carbon-cutting technologies because water and heat are the only byproducts and it can be made from numerous sources, including methane, coal, water, and even garbage. Fuel cell vehicles remain a niche technology, as there are not many fueling stations and potential customers also worry about resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions.  For long-haul transport, proponents say hydrogen-powered trucks have an advantage over electric rivals as they have a greater range and require less time to charge. But they are expensive so their uptake and mass production has been slow.  Last November, Illinois-based Navistar and engine maker Cummins said they would work together on a fuel-cell Class 8 truck. Navistar is also developing battery electric trucks.  Also that month, Volkswagen AG\u2019s truck unit Traton SE agreed to pay $3.7 billion for the outstanding shares of Navistar it doesn\u2019t already own. That deal is expected to close in mid-2021.  Wednesday\u2019s deal comes less than two months after GM announced a non-binding agreement to supply fuel cells to startup Nikola. GM said that deal is not affected by the Navistar agreement.  Under its agreement with Nikola, which must be finalized by year end, GM will supply its fuel-cell system for Nikola\u2019s Class 7 and 8 commercial semi-trucks  Nikola expects to begin testing prototypes of its fuel-cell trucks by year end, and will break ground on its first commercial hydrogen station in the second quarter.  Nikola has also said it will launch its Tre electric semi-truck with CNH Industrial in the fourth quarter.  Korea\u2019s Hyundai in December said it was launching a brand dedicated to its hydrogen fuel-cell system, and last year delivered its first H2 Xcient fuel-cell trucks to customers.  Japan\u2019s Toyota has said a demonstration version off its heavy-duty fuel-cell truck, developed with subsidiary Hino Motor Co, would be ready in the first half of 2021.  Germany\u2019s Daimler last June established a separate fuel-cell business unit, and previously announced a team-up with Volvo Trucks to develop fuel-cell systems for heavy-duty vehicles.

On Monday, Trump inspected a prototype Lordstown Motors pickup outside the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible piece of science, technology. It\u2019s going to happen now with more and more trucks,\u201d Trump said.  The unscheduled event came on the eve of the first presidential debate, scheduled for Cleveland, about 60 miles from Lordstown.

Three-cylinder gasoline engines are cleaner and more fuel efficient than their conventional four-cylinder counterparts, and automakers are keen to promote them, particularly in China which has some of the world\u2019s most stringent fuel economy and emission rules.  GM went further than competitors, discontinuing four-cylinder versions for many models in the world\u2019s largest auto market. By comparison, Honda Motor Co and BMW also offer three-cylinder cars in China but the models are an option in addition to four-cylinder versions.  Many Chinese consumers, however, perceive cars with three-cylinder engines as noisier and prone to vibrating, and sales began to tumble in third quarter of 2018. Last year, GM\u2019s China sales fell 15% to 3.09 million vehicles, its second straight year of steep declines and the lowest level since 2012.  The move was \u201ctoo quick, too radical and lacked sophisticated planning,\u201d a senior Shanghai-based sales manager at a Buick dealership told Reuters.  The sales manager, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified, said his company was among hundreds of dealers which lobbied GM to change the plan at dealer conferences.  By resurrecting four-cylinder options for key models, the hope is that GM, which reports fourth-quarter earnings later on Wednesday, can regain some of the ground it has lost at a time when the new coronavirus is threatening to sink sales in the first quarter.  The outbreak is only adding to pain caused by to a slowing economy, U.S.-China trade tensions, new emission rules as well as fierce competition from Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG.

UAW officials and striking workers on the picket lines had said their focus in the dispute with GM was on jobs, pay equity and fairness for workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy. They also wanted to save factories in Ohio and Michigan GM had threatened to close.  This year\u2019s talks - also occurring with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  The following is a timeline of events leading up to the tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the workers:  Nov. 26, 2018  GM announced the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s biggest restructuring since its 2009 bankruptcy, putting five North American plants on notice for potential closure and saying it would cut nearly 15,000 jobs.  The UAW, which represents U.S. workers at the four U.S. plants targeted, vowed to fight the cuts.  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that GM save the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that was targeted.  Nov. 27, 2018  Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants.  Dec. 5, 2018  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra warned the Detroit company had excess manufacturing capacity, and said the Lordstown plant\u2019s future would be determined during the 2019 labor talks.  Dec. 14, 2018  GM said more than 1,100 of the 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at plants losing production had volunteered to transfer to other plants. That number has risen since then to more than 2,300.  Jan. 3, 2019  The UAW sued GM in federal court, claiming its use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violated its labor deal.  Feb. 22, 2019  GM extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, instead of ending work in June as earlier planned. However, on March 6, the last Chevrolet Cruze small car rolled off the assembly line at the Lordstown plant.  Feb. 26, 2019  The UAW sued GM over its restructuring plan, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.  March 13, 2019  UAW President Gary Jones at the union\u2019s bargaining convention in Detroit said job security and stopping the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico were top priorities for the contract talks.  March 18, 2019  U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged Norwood Jewell, a former high-ranking UAW official in charge of labor relations with Fiat Chrysler, of misusing funds to pay for lavish parties for himself and other union officials. The following month, he pleaded guilty.  May 8, 2019  GM said it was in talks to sell the idled Lordstown plant to a cash-strapped electric vehicle startup, Workhorse Group Inc . GM also said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio plants. The UAW called on GM to put a new product of its own in the plant.  June 5, 2019  Barra defended GM\u2019s proposed sale of the Lordstown plant and said the automaker did not plan to add a new vehicle there.  July 16, 2019  GM and the UAW formally kicked off talks for a new four-year labor deal, with Jones calling on the automaker to keep open plants it had slated for shutdown.  Aug. 28, 2019  The FBI conducted searches at the home of Jones and other locations as part of a corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.  Sept. 3, 2019  The UAW said it would target GM first in talks with the Detroit automakers for contracts set to expire on Sept. 14.  Sept. 12, 2019  U.S. prosecutors\u2019 probe of alleged corruption within the UAW expanded with the arrest of a senior union official. In a criminal complaint released the following day, a source said Jones was one of the unnamed officials singled out.  Sept. 16, 2019  The UAW workers went on strike against GM. The automaker disclosed it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in new investments, solutions for the Lordstown and Detroit assembly plants that included a battery plant in Ohio and an electric vehicle for the Michigan plant, a pay increase and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  Sept. 17, 2019  GM shifted health insurance costs for the striking workers to the UAW, prompting an outcry from the union and Democratic politicians. On Sept. 26, GM reversed its decision.

GM says a nationwide program modeled on California\u2019s effort could result in 7 million electric vehicles, or EVs, on U.S. roads by 2030. The largest U.S. automaker said the requirements would not apply if \u201cbattery cost or infrastructure targets are not practicable within the time frame.\u201d  GM product chief Mark Reuss told reporters that governments and industries in Asia and Europe \u201care working together to enact policies now to hasten the shift to an all-electric future. It\u2019s very simple: America has the opportunity to lead in the technologies of the future.\u201d  A national mandate also would create jobs and reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and \u201cmake EVs more affordable,\u201d Reuss added. GM also wants the program to offer incentives for electric autonomous and ride-sharing vehicles.  GM has said it plans to offer 20 EVs globally by 2023.  The Trump administration in August proposed reversing Obama administration fuel rules and freezing standards at 2020 model year levels through 2026.  The administration has proposed barring California from setting its own emissions requirements or requiring more zero emission vehicles. The administration is also considering eliminating all emissions compliance credits that automakers receive for building EVs.  Other automakers, including Tesla Inc, did not comment on GM\u2019s proposal. The Trump administration and California officials did not immediately comment but one environmental group called the GM proposal \u201ca distraction.\u201d  Luke Tonachel, director of clean vehicles and fuels at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said automakers should focus on maintaining the Obama era rules that call for hiking fuel efficiency requirements at about 5 percent annually through 2026.  Automakers and others have until Friday to file comments on the administration\u2019s proposed emissions revisions. Major automakers say they do not support freezing requirements.  California wants 15.4 percent of vehicle sales by 2025 to be EVs or other zero emission vehicles. Nine other states, including Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, have adopted those requirements. In January, California Governor Jerry Brown set a target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles in California by 2030.  A nationwide ZEV plan would give automakers more flexibility to meet a single nationwide target, rather than specific state sales requirements, GM said.  California Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols said last month the state will \u201ccontinue to insist on cars that produce fewer emissions, including millions more zero-emission vehicles.\u201d  The Trump administration criticizes California\u2019s ZEV mandate, saying it requires automakers to spend tens of billions of dollars developing vehicles that most consumers do not want, only to sell them at a loss.","348":"WASHINGTON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that General Motors Co and the United Auto Workers union should \u201cget together and make a deal.\u201d Trump tweeted about five hours before the union is set launch its first nationwide strike at GM in 12 years.

A \"UAW On Strike\" sign is seen during a rally outside the shuttered General Motors Lordstown Assembly plant during the United Auto Workers national strike in Lordstown, Ohio, U.S. September 20, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  \u201cYou can\u2019t support a plant like this making batteries. We need a new vehicle allocated to us,\u201d said Nero, 62, who has worked at five plants over 42 years with the No. 1 U.S. automaker.  \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t even cover 10% of the facility or hire 10% of the people, and they wouldn\u2019t pay enough to support yourself, let alone a family,\u201d he said.  The United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which went on strike last week, agrees.  The sprawling Lordstown plant at one time employed more than 4,500 workers. GM\u2019s decision to close it and three other U.S. facilities due to sagging U.S. passenger car sales has drawn widespread criticism, including from President Donald Trump. Ohio is a crucial swing state in the 2020 presidential election.  The closure is part of the reason for the UAW strike, to demand that GM build another vehicle there. The union also wants GM to reduce the use of temporary workers and share more of its profits, a decade after the union helped the company through a government-led bankruptcy.  Visiting nearby Youngstown soon after becoming president in 2017, Trump told workers that factory jobs would not leave, advising them: \u201cDon\u2019t move, don\u2019t sell your house.\u201d Since GM\u2019s announcement, Trump has urged the Detroit company to move vehicle production back to the United States from Mexico.  As part of contract talks with the UAW, GM has suggested the Lordstown facility could be converted to an electric vehicle (EV) battery plant. Separately, it says it is also negotiating to sell the plant to a group affiliated with EV start-up Workhorse Group Inc WKHS.O.  A source familiar with GM\u2019s plans said if the sale goes ahead, the automaker would then build a new battery plant near the Lordstown facility.  Workhorse declined to comment.  In Washington in June, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra defended the Workhorse plan. She also told Reuters that GM had no intention of building a new vehicle in Lordstown.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  Lordstown workers say that\u2019s the only way there will be enough well-paid manufacturing jobs for the community. They - and the UAW - place the blame squarely on GM.  \u201cYou did everything GM ever asked of you and it still wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d UAW Local 1112 president Tim O\u2019Hara told 100 cheering workers during a rally outside the plant on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hold the line as long as it takes.\u201d  The reality is that GM needs to cut back underutilized U.S. manufacturing capacity even at current levels, said Sam Fiorani, a vice president with Auto Forecast Solutions.  \u201cThere\u2019s no chance that GM is going to put a product back into that plant,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have too much capacity as it is.\u201d  GM\u2019s capacity utilization rate in its North American plants is about 75 percent, excluding idled assembly plants in Lordstown and Detroit, research firm LMC Automotive said.  THE LAST CRUZE  The 6.2-million-sq foot (576,000 sq meters) Lordstown complex has manufactured more than 16 million vehicles since it opened in 1966. The last Cruze rolled off the line in March.  Most workers here have taken transfers to other GM plants. But around 450 workers have not, many because they did not want to uproot their families.  Even if the Workhorse deal goes through, workers wonder how many people the plant would employ, whether they would still be working for GM and what kind of pay cut that would entail.  UAW workers at the top of the wage scale earn about $31 an hour, compared with the $15-$17 an hour workers are paid at a GM battery plant near Detroit that operates under a side agreement.  Analysts said neither a Workhorse nor a GM plant would be likely to employ even half the plant\u2019s previous workforce.  \u201cNothing other than vehicle production has even a hope of replacing the jobs and income and economic impact of what was previously there as an automotive assembly plant,\u201d said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The UAW said in a 2018 research paper that the disruptive effect of electric vehicles and their less complex batteries compared with gasoline-powered engines meant that fewer workers were going to be needed in the future.  Teresa Oakes, 44, has done the math.  \u201cIf they made batteries here it would allow them to lower wages to the bare minimum,\u201d said Oakes, who worked at the plant for 10 years. \u201cGM should bring back vehicles they make in Mexico and have them made by U.S. workers instead.\u201d  Most other jobs in the Lordstown area pay less, including at warehouses like the one discount retailer TJX Companies Inc TJX.N is building nearby.  Rick Michaels, 49, took a transfer to a plant in Lansing, Michigan, and travels 4-1\/2 hours home every weekend to see his family. He was on the picket line at Lordstown all week.  \u201cIf GM opened a battery factory here, that would barely employ all the people here,\u201d Michaels said on Friday, pointing at the rally crowd. \u201cThere would be no way for me to get back home.\u201d  Doug Grant, 59, was picketing in a homemade T-shirt that read \u201cDID YOU MAKE $21,905,256 IN 2017\u201d on the front and \u201cMARY BARRA DID!\u201d on the back.  Grant, who said he declined to take a transfer to another GM facility, said it could take years to get a battery plant up and running.  \u201cThat\u2019s way too long,\u201d he said. \u201cThat puts me right out of the game.\u201d","353":"DETROIT, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The leadership of the United Auto Workers was meeting on Thursday to review terms of the union\u2019s tentative deal with General Motors Co to end a crippling month-long strike at the No. 1 U.S. automaker.  The national council, representing GM plants across the United States, was reviewing terms of the four-year deal. It was then expected to forward the agreement to GM\u2019s 48,000 striking workers for final ratification.  It was not immediately clear whether the workers would end their strike at that point or stay on the picket lines while the voting occurs; a process that could last up to two weeks.  The strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, and the use of temporary workers.  The longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event. Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines, eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that she had targeted for closure.  The strike cost GM an estimated $2 billion according to analysts, hurt auto suppliers and played a role in U.S. manufacturing output falling more than expected in September.  Sources have previously said the deal includes plans to invest $9 billion in GM\u2019s U.S. plants, and provides pay raises and a path to full time employment for temporary workers. It also includes a ratification bonus of $11,000 and a commitment to create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which will be new jobs, the sources said.  The agreement includes 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively, the sources said. GM also agreed to make temporary workers with three years of service permanent, the sources said.  Under the agreement, GM is expected to invest money in a battery facility near the Lordstown plant that it has said it was in talks to sell to start-up electric truck manufacturer Workhouse Group Inc, the sources said.  GM has also agreed to produce a future new electric truck and other vehicles at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant that was set to end operations in early 2020, the sources said.  As part of the deal, GM will win the right to end assembly operations at Lordstown and permanently close two other parts plants in Baltimore and Warren, Michigan, the sources said.  Workers from Lordstown were outside GM\u2019s Detroit headquarters, where UAW leaders were meeting, to protest the planned agreement.  If the deal is approved by workers, the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor Co or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.  A successful ratification is not a sure thing as workers during the 2015 talks initially rejected a deal with Fiat Chrysler before eventually approving a revised offer.  This year\u2019s talks have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union, although officials and workers said they focused strictly on the negotiations.

Members of the GM Korea union, a subcommittee for Korea Metal Workers' Union, hold a meeting to demand GM Korea withdraw its plan to shut down Gunsan manufacturing plant in Gunsan, South Korea February 14, 2018. Yonhap via REUTERS  GM is bracing for a major showdown with its South Korean unionised workers, after the U.S. automaker announced last week it would shut a plant by May in the city of Gunsan, in southwest South Korea, and decide the future of its remaining three plants in the country within weeks.  GM executives have complained that South Korea\u2019s relatively high wages and unyielding unions have contributed to its problems in the country.  To \u201cimprove the manufacturing competitiveness of GM Korea,\u201d GM will propose freezing base wages this year and limit future wage increases below inflation, the letter said.  \u201cIt is impossible to pay 2018 bonuses\/one-time payments in 2018,\u201d GM said in the letter, sent to team leaders, laying out proposals for this year\u2019s wage talks with the union.  GM Korea has paid about 10 million won ($9,285.83) in bonuses to each worker almost every year, company officials have said.  The proposal includes suspending benefits, such as school tuition for employees\u2019 children, gold medals and travel expenses for long-serving workers, and free lunches.  GM has told its South Korean employees the company should trim benefits worth a combined 300 billion won, two sources told Reuters. One of the sources said GM has also asked employees to curb use of corporate cards.  A GM Korea spokesman declined to comment, while a union spokeswoman said it has not officially received the proposal.  TEMPORARY RELIEF  Meanwhile, GM on Friday dropped a request to use its South Korean factory in Bupyeong as collateral for debt, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  At around 5 percent interest, GM headquarters in Detroit has lent its South Korean unit nearly 3 trillion won, out of which 700 billion won comes due at the end of this month.  At a board meeting of its South Korean unit, GM also agreed to grant temporary relief in repaying the 700 billion won debt until the government completes its due diligence of the unit, the person with direct knowledge of the matter said.  South Korea said on Thursday it plans to quickly conduct due diligence on GM\u2019s S.Korean operations and would discuss whether the government would provide financial support to the company.  This came after GM agreed to play \u201ca responsible role\u201d in normalising its South Korean operations while other stakeholders also \u201cshare the pain.\u201d  \u201cGM told board members that there is progress with its talks with the government, but little progress with talks with its labour union, which is a problem,\u201d said the person with direct knowledge of the matter.  GM has been seeking concessions from the South Korean union, and government support to engineer a turnaround.  South Korea was once a major export base for GM, but saw slumping sales in recent years as GM scrapped its Chevy brand in Europe.  The ruling party on Friday urged GM to come up with a \u201cviable, long-term turnaround plan\u201d for its South Korean operations.","356":"WASHINGTON\/DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N plans to build a new family of premium electric pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant beginning in late 2021, possibly reviving the imposing Hummer brand on some of them, several people familiar with the plans said.  FILE PHOTO: A Hummer vehicle sits in the parking lot of a dealership in Scottsdale, Arizona June 2, 2009. REUTERS\/Joshua Lott  The so-called BT1 electric truck\/SUV program is the centerpiece of a planned $3 billion investment in the Detroit-Hamtramck plant to make electric trucks and vans, and part of a broader $7.7 billion investment in GM\u2019s U.S. plants over the next four years, according to a proposed labor deal between the automaker and the United Auto Workers union.  The investments were made public by the UAW on Friday but no details were provided.  The investment would move the automaker into a part of the EV market that is largely untested and where GM has a higher likelihood of turning a profit, analysts said.  \u201cIt makes perfect sense to hit the high end of the market in order to generate some revenue that might actually turn a profit,\u201d Auto Forecast Solutions vice president of global vehicle forecasting Sam Fiorani said.  GM is mirroring the approach electric carmaker Tesla Inc TSLA.O took by starting in the high end and then moving down the price ladder, he said.  That is important for a company who previously tried to sell the plug-in electric hybrid Chevrolet Volt and all-electric Bolt cars at lower prices and higher volumes, but failed to sell enough to make those efforts profitable, Fiorani said.  The UAW\u2019s 48,000 GM hourly workers are scheduled to vote next week on the proposed contract that would end a month-long strike that analysts say has cost the No. 1 U.S. automaker about $2 billion.  GM\u2019s BT1 program includes an electric pickup for the GMC brand and an electric SUV for Cadillac, both due in 2023, the sources said.  Before then, GM plans to begin low-volume production in late 2021 of the first BT1 model, a pickup, under a different brand, the source said. A performance variant of the pickup will be added to that brand in 2022, followed by an electric SUV in 2023.  One of the sources said the Hummer name is \u201cunder consideration\u201d but a decision has not been finalized. The pickup is codenamed \u201cProject O.\u201d  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Bringing back the Hummer name would take advantage of a still strongly recognized brand name, Fiorani said. Hummers were rugged civilian utility vehicles with low gas mileage that were inspired by military vehicles and were popular with such celebrities as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former basketball star Dennis Rodman.  \u201cPutting a Hummer badge on anything is a great idea for General Motors because half the marketing is already paid for,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking it environmentally friendly is just icing on the cake.\u201d  The pickups and SUVs in the BT1 family will use a new dedicated electric vehicle architecture, including a \u201cskateboard\u201d chassis that bundles electric motor and batteries, the sources said. Fiorani expects the GM electric truck to sell at around $90,000 or more, while the other vehicles will easily top $100,000.  GM President Mark Reuss said in June at a UBS conference that the new EV architecture will be highly flexible, enabling the Detroit automaker to build a variety of body types in different sizes, with the capability of providing front-, rear- or all-wheel drive models.  When the plant reaches full production in 2024, it is expected to build about 80,000 electric vehicles a year, the sources said. Fiorani called that figure realistic.  As part of its plans around EVs, GM plans to open a battery plant near its closed Lordstown, Ohio, factory that sources have said would be a joint venture and is part of plans to invest another $1.3 billion in non-GM plants in the United States over the next four years.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in April the automaker would make an electric full-size pickup, but provided no further details. The company has said it plans to invest $8 billion to develop electric and self-driving vehicles, launching 20 new EVs globally by 2023.  Asked about the details provided to Reuters, GM spokeswoman Jordana Strosberg said GM doesn\u2019t comment on speculation. But she added the company is committed to an electric future.  \u201cGM believes in an all-electric future and we are making great progress in that area,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have announced that a pickup truck will be part of our future portfolio, but have no additional information to provide.\u201d  GM is aiming to be one of the first in what is soon to be a crowded market for electric trucks and SUVs.  Well-funded Michigan startup Rivian has announced plans to build an electric pickup - a premium version of which will top $90,000 - followed by an electric SUV, beginning in fall 2020. It also has a contract with investor Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O to build up to 100,000 electric delivery vans for the e-commerce giant.  GM previously held discussions about investing in Rivian and using its electric vehicle platform, but sped up its internal EV program when the startup turned to rival Ford Motor Co F.N.  Ford invested $500 million in Rivian in April and said it planned to use Rivian\u2019s skateboard to build a new Ford-branded electric vehicle.  Ford plans to unveil an electric version of its own F-series pickup in early to mid 2022, sources previously told Reuters. It also will begin selling a Mustang-inspired electric SUV next year as part of its plan to invest $11.5 billion electrifying its vehicles by 2022, including adding 16 fully electric models.  Electric pickups and SUVs - the heart of the U.S. market - could help Ford and GM generate the significant sales of EVs they will need to meet tougher emission standards and electric vehicle mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards \u2013 and eliminate extra credits that automakers receive from EV sales -but the electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the company wants to add a pickup to its growing family of premium electric vehicles, but has not provided a specific timetable. Tesla is expected to unveil a prototype this year, with analysts predicting a 2022 debut.

United Auto Workers (UAW) members at GM went on strike on Sept. 16, seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of GM\u2019s profit and protection of their healthcare benefits.  Talks ran late into the evening on Tuesday and began early in the morning on Wednesday, representatives for both sides said.  The walkout - the longest auto worker strike in nearly 30 years - has become a political event, attracting the attention of Democratic politicians, who have been visiting the striking workers and voicing their support.  On Wednesday, Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont who is an independent, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former U.S. Representative from Texas, are scheduled to visit the picket lines.  The Democratic presidential candidates have echoed the striking workers in saying the GM employees deserve fair treatment from the U.S. automaker they helped through bankruptcy.  President Donald Trump, a Republican, convinced numerous UAW members to vote for him in 2016, helping him win Michigan, Ohio and other states. He has repeatedly demanded GM find a new vehicle for its now-shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, a key state for him in the 2020 presidential election.  GM officials have tried to counter charges that they are abandoning U.S. workers, releasing details of an offer to the UAW that included the promise of investing $7 billion in U.S. plants, annual raises in a new four-year deal, increased profit sharing and retention of existing healthcare insurance.  However, the sources said some of the bigger remaining issues relate to how fast newer hires progress to the top UAW pay scale of about $31 an hour. Currently, it takes eight years to reach that level for newer hires and the union wants a faster ramp to the top.  Another big issue is the use of temporary workers, who have no pathway to full-time job status and few rights related to sick time or vacation days.  GM has said it can reduce its cost disadvantage with the international automakers in the U.S. market and safeguard union jobs by using temporary workers. The use of temps also allows Detroit automakers to cover for high rates of absenteeism among UAW workers.

The GMC website showed a \u201creservations full\u201d banner over the Hummer EV \u201cEdition 1,\u201d due to start production in the fall of 2021. The next version of the truck, the $99,995 Hummer EV 3X, is not scheduled to begin production until the fall of 2022.  The least expensive Hummer EV, starting at $79,995, is scheduled to go into production in the spring of 2024, GM said.  The Hummer EV was designed and engineered in 18 months, GM officials said during a presentation on Wednesday. The brawny truck can \u201ccrab walk\u201d sideways on rough terrain using its four-wheel steering system, and has a \u201cWatts to Freedom\u201d mode that accelerates the truck to 60 miles per hour (97 kph) in 3 seconds.  The Hummer EV is in part a response to Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Cybertruck, which has a very different but equally eye-grabbing design and a bevy of extreme performance features. The Cybertruck's starting price is $39,900, though a model with 500 miles of range starts at $69,900.  Tesla has begun building a factory in Austin, Texas to build the Cybertruck starting in late 2021.  The head of GM\u2019s GMC division, Duncan Aldred, said about half the brand\u2019s dealers have agreed to sell the Hummer EV lineup. GM is taking orders on its website, and Aldred said the company\u2019s intent is to offer no-haggle prices. The online reservations and firm pricing are similar to the Tesla approach.  High-performance electric pickup trucks could be a crowded niche in the U.S. market, with eight companies promising to launch models by the end of 2021.

While GM is also planning to discontinue Chevrolet Impala in the next few years, Ford Motor Co F.N will stop making the Fiesta small car for the U.S. market by as early as next year, and discontinue the Taurus sedan, the Journal reported.  The move comes at a time when U.S. consumers are increasingly shunning passenger cars in favor of more comfortable sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks.  Ford executives are still considering the future of Fusion cars, the report said.  General Motors declined to comment, while Ford was not immediately available for comment.  Last month, Ford disclosed plans to shift the product portfolio from passenger cars to SUVs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and cut manufacturing costs.  Demand for sport utility vehicles in the United States is booming, with the number of new models vying for a share of the market growing even faster.  Last month, GM unveiled a revamped luxury pickup truck, intensifying the battle among Detroit\u2019s big three automakers for fat profits at the top end of a highly lucrative segment.","360":"Oct 4 (Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s Cadillac outscored Tesla Inc in a new ranking of partially automated driving systems tested by Consumer Reports and released on Thursday.  The highly influential nonprofit organization, which tests and rates a variety of consumer products from appliances to vehicles, said it compared Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise and Tesla\u2019s Autopilot with similar systems from Nissan Motor Co and Zhejiang Geely\u2019s Volvo Car Corp. Nissan\u2019s ProPilot Assist was ranked third and Volvo\u2019s Pilot Assist fourth.  Consumer Reports said it has been testing partially automated driving systems for several years but elected to conduct a formal study intended for publication, because \u201cwe are at a tipping point where they are now going mainstream,\u201d according to Jake Fisher, director of auto testing.  The organization said its tests, conducted on a private track and on public roads in Connecticut, were designed to measure the systems\u2019 ability to automatically control steering and speed in certain situations, while helping drivers pay attention and regain manual control of the vehicle when required.  The systems typically use cameras, radar and other sensors, as well as mapping data, to monitor location and traffic conditions and help keep a vehicle centered in the lane at a safe distance behind other cars.  Each system has limitations. Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise, for instance, only functions on divided highways that have been mapped by GM. In contrast, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot can be used even on small, curvy roads with poor lane markings, but \u201coperates erratically in those situations,\u201d Consumer Reports said.  While they can help relieve driver stress and fatigue, Consumer Reports said, the partially automated systems are \u201cnot intended to be self-driving features.\u201d  The organization tested Super Cruise on the Cadillac CT6; Autopilot on the Tesla Model 3, Model X and Model S; ProPilot Assist on the Nissan Leaf and Infiniti QX50, and Pilot Assist on the Volvo XC40 and XC60.  Consumer Reports said Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise did \u201cthe best job of balancing high-tech capabilities with ensuring the car is operated safely and the driver is paying attention.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s Autopilot was cited for its capability and ease of use, while Nissan\u2019s ProPilot Assist did a better job than Autopilot or Volvo\u2019s Pilot Assist in keeping drivers engaged.  Cadillac\u2019s Super Cruise is not related to the GM Cruise self-driving vehicle being jointly developed by General Motors and Honda Motor Co Ltd.","361":"March 1 (Reuters) - The following are the 20 top-selling vehicles in the United States in February, excluding models from General Motors and Ford Motor, as reported by the automakers and ranked by total units: Top 20 selling vehicles in the United States in February : RANK VEHICLE Feb-19 Feb-18 PCT CHNG 1 Ram P\/U 39,950 33,299 +20.0 2 Nissan Rogue 31,899 38,119 -16.3 3 Toyota Corolla 29,016 25,021 +16.0 4 Honda CR-V 26,304 25,852 +1.7 5 Toyota RAV4 26,149 29,869 -12.5 6 Toyota Camry 24,267 30,865 -21.4 7 Honda Civic 22,979 25,816 -11.0 8 Honda Accord 20,254 19,753 +2.5 9 Toyota Tacoma 18,533 16,817 +10.2 10 Jeep Grand Cherokee 18,009 17,468 +3.1 11 Toyota Highlander 17,384 15,960 +8.9 12 Nissan Sentra 17,072 17,148 -0.4 13 Nissan Altima 16,216 19,703 -17.7 14 Jeep Wrangler 15,001 15,936 -5.9 15 Dodge Caravan 12,521 16,443 -23.9 16 Hyundai Elantra 10,304 15,724 -34.5 17 Kia Soul 8,592 6,631 +29.6 18 Nissan Versa 7,410 7,196 +3.0 19 Kia Sorento 7,386 7,236 +2.1 20 Kia Optima 7,212 6,402 +12.7 RANK VEHICLE YTD 2019 YTD 2018 PCT CHNG 1 Ram P\/U 74,839 62,657 +19.4 2 Nissan Rogue 58,012 74,303 -21.9 3 Honda CR-V 55,456 50,178 +10.5 4 Toyota Corolla 54,119 46,428 +16.6 5 Toyota RAV4 50,654 56,524 -10.4 6 Toyota Camry 48,069 55,503 -13.4 7 Honda Civic 44,532 49,565 -10.2 8 Honda Accord 39,040 37,430 +4.3 9 Toyota Tacoma 35,385 33,529 +5.5 10 Jeep Grand Cherokee 33,084 33,832 -2.2 11 Toyota Highlander 31,797 31,444 +1.1 12 Nissan Sentra 31,160 34,879 -10.7 13 Nissan Altima 28,405 39,888 -28.8 14 Jeep Wrangler 28,015 27,675 +1.2 15 Hyundai Elantra 20,246 29,741 -31.9 16 Dodge Caravan 19,634 26,852 -26.9 17 Kia Soul 15,693 12,569 +24.9 18 Kia Sorento 14,112 13,359 +5.6 19 Nissan Versa 14,059 14,444 -2.7 20 Volkswagen Jetta* 13,984 9,123 +53.3 * Jetta numbers include SportWagen sales Note: General Motors and Ford numbers are not included as the companies report on a quarterly basis.

Many of the ventilators assembled by the automakers and other manufacturers have gone into a U.S. government stockpile as doctors shifted away from using invasive ventilators with COVID-19 patients. The government currently has 108,000 ventilators in its medical equipment stockpile, and 12,000 deployed at U.S. hospitals, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said Tuesday.  GM and medical equipment maker Ventec Life Systems are in the \u201chome stretch\u201d toward completing a contract to deliver 30,000 critical care ventilators by the end of August under a $489 million contract with the federal government, the automaker said.  GM and Ventec have already delivered more than 20,000 machines, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.  Ford has assembled about 47,000 of the 50,000 ventilators it agreed to supply to partner General Electric Co, Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said. GE has a $336 million contract with the government.  Ford and GM earlier this year said they would employ a total of as many as 1,500 people on ventilator assembly lines. Automakers likened the efforts to their switch from making cars to tanks and planes during the Second World War.  With North American car and truck factories back in operation, the Detroit automakers are winding down their forays into ventilator manufacturing, while continuing to make respiratory masks.  GM has said it plans to transfer the ventilator-making operations at a factory in Kokomo, Indiana, to its partner Ventec on Sept.1. Union-represented GM workers employed at the plant will return to the automaker, and temporary workers will remain with Ventec.  Ford has not said what the future will be for its ventilator facility.  The automakers\u2019 efforts to build ventilators and other medical equipment were launched in a politically charged atmosphere as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic swamped the U.S. economy and healthcare system. The shortage of ventilators became a symbol of the nation\u2019s struggle to respond.  U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on the automakers as part of a broader push to secure more than 130,000 ventilators by the end of 2020.  The automakers used the medical equipment assembly operations set up in the spring to test safety protocols they later used to reopen their vehicle-making operations.","364":"Nov 7 (Reuters) - General Motors Co confirmed on Thursday it has sold its shuttered Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio to a start-up that has an ambitious plan to begin building electric pick-up trucks by the end of 2020.

FILE PHOTO: A line up of cars is seen on a road after a shift change at the General Motors Car assembly plant in Oshawa, June 1, 2012. REUTERS\/Mark Blinch  Unifor, which represents most unionized autoworkers in Canada, said it had been informed by GM that there would be no product allocated to the plant in Oshawa after December 2019, a development that would affect production at the plant.  The union statement came after a Canadian TV news channel said GM was planning to close all operations at the plant in Oshawa, near Toronto.  A GM spokesman declined to comment on Sunday evening.  GM has been cutting jobs to deal with plunging car sales in North America. The company has internally debated for months how to address shrinking car demand, a person briefed on the matter said, and the issue is certain to re-emerge when GM holds contract talks next year with the United Auto Workers union.  GM is expected to announce as soon as this week some involuntary salaried layoffs after it did not get as many volunteers to accept buyouts as hoped, the person said.  GM said on Oct. 31 that about 18,000 of its 50,000 salaried employees in North America are eligible for the buyouts.  The stepped up cost-cutting and restructuring at GM comes as many industry executives and analysts predict that overall vehicle sales in the United States will decline further in 2019 and 2020.  At the same time, China, the world\u2019s largest auto market and GM\u2019s biggest market by vehicle sales, has decelerated sharply in the past few months.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Analysts have said GM has too many North American plants building slow-selling sedans.  GM shares are down 12 percent for the year, and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra, in a message to employees last month, cited the stagnant share price as a reason for tougher restructuring measures.  She said the automaker had negative cash flow for the first nine months of the year and it needed to cut costs.  BUYOUTS  GM has been offering buyouts to North American salaried workers and has said it could lay off white-collar staff if it does not hit a cost-cutting target.  The person briefed on the matter confirmed that GM planned a major announcement on the future of the Oshawa plant, but said the automaker wanted to notify employees of its plans before making any announcements about the plant.  Total vehicle production at the Oshawa complex fell 60 percent through the first ten months of 2018 from the same period a year ago, according to Automotive News production data.  GM employs about 2,500 union staff in Oshawa which produces both the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS sedans. It also completes final assembly of the stronger-selling Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks which are shipped from Indiana.  Political pressure in Canada is already mounting on GM, which had accepted billions of dollars in aid from the U.S., Canadian and Ontario governments after filing for bankruptcy protection during the 2009 global economic downturn.  \u201cWe are aware of the reports and we will be working in the coming days to determine how we can continue supporting our auto sector and workers,\u201d a Canadian government official said.  \u201cThe jobs of many families are on the line,\u201d said Colin Carrie, a Member of Parliament for Oshawa. \u201cCommunities all over Ontario would be devastated if this plant were to close.  The U.S.-based automaker has other operations in Canada, including a plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, where it assembles the Chevrolet Equinox.  The reported plant closure is a further blow to the Canadian auto industry, which has lost jobs to the United States, where governments offer manufacturers rich incentives, and Mexico, where labor costs are lower.  However, a new trade deal that the United States, Mexico and Canada struck in September leaves significant room for Canadian plants to grow exports duty-free.","367":"Aug 14 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Detroit on Friday rejected a bid by General Motors Co to reinstate a racketeering lawsuit against its smaller rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) .

The deal would give Amazon and GM minority stakes in Rivian, the sources said. It would be a major boost for the Plymouth, Michigan-based startup, which aspires to be the first carmaker to the U.S. consumer market with an electric pickup.  If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced as early as this month, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. There is always a chance that deal talks fall through, the sources cautioned.  \u201cWe admire Rivian\u2019s contribution to a future of zero emissions and an all-electric future,\u201d GM said in an emailed statement, declining to specifically comment on any talks with Rivian.  Amazon and Rivian declined comment.  The Rivian deal would come as its much larger electric car manufacturing rival, Tesla Inc, struggles to stabilize production and deliver consistent profits as it rolls out its flagship Model 3 sedan.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors last August that an electric pickup is \u201cprobably my personal favorite for the next product\u201d from the company, though he has spoken only in general about a potential launch, saying that it would happen \u201cright after\u201d Tesla\u2019s Model Y, which the company has targeted to start production in 2020.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  \u2018SKATEBOARD\u2019 PLATFORM  Rivian intends to begin selling its R1T, the pickup it debuted in November, in the fall of 2020. The company was founded in 2009 by CEO R.J. Scaringe.  Scaringe has described the Rivian vehicle\u2019s platform as a \u201cskateboard\u201d that packages the drive units, battery pack, suspension system, brakes and cooling system all below wheel height to allow for more storage space and greater stability due to a lower center of gravity.  He has also said the company plans to partner with outside firms to develop advanced self-driving technology, rather than try to do so on its own.  Big automakers, including GM, have not jumped into the market for electric pickups thus far. GM CEO Mary Barra has said it has given a \u201ctiny bit\u201d of thought to developing all-electric pickups.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker is counting on profit from sales of conventional large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America to fund its electrification push. GM said last November it was doubling resources allocated to developing electric and self-driving vehicles, as part of a significant restructuring that included ending production at five North American plants.  GM last month announced a strategy to make its luxury Cadillac its lead electric vehicle brand, revealing it would be the first vehicle built on the Detroit automaker\u2019s \u201cBEV3\u201d platform to challenge Tesla. GM has said one of the first fully electric Cadillac models using the new platform would hit the market around 2022.  Amazon has also invested in self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation Inc, in a $530 million funding round announced last week. The world\u2019s largest online retailer has steadily increased its logistics footprint, building warehouses around the world and inking deals with Mercedes as well as cargo airlines to help with delivery.  Rivian\u2019s existing financial backers include Saudi auto distributor Abdul Latif Jameel Co (ALJ), Sumitomo Corp of Americas and Standard Chartered Bank. ALJ has agreed to provide almost $500 million in funding, Sumitomo invested an undisclosed amount, and Standard Chartered provided debt financing of $200 million.","370":"FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019.

Some analysts and GM shareholders have pushed GM to consider a spinoff of all or some of its EV assets into a separate company that would be valued at headier levels like Tesla Inc TSLA.O and other newly public EV automakers.  During a July earnings conference call, Barra said nothing was off the table when it came to maximizing the value of its EV assets and there was no impediment to a possible spinoff.

BOWLING GREEN, Ky. - Oct 3 (Reuters) - While striking workers at General Motors Co\u2019s U.S. auto plants continue walking picket lines for a third week to demand better pay and benefits, the financial pressure has mounted for union members like Frank Lee.  Analysts estimate that GM could lose $1 billion from the labor dispute that began on Sept. 16 and is now the longest nationwide strike at the automaker since 1970. For GM, which had $24 billion in cash and marketable securities as of June 30, that cost is likely manageable.  But it\u2019s a different story for some strikers.  Frank Lee, a United Auto Workers union member at GM\u2019s Corvette assembly plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is fending off bill collectors.  \u201cUntil yesterday, I was negative in my bank account,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI called the bank to try and stop an insurance payment from coming out. I failed to do that; it was too late.\u201d  Adding to the difficulty of his situation, union regulations prohibit Lee from seeking outside employment while on strike. If he finds another job, or supplements the weekly $250 strike pay, he will lose the benefits with the union.  Negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors Co continued talking on Wednesday, with no word on when a deal would be agreed that would get the automaker\u2019s U.S. assembly lines rolling again.  GM and the UAW said they traded what were described as comprehensive proposals on Tuesday. The union rejected GM\u2019s plan, saying it fell short on wages, healthcare, job security and the treatment of temporary workers, which has become a central issue for the UAW.  Lee is a temporary worker who was hired at the Bowling Green plant three years ago. The 47-year-old has trained to work at more than 30 positions within the assembly plant.  But even after three years on the job, Lee does not qualify for the same pay and benefits as full-time UAW workers, who earn $7 to $14 an hour more than temporary workers in the same factories.  Lee lives with his son, Isiah, in a trailer home thirty miles south of the Bowling Green plant.  \u201cBefore the strike even happened, the money I make as a temporary is week to week; paycheck comes in, paychecks go out, and we barely survive,\u201d said Lee, making his comments in between phone calls with bill collectors.  On Friday, union members at GM will mark their second payday without a check.  \u201cI\u2019ve got bills that are behind already. I\u2019ve got bill collectors; they\u2019re already calling me,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere\u2019s a stack of bills that seemed to have doubled. Rent is due. I don\u2019t know where that money is coming from.\u201d  Lee has called his credit card providers, explaining that paying rent and buying groceries would need to take priority.  The UAW is working with charities in communities affected by the strike to get additional help for strikers, a union spokesman said.  Lee said financial pressure had increased for him not because of the strike but due to the way General Motors treats temporary employees. He had believed his temporary position would lead to a job with full pay and benefits.  Despite the stress and financial hardship, Lee finds inspiration in his son, Isiah.  \u201cI\u2019m in this for my son, and we are survivors,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get through this.\u201d  At the bargaining tables in Detroit, the issue of how temporary employees are treated is based on the union\u2019s principle that workers at the same plant should get similar wages for similar work.  High absenteeism poses a problem for GM management as the company tends to rely on temporary workers to fill in for missing full time workers.  The union has urged GM to give temporary workers a pay rise and an easier path to jobs at full UAW pay and benefits. GM pays temporary workers between $15.78 and $22 an hour depending on when they were hired, according to a summary of the now expired contract. Full time assembly workers can earn a base pay of nearly $30 an hour or more.  GM management has talked up the $63 hourly average labor costs at its U.S. operations, which is higher than the average $50 an hour paid by Asian and European automakers at their non-union auto factories in the United States.  Non-union plants tend to employ a much higher number of temporary workers, who can be laid off or hired back more quickly as demand ebbs and flows.

REUTERS\/Joe White\/File Photo  However, the second-quarter growth rate of vehicle sales in China eased compared with the January-March quarter, which saw an increase of 8 percent. The slowdown was mainly due to lean sales of Buick brand vehicles in the April-June period.  Buick sales dived 16 percent to 230,454 vehicles in the second quarter compared with a year-ago period. Sales of Cadillac, Chevrolet and other brands climbed in the second quarter from a year ago.  Buick sales declined due to a technology shift by the brand to offer a number of models with smaller-displacement, turbo-charged engines, said a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for General Motors.  \u201cBuick is leading the industry in the deployment of the cutting-edge small displacement engines, but it takes time for sales to pick up after technology changeovers,\u201d the spokeswoman said.  While the 1-litre and 1.3-litre turbo-charged engines match or exceed the performances of non-turbo 4-cylinder engines that were replaced, the new engines also offer greater fuel efficiencies.  \u201cWe believe the adoption of these engines will be commonplace in China in the years ahead,\u201d she added.  In the first-half of 2018, GM and its local Chinese joint venture partners posted record sales, selling 1.84 million vehicles, up 4.4 percent from the first half a year ago.  The previous first-half record was during the January-June period of 2016 when GM sold 1.81 million vehicles.

General Motors production worker Dina Mays works on the 10-speed transmission assembly at the General Motors (GM) Powertrain Transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, U.S. March 6, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  Dina Mays, a 14-year veteran of Lordstown Assembly, was not at the plant for its last day. She had already moved on to her new workplace, GM\u2019s Toledo transmission plant, where the automaker builds 10-speed transmissions for popular pickup trucks.  The U.S. auto industry is heading into a new cycle of plant closings and job cuts. Sales in the world\u2019s second-largest vehicle market are projected to fall. Consumers shifting away from traditional sedans such as the Cruze have left GM with more workers assigned to building cars than the market can support.  But GM has the reverse problem with trucks - for now, it cannot build them fast enough. That is helping GM find new jobs for displaced sedan plant workers, and blunt attacks from the UAW and politicians.  The automaker recently announced it will add 1,000 jobs at a plant in Flint, Michigan, to build a new generation of GM\u2019s largest pickups.  A GM spokeswoman said last week that 538 workers from a Detroit plant slated to close in 2020 and nearly 100 from Lordstown have already signed on in Flint to fill those jobs.  That and other job opportunities could cushion the blow for most of the 1,450 workers currently laid off at Lordstown. The Ohio plant is one of five North American GM plants slated to close by January 2020.  GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has said the automaker expects to have 2,700 job openings by early 2020 at other thriving plants, enough to absorb nearly all of those displaced in plants in Maryland, Ohio and Michigan willing or able to uproot for work hundreds of miles away. GM said another 1,200 affected hourly workers are eligible for early retirement.  Based on a plant-by-plant count provided by GM, if every worker displaced or soon to be displaced volunteers for or accepts a new job - and those eligible to retire do so - that would potentially leave up to 500 GM workers jobless, far fewer than the thousands decried by the UAW and Trump.  Ohio is a key state for Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election chances. In July 2017 he vowed in Youngstown, Ohio, near GM\u2019s Lordstown plant, that those auto jobs were \u201call coming back.\u201d  \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he told residents. \u201cDon\u2019t sell your house.\u201d  On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he had spoken with Barra to demand she \u201cdo something quickly\u201d to keep the Lordstown plant running. GM responded, \u201cOur main focus remains on our employees and offering them jobs in our plants where we have growth opportunities. We have opportunities available for virtually all impacted employees.\u201d The company said the ultimate fate of the plant will be decided in contract negotiations with the UAW this fall.  NOMADIC LIFESTYLE  Mays and other veteran GM factory workers have been pushed into nomadic lives before. Mays is on her third GM factory in 15 years. In 2005, she moved to Lordstown in northeastern Ohio after being laid off at a GM plant in Baltimore, Maryland.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it. It\u2019s rough,\u201d Mays said.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  Her eldest son is at college and a 12-year-old son remains with relatives near Lordstown. \u201cBut I have to be able to support myself and my kids.\u201d  After 25 years with GM, she has five years until retirement, so transferring \u201cwas the best decision I could make.\u201d  For those who move, GM offers a $30,000 cash package to offset costs. If the company has jobs for laid-off workers elsewhere and they refuse them, they lose their supplemental pay and are eligible to hire on again only at their \u201chome plant\u201d - in this case, Lordstown.  SCANT OPTIONS  For Joe Stanton, 55, transferring 160 miles (260 km) to Toledo from Lordstown made sense.  With 25 years at GM, he also has five years to go before he can retire. He rents an apartment with Mays just outside Toledo to cut costs. He moved from Pittsburgh to Lordstown in 2006 when his GM plant there closed. He owns two homes, one near Lordstown and one in Pennsylvania.  Stanton misses his adult son in Pittsburgh and girlfriend near Lordstown but said he is lucky not to have small children or sick parents to care for so he could move to Toledo.  If the UAW renegotiates a new product for Lordstown, retooling the plant would take years, Stanton said.  \u201cThat\u2019s a gamble I wasn\u2019t willing to take,\u201d he said.  For those left behind, the outlook is bleak.  Tod Porter, chair of Youngstown State University\u2019s economics department, estimated Lordstown\u2019s closure could cost more than 8,000 jobs including at auto suppliers and service providers, in an area still affected by steel mill closures decades ago.  Dave Green, president of UAW Local 1112, which represents workers at Lordstown, said he is fighting for the plant to reopen but added unemployed GM workers have scant options.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t want a job flipping burgers for minimum wage, you got to get the hell out of here,\u201d he said.","379":"DETROIT, June 29 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday stayed a lower court\u2019s order requiring officials from General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to resolve GM\u2019s racketeering lawsuit.

The carmaker sought to extend maturities on US$6bn in revolving loans rather than refinance a US$16.5bn credit facility following discussions with its bank group during the height of the COVID-19 crisis.  \u201cThey knew they wouldn\u2019t get any interest in the five-year,\u201d a banking source said, referring to the US$10.5bn that the company left in place. \u201c(The banks) had to tell them it was not happening.\u201d  Concerns about the impact of the virus on the economy has pushed companies in the US to pile on capital. Since March, corporations such as Heinz, Anheuser-Busch InBev and Petrobras have drawn down, often entirely, their usually unfunded credit lines as they brace themselves to withstand the slowdown brought on by the pandemic.  Banks\u2019 inability to repay their liabilities with sufficiently liquid assets is considered to be a large cause of the financial crisis. Liquidity right now has tightened, and with it, issuers are being advised to sit tight when it comes to rolling existing multi-year working capital facilities. The same holds true for incremental liquidity, which is currently weighted toward one-year facilities and 18-month loans.  As of the first week of April, investment grade issuers had structured 34 tranches totaling over US$65.4bn with maturities of less than five years compared to 23 tranches totaling US$50.4bn with five-year structures, according to Refinitiv LPC data.  \u201cAny time there is a bit of instability in the market, people prefer to lend shorter term,\u201d a second banking source said. \u201cAnd there is so much uncertainty right now.\u201d  GM originally went out to its JP Morgan and Citigroup-led bank group in early March requesting to push maturities on the US$16.5bn in revolving credit facilities as part of its regular-way liability management operations.  The transaction was meant to roll over maturities, but leave pricing unchanged, several sources familiar with the discussions said.  But GM\u2019s decision to refinance came at a time when the company is facing a longer than expected shutdown of its plants and considerable revenue losses amid a crisis of extraordinary magnitude that has created a playing field much different from when it last underwent refinancing discussions in 2019.  Complicating negotiations further, the company decided to draw down US$16bn on its revolver on March 27 while the refinancing talks with its bank group were taking place.  \u201cTo shore up liquidity and strengthen its financial position due to global market uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the company said on March 24 about its plans to draw down the facility.  The originally proposed refinancing included a US$2bn 364-day loan and a US$4bn three-year loan. It also included a US$10.5bn five-year facility, said several sources familiar with the original refinancing discussions.  The new plan has only refinanced the short-term maturities, including the US$2bn loan that has been reduced to US$1.95bn, and the US$4bn three-year loan, the sources said.  GM\u2019s change of plans is indicative of three things: increased pricing in the market, strong preference for shorter-dated commitments and concerns about the auto sector, a third banking source said.  The spreading virus forced most of North America\u2019s auto plants to close, at least temporarily. Ford, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Hyundai have all been impacted.  PRICING  The one-year loan pays 25bp undrawn, while the three-year loan pays 40bp undrawn.  When fully drawn, the loans pay 175bp over Libor, the sources familiar with the transaction said.  An option to convert the one-year revolving credit into a term loan after one year from the current deal has been removed, the sources said.  GM\u2019s 364-day loan previously paid 12.5bp undrawn, the three-year paid 15bp undrawn. The drawn margin on the two facilities was 125bp over Libor. The company offered 30bp to lenders that chose to roll over their existing holdings.  The new refinancing plan left in place the US$10.5bn credit facility. Pricing on the five-year will stay unchanged at 125bp over Libor and 17.5bp undrawn.  GM also has a US$3bn revolving credit it entered into in January 2019 when it refinanced the other three tranches. That loan increased the company\u2019s borrowing capacity to US$19.5bn.  Citigroup and JP Morgan spokespeople declined to comment. A spokesperson for GM did not return requests for comment. (Reporting by Michelle Sierra.

Now, it\u2019s show time for the first results of a project code-named GEM, for Global Emerging Market.  At events this week ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show, the No. 1 U.S. automaker plans to unveil two small SUVs that will be part of a new family of sedans and SUVs the automaker forecasts will make up one in five of its global vehicle sales by 2023.  This is just the opening salvo in a nearly $5-billion bet by GM to sell up to 2 million technology-laden, modern-looking vehicles annually to consumers who today cannot afford GM vehicles designed for the United States, but may someday as their incomes rise.  GM has struggled for years to crack the code for growing profitably outside rich markets, in part because vehicles designed for the U.S. or China\u2019s wealthy coastal cities cost too much for developing world consumers. The company has abandoned some Southeast Asian countries and pulled back from Africa because it could not compete.  This time around, GM says, through disciplined cost-control it has finally found a way to make affordable vehicles in bulk for emerging markets, loaded with the technology that consumers want and still make a profit.  The Chevrolet Tracker and the Buick Encore - not be confused with its American cousin of the same name - are the first tests of a new strategy for engineering vehicles to appeal to buyers in around 40 nations of the world\u2019s middle class such as Brazil and Mexico, and the huge developing market that exists within China\u2019s heartland.  The GEM project involved an unprecedented level of cooperation with GM\u2019s Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd. GM and SAIC shared engineering costs and collaborated on purchasing, GM executives said.  What potential customers will see are vehicles that include amenities such as touchscreens, mobile phone connectivity, rear-view cameras, and safety features like automatic emergency braking and airbags.  What GM is counting on them not to notice is that the number of options is limited, to reduce complexity in purchasing and manufacturing, or that touches such as fully-carpeted trunks are absent. \u201cWe may not be the absolute lowest price point in China,\u201d GM president Mark Reuss told Reuters at the automaker\u2019s downtown Detroit headquarters. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to be right in that segment where this is a pretty good-sized car... (with) a huge value for what you pay for it.\u201d  FEWER PARTS, LESS COST  The team that set out to build GM\u2019s new vehicle family included engineers and designers from 14 different countries, meeting at the automaker\u2019s technical center in the Detroit suburb of Warren to hammer out details that were then executed in China and elsewhere, GM executives said.  As the basic design of the GEM vehicles took shape, the strategy for where they would be sold changed. GM pulled out of some markets like India and Vietnam that were originally slated to be among the target markets.  The challenge GEM project chief engineer Doug Houlihan faced was how to deliver low-cost vehicles that did not look cheap or lack key safety features.  Sometimes, that meant spending more. Houlihan gave the green light to spend extra on machines that could weld on the tops of car doors rather than stamping the door in one piece. The extra investment delivered a door that fit smoothly into the roof of the car for a sleeker look.  \u201cThis gives the customer more than they would expect,\u201d Houlihan said.  To offset that cost, Houlihan and his colleagues dug into logistics and the supply chain.  Shipping some vehicles by sea between Brazilian ports saved money in a market where moving goods by road can be a logistics nightmare.  Houlihan said that Brazilian logistics savings more than paid for the extra $2 per vehicle GM invested for a rear axle five times stronger than its predecessor in South America. One GM plant in Brazil took over some work on engines and bumpers that had previously been outsourced, saving $120 per vehicle - a significant figure for a low-cost vehicle.  Integrating the head-rest on the front seat for some models saved $7 per vehicle.  Chinese suppliers are key to the new GM vehicle line, but the automaker is shifting away from relying on Chinese production.  GM has tried to localize costs for these vehicles as much as possible which can help offset currency fluctuations that hit markets like Brazil. That can also mitigate the impact of tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated trade tensions with China and has threatened a broad tariff on U.S. autos and parts.  \u201cYou try and tariff-proof yourself and get it as local as you can,\u201d GM\u2019s Reuss said.  GM\u2019s new emerging market lineup will face plenty of competition. Chinese automakers are pushing into some of the same countries GM has targeted.  Jeff Schuster, a senior executive at auto forecaster LMC Automotive, said GM\u2019s advantage could last just a few years if rivals follow with their own low-cost models that offer modern amenities to match those in new Chevrolets and Buicks.  Internally, a key test will be how GM applies the cost-saving strategies used in the global emerging market project to other vehicle programs.  Houlihan has been named to lead efforts to apply the cost lessons learned from this project to GM\u2019s global lineup of crossovers for the Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and her top executives will host an investor conference in New York.

Barra has been restructuring GM\u2019s operations and stressing her goals of readying GM for a future of \u201czero emissions and zero accidents\u201d for several years.  Still, GM shares trade just above the $33 share price of its November 2010 initial public offering. That has left it with a market capitalization of about $49 billion, compared with Tesla\u2019s valuation of about $160 billion. Tesla shares surged on Tuesday, extending a rally that has more than doubled the company\u2019s market value since the start of the year.

The Chinese market has been the source of a steady $2 billion in profits a year, but that is threatened by a market slowdown, rising costs for electrification and now the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.  Barra\u2019s challenge now is to assure investors that GM can make the leap across the gap separating its profitable internal combustion present and an uncertain electric future.  While gasoline-powered vehicles will make up a large portion of U.S. sales into the 2030s, GM will spend more on developing electric vehicles than those with internal combustion engines over the next five years, Barra said in October.  In December, GM and South Korea\u2019s LG Chem said they would invest $2.3 billion to build an EV battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world\u2019s largest battery facilities.  That same month, GM\u2019s Cadillac chief said most if not all of the vehicles offered by the luxury brand would be electric by 2030.  GM said last week it would invest $2.2 billion in its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to build electric trucks and SUVs, including the Cruise Origin, a driverless vehicle for ride-sharing service.

Barra was on Capitol Hill for two days of meetings last week to discuss the company\u2019s decision with angry lawmakers from states where plants are closing. \u201cTo tell me a couple weeks before Christmas that\u2019s she going to close in Ohio and Michigan - not acceptable to me,\u201d Trump said.  Trump has repeatedly said GM should reverse a decision to close an assembly plant in northeast Ohio, an area potentially crucial in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cOhio is going to replace those jobs in like two minutes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe\u2019s either going to open fast or somebody else is going to go in.\u201d  GM shares fell 1.4 percent in trading Thursday.  Asked to respond, GM said it timed its job cut announcement so employees could accept open jobs at other plants.  \u201cWe continue to produce great vehicles today for our customers while taking steps toward our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion,\u201d GM said.  Trump suggested that a new free trade deal with Mexico and Canada makes it \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d for GM to build cars outside the United States.  \u201cI don\u2019t like that General Motors does that... General Motors is not going to be treated well,\u201d he said without elaborating.  Trump signed a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada on Nov. 30 to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, but that deal has not been approved by the U.S. Congress.  The deal boosts the North American content requirements for vehicles to be traded tariff free and requires a significant percentage of vehicles to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour.  Some Democrats argue the trade deal may need changes to deter GM and other automakers from continuing significant production in Mexico. GM is not backing off its plans to build the new Chevrolet Blazer SUV in Mexico.","389":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co is developing an electric van aimed at business users, joining a growing list of carmakers planning EVs for the same segment which includes customers such as Amazon.com Inc and United Parcel Service Inc, five people familiar with the plans told Reuters.  FILE PHOTO: Models of the Rivian-built Amazon electric delivery vans are seen in this handout photo in Plymouth, Michigan, U.S., November 13, 2019. Jordan Stead\/Amazon\/Handout via REUTERS  That multibillion-dollar strategy could enable GM, Ford Motor Co and at least two EV startups to build and deliver more electric vehicles at a time when consumer demand for battery-powered models is still a small fraction of overall industry sales, while targeting a potentially lucrative market segment that Tesla Inc has yet to address.  GM\u2019s plan to develop an electric van has not previously been reported. The No. 1 U.S. automaker did not confirm the van, but has said it plans to introduce at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, in a variety of body styles including sedans, trucks and crossovers.  Suppliers familiar with such plans at GM and Ford told Reuters the Detroit automakers, which count trucks and commercial vehicles among their most profitable businesses, \u201cdon\u2019t want to leave the door open for Tesla\u201d as they did in consumer passenger cars.  Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, said the package delivery firm believes electric vans have the potential to disrupt the commercial market.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be similar to what the Model 3 has done for the consumer market,\u201d Phillippi said, referring to Tesla\u2019s small near-luxury electric sedan. \u201cNow all of a sudden, we\u2019re off to the races.\u201d  The GM van \u2013 code-named BV1 \u2013 is due to start production in late 2021, the sources said. It is believed the BV1 van will share some components with GM\u2019s future electric pickups and SUVs, including the automaker\u2019s new Ultium advanced battery system. It is expected to be assembled alongside the electric trucks at GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  GM is considering whether to offer the electric van through its traditional truck brands - Chevrolet and GMC - or market it under a different brand such as Maven, the sources said. GM\u2019s first electric pickup truck, due in late 2021, will be sold by GMC dealers under the Hummer brand.  In a statement, GM said it is \u201ccommitted to an all-electric future and is implementing a multi-segment, scalable EV strategy to get there. At this time, we do not have any announcements to make regarding electric commercial vehicles.\u201d  The GM electric van project is aimed at an important segment of the emerging EV market \u2013 commercial delivery vehicles. For established players, this is a hugely profitable business segment driven by cost of ownership, not fancy tech or star power. It is also a segment in which Tesla and its high-profile CEO, Elon Musk, lack an entry to compete for sales and CO2 credits, which allow automakers to offset the sale of non-electric vehicles including high-margin pickups and SUVs.  \u201cBuyers of commercial vans want reliability and not necessarily a flashy brand name,\u201d said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. \u201cThe reduced maintenance and fuel use of electric vehicles become very attractive to a business customer, where the current limitations of EVs make the price premium less attractive to individual consumers.\u201d  In February, Ford said it would introduce an electric version of its Transit van for model year 2022. \u201cThe most critical bet we will be making over the next several years will be our commercial vehicles,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief operating officer, Jim Farley, told Reuters at the time.  Ford also is an investor in Michigan-based startup Rivian, which is scheduled to begin building the first of 100,000 mid-size electric vans for Amazon next year.  Amazon rival UPS has commissioned 10,000 mid-size electric vans from British startup Arrival, which is backed by Korea\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co and its sister company Kia Motors Corp.  The combined value of the Amazon and UPS contracts with Rivian and Arrival is estimated at $4 billion or more.  And more players in the segments will likely follow, including Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, said Samit Ghosh, chief executive of the Americas for consulting and engineering firm umlaut.  \u201cThe delivery vans is a volume not to be underestimated,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not just call it a niche segment.\u201d","390":"WARREN, Mich. (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and South Korea's LG Chem 051910.KS said on Thursday they will invest $2.3 billion to build an electric vehicle battery cell joint venture plant in Ohio, creating one of the world's largest battery facilities.  The plant, to be built near GM\u2019s closed assembly plant in Lordstown in northeast Ohio, will employ more than 1,100 people, the companies said. Construction is to begin in mid-2020 and the plant will have an annual capacity of more than 30 gigawatt hours with the flexibility to expand.  At a media briefing, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the 50-50 joint venture with LG Chem is aimed at \u201cdramatically enhancing electric vehicle affordability and profitability.\u201d  Barra said the Ohio battery plant will accelerate the automaker\u2019s initiative to introduce 20 new electric vehicles globally by 2023.  \u201cGeneral Motors believes in the science of global warming and believes in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.  Barra said the battery cells will be used in a GM electric pickup which will start production in fall 2021 at the company\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which eventually will \u201chave more than one product.\u201d  In October, Reuters reported the Detroit-Hamtramck plant is expected to build at least four different electric vehicles, including an SUV for Cadillac and a pickup for GMC.  The Ohio battery cell plant will boost LG Chem\u2019s global battery capacity to 100 gigawatt-hours by the end of 2020, LG Chem CEO Hak-Cheol Shin said at the briefing. Each company will invest about $916 million, with the rest coming from debt capital raised by joint venture, a GM spokeswoman said.  Electric vehicle industry suppliers were cheered by the news, especially GM\u2019s talk of an EV truck as pickups and SUVs are the heart of the U.S. market.

REUTERS\/Alan Freed\/File Photo  LG Chem's cross-town rival SK Innovation 096770.KS, which counts Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and Daimler DAIGn.DE among its customers, broke ground in March on a $1.7 billion EV battery factory in Commerce, Georgia, about 200 km from Volkswagen's Chattanooga plant, which will be the automaker's EV hub in the United States.  SK Innovation\u2019s U.S. factory is scheduled to begin mass production in 2022.  \"We\u2019ve been trying to make it clear to everyone that the U.S. electric vehicle supply chain will grow when more (automakers) make more EV trucks here in the country,\" said Keith Phillips, CEO of Piedmont Lithium Ltd PLL.AX, which is developing a lithium mine near Charlotte, North Carolina. Lithium is a key material in EV batteries.  Sources familiar with the plan said workers at the GM-LG Chem plant were expected to be represented by the United Auto Workers union and earn $15 to $17 an hour. If so, it would be the first unionized battery factory in the United States. Tesla's TSLA.O Nevada battery factory and LG Chem's battery plant in Michigan do not have unions.  Barra said the plant\u2019s workers would decide whether a union represents them, and said pay would be competitive with other parts plants.  The average pay for a UAW worker at GM is about $31 an hour.  Barra said Ohio is providing financial incentives for the plant, but declined to provide details.  Ohio became a political lightning rod last year after GM announced plans to close the Lordstown car manufacturing plant. The closure was one issue during a lengthy strike by GM workers, and U.S. President Donald Trump condemned the move.  White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro told Reuters he thinks the plant will expand over time and be a significant anchor of employment in Lordstown.  \u201cThe battery plant itself is a critical part of GM\u2019s overall strategy to dominate the EV market over the next several decades,\u201d Navarro said.","391":"SILAO, Mexico (Reuters) - Half a continent away from the auto plants of Detroit, U.S. strikes at General Motors (GM) have sent shivers through the central Mexican city of Silao, where the local GM factory furloughed 6,000 workers last week when parts from the United States ran out.  FILE PHOTO: General Motors workers are seen while leaving their shift at the GM pickup and transmission plant in Silao, Mexico, October 1, 2019. REUTERS\/Sergio Maldonado  Rich or poor, residents are anxiously hoping the labor dispute will end so the company reopens the plant, which has been an anchor of the local economy since GM arrived a generation ago, transforming the landscape forever.  \u201cGeneral Motors is the biggest source of income here. When General Motors stops, everything stops,\u201d said Silao resident Francisco Vazquez. \u201cBefore General Motors, there was nothing.\u201d  Once a provincial backwater with a handful of colorful old churches, Silao is now enveloped in a thick cordon of factories and warehouses serving automotive companies from all over the world.  In the years after GM opened the Silao plant in 1995, dozens of other firms followed, such as Volkswagen, Continental and Pirelli. Meanwhile the city\u2019s home state, Guanajuato, drew in plants from carmakers including Mazda, Honda and Toyota.  Tensions over the future of manufacturing in North America are at the heart of the mass GM walkout. The debate has pitted U.S. labor advocates eager to reduce Mexico\u2019s cost advantage against Mexican trade unions fighting to protect local jobs.  In the United States, the average GM assembly employee earns about $30 per hour before tax. By contrast, an assembly worker in Silao with 10 years experience was, until the shutdown, getting about $4.50 per hour before tax, including benefits like shopping vouchers, according to a pay-slip he showed Reuters.  When Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, he pledged to bring back manufacturing jobs lost since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in 1994. He also vowed to slash illegal immigration from Mexico.  Yet Silao\u2019s labor leaders say moving jobs from Mexico to the United States will only increase pressure on Mexican workers to migrate.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep jobs in Mexico for the sake of the United States,\u201d said Hugo Varela, the Guanajuato boss of Mexico\u2019s CTM trade union confederation, which represents GM workers. \u201cIt\u2019s what stops migration to the United States,\u201d he added. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t jobs here, people will try to cross.\u201d  In addition, the GM strike has Mexican business leaders worried that industrial unrest could spread here, where the leftist government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to help strengthen trade unions.  More than a dozen local workers, union officials and contractors of GM told Reuters their priority was defending local jobs. There has been little indication that Mexican autoworkers will show solidarity with the UAW.  EMPTY PARKING LOTS, ODD JOBS  Operations at the GM Silao plant ground to a halt on Oct. 1. Vast parking lots in front of the cream-yellow building were mostly empty this week. Fast food sellers set up on the perimeter of the sprawling plant complained business was bad, and local GM workers said they were trying to make ends meet with odd jobs.  The GM worker with the pay-slip said that during his furlough he was only receiving 55% of his regular wage. He shook his head when asked if he might strike to pressure GM for full pay. His chief concern, he said, was to keep his job - or ensure a proper severance.  \u201cMaybe we\u2019d go on strike if they tried to take the plant away,\u201d said the GM worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because he worried he could be fired for talking to the media.  The Silao shutdown has sparked temporary layoffs at another GM site in Mexico and some major suppliers locally, including American Axle & Manufacturing AXL.N, employees said.  In Washington, the GM strike has complicated Trump\u2019s push to get Congress to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the trade deal he brokered to replace NAFTA.  Democratic lawmakers allied with unions are resisting, saying Mexico must do more to implement tougher labor rules.  U.S. and Canadian unions accuse their Mexican peers of flouting international standards to undercut them, and hope tougher laws will make Mexico less attractive to offshoring.  Over the past two decades, Mexican annual automobile output has jumped 165% to more than 4.1 million according to the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, lifting Mexico from 11th to 6th place in the global rankings.  \u201cGETTING DESPERATE\u201d  By July 2019, the automotive industry made up more than 30% of the value of Mexico\u2019s total exports. Some 80% of those are sent to the United States, making Mexico highly sensitive to U.S. industrial disputes.  The U.S. strike at the No. 1 U.S. carmaker began on Sept. 16, with its 48,000 members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union seeking more pay and job security, a bigger share of company profits and protection of healthcare benefits.  In Silao, fears about the local economy are growing.  Jose Juan Campos, a contractor who said he had worked regularly at the GM plant from its opening until the strike, said he had never known a stoppage like it and that the firm was unlikely to take back many workers before Christmas.  \u201cPeople are getting desperate,\u201d he said.","392":"Slideshow ( 3 images )  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Tuesday it is upgrading an investigation into 1.7 million General Motors Co vehicles for windshield wiper failures.  The auto safety agency opened the probe in November 2018 to see if GM needed to expand a 2016 recall of 2013 model year Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain SUVs to cover additional vehicles.  The engineering analysis probe covers 2010-2012 and 2014-2016 Equinox and Terrain vehicles. NHTSA could demand a recall after it completes the probe.  NHTSA said it has reviewed 1,900 complaints and reports related to the issue in the 1.7 million vehicles.  NHTSA said it has seen elevated failure rates in the 1.7 million vehicles, even though GM said the recalled vehicles have \u201cdouble the warranty rate and five times the complaint rate.\u201d  GM said it \u201cfully cooperate to support their investigation. We do not believe these windshield washer systems are defective.\u201d  The wiper failures that prompted the 2016 recall were attributed to water and debris intrusion into the windshield wiper assembly ball joints, leading to excessive wear and eventual detachment of the ball joint.\u201d  GM said it was installing an improved windshield wiper motor and transmission assembly and relocating a drain hole at the base of the windshield.","393":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Thursday they plan to resume normal operations after they were forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan over concerns about the state\u2019s natural gas supply.

Fiat Chrysler said it would resume normal operations on Friday after it canceled two shifts at its Warren Truck and Sterling Heights Assembly plants on Thursday.  GM said late Wednesday it was suspending operations at 13 Michigan plants and its Warren Tech Center due to the CMS request. It resumed limited operations at five engine, transmission and stamping plants on Thursday afternoon.  GM said late on Thursday it would resume operations on Friday at all manufacturing facilities and some critical labs, testing and other limited locations.  GM said employees at three locations including the Tech Center will work from Friday and added it expects normal operations to resume in full over the weekend.  Ford Motor Co said it had also taken steps to reduce energy use at its four Michigan plants supplied by CMS.  CMS, the parent company of Consumers Energy, took the unusual step of issuing an urgent appeal to 1.8 million Michigan customers on Wednesday asking them to lower their thermostats to ease the burden on the system due to the fire and record cold weather.  The company said Thursday that consumers could resume normal usage at 12:01 a.m. Friday.  CMS Chief Executive Patricia Poppe said earlier on Thursday about 79 large users in Michigan including major automakers, other manufacturers and two universities had curtailed their natural gas usage. Along with individual consumers, usage had fallen by about 10 percent over anticipated demand, she said at a news conference on Thursday.  Michigan State University said it cut hot water to some buildings and reduced temperatures in some buildings.

GM plans to invest both in advanced propulsion systems for electric vehicles and in core products such as trucks and utility vehicles that generate much of its profit, the company said on Monday.  Some of that investment is earmarked for the production of electric vehicles in Michigan and battery cells in Ohio, sources said.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Nikola founder Trevor Milton, whose company become a darling of the stock market over the summer, resigned as executive chairman on Monday following accusations by short-seller Hindenburg Research on Sept. 10 that he made false claims about Nikola\u2019s technology.  Milton has fought back, even after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice said they were looking into the company.  Nikola shares were down 20% in trading Monday, and have lost more than 45% of their value since Sept. 8, when it announced an alliance to build electric and fuel cell trucks with GM.  Nikola\u2019s alliance with GM, and earlier partnerships to develop fuel cell and electric commercial trucks with Bosch and CNH Industrial\u2019s Iveco unit are critical to the startup\u2019s effort to regain traction. On Monday, Nikola said board member Steve Girsky, a former GM vice chairman, would take over as chairman.  Last week, Girsky defended the due diligence his firm, VectoIQ, did before it purchased Nikola in a reverse merger that took the startup public.  GM has agreed to build an electric pickup for Nikola and supply batteries and hydrogen fuel cells for commercial trucks. In return, GM was supposed to receive an 11% stake in Nikola and payments of up to $700 million for assembling the Nikola Badger pickup.  \u201cWe will work with Nikola to close the transaction we announced nearly two weeks ago,\u201d GM spokesman Jim Cain said in a Monday email.

However, Hindenburg Research founder Nathan Anderson said in an email Monday that Milton\u2019s exit was \u201conly the beginning of Nikola\u2019s unraveling.\u201d  \u201cGeneral Motors should carefully evaluate the potential long-term damage to its 112 year brand by continuing to tie itself to Nikola,\u201d Anderson wrote.  Italy's CNH Industrial CNHI.MI declined to comment on Monday. CNH said last week it and Nikola were working to build prototypes of the startup's Tre seimi-truck, and CNH aimed to start testing the trucks later this year with hopes to begin selling them by the fourth quarter of 2021.  CNH invested $250 million in Nikola last September and owns about 7.11% of Nikola\u2019s shares.

These sources say that some unexpected technical challenges - including the difficulty that Cruise cars have identifying whether objects are in motion - mean putting GM\u2019s driverless cars on the road in a large scale way in 2019 is looking highly unlikely.  \u201cNothing is on schedule,\u201d said one GM source, referring to certain mileage targets and other milestones the company has already missed.  Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt told Reuters last month the service will offer passengers \u201ca primary form of transportation\u201d most anywhere they want to go, and compete with Uber and Lyft. Using driverless cars to carry fare-paying customers would allow Cruise to recover investments in expensive technology and turn a profit more rapidly than trying to sell self-driving cars to the few individual customers who could afford them.  In addition, operating self-driving cars in a taxi service would allow Cruise and GM to tailor the service to the limitations of the technology until software and sensors are ready to enable autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere.  \u201cBased on where we\u2019re at and where we\u2019ve been, we\u2019re on track to hit that\u201d 2019 goal, Vogt said.  Still, some close to the project acknowledge the length of time and money it will take to get the ride hailing service up and running.  \u201cWe know we aren\u2019t commercially ready now,\u201d said Michael Ronen, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers and the firm\u2019s lead investor on the Cruise deal who will join Cruise\u2019s board of directors. \u201cI think now the question is who is going to be successful and how quickly.\u201d  Reuters has learned that the driverless Cruise cars still struggle to identify whether objects on the road are moving or stationary, according to one current and three former Cruise employees who have witnessed the problem. The result is that the vehicles hesitate and stop while passing a row of parked motorcycles or bicycles, they said.  At times, the software has failed to recognize pedestrians, and has mistakenly seen phantom bicycles, causing the cars to brake erratically, according to two of the sources. And Cruise does not yet have a data-sharing collaboration with the San Francisco Fire Department, a necessary step to train the cars to respond to fire truck sirens, according to a fire department spokesman.

REUTERS\/Heather Somerville  In addition, the open-source software robotics tools that Cruise used to develop the technology has delays that slow messages from the car\u2019s sensors to the car\u2019s brain, according to a fourth former employee and nine other people familiar with Cruise\u2019s technology.  Cruise\u2019s Vogt said the next generation of hardware and software and sensors in the pipeline can help address these issues and will improve performance.  \u201cEarly in development I\u2019m sure there were phases where we were putting systems together where they didn\u2019t meet the requirements we needed for launch, and that\u2019s part of the testing and development process,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cSafety is our measure for launching, and so we certainly will (resolve that) by the time we will release cars on the road without drivers,\u201d he added.  GM\u2019s drive to be seen as a leader in autonomous vehicle technology is critical at a time when the automaker\u2019s shares are down more than 20 percent for the year. The delivery of capital promised by Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Honda depends on Cruise achieving certain performance targets.  Cruise\u2019s competitors face their own challenges, and some experts predict that a shakeout of rival efforts is inevitable. Uber, for example, had to overhaul its production timeline following a fatal crash with one of its self-driving SUVs. Though the autonomous vehicle program remains paused after the crash, a company official said Uber is making progress, building in safeguards to improve the overall functionality and safety of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars.  \u201cEveryone in the industry is becoming more and more nervous that they will waste billions of dollars,\u201d said Klaus Froehlich, a board member at BMW and its head of research and development.  \u201cCHALLENGE OF OUR GENERATION\u201d  GM President Dan Ammann calls developing an automated vehicle that can navigate city streets more safely than a human driver the \u201cthe engineering challenge of our generation,\u201d and a project that will ultimately take years and billions of dollars to fully develop.  \u201cRight now we are in a race to the starting line,\u201d he said in an interview with Reuters.  \u201cGetting stuck on one particular parameter, or one particular scenario, is missing the fundamental point of what is the total overall performance of the system,\u201d said Ammann.  Cruise\u2019s 2019 goal will go forward only if the Cruise system achieves the safety standards the automaker has established, and shown to regulators, he added.  Cruise says it has not begun offering rides to the public, and the cars are not operating without a safety driver. The company has yet to apply for permits to give passengers a ride without a driver, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission.  SoftBank says it factored in setbacks for the technology into its $2.25 billion agreement with Cruise. One provision says more than half of SoftBank\u2019s investment will come only when Cruise can commercially deploy vehicles in fully driverless operation, according to GM public filings.  \u201cIt\u2019s a speculative investment,\u201d said SoftBank\u2019s Ronen. \u201cThese are still unproven technologies.\u201d  (For a graphic on SoftBank's investments, click tmsnrt.rs\/2yrKBQ9)  In unveiling plans for a $2.8 billion investment in Cruise earlier this month, Honda executive Seiji Kuraishi said he sees potential in Cruise because of its tie-up with GM, and most of its investment will come after Cruise\u2019s 2019 deadline and will be spread over 12 years.  Shortly after the GM acquisition in 2016, Cruise leadership acknowledged internally they faced a decade-long technical challenge, according to a former Cruise employee.  Vogt gave a speech at the time to his employees and asked them not to pull all-nighters or burn themselves out, said the source, who was present for the talk.  Cruise and GM began missing early milestones they had set together, including the first deadline less than a year after the GM acquisition of Cruise, according to two former Cruise employees and a former GM employee.  Public records with the San Francisco Department of Motor Vehicles and an industry source familiar with the matter tell of other missed targets. It failed, for example, to have Cruise cars record the fewest number of times a human has to take control of a vehicle versus is rivals in 2017. Cruise also missed the goal of logging a million miles a month by early 2018.  The company said the mileage goal was based on its testing footprint at the time, which still included a significant chunk of testing in settings like suburban Phoenix. It has since heavily refocused efforts on testing in San Francisco, where total mileage is lower, but the company expects a higher rate of \u201clearning\u201d due to the complexity of the environment.  \u201cWith 10 engineers, you can bolt a bunch of sensors onto a car and put a computer in it and get it to drive around the block,\u201d Vogt told Reuters. A commercial product is \u201cabout 10,000 times harder,\u201d he said.","400":"DETROIT\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Thursday workers at General Motors Co will stay off the job while they vote on a proposed contract that delivers higher pay for full-time workers and better terms for temporary workers, but allows the automaker to close three U.S. plants.  Striking United Auto Workers (UAW) members rally in front of General Motors World headquarters in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., October 17, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  Union leaders are giving the 48,000 striking workers until Oct. 25 to vote on the contract terms, but have recommended ratification of the deal.  The decision to keep the strike going for another week reflects the pressure on top UAW leaders amid a continuing federal corruption probe of the union. Disappointment among rank and file at the failure to prevent the plant shutdowns and block GM from moving work to Mexico could be challenges for union leaders as they seek to have the deal ratified.  In 2015, rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV rejected the first version of a contract. This time, UAW leaders are keeping workers on strike pay of $275 a week while they decide on the tentative agreement.  \u201cOur members will make this decision,\u201d UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said at a press conference at the Detroit building where GM is based. \u201cIt is their contract. It is in their hands.\u201d  GM hopes the deal can be approved expeditiously. \u201cWe encourage the UAW to move as quickly as possible through the ratification process, so we can resume operations and get back to producing vehicles for our customers,\u201d the company said in a statement.  GM shares closed down 1.3% at $36.19 on Thursday, after a modest rally on Wednesday following the UAW\u2019s announcement it had reached a tentative contract deal.  On Wall Street, reaction to the proposed agreement, the highlights of which the union released, has been muted. \u201cWe continue to believe that if this is ratified, it is a fairly solid outcome for GM,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote in a note Thursday. \u201cThe financial implications of the deal don\u2019t look too onerous.\u201d  The strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, the use of lower-paid temporary workers and GM\u2019s production of vehicles in Mexico.  The strike cost GM an estimated $2 billion according to analysts, hurt auto suppliers and played a role in U.S. manufacturing output falling more than expected in September.  The longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event. Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines, eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that she had targeted for closure. The White House did not comment.  However, under the deal, GM will move ahead with closing Lordstown and two parts plants in Baltimore and Warren, Michigan. Workers from Lordstown on Thursday were outside GM\u2019s Detroit headquarters, where UAW leaders were meeting, to protest the planned agreement.  GM also appears to have dodged a significant addition to its long-term balance sheet liabilities by agreeing to make a one-time cash distribution to UAW members eligible for pensions.  The union said GM has agreed to put \u201cnew product\u201d in the company\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant as part of the deal. Details were not provided in the UAW summary but sources have said the plant will build electric trucks.  Separate from the UAW deal, GM on Thursday confirmed plans for an electric battery plant near the Lordstown complex that could eventually employ 1,000 people. Sources have said the battery plant would be a joint venture, where the workers are represented by the UAW and earn in the range of $15 to $17 an hour.  LORDSTOWN\u2019S DISPLACED WORKERS  GM has said it plans to sell the Lordstown plant to a group affiliated with electric truck startup Workhorse Group Inc that would initially employ 400 people - barely a tenth of the workforce Lordstown had when it was operating on three shifts. A Workhorse spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  A group of workers from the Lordstown plant stood outside the hotel ballroom where UAW leaders were meeting on Thursday, reading the UAW summary of the contract on smartphones. The Lordstown workers, some wearing red shirts with the slogan \u201cStop Building in Mexico,\u201d said they were not satisfied with what they saw.  Scott Gearhart, who worked for 26 years at Lordstown, said he is now working at GM\u2019s Wentzville, Missouri, pickup truck assembly plant, living in an apartment and driving 10 hours to go home on days off. \u201cI have my family at home. My mom\u2019s by herself,\u201d Gearhart said, explaining why he has not moved.  Tommy Woliko looked up from reading the contract summary on a smartphone. \u201cI\u2019m looking for something that says we\u2019re not losing jobs to Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cI see nothing.\u201d Woliko worked for 11 years at Lordstown before moving to GM\u2019s heavy duty pickup truck plant in Flint, Michigan.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very good experience working there,\u201d Woliko said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not home.\u201d  GM also is moving ahead with plans to invest $9 billion in the United States over the life of the next UAW deal, sources said. It also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial number of which would be new, a person familiar with the plans said. The UAW contract summary did not address these figures.  The UAW\u2019s summary of the contract terms did not include details of which GM plants would be receiving shares of the $7.7 billion in direct investments the company has outlined. In 2015, the UAW listed plants that would be getting investment and jobs in its contract summary. UAW spokesman Rothenberg said some of the investments in the current deal were not included in the national agreement.  As part of the push to protect jobs, the UAW said it will jointly form a committee with GM that would meet at least quarterly to discuss the impact of technologies like electric and self-driving vehicles and their impact on UAW members. This group would address instances where work has shifted out of the union due to new manufacturing processes.  The UAW has expressed concern it could lose thousands of workers at engine and transmission plants operated by the Detroit Three automakers as the companies launch more electric vehicles in coming years.  If the deal is approved by the workers, the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor Co or Fiat Chrysler, covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.","401":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co confirmed on Friday it will invest $300 million in a suburban Detroit assembly plant, adding 400 jobs to build a new Chevrolet electric vehicle.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  The largest U.S. automaker has come under heavy criticism from President Donald Trump in recent days over its decision to end production at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant earlier this month.  GM officials said the announcement was planned well before Trump\u2019s series of angry GM tweets that started on Saturday. Trump called GM CEO Mary Barra on Sunday to urge her to reverse the decision to end production at the Ohio plant, which is in a crucial state for the 2020 presidential election. He again ripped the company in a speech in Ohio on Wednesday.  Barra, speaking to reporters after an event at the plant in Orion Township, outside Detroit, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the investment, said GM is focused on ensuring that all of the hourly workers at Lordstown find new jobs at other plants. But she has shown no indication it will reverse course and reopen the Lordstown plant.  She declined to say if she thought there was more tension between GM and Trump.  \u201cWe want to create jobs, good paying jobs,\u201d Barra said, saying her talks with Trump had a \u201cbusiness focus.\u201d She said GM needs to remain \u201cstrong\u201d in order to continue to add jobs.  Reuters reported on Thursday on GM\u2019s investment plans for the plant.  Last year, GM said it would end production at five North American assembly plants and eliminate about 15,000 jobs, prompting outrage and a two-day visit by Barra to Capitol Hill to answer questions about the job cuts.  GM did not disclose the name or timing of the new GM EV but said it would be built on the same platform as the existing Chevrolet Bolt EV. GM did not disclose the name of the new EV or the timing of production.  The automaker said in total it is investing $1.8 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations this year, creating 700 new jobs and supporting 28,000 jobs across six states.  Additional product information and timing for the new Chevrolet EV will be released closer to production.  Barra said after event that GM \u201csupports\u201d the proposed United States, Mexico and Canada Agreement \u201cand we are making adjustments because we will comply\u201d with new rules requiring additional North American content.  Reuters reported Thursday that GM was initially considering building the new EV in China.  In February, GM disclosed that it had hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm run by Brian Ballard, a fundraiser for Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The company has been eager to try to smooth over relations with the White House after Trump first began harshly attacking GM last year.","402":"(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Friday Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson would resign from his position, effective Nov. 15, to join General Motors as CFO.

The decision came after GM faced months of criticism over its plan announced in November to close five North American plants and cut 15,000 jobs. GM\u2019s decision to close the small-car Ohio assembly plant in a key state in the 2020 election had already become fodder for several Democratic presidential candidates.  GM did not immediately comment but said it planned to make an announcement later in the day.  Trump, in a tweet, said the sale of the Ohio plant to Workhorse Group Inc will require the approval of the United Auto Workers union. Trump said GM will invest $700 million in three other Ohio facilities and add 450 jobs. A person briefed on the matter said GM will make investments in its Toledo, Parma and Lorain operations.  Workhorse shares jumped nearly 70 percent on Trump\u2019s tweet and were briefly halted. They were recently up about 40 percent. The UAW did not immediately comment.  Separately, GM and the largest union representing Canada\u2019s auto workers have reached a deal to partly rescue an Ontario car-making plant slated to close this year by turning it into a parts-making facility, the automaker said in a statement.

The decision, which affects four U.S. plants including one in Warren, Ohio, drew the condemnation of U.S. President Donald Trump and members of Congress.  The UAW, which will negotiate a new national labor deal with GM this year, has vowed to fight the cuts. The current labor contract was reached in 2015 and expires in September.  The union said there are about 1,000 laid-off hourly employees that have the right to transfer to plants with openings, including almost 700 at the Lordstown plant in Ohio. GM is employing temporary workers at its Fort Wayne Assembly plant rather than transferring workers, the UAW said.  \u201cUAW members negotiated a binding agreement and we expect General Motors to follow the contract they agreed to and GM members ratified,\u201d UAW Vice President Terry Dittes said in a statement.  In December, the UAW sent a letter to GM formally objecting to the decision to end production in 2019 at four U.S. plants, saying it violates commitments made during the contract talks in 2015. \u201cWe will use all of our resources to enforce our agreements,\u201d the union said in the letter.  GM said in a statement that it started the process to bring about 50 workers from the Lordstown plant to Indiana late last year and has ongoing talks with the union regarding staffing needs in Fort Wayne. It declined to comment directly on the lawsuit, however.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker has said the fate of the plants that have no future product allocated will be decided in talks with the UAW.  The union said in the lawsuit that on May 31, 2018, it approved GM\u2019s request to use temporary workers at the Indiana plant through the end of August 2018 to support the launch of new full-size pickup trucks.  GM sought to extend that period, and while the UAW agreed it had also pushed for the laid off pool of workers to eventually be hired to fill those openings, the lawsuit said.  GM ultimately lost the union\u2019s permission to use the temporary workers beyond the end of November, according to the lawsuit.  The UAW said many of the 690 Lordstown workers on layoff had applied to transfer to the openings at Fort Wayne. It is asking the court to make any affected workers whole through back wages lost, benefits, relocation costs and seniority credit.","410":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and medical equipment maker Ventec are speeding up efforts under a partnership code-named \"Project V\" to build ventilators at a GM plant in Kokomo, Indiana, to help combat the coronavirus outbreak.  Parts are machined at Twin City Die Castings, an employee-owned company making aluminum and magnesium parts for ventilator compressors and housings, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. February 12, 2014. Picture taken February 12, 2014. Twin City Die Castings Co\/Handout via REUTERS  GM said on Monday that work at its Indiana plant, which makes small electronic components for cars, is part of the effort to expand ventilator production. Sources said the GM-Ventec project is known internally as \u201cProject V.\u201d  As part of the effort to boost ventilator output from Ventec, GM has arranged for the supply of 95% of the parts needed to build the ventilator and is seeking to source the remaining 37 necessary parts, according to an email to suppliers from Shilpan Amin, GM\u2019s vice president of global purchasing.  The goal of the venture is to build up to 200,000 ventilators, said people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified.  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that U.S. automakers GM, Ford Motor Co F.N, and Tesla Inc TSLA.O had been given the green light to produce ventilators and other items needed during the coronavirus outbreak. It was not clear what Trump meant by the companies \"being given the go ahead.\"  \u201cVentec Life Systems and General Motors have been working around the clock to implement plans to build more critical care ventilators,\u201d GM spokesman Dan Flores said in an email on Monday. \u201cWith GM\u2019s support, Ventec is now planning exponentially higher ventilator production as fast as possible.  \u201cAs part of those efforts, GM is exploring the feasibility to build ventilators for Ventec at a GM facility in Kokomo, Indiana,\u201d he added.  First parts need to be delivered by suppliers to GM by April 6, the sources said. Supplier production could begin \u201cwithin the next 2-3 weeks,\u201d Amin said in his email. It was not clear when GM might begin production.  Creative Foam Corp in Fenton, Michigan, is one of the auto suppliers joining the effort, although it already had a division serving the healthcare sector.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The privately-owned company will start making foam parts for the ventilators\u2019 air filtration system this week, CEO Phil Fioravante said. \u201cWe already have installed capacity, so we\u2019re just repurposing it and utilizing it for this end.\u201d  In Minneapolis, auto supplier Twin City Die Castings Co, which had signed a contract to supply Ventec about nine months ago, quickly amped up its plans, CEO Todd Olson said. The employee-owned company makes aluminum and magnesium parts for the ventilator compressor and housing.  Now Twin City is converting the parts it was making into die casts for higher-volume production as the volume target has gone from making parts for 150 ventilators a month to as many as 20,000, he said.  Such a conversion would normally have taken 12 weeks to complete, Olson said, but is being done in one week as employees work almost non-stop. In addition, Twin City and rivals are sharing intellectual property to speed the process. \u201cLuckily, we had a nice jump on this,\u201d Olson said.  On Friday, GM and Ventec Life Systems said they were teaming up to increase Ventec\u2019s production of desperately needed ventilators. At the time, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said the automaker would explore other ways to help beyond helping Ventec scale up production.  Ford declined to comment on its efforts, but suppliers said the No. 2 U.S. automaker is part of a task force on face masks.  On Sunday, Fiat Chrysler Automobile NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N CEO Mike Manley told employees in an email that the Italian-American automaker would start converting one of its China plants to make face masks in the coming weeks and ultimately make over 1 million masks a month.  Last week, Reuters reported that FCA and Ferrari RACE.MI were working together to help boost ventilator production in Italy.  On Sunday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that the electric carmaker was working on ventilators, which \u201cshould arrive within a few days.\u201d He added that he expected Tesla to have about 1,200 to distribute this week.  Musk said the day before that he had had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic PLC MDT.N about ventilators.  He also said Sunday that Tesla also is working on getting other types of personal protective equipment and he told a hospital the company was sending masks and supplies.","411":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N will revive the Hummer name to sell a new family of electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles and will tout the return with a Super Bowl ad featuring NBA star LeBron James, two people briefed on the matter said on Friday.

REUTERS\/Geoff Robins  The vehicles will be sold under the GMC nameplate. Reuters reported in October that GM planned to build a new family of premium electric pickup trucks at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant beginning in late 2021 and was considering reviving the Hummer name, citing several people familiar with the plans.  The Wall Street Journal reported GM\u2019s decision to move forward earlier on Friday. GM declined to comment.  The electric truck and SUV program is the centerpiece of a planned $3 billion investment in the Detroit-Hamtramck plant to make electric trucks and vans, and part of a broader $7.7 billion investment in GM\u2019s U.S. plants over the next four years that was part of a new contract signed with the United Auto Workers union last year.  The investment moves the automaker into a part of the EV market that is largely untested and where GM has a higher likelihood of turning a profit, analysts said.  Reuters reported GM plans to first build EV pickups in late 2021 and then an electric SUV in 2023.  Tesla TSLA.O CEO Elon Musk in November unveiled an electric pickup called \"Cybertruck\" it plans to build starting in late 2021.  Rivian, a start-up electric company backed by Amazon.com AMZN.O, will begin building 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon starting in 2021.  Hummers were rugged civilian utility vehicles with low gas mileage that were inspired by military vehicles and were popular with such celebrities as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger but derided by environmentalists as gas-guzzlers. GM shut down its Hummer brand after a deal to sell the SUV-line to an obscure Chinese machinery maker was blocked by Chinese regulators in 2010.  Michael Harley, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book, noted \u201cthe original Hummer was ostracized out of showrooms for being heavy and ponderous with an insatiable appetite for gasoline. An all-electric powertrain essentially exonerates the truck on all charges.\u201d  Electric pickups and SUVs - the heart of the U.S. market - could help Ford Motor Co F.N and GM generate significant sales of EVs needed to meet tougher California emission standards and electric vehicle mandates.  The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards \u2013 and eliminate extra credits that automakers receive from EV sales but electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails.","412":"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co said on Friday it was joining General Motors in exiting a group of automakers that had backed U.S. President Donald Trump in his bid to prevent California from imposing its own vehicle emissions rules.  Last week, GM reversed course in the ongoing court fight, winning praise from Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. In October 2019, GM joined Toyota Motor Corp, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Nissan and other automakers supporting Trump effort\u2019s to bar California from setting its own fuel-efficiency rules, or zero-emission requirements, for vehicles. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler)","413":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Thursday it was setting a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift by the largest U.S. automaker away from gasoline and diesel engines.  GM, which also said it plans to become carbon neutral by 2040, made the dramatic announcement just over a week after President Joe Biden took office pledging to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and boost sales of electric vehicles (EVs).  GM sold 2.55 million vehicles in the United States last year, but only about 20,000 were EVs, the Chevy Bolt hatchback. It said in November it was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, up from $20 billion planned before the coronavirus pandemic.  GM\u2019s stock, which climbed as much as 7.4% on Thursday, closed up 3.5%.  Chief Executive Mary Barra has aggressively pushed GM to embrace electric vehicles and shift away from gasoline-powered vehicles.  She said in a statement the automaker had worked with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), an environmental advocacy group, to \u201cdevelop a shared vision of an all-electric future and an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035.\u201d  Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas said the decision is \u201cbased principally on economic grounds... Would GM decide to wind down a business in under 15 years if it truly felt it would spin off cash and provide positive economic value?\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Jonas added that investors should look for most if not all automakers \u201cto follow GM\u2019s precedent.\u201d  In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state plans to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035. Several states, including Massachusetts, say they plan to follow suit.  Newsom called GM\u2019s announcement a \u201cgamechanger\u201d but the California Air Resources Board said \u201cif GM is serious about cleaning up the air our children breathe today, it must also drop its defense of the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks of federal vehicle emissions standards.\u201d  GM and other major automakers sided with Trump last year in a legal challenge to his rollback of federal vehicle emissions standards through 2026.  However, in November, GM withdrew from a separate legal case in which it had sided with the Trump administration effort to bar California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules.  Last week, Biden directed U.S. agencies to reconsider the Trump emissions rollback and the revocation of California\u2019s emissions authority.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  GM is \u201copen to working with California and the Biden Administration to achieve agreement on a national standard and complementary policies to accelerate the electrification of the light-duty transportation sector,\u201d the company said in a separate statement.  However, in announcing the change, GM reaffirmed a commitment to producing zero-emission vehicles.  \u201cWe\u2019re taking actions so that we can eliminate tailpipe emissions by 2035,\u201d Dane Parker, GM\u2019s chief sustainability officer, said at the media briefing. \u201cSetting a goal for us 15 years from now is absolutely reachable.\u201d  EDF President Fred Krupp said in a statement: \u201cwith this extraordinary step forward, GM is making it crystal clear that taking action to eliminate pollution from all new light-duty vehicles by 2035 is an essential element of any automaker\u2019s business plan.\u201d  GM also said it will source 100% renewable energy to power its U.S. sites by 2030 and global sites by 2035, five years ahead of a prior goal.  David Friedman, a vice president at Consumer Reports and a former Obama administration auto regulator, said \u201cstrong aspirations are important and inspirational, but firm production plans and strong policies are what move the market and the climate.\u201d  More than half of GM\u2019s capital spending and product development team will be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs, GM said.  Biden on Monday vowed to replace the U.S. government\u2019s fleet of roughly 650,000 vehicles with electric models as the new administration shifts its focus toward clean energy.","414":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday for a new four-year labor deal, moving closer to ending a costly month-long strike that shut down GM\u2019s most profitable factories in a test of wills over the future of U.S. auto industry jobs.  Neither the UAW nor GM released details of the deal, which is subject to ratification by UAW members, a process that could last up to two weeks. A new contract is expected to include commitments by the automaker to invest billions in U.S. vehicle factories to build new generations of electric vehicles, as well as U.S. electric vehicle battery plants. Union leaders worry that a shift to electric vehicles could cost thousands of jobs at engine and transmission factories.  The longest nationwide strike against a Detroit automaker since 1970 became a political event. Democratic presidential candidates joined UAW picket lines, eager to win union votes in Midwest swing states. For his part, U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on GM Chief Executive Mary Barra before the strike to preserve jobs at a car plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that she had targeted for closure.  Trump spoke individually with Barra and UAW President Gary Jones on Wednesday, spokesmen for GM and the union confirmed. The White House declined to comment on the discussions.  Details of GM\u2019s last offer emerged over the weekend and Reuters had reported that the company boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion. That figure is unchanged in the final agreement, a person briefed on the matter said.  The deal also would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a \u201csubstantial\u201d number of which will be new, the source said. GM in September said its initial offer would support 5,400 jobs - and a majority of those would be new jobs.  If the contract is ratified, UAW workers who have been living on $250 a week in strike pay are expected to get one-time signing bonuses, as well as increases to base pay. The union had also pushed for temporary workers at GM plants who earned less than permanent UAW employees to get an easier path to full-time wages and benefits.  GM shares closed 1.1% higher at $36.65 on Wednesday after rising as much as 2.6% during the day. Shares of some auto parts suppliers also rose after the UAW announced the tentative deal. The cost of the strike - and how quickly those costs can be recovered - will be a focus for investors as the automaker and its major suppliers report quarterly results over the next several days.  Analysts have estimated the strike cost GM more than $2 billion in lost production, though some of that could be made up through overtime work. The strike halted production of GM\u2019s large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles - key drivers of the company\u2019s global profit.  POLITICAL EVENT  The deal is not done yet. The union\u2019s national GM council will decide whether to accept the agreement during a meeting on Thursday. Then UAW members at GM will vote on the agreement. The strike continues at least until Thursday\u2019s meeting, the UAW said in a statement.  The strike began on Sept. 16, with about 48,000 hourly workers of the UAW union at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM has indicated it may close, and the use of temporary workers.  GM\u2019s revised offer that emerged over the weekend also included an increase of its proposed ratification bonus by $1,000 to $9,000. GM also proposed 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively. It agreed to make temporary workers with three years of service permanent and give those workers a $3,000 ratification bonus.  FILE PHOTO: A union strike sign is stuck in the fence outside the General Motors Flint Truck Assembly in Flint, Michigan, U.S., October 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  The final agreement is similar to that offer on pay and bonuses, but includes some enhancements, the person briefed on the matter said.  The automaker said during the talks that it had offered \u201csolutions\u201d for the Lordstown assembly plant and a large assembly plant in Detroit-Hamtramck that were targeted for closure. A group affiliated with electric truck maker Workhorse Group had proposed acquiring the Lordstown plant. GM also said it had proposed a \u201cunion represented battery cell manufacturing site in the U.S.\u201d  GM was considering using the Detroit-Hamtramck factory to build a new line of electric trucks, sources said.  These proposals could have changed or been dropped in the final days of the talks.  If the deal is approved by the workers, the union will next begin negotiations with Ford Motor Co or Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA), covering many of the same issues. The UAW previously agreed to temporary contract extensions with both automakers while it focused on GM.  A successful ratification is not a sure thing as workers during the 2015 talks initially rejected a deal with FCA before eventually approving a revised offer.  SHARING THE REWARDS  This year\u2019s talks have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  For GM and the UAW, the bargaining came at a time of industry uncertainty following nine years of strong sales and robust profit, fueled by the trucks and SUVs built by UAW workers. GM\u2019s Barra and President Mark Reuss joined the bargaining on Tuesday, indicating a deal was close.  Union leaders said the rewards of GM\u2019s recovery from its 2009 bankruptcy had not been shared fairly. Inflation-adjusted wages for all U.S. auto workers have fallen 16% since 2010, and UAW workers at the Detroit Three have received only two base wage increases of 3% in the past nine years, according to CAR.  GM management, on the other hand, sees UAW wages as 26% higher than the average for non-union auto factories in the Southern United States. High absenteeism and rich health benefits add to the cost burdens at a time when U.S. vehicle sales are projected to decline and automakers are funding investments in electric vehicles.","415":"DETROIT, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Negotiators for General Motors Co and the United Auto Workers are scheduled to restart bargaining Monday to resolve a strike that shut down the automaker\u2019s highly profitable U.S. operations.  The UAW on Sunday launched the first company-wide strike at GM in 12 years, saying negotiations toward a new national agreement covering about 48,000 hourly workers had hit an impasse.  Workers took to picket lines outside GM factories, waving signs declaring \u201cUAW On Strike.\u201d During the walkout, UAW members will get $250 a week from the union\u2019s strike fund.  The UAW and GM said talks would resume at 10 A.M (1400 GMT) Monday.  The strike quickly became a political issue, as both U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats who want to unseat him in 2020 weighed in. Trump and Democrats see the votes of UAW members in the Midwest as critical to victory.  Trump on Sunday took to Twitter to urge the UAW and GM to \u201cget together and make a deal!\u201d. GM spokesman Tony Cervone said the automaker \u201ccouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d with Trump\u2019s call.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra met with Trump ahead of the strike deadline. Trump has attacked GM for Barra\u2019s decision to stop building small cars at an assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio. The state is pivotal to Trump\u2019s re-election.  The union wants to stop GM from closing Lordstown and an assembly plant in Detroit. The UAW has said workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.  GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in southern U.S. states.  In a statement Sunday, GM outlined its offer to the union, saying the package included solutions for the Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products, $7 billion in U.S. investment and a signing bonus of $8,000 per worker.  A person familiar with GM\u2019s offer said the company could produce a future electric vehicle at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant that now has no future assignment.  GM could also build an electric vehicle battery plant in Lordstown, and go through with the proposed sale of the plant to a group affiliated with electric vehicle start-up Workhorse Group Inc.  A new battery plant could give some UAW workers at Lordstown the chance to remain with GM.  The UAW\u2019s top negotiator at GM said the proposal came just two hours before the strike deadline, and laid blame for the strike on the automaker.  \u201cHad we received this proposal earlier in the process, it may have been possible to reach a tentative agreement and avoid a strike,\u201d UAW Vice President Terry Dittes wrote in a letter to GM on Sunday, according to a copy viewed by Reuters.  A strike will very quickly shut down GM\u2019s operations across North America and could hurt the broader U.S. economy. Prolonged industrial action would also cause hardship for GM hourly workers on greatly reduced strike pay. Suppliers of parts and services to GM\u2019s U.S. operations could also suffer from a long shutdown, as could dealers and consumers.

The GM logo is seen at the General Motors headquarters in Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil March 13, 2018. Picture taken March 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Leonardo Benassatto  In a message posted at Brazilian plants, GM\u2019s top executive in Brazil and Argentina, Carlos Zarlenga, said after running up a heavy loss over the past three years the operation had reached \u201ca critical moment that will require sacrifices from everyone.\u201d  The memo referenced comments that Chief Executive Mary Barra made during investor presentations last week about challenges in South America. \u201cWe are not going to keep deploying capital to lose money,\u201d she said, in a quote repeated by Zarlenga.  GM representatives in Brazil did not immediately comment on the memo, which was first reported by newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo.  The dire tone came as a shock to some workers in Brazil, where GM has overtaken Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI to become the industry sales leader as the economy rebounds slowly from a deep slump.  Union leader Renato Almeida called GM\u2019s statement \u201cabsurd.\u201d  \u201cThe company is going through a good moment in Brazil,\u201d said Almeida, vice president of a metalworkers union in Sao Jose dos Campos. \u201cThere is no justification for them to suggest they would shut down operations.\u201d  In April 2018, Zarlenga touted a new family of low-cost cars hitting Brazilian dealerships this year as he played up progress in an interview with Reuters. He said cost reductions in the downturn, including a 35 percent cut to the Brazilian workforce, contributed to a narrow profit in South America in 2017.  While Brazil\u2019s economy has gradually recovered after a 2015-16 recession, Argentina fell back into recession last year as inflation surged and its currency cratered. Investors are watching to see if the presidents of both countries can pull off the tough economic reforms they have promised.  Zarlenga said regional executives had prepared a \u201cviability plan\u201d for senior management in Detroit, but they still need the support of local unions, suppliers, dealerships and government. \u201cGM investments and our future depend on this plan,\u201d he said.  Last year, Brazil\u2019s government granted carmakers a 15-year package of tax breaks \u2013 extending subsidies for an industry that has struggled to compete directly with production elsewhere.  Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who took office with a new government this month, has said Brazil cannot afford to keep subsidizing powerful industries, arguing that an end to protectionist policies will make the economy more competitive.","417":"FORT WAYNE, Ind., Aug 9 (Reuters) - When General Motors Co engineers were developing the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, some of them joined public tours of Ford Motor Co\u2019s Dearborn, Michigan factory to watch aluminum-bodied F-series trucks go down the assembly line.  The redesign of the Ford F-series trucks, launched in 2014, set a new standard for fuel economy and lightweight vehicle construction. But armed with stopwatches and trained eyes, the GM engineers believed they saw problems.  \u201cThey had a real hard time getting those doors to fit,\u201d Tim Herrick, the executive chief engineer for GM truck programs told Reuters.  His team did more intelligence gathering. They bought and tore apart Ford F-series doors sold as repair parts. Their conclusion: GM could cut weight in its trucks for a lower cost using doors made of a combination of aluminum and high strength steel that could be thinner than standard steel, shaving off kilograms in the process.  These pounds and penny-based decisions will have major implications in the highest stakes game going in Detroit: dominance in the world\u2019s most profitable vehicle market, the petrol-fueled large pickup segment. What\u2019s more, GM is banking on strong sales of overhauled 2019 Silverados and GMC Sierras to fund its push into automated, electric vehicles \u2013 a business many investors see as the auto industry\u2019s long term future.  The risks are high given the hits automakers have taken from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies.  Rising aluminum prices spurred by Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up costs on the Ford\u2019s F-series, while rising steel and aluminum prices drag on GM results. GM also has a significant risk should the United States, Mexico and Canada fail to agree on a new NAFTA trade deal, given GM trucks built at its Silao, Mexico factory could face a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA collapses.  Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2IgOECU  Interviews with GM executives and a tour at its factory here in northwest Indiana provide a detailed look inside GM\u2019s plan for the most important vehicles in its global lineup.  These big pickups are everything Tesla Inc\u2019s Model 3 or a Chevy Bolt electric car is not.  The mostly steel body is bolted to the truck\u2019s steel frame, rather than the one-piece body and frame electric vehicles. The majority of trucks will have a V-8 gasoline engine in front powering the rear wheels \u2013 like the classic GM cars of the 1950s. Some Silverados will have new four-cylinder engines, but there is no electric or hybrid offering as of now. The new Silverado - GM\u2019s top-selling vehicle in the United States - is a technology achievement of a different kind.  It is taller and has a longer wheelbase than its beefy predecessor, which can help it more easily meet federal fuel efficiency rules. But it is 450 pounds lighter, and its V-8 engine achieves 23 mile per gallon on the highway that rivals smaller SUVs.  Wall Street investors give Tesla and its electric vehicles a higher value than GM\u2019s shares. GM is betting that its core customers in the American heartland will keep paying premium prices - 27 percent of GM trucks sell for more than $55,000 - for these vehicles capable of hauling a trailer by day and substituting for a luxury sedan by night.  Large pickups generate at least $17,000 a vehicle in pre-tax profit for GM, the company has indicated in disclosures to investors. GM executives told Reuters that with the new trucks, GM will have a big cost advantage they can use to chop at Ford\u2019s leading market share.  \u201cWe think we have thousands of dollars advantage (over Ford) just in the aluminum costs. It\u2019s big,\u201d said Herrick during a walk through the Fort Wayne plant, which began shipping the new Silverados and Sierras late last month.  He said GM plans to use its Silverado cost advantage to put more safety or entertainment technology in the trucks, fund programs such as a promised fleet of electric cars and return money to shareholders.  At Ford, truck marketing manager Todd Eckert said the company plans to stick to its game plan. For 41 years, the F-series trucks have been the best-selling single model line in the United States. For the first half of this year, the F-series line \u2013 which ranges from the light-duty F-150 to medium duty commercial trucks \u2013 has a 59,000 vehicle lead over the combined Chevrolet and GMC large pickups.  \u201cThere\u2019s always been competition in this segment and there always will be,\u201d Eckert said.  Ford\u2019s purchasing director Hau Thai-Tang at an investor conference on Wednesday called the F-series pickup \u201cone of our profit pillars,\u201d and said Ford plans to increase the share of its 2018-2022 product development budget allocated to trucks and commercial vehicles to 29 percent from 24 percent in its prior 2015-2019 plan.  A LIGHT METAL DUEL  For decades, Ford and GM matched each other\u2019s moves closely and built trucks that were similar in design, technology and capability.  With the launch of GM\u2019s new trucks, the rivals\u2019 technology strategies have diverged.  Ford in 2014 launched a new generation of F-series trucks with all-aluminum body structures for its big pickup trucks, and challenged rivals to find a better way match the fuel efficiency and towing power achieved using the lightweight metal and turbo-charged, six-cylinder engines.  Rising pressure from the U.S. government to slash carbon dioxide emissions made Ford\u2019s move look smart.  The debate within GM over whether to follow Ford\u2019s aluminum strategy \u201cwas a really hotly contested item for us,\u201d said Herrick. He recalled skeptical questions when he sought approval from GM\u2019s board for the billions of dollars required to launch the new Silverados at three factories.  \u201cSon, it really costs this much to build all those trucks?\u201d the 58-year-old executive recalled being asked by a member of the board.  Herrick, and Global Product Development chief Mark Reuss, said the shareholders\u2019 billions would be better spent on what they call a \u201cmulti-material\u201d strategy.  The new Silverado and Sierra got close to the Ford truck\u2019s weight using seven different grades of steel in the cab, aluminum hoods, door exterior panels and tailgates. Reuss pushed development of a novel carbon fiber plastic that will be molded to make load beds for certain high-priced GMC models \u2013 and perhaps be used in different ways in future GM models, Reuss said.  Before GM\u2019s direction was clear, a supplier to Ford sent Reuss a box of the rivets his competitor was using to fasten the F-series aluminum body panels together, anticipating he\u2019d be ordering them, too.  \u201cThey\u2019re still on my desk,\u201d Reuss said in an interview.  The combination of weight reduction and engine technology produces a rear-wheel drive 2019 Silverado with a 5.3 liter V-8 and an eight-speed automatic transmission that averages 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway, with a combined rating of 19 miles per gallon.  A Ford F-150 with a 3.5 liter turbo six cylinder is rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city, 21 on the highway and 19 combined, according to the government.  FOUR DOORS FOR PROFIT  In some crucial ways, GM is following Ford.  GM previously could not keep pace with demand for crew cab pickups \u2013 models with four, sedan-style doors in the cab. Ford used its lead in crew cab design to develop luxury truck models, such as the F-450 Limited, that have sticker prices as high as $100,000.  Average selling prices in the segment are around $42,000 to $45,000 - higher than the industry average.  GM has now dedicated two factories to building light duty pickups - in Fort Wayne and Silao, Mexico - which have the flexibility to build \u201cdarn near 100 percent crew cabs if we wanted,\u201d Herrick said.  The GMC marketing division, meanwhile, is putting more emphasis on its Denali luxury truck brand, while Chevrolet will market more luxurious versions of the Silverado such as the frontier-themed High Country, which has leather seats and a Bose sound system. GM executives said they want to increase the company\u2019s share of trucks sold at prices above $55,000 from the current 27 percent.  John Bergstrom, who owns a multi-brand network of dealerships based in Neenah, Wisconsin, said the new GM trucks should pull in buyers who currently don\u2019t drive a pickup.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the technology we needed,\u201d Bergstrom said. With the new truck, \u201cwe\u2019ve got that. They almost magically figured out how to get fuel economy out of these things.\u201d","418":"(Adds details, background)  WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday thanked General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV for \u201cstanding with\u201d his efforts to bar California from setting its own fuel efficiency rules for cars and trucks.  \u201cCalifornia has treated the Auto Industry very poorly for many years, harming Workers and Consumers,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.  The automakers\u2019 decision to side with the Trump administration follows legal challenges by California and 22 states and environmental groups in September.  Those challenges aim to undo the administration\u2019s determination that federal law bars California from setting its own stiff tailpipe emission standards and zero-emission vehicle mandates.  The decision to back Trump, disclosed in a filing with a U.S. appeals court late on Monday, could prompt a furious backlash from Democrats and environmentalists.  It also poses a risk for the automakers if a Democrat wins the White House in next year\u2019s election and reverses Trump\u2019s actions, and also reinstates California\u2019s right to set its own rules and tougher national emissions standards adopted under former President Barack Obama.

GM workers and politicians, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have blasted GM for the decision, which is likely to close those plants.  The move comes at a time when the U.S. market looks set to decline, with 2019 industry-wide new vehicle sales expected to fall below 2018 levels.

The plans also include a $900 million investment to modernize and retool another Detroit plant to make the Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

The plant, to be built at a new site near GM\u2019s closed assembly plant in Lordstown in northeast Ohio, will employ more than 1,100 people, the companies said. Construction is to begin in mid-2020 and the plant will have an annual capacity of more than 30 gigawatt hours with the flexibility to expand.  At a media briefing, Chief Executive Mary Barra said the 50-50 joint venture with LG Chem is aimed at \u201cdramatically enhancing electric vehicle affordability and profitability.\u201d  Barra said the investment in the Ohio battery plant will accelerate the automaker\u2019s initiative to introduce 20 new electric vehicles globally by 2023.  \u201cGeneral Motors believes in the science of global warming and believes in an all-electric future,\u201d she said.  Barra said the new battery cells will be used in a new GM electric pickup which will start production in fall 2021 at the company\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck plant. Barra said the plant eventually will \u201chave more than one product.\u201d  Reuters reported earlier that the plant is expected to build at least four different electric vehicles, including an SUV for Cadillac and a pickup for GMC.  The Ohio battery cell plant will boost LG Chem\u2019s global battery capacity to 100 gigawatt-hours by the end of 2020, said Hak-Cheol Shin, LG Chem vice chairman and CEO, at the media briefing.  Sources familiar with the plan said workers at the plant were expected to be represented by the United Auto Workers union and earn $15 to $17 an hour. If so, it would be the first unionized battery factory in the United States. Tesla\u2019s Nevada battery factory and LG Chem\u2019s battery plant in Michigan do not have unions.

The midsize SUV, priced starting at about $35,000, has become a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio. The Envision, assembled only in China, last year accounted for about 19 percent of Buick brand sales in the United States.  GM said in a statement that it filed the request on July 30 with the U.S. Trade Representative. An official notice was posted on Thursday on the regulations.gov website, which is tracking requests for exclusions from the so-called Section 301 tariff on certain imported goods from China.  GM, the largest U.S. automaker, argued in its request that Envision sales in China and the United States would generate funds \u201cto invest in our U.S. manufacturing facilities and to develop the next generation of automotive technology in the United States.\u201d  GM said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Envisions, about 200,000 a year, are sold in China. About 41,000 were sold last year in the United States.  Because of the lower U.S. sales volume, \u201cassembly in our home market is not an option\u201d for the Envision, which competes with such mid-size crossover vehicles as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Cadillac XT5.  GM has taken other steps to soften the blow of tariffs, which hit just as the automaker had lowered the price of the Envision to make it more competitive.  Ahead of the July 6 start for higher import tariffs, GM shipped in a six-month supply of Envisions at the much lower 2.5 percent tariff rate.  Envision sales from April through June plunged to just 7,000 vehicles, while inventories climbed to more than 13,000 vehicles at the end of June. At the current sales rate, the Envision supply should be enough to keep many dealers stocked through the end of the year.  GM had lowered prices by as much as $2,500 on the 2019 models, which it started shipping in late April. That means Buick\u2019s 2,000 U.S. dealers should have lower-priced Envisions to sell well into the fall.  \u201cThe previous price point was too high\u201d on the 2018 Envision, said Casey Clark, sales manager at Serra Buick GMC Cadillac in Washington, Michigan, in an interview. \u201cThat put off some customers.\u201d  With help from GM, Casey said, the mid-Michigan dealership has been able to offer hefty discounts on Envision of $5,000 and more.  GM has announced no plans to stop U.S. sales of the Envision or to relocate production of U.S.-bound models to another plant outside China, a source familiar with the company\u2019s strategy said on condition of anonymity.  GM has provided Buick dealers with incentives to keep Envisions in stock. These include financial offers to put Envisions into fleets of vehicles loaned to customers whose cars are being repaired, the source said.  This year, GM plans to cut Envision imports to around 35,000 vehicles, more than half of which will be hit with the higher tariff, the source said.

Ahead of third-quarter results due on Oct. 31, GM shares are trading about 6 percent below the $33 per share price at which they launched in 2010 in a post-bankruptcy initial public offering.  The Detroit carmaker\u2019s stock is down 22 percent since Barra took over in January 2014. After hitting an all-time high of $46.48 on Oct. 24, 2017, the shares have declined 33 percent. In the same period, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has climbed 7.8 percent.  Several shareholders contacted by Reuters said GM could face a third major action by activist shareholders in less than four years if the share price does not improve.  \u201cI\u2019ve been expecting it,\u201d said John Levin, chairman of Levin Capital Strategies. \u201cIt just seems a tempting morsel to somebody.\u201d Levin\u2019s firm owns more than seven million GM shares.  Barra has guided the company through the settlement of a federal criminal probe of a mishandled safety recall, sold off money-losing European operations, and returned $25 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks from 2012 through 2017.  GM declined to comment for this story, but the company\u2019s executives privately express frustration with the market\u2019s reluctance to see it as anything more than a manufacturer tied mainly to auto market sales cycles.  GM\u2019s profitable North American truck and SUV business and its money-making China operations are valued at just $14 billion, excluding the value of GM\u2019s stake in its $14.6 billion Cruise automated vehicle business and its cash reserves from its $44 billion market capitalization.  The recent slump in the Chinese market, GM\u2019s largest, and plateauing U.S. demand are ratcheting up the pressure.  GM is one of the few global automakers without a founding family or a government to serve as a bulwark against corporate raiders.  In 2015, a group led by investor Harry Wilson pressed GM to launch a $5 billion share buyback, and commit to what is now an $18 billion ceiling on the level of cash the company would hold. In 2017, GM fended off a call by hedge fund manager David Einhorn to split its common stock shares into two classes.  Einhorn, whose firm still owned more than 21 million shares at the end of June, declined to comment about GM\u2019s stock price.  Other investors said there were no clear alternatives to Barra\u2019s approach.  \u201cI\u2019m clearly a frustrated investor,\u201d said Michael Razewski, a partner with Douglas C. Lane & Associates, which owned 2.57 million GM shares at the end of September. \u201cGM is a name that I am still particularly bullish about despite years of disappointment.\u201d  Some investors said they would welcome a spinoff or partial float of Cruise, or the creation of a tracking stock, as a way of calling attention to the potential value of GM\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology.  \u201cIn the near term, really the only way to drive this stock higher is via Cruise,\u201d Razewski said.  Some investors have given up waiting. Barometer Capital Management sold its 420,000 GM shares in the first quarter of 2017.  Barometer portfolio manager Jim Schetakis said GM should exit the money-losing sedan business like rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles have done and possibly split off its China operations.

The Detroit automaker, which resumed production on Monday after suspending operations in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, will launch a second shift next week only at its Lansing Delta Township plant. It will not immediately begin, as it had hoped, second shifts on Monday at its Ft Wayne, Indiana, Flint and Silao, Mexico plants that build full-size trucks, but could resume a second shift as early as later next week, the source said.  GM spokesman Dan Flores said \u201cdemand for our full size picks has been very strong so we are certainly exploring ways to add production and will do that when it makes sense.\u201d  Mexican auto parts production is only this week beginning to slowly resume. GM\u2019s decision to delay resuming some production shifts shows the challenges of resuming production with thousands of suppliers.  GM shares fell 1.2% on Friday in early trading.  Last week, GM suppliers were told the company planned to resume three-shift production at it Fort Wayne plant and other plants as soon as June 1.  Sales of big Detroit brand pickups, particularly in southern and western states less affected by the coronavirus outbreak, have recently significantly outperformed the market, industry executives say.  Large pickups, including Ford\u2019s F-series line, GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra and Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram, accounted for nearly 21% of all light vehicles sold in the United States in April, Ford vice president for U.S. sales, marketing and service Mark LaNeve said earlier this month. Normally, the pickup segment is 13% to 14% of total sales.","438":"DETROIT, March 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co executives on Wednesday will tackle one of their toughest tasks: Persuading investors that a Detroit automaker can catch up with Elon Musk and Tesla Inc as vehicles go electric.

On Tuesday, Tesla\u2019s market cap hovered around $144 billion, more than three times GM\u2019s $45 billion.  GM is by far the larger manufacturer by volume, and generates more cash and profits. But in the electric vehicle market, Tesla is the leader.  Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 electric vehicles globally, including 223,000 in the United States. GM sold just 16,400 Chevrolet Bolt EVs to U.S. buyers, and 60,000 Baojun E-Series models in China with joint venture partner SAIC Motor .  GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and President Mark Reuss have ramped up electric vehicle development over the past three years, focusing on a proprietary battery, a low-cost flexible vehicle design and a blueprint for high-volume production, mainly in China.  The company has revealed its electric vehicle strategy in incremental steps - announcing the Hummer brand will be reborn as an electric pickup and partnering with Korean battery maker LG Chem to build a $2.3 billion battery plant near a shuttered GM car plant in Lordstown, Ohio. GM is now trying to put the broader picture into focus for investors.  GM has said it aims to reduce the cost of battery cells - the single greatest expense in electric vehicles - to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour. That in turn could slash the cost of battery packs for electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV by up to 45%, experts say.  GM is also developing an advanced battery, in partnership with LG Chem and Japan\u2019s Honda Motor Co, that will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.  Musk has told investors that Tesla has battery cost and range breakthroughs in the works that it will describe at a \u201cBattery Day\u201d in April.  Barra has said GM plans to spend more on electric vehicles than on gasoline-powered cars over the next five years. But it has not put a figure on how much it will invest in its efforts to rival Tesla and traditional competitors such as Volkswagen AG or Ford Motor Co as the electric vehicle market develops.  Barra has, however, promised that GM will make money on electric cars by 2021.

GM is continuing to produce the Cruze in Mexico for other markets, but not for the United States.  GM noted that over 400 Lordstown employees have accepted offers at other GM locations, and it reiterated that jobs are available at other assembly plants for anyone willing to relocate to other states.

The 6.3-million-square foot Lordstown assembly complex has manufactured more than 16 million vehicles since it opened in 1966, including nearly 2 million Chevrolet Cruze cars since 2010.  In November, GM announced it would idle five North American plants, including Lordstown, and cut up to 15,000 jobs.  GM also disclosed on Tuesday in a notice to the state of Ohio it would cut 101 jobs at the West Chester, Ohio, service and parts warehouse and operations facility that is closing.  The automaker told employees of the plans in June 2018 to close the facility and shift the work to a new warehouse in Burton, Michigan. Ohio workers can move to Michigan if they choose, GM said.  Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio called Wednesday \u201ca heartbreaking day. ... These workers are the heart and soul of GM.\u201d  Separately, the UAW and the Communication Workers of America union sent a letter this week to the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee asking it to investigate significant corporate tax cuts received by GM and AT&T Inc even as they cut thousands of union jobs.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake  The year was 2000, and the researcher was helping a lawyer prepare a case on behalf of a young man who had been paralyzed when the Chevrolet Blazer he was driving flipped. It was one of thousands of lawsuits GM and other automakers faced over the years that claimed that the roofs of their vehicles easily crumpled in rollovers, resulting in severe injury and death.  GM invariably denied the allegations, arguing that roof strength made little difference. Now, Lawlor had in hand evidence to the contrary. Among other documents were 1980s test results showing that people wearing seatbelts in vehicles with stronger roofs were likely to suffer less severe injuries in a rollover.  Such evidence helped persuade a jury to award the plaintiff $15.4 million. But something continued to trouble Lawlor. Only a small fraction of the evidence was aired publicly at trial. Worse, to her mind, was that while dozens of plaintiff lawyers suing GM over roof-crush deaths and injuries had seen much of the same evidence over the previous decade, most of it remained hidden under court-mandated secrecy the lawyers had accepted.  In those 10 years, more than 5,000 seatbelt-wearing passengers died in GM rollover accidents, many more were injured, and the company was still pumping out new vehicles with similar roofs.  As Lawlor saw it, the plaintiff lawyers should have raised alarms. \u201cIf you see something so egregious, don\u2019t you think you have a responsibility to do something?\u201d she said.  Lawlor did do something. She embarked on a years-long campaign in and out of the courts to expose the evidence about GM vehicles\u2019 roof strength \u2014 a personal mission that culminated in 2016, when tougher federal standards for vehicle roofs took effect.  The secrecy that prompted her to action, however, has remained pervasive in U.S. courts. And as Reuters found, plaintiff lawyers in big product liability cases are often complicit in perpetuating it. Their willing participation in a process that hides critical information about potentially harmful and even deadly products prevents consumers from making informed choices and regulators from taking corrective action.  \u201cFar too many plaintiff lawyers miss the big picture about the good that can be done\u201d by pushing for more transparency in court, said Drew Ashby, a plaintiff lawyer with The Ashby Firm in Atlanta.  That clashes with the image plaintiff lawyers cultivate as champions of transparency, fighting to hold corporate America accountable for making and selling harmful products. As the then-president of the American Association for Justice, the plaintiff bar\u2019s main lobbying group, said in 2014: \u201cWhether it\u2019s dangerous cribs, defective drugs or exploding tires, court secrecy endangers consumers and allows corporations to hide wrongdoing. Americans have a right to know about hazardous and defective products.\u201d  COMPETING OBLIGATIONS  Dozens of plaintiff lawyers told Reuters they feel compelled to go along with entrenched court secrecy. The main reason, they said, is their duty to their clients, as spelled out in state bar association rules. Many plaintiffs have suffered catastrophic injuries and other hardships and literally can\u2019t afford to wait for disputes over what can and can\u2019t be made public as bills mount. Of course, such delays can also be costly to the lawyers, who get paid only when a case is settled or decided in their favor.  \u201cYou have to balance the need \u2026 for an attempt at prompt resolution for the people who are actually the victims of the defendants\u2019 conduct, and the need for public disclosure,\u201d said Ellen Relkin, a New York plaintiff lawyer who has litigated several high-profile product liability cases.  Plaintiff lawyers\u2019 interests are thus aligned with those of judges who want to keep the wheels of justice moving and of defendants \u2014 usually big companies \u2014 that prefer to keep details of their inner workings hidden.  As Reuters reported in June, judges regularly allow information pertinent to public health and safety to be filed under seal, even though court documents are, by law, presumed to be public. In nearly all jurisdictions, judges are required to provide an on-the-record rationale for allowing litigants to file information under seal \u2014 to protect trade secrets, for example, or an individual\u2019s medical records \u2014 but they rarely do that.  In its analysis, Reuters found that information pertinent to public health and safety was filed under seal in 55 of the 115 biggest product liability cases consolidated in federal courts over the past 20 years. These mega-cases, known as multidistrict litigation (MDL), involved products used by millions of consumers.  The secrecy exacts a heavy toll. In just a handful of cases Reuters analyzed, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products \u2013 including cars, drugs and guns \u2013 after judges allowed litigants to file under seal evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger.  It\u2019s a measure of their role in maintaining court secrecy that in nearly all of the 55 big cases, it was plaintiff lawyers who filed the information under seal. That\u2019s because of the way secrecy is baked into the process early on.  During pretrial discovery, when the opposing sides request information from each other to prepare their cases, the defendant usually won\u2019t give plaintiffs any information until they agree to a protective order. In theory, these agreements are meant to keep under wraps potentially damaging proprietary or personal information. But in many cases, nearly everything ends up being stamped \u201cconfidential,\u201d and plaintiff lawyers often just agree to the secrecy without complaint.  Later, when plaintiff lawyers begin filing motions or presenting their cases in court, the standard for imposing secrecy moves higher. Material obtained through discovery that is later submitted as evidence becomes part of the court record; as a matter of law, litigants must provide a reason for submitting such evidence under seal, and the judge must approve.  In most of the big MDLs, however, plaintiff attorneys actually cited the defense\u2019s earlier claims of confidentiality to justify filing evidence under seal. Since judges rarely ask for a more specific rationale for the secrecy, documents marked as confidential remain so.  That\u2019s true when the parties settle, which is how most product liability cases end. It can also be true after a jury decides in favor of the plaintiff. Sometimes, plaintiff lawyers even agree to keep evidence confidential that has already been aired in open court in other cases.  Lawyers who do fight secrecy seldom succeed. They challenged defendants\u2019 claims of confidentiality for material relating to public health and safety in 23 of the 55 big cases Reuters analyzed. Judges nearly always refused to unseal the evidence.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  A FAILED CHALLENGE  In a GM roof-crush case in the 1990s, Donald Friedman, a former GM engineer, served as an expert witness, analyzing the company\u2019s crash test data. That and most of the other evidence cited in court was marked confidential. After a jury awarded the plaintiff $8.8 million, Friedman determined that everyone should be able to see what he had seen.  Acting on Friedman\u2019s request, Thadd Llaurado, a lawyer on the case, challenged the sealing of GM\u2019s records. After nearly a year of briefs and hearings, the judge turned down Llaurado\u2019s request to lift the protective order.  \u201cGM has shown that the testing information is of value to GM\u2019s competitors,\u201d the judge said in his 1993 decision. Among the records the judge kept under seal were about 10 exhibits that had been cited openly in the trial.  GM declined to comment on past roof-crush litigation. It said that in general, confidentiality safeguards under the law \u201chave not been an obstacle to continuous improvements in safety.\u201d  Yet potentially harmful flaws in many products remain secret years after the first lawsuits are filed. Overly broad protective orders are a big part of the problem, legal experts and plaintiff lawyers said. In 45 of the 55 big MDLs Reuters analyzed, the protective order allowed most any document to be marked as confidential.  One solution is for plaintiff lawyers to push for protective orders that more narrowly define what can be kept confidential.  The strategy worked for Eric Holland. In July 2018, his legal team won a huge victory when a St. Louis jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who had alleged that their ovarian cancer was caused by Baby Powder and other J&J talc products tainted with carcinogenic asbestos. J&J has appealed the verdict.  Holland told Reuters that many of the documents he thought revealed the full story about talc and asbestos hadn\u2019t come out in the trial and were still deemed confidential. He thought they should be made public. In a separate talc case, he negotiated a protective order with J&J that limited what the company could mark confidential to trade secrets, personal information and the like.  The more specific order made public internal J&J documents showing that the company knew its talc had sometimes tested positive for asbestos. Scientists used that information in a presentation to U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials earlier this year. The agency has since said it may consider new rules to improve talc safety.  J&J, in a statement to Reuters, noted that it has made thousands of documents available for use in the courts and on its website. The company also said it \u201chas continued to work with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to negotiate appropriate protective orders to protect documents that contain confidential information.\u201d  For help drafting the narrower protective order, Holland turned to Public Justice, a nonprofit organization that intervenes in cases to get court records unsealed. The group has developed a model protective order that lays out narrow definitions of what can be marked confidential and makes clear that simply marking a document as confidential is not a sufficient reason to later file the information under seal during court proceedings.  As the first and sometimes only people to know that potentially life-saving documents are being sealed, plaintiff lawyers should be the \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d against harmful secrecy, said Jennifer Bennett, a lawyer with Public Justice.  MASTERING ROOF CRUSH  Court secrecy wasn\u2019t on Paula Lawlor\u2019s radar when she stumbled into a job as a researcher for Michael Piuze, a Los Angeles personal injury and product liability lawyer who has notched big court victories against cigarette maker Philip Morris. Lawlor had been helping him on several different cases when he asked her in 2000 to focus on roof crush.  Piuze\u2019s client was Robbie Lambert, who in 1990 fell asleep at the wheel of his Chevrolet Blazer, which veered off the road and flipped. Lambert was wearing a seatbelt, but the SUV\u2019s roof crumpled inward. The then 18-year-old Lambert, who had just been named to the training team for U.S. Olympic hockey, was left a quadriplegic.  Lambert\u2019s was only the latest among hundreds of lawsuits alleging that roofs on some GM vehicles were too weak to prevent serious injuries and deaths in rollovers. By then, thousands of people had died or been seriously injured in GM rollovers, though it\u2019s impossible to determine whether roof crush was responsible.  Lawlor, a then-47-year-old mother of seven with no college degree, set to work transforming herself into an expert on all things roof crush. She networked with lawyers across the country, some of them sending her documents they had obtained in discovery in their own lawsuits against GM. Her home became a library of binders. She pulled all-nighters poring over documents. She talked about little else with her family.  \u201cComing home and not thinking about work, that\u2019s not for her,\u201d said Jennifer Preston, Lawlor\u2019s daughter.  As Lawlor pieced together the material, a damning picture emerged: In the 1970s, GM and other automakers persuaded the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to weaken its originally proposed roof-strength standards \u2013 after GM vehicles failed to meet those standards in crash tests \u2013 but by 1990, GM had conducted its own tests showing that stronger roofs were safer.  The more she read, the more she came to \u201creally understanding how they totally misled everybody all of those years,\u201d Lawlor said.  As the trial date approached, Piuze\u2019s team set up a \u201cwar room\u201d where they met to discuss strategy, prepare motions and review discovery material to be used as evidence. And thus Lawlor found herself in that hotel room outside of Los Angeles in 2000, going through piles of more GM documents.  After her work helped Piuze win the $15.4 million verdict against GM in 2001, Lawlor still felt she had to do something. \u201cPeople were dying,\u201d she said.  \u201cPaula knew more about roof crush than most experts and almost all lawyers,\u201d Piuze said. The two had discussed challenging the protective order in the Lambert case, but \u201cI didn\u2019t have time to get involved in the crusade. I had a lot of clients to satisfy,\u201d Piuze said. Still, Lawlor \u201chad my blessing\u201d to bring the full story to light, he said.  In 2003, she got her chance when she began working on a case for Los Angeles lawyer Garo Mardirossian. In 1999, Bing Lin Duan suffered traumatic head injuries when the Chevy Aerostar van his family had rented for a vacation rolled four times on a road near California\u2019s Sequoia National Forest. The roof caved in by 10 inches. Duan persisted in a vegetative state for about two years before dying from his injuries at age 65.  When Lawlor came to the case, NHTSA was seeking public comments on a proposal to strengthen its vehicle roof strength standards. The agency, analyzing its own data, had found that rollovers were the most dangerous types of crashes from 1995 to 1999.  Lawlor approached Mardirossian about using the Duan case to challenge the secrecy shrouding the GM litigation. He agreed with her plan.  She knew what to request from GM during discovery. She also knew that some of that information had already been used as exhibits in other trials, which should make them public. This included detailed results of tests GM conducted in the 1980s on Chevrolet Malibu cars \u2014 film, data and analysis showing that roofs stronger than the NHTSA standard resulted in less severe injuries in rollovers.  In court, GM and other automakers cited summaries of the Malibu tests that GM engineers published in 1985 and 1990 to argue that roof strength doesn\u2019t matter in rollovers. The automakers also used the partial summary results to convince NHTSA that roof standards on the books since 1971 were sufficient.  GM continued to mark all of it \u2013 the published summaries and the test details \u2013 confidential under protective orders issued in other cases across the country.  \u201cWe all knew in the industry\u201d about the tests, Madirossian said. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t talk about it freely.\u201d Under the protective orders, lawyers could discuss the discovery material only with expert witnesses and others involved in the litigation.  In a motion filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2004, Madirossian argued for sharing the information with safety advocates and NHTSA. \u201cThe documents are fifteen to forty years old and are of no commercial value. Finally, all of them are of such paramount importance to the health and safety of the public as to outweigh any interest GM might have in keeping them confidential,\u201d the motion said.  Judge Mel Red Recana ruled in favor of Mardirossian\u2019s motion. Mardirossian estimates that the months-long effort to challenge the confidentiality cost about $100,000 in staff time. As the jury entered its second week of deliberation, the two sides settled. Terms weren\u2019t disclosed.  Recana declined to comment.  The judge\u2019s ruling freed Lawlor. With copies of GM\u2019s records, she left Los Angeles in 2004 and, with her two youngest children, moved to be near the beach in San Diego to focus on her mission. On one of her frequent seaside walks, it hit her: Take the fight to Washington, D.C.  Money was tight, and she worried about how to pay for her efforts. Then, in 2006, her back was injured in a minor traffic accident, resulting in a legal settlement that paid her $70,000. \u201cWhen I got the money, I was sure it was meant for me to do something big,\u201d Lawlor said.  DELIVERED BY HAND  She flew to the capital to deliver more than 1,000 pages of GM\u2019s records in person to a NHTSA clerk. In 2007 she gathered engineers, politicians, academics, victims, safety advocates and more for a meeting about roof crush in Washington. She launched a public information campaign that included strategically placed billboards.  In 2007, she co-wrote \u201cDeadly by Design,\u201d a self-published study on how automakers fended off stronger roof-strength standards. She sent it to NHTSA and lawmakers, and it was later quoted in a hearing before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.  She also volunteered with the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer safety group, putting together reports detailing the history of the roof-crush controversy. The center was joined by Public Citizen and other advocacy groups in pushing NHTSA to upgrade roof-strength standards.  In 2009, NHTSA published a new minimum standard mandating that the roofs of all passenger vehicles be able to withstand three times their empty weight in tests, doubling the earlier requirement. The agency also changed testing procedures to more closely resemble real-world crashes.  At the time, the agency said the upgraded standard would prevent 135 deaths and more than 1,000 injuries a year. In 2010, the agency published a study that \u201cconfirms a relationship between greater roof strength and fewer injuries.\u201d  In a statement to Reuters, NHTSA did not address Lawlor\u2019s efforts or the importance of the documents she shared with the agency. \u201cSafety-related information developed or discovered in private litigation is an important resource for NHTSA,\u201d the regulator said.  After the 2009 rule change, Lawlor took some time off and traveled to France, where she had a religious epiphany. These days, she leads pilgrimages to a holy site in southern France.  Starting in September 2016 \u2014 16 years after Lawlor first came across the documents that launched her campaign \u2014 every passenger vehicle sold in the United States was required to adhere to the new roof-strength standard.","455":"DETROIT\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co took the unusual step of appealing directly to its unionized employees in a blog post on Friday that laid out its latest offer aimed at ending a month-long strike, drawing an angry response from the union that the automaker was trying to \u201cstarve ... workers off the picket lines.\u201d  While emphasizing GM\u2019s commitment to the collective bargaining process, the letter, signed by Gerald Johnson, executive vice-president for global manufacturing, circumvents United Auto Workers (UAW) leadership and points to frustration at a lack of progress on ending a conflict that has already cost the company more than $1 billion.  The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union\u2019s 48,000 members at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Credit Suisse estimated the loss could hit about $1.5 billion, and the Center for Automotive Research estimated the weekly costs to GM and the UAW strike fund at $450 million and $12 million, respectively.  As part of its revised offer, GM boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion, a source familiar with the offer said.  Of the new total, $7.7 billion would be invested directly in GM plants, with the rest going to joint ventures including a potential battery plant near the Lordstown, Ohio, factory that has been idled, the source said.  GM stock closed up 2.6% at $35.57 on Friday.  The company said the offer also includes increased compensation through wages and one-time payments, preserving industry-leading healthcare benefits without increasing workers\u2019 costs, enhanced profit sharing with unlimited upside and a higher ratification bonus than the $8,000 previously offered.  For temporary workers, GM said its offer would create a path to permanent employment and include a ratification bonus.  \u201cThe strike has been hard on you, your families, our communities, the company, our suppliers and dealers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe have advised the union that it\u2019s critical that we get back to producing quality vehicles for our customers.\u201d  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The UAW in a statement said GM was \u201cplaying games at the expense of workers\u201d and accused the automaker of \u201cpurposefully stalling the process to starve UAW-GM workers off the picket lines.\u201d  \u201cAt every step of the way, GM has attempted to undermine the ongoing, good-faith efforts the UAW has made to end this strike,\u201d the union said.  In a subsequently released video here, the UAW's lead GM negotiator, Terry Dittes, said the union would bargain at the table and not through the media. \"Let me be clear: the company's strategy of releasing half-truths does nothing to reach a final settlement.\"  GM responded with a statement from its senior vice president of communications, Tony Cervone: \u201cThe goal of our communication has been to inform \u2013 not incite. We will continue to provide information in a straightforward, and importantly, factual way.\u201d  Nevertheless, negotiations continued after that exchange and late on Friday the UAW said it had given GM a counterproposal that covered five unresolved issues the two sides have been discussing, Dittes said in a letter. \u201cIf GM accepts and agrees to this group of proposals, we will have a tentative agreement,\u201d he said.  GM declined to comment on the new union proposal.  FIVE ISSUES  In a Thursday letter to UAW leaders, GM urged the union to agree to around-the-clock negotiations, while the union insisted in its own letter on dealing with the five issues first before it responded to the broader proposal made to union negotiators Monday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra met on Wednesday with UAW President Gary Jones and Dittes to urge a faster response by the union to the company\u2019s last offer.  One of the five issues the committees are discussing is the fate of four U.S. factories that GM has indicated could close, according to the UAW letter. Other issues include future technological changes to production and the fate of the UAW-GM joint training center. Dittes said he did not know when the issues would be resolved, suggesting a final deal may not be close.  UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers, and that workers in battery production plants may earn less than those at existing transmission plants.  Reuters previously reported GM told the UAW it could build a new battery plant near the now-shuttered Lordstown factory, and assemble an electric truck at its Detroit Hamtramck plant.  Moody\u2019s said in a Friday report that GM must maintain its flexibility under any new deal to build electric and self-driving vehicles without its fixed costs rising further. It said GM\u2019s annual costs in wages and benefits are more than $1 billion higher than foreign automakers operating U.S. plants.  \u201cWe expect that the long-term strategic benefits of obtaining a UAW contract ... will outweigh the costs of enduring a protracted strike that might last into November,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.  The UAW\u2019s membership is largely in the Midwest, in states that could be critical to both sides in the November 2020 presidential election, so the strike has drawn the attention of Republican President Donald Trump, his rivals seeking the Democratic nomination, and U.S. lawmakers. They have urged GM to build more vehicles in the United States and shift work from Mexico.","456":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s majority-owned Cruise self-driving division said on Tuesday fund manager T.

The latest funding for Cruise includes existing investors General Motors, Japan\u2019s SoftBank Vision Fund and Honda Motor Co Ltd, and should give the firm much-needed cash as it aims to launch vehicles by the end of 2019.  The additional capital comes at a crucial time as a host of automakers and technology companies weigh how quickly autonomous vehicles can be marketed and sold in large volumes, and find ways to share rising costs for hardware and software development.  Rival Ford Motor Co is in talks with German automaker Volkswagen AG about joining forces to create autonomous vehicles in a deal that could involve an investment by VW in Argo AI, an autonomous vehicle technology company majority owned by Ford.  Cruise, which has secured capital commitments of $7.25 billion in the past year, was valued at $14.6 billion in the last funding round by Honda in October, which had invested $2.75 billion.  The current valuation is equivalent to about 35 percent of GM\u2019s market capitalization despite no significant revenue and a product not ready for commercial launch.

FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Lansing, Michigan October 26, 2015. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  GM first made the request for a two-year temporary waiver on features like mirrors, dashboard warning lights and turn signals designed for a human driver in a petition filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January 2018.  The largest U.S. automaker said it hoped to deploy no more than 2,500 modified Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles as part of a controlled on-demand ride-sharing fleet, likely to be based in San Francisco, by the end of 2019.  In March, NHTSA made the petition available for public comment for the 60 days that ended on Monday.  Several groups, including car dealers and insurers, raised questions posted publicly this week pressing NHTSA to demand more data, require additional safety provisions or deny the petition outright.  The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies said driverless vehicles without human controls should not be permitted on public roads until data proves the cars are safe.  \u201cNHTSA has no business enabling (automated vehicles) to operate on the roads, and surely has no business removing federally mandated vehicle safety standards to a vehicle that they do not know if it\u2019s as safe as existing vehicles,\u201d said the group, which represents 43 percent of U.S. auto insurers.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) said GM should not be allowed to withhold safety features like high-beam headlights from the vehicle and should design the vehicle to require passengers to wear safety belts.  Backers of GM\u2019s plan include Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Federation of the Blind, the Telecommunications Industry Association and American Trucking Associations, which say autonomous vehicles have the potential to drastically cut the toll from car crashes.  More than 37,000 people were killed and 2.7 million injured in 6.4 million crashes on U.S. roads in 2017. NHTSA says human error is a critical factor in more than 90 percent of all crashes.  INDICATORS  The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators said NHTSA should also should require driverless vehicles to \u201cutilize some sort of signage or a universal indicator to alert first responders, potential passengers and other road users that the vehicles do not comply with federal safety standards.\u201d  The Union of Concerned Scientists said the automaker should produce more data on how GM self-driving cars on the road now are performing with backup safety drivers and called for the petition to be rejected.  GM self-driving test vehicles in California with a backup driver in the front seat have been involved in at least 69 traffic collisions, the group said.  Although not all the crashes occurred when the vehicle was in self-driving mode and there was little evidence the cars were at legal fault, UCS said details suggested GM\u2019s self-driving car at times \u201cdoes not conform to typical driver behavior, leading to confusion or frustration among other road users.\u201d  GM spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan declined to address specific comments. \u201cWe will review the many comments received and respond as appropriate,\u201d she said.  NHTSA said on Wednesday it would also seek public comment \u201con the removal of unnecessary regulatory barriers to the safe introduction of automated driving systems\u201d as part of its wider efforts to draw up a body of regulations for self-driving cars.","461":"FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and Assistant to the President for Strategic Initiatives Chris Liddell hold up a chart showing the processes involved with making a federal highway during an event on deregulation at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 14, 2017.

Slowing global economy amid the U.S.-China trade war has hurt consumer sentiment that has weighed on auto sales, while trade tariffs on metals have pushed vehicle production costs up by billions of dollars, hurting automakers and parts suppliers\u2019 profitability.  A 40-day strike at the No.1 U.S. carmaker, General Motors, has added to auto parts makers\u2019 pain, in the form of lost revenue.  Magna, which makes parts such as body structures, chassis and powertrain for customers including Ford Motor F.N and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, cut its 2019 sales outlook to between $38.7 billion and $39.8 billion, from its previous range of $38.9 billion to $41.1 billion, largely due to the strike at GM.  The company now expects full-year net income between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, down from its prior range of $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion.  \u201cWe have made some adjustments to our outlook largely to reflect estimated lost volume related to the GM strike and higher launch costs,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Vince Galifi said.  Several auto parts makers and suppliers have lowered their full-year forecasts and disclosed hits to quarterly earnings due to the strike.  Earlier this month drivetrain systems maker American Axle and Manufacturing Holdings AXL.N said the strike reduced third-quarter sales by $57 million, and warned of an about $250 million hit to full-year revenue.  Aptiv Plc APTV.N said last month the strike knocked off $70 million from the company's quarterly revenue and reduced profit by 10 cents per share in the third quarter.  Magna recorded non-cash impairment charges of $537 million after income taxes in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 and reported adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $558 million, below analysts\u2019 expectation of $572 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N said on Tuesday it will stop reporting monthly U.S. vehicle sales, saying the 30-day snapshot does not accurately reflect the market and the company will, instead, issue quarterly sales reports.  GM will also no longer report monthly sales in China, its largest market. The company will provide monthly data to the U.S. Federal Reserve, industry associations and government agencies across the globe but that data will not be made public.  Other major automakers indicated on Tuesday that they would not immediately follow GM\u2019s lead on switching to reporting sales on a quarterly basis.  \"At this time, we are maintaining our reporting of sales on a monthly basis,\" said a spokesman for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N.  On a conference call with analysts and reporters, Ford Motor Co's F.N U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said the automaker would assess GM's move but a \"decision is not imminent\" on whether to report sales quarterly.  Jack Hollis, Toyota Motor Corp's 7203.T North American head of sales and marketing, said there is \"no change planned on our side.\"  Analysts and investors rely on monthly U.S. vehicle sales to track the performance of individual automakers, and also use the data as a barometer of the health of the world\u2019s second-largest auto market and an indicator of consumer confidence in the U.S. economy overall.  Jeff Schuster, a senior executive at forecaster LMC Automotive, said GM\u2019s decision to release fewer sales reports was \u201cnot that big a deal.\u201d  \u201cAs an industry, we\u2019ve gotten used to the monthly sound bites and have focused too much on the \u2018noise,\u2019\u201d Schuster said. \u201cMaybe we should focus more on the \u2018why.\u2019\u201d  GM and its Detroit rivals have relied heavily on sales of high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs to boost profits.GM\u2019s total U.S. sales, its second-largest market, are down 3.2 percent for the first two months of 2018, reflecting a 6.8 percent drop in retail sales to individual customers, the company reported last month.  Executives at GM have expressed frustration that comparisons of monthly U.S. sales results among rival automakers are distorted by short-term discount programs, and by differences in strategy for selling vehicles in bulk to rental car fleets.  \u201cThirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market,\u201d Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president for sales operations said in a statement.  GM\u2019s actions could prompt other automakers to also switch to quarterly U.S. sales reports. Major automakers report March U.S. new vehicle sales on Tuesday.  Until the early 1990s, most U.S. automakers released sales results every 10 days. The former Chrysler Corp, a forerunner of today's Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, stopped reporting sales on a 10-day basis in 1990, and rivals followed suit over the next three years.  GM executives are betting that investors will quickly adapt to receiving U.S. sales data every three months, as investors in other retail sectors already have.

Earlier this month, voters in Massachusetts overwhelmingly approved an initiative to revise the state\u2019s 2013 \u201cRight to Repair\u201d law to require automakers to provide expanded access to mechanical and electronic repair data and allow independent shops to repair increasingly sophisticated technology.  The Alliance for Automotive Innovation trade group said if the law takes effect \u201cyears of manufacturers\u2019 work and billions of dollars in investment to protect and secure vehicle data will effectively be obliterated.\u201d  The court battle may help determine who will control the $390 billion U.S. auto data aftermarket in the digital age. The auto group asked a U.S. district court judge in Boston to block the law, which is set to take effect in the 2022 model year. The Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment.  Unprecedented advancements in modern vehicles and crash avoidance systems have prompted many automakers to limit information and warranties to only parts and repairs from authorized dealers to ensure safety and privacy.  They argue such data is complex and sensitive, and that using content to repair modern cars requires extensive training by those with proprietary technology.  Independent repair groups have rebuked those restrictions as an attempt to seize control of the lucrative repair market and a way to force consumers into more expensive manufacturer-affiliated dealer shops. They are also concerned by automakers increasingly pushing for wireless repair data transfers, which will limit third-party access.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in July the measure \u201crequires vehicle manufacturers to redesign their vehicles in a manner that necessarily introduces cybersecurity risks, and to do so in a timeframe that makes design, proof, and implementation of any meaningful countermeasure effectively impossible.\u201d","467":"(Reuters) - With auto showrooms shut during the coronavirus pandemic, Fiat Chrysler and General Motors Co GM.N moved to reboot demand with seven-year, no-interest loans and programs allowing customers to buy vehicles online.

But the pandemic has been pulling auto retailing into the digital age, with dealerships shuttered across the country and sales likely to take a further beating in April as social distancing guidelines remain in place.  FCA shares were down 4.9% to $6.84 in afternoon trading in New York after the company posted a 10% drop in first-quarter U.S. auto sales, as the pandemic hurt demand and halted production from mid-March.

That blow to production was on top of the 60,000 units lost earlier in the year as the novel coronavirus spread, making it likely GM Korea would not turn a profit this year unless it could recapture that output, he added.  \u201cWe\u2019re basically being held hostage in the short term by lack of vehicle production,\u201d Kiefer said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s having a very significant short-term financial impact.\u201d  The industrial action would \u201cbasically make it impossible for us to allocate any further investments or ... new products to the country of Korea.

GM Korea reported an operating loss of 332 billion won ($300.8 million) in 2019, trimming a loss of 615 billion won a year earlier.  Faced with low production rates and poor sales, GM agreed on a rescue package worth $7.15 billion, including $750 million from KDB in 2018. Under the terms of the binding deal, GM cannot exit its investment in the country for 10 years.  While it would be hard to quit South Korea in the short term, the long-term future was in doubt, Kiefer said.  GM would abide by any past agreements, including plans to build a 2023 Chevrolet crossover in Korea, but even spending on that program had been suspended due to the strikes.  \u201cWe would prefer to make this model work ... but as of now, we\u2019re losing confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to invest in that country,\u201d Kiefer said.

To \u201cimprove the manufacturing competitiveness of GM Korea,\u201d GM will propose freezing base wages this year and limit future wage increases below inflation, the letter showed.  The proposal includes suspending benefits including school tuition for employees\u2019 children and gold medals and travel expenses for long-serving workers, while removing complementary lunches and other benefits.  A GM Korea spokesman declined to comment, while a union spokeswoman said it has not officially received the proposal.

Since May, General Motors Co and its Cruise self-driving car unit have landed $5 billion in investment commitments from Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd to develop a robot taxi service that could safely navigate the city streets of San Francisco by the end of next year - putting it ahead Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo self-driving car unit, Uber and Lyft.  Those expectations are now hitting speed bumps, according to interviews with eight current and former GM and Cruise employees and executives, along with nine autonomous vehicle technology experts familiar with Cruise. These sources say that some unexpected technical challenges - including the difficulty that Cruise cars have identifying whether objects are in motion - mean putting GM\u2019s driverless cars on the road in a large scale way in 2019 is looking highly unlikely.  \u201cNothing is on schedule,\u201d said one GM source, referring to certain mileage targets and other milestones the company has already missed.  Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt told Reuters last month the service will offer passengers \u201ca primary form of transportation\u201d most anywhere they want to go, and compete with Uber and Lyft. Using driverless cars to carry fare-paying customers would allow Cruise to recover investments in expensive technology and turn a profit more rapidly than trying to sell self-driving cars to the few individual customers who could afford them.  In addition, operating self-driving cars in a taxi service would allow Cruise and GM to tailor the service to the limitations of the technology until software and sensors are ready to enable autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere.  \u201cBased on where we\u2019re at and where we\u2019ve been, we\u2019re on track to hit that\u201d 2019 goal, Vogt said.  Still, some close to the project acknowledge the length of time and money it will take to get the ride hailing service up and running.  \u201cWe know we aren\u2019t commercially ready now,\u201d said Michael Ronen, managing partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers and the firm\u2019s lead investor on the Cruise deal who will join Cruise\u2019s board of directors. \u201cI think now the question is who is going to be successful and how quickly.\u201d  Reuters has learned that the driverless Cruise cars still struggle to identify whether objects on the road are moving or stationary, according to one current and three former Cruise employees who have witnessed the problem. The result is that the vehicles hesitate and stop while passing a row of parked motorcycles or bicycles, they said.  At times, the software has failed to recognize pedestrians, and has mistakenly seen phantom bicycles, causing the cars to brake erratically, according to two of the sources. And Cruise does not yet have a data-sharing collaboration with the San Francisco Fire Department, a necessary step to train the cars to respond to fire truck sirens, according to a fire department spokesman.  In addition, the open-source software robotics tools that Cruise used to develop the technology has delays that slow messages from the car\u2019s sensors to the car\u2019s brain, according to a fourth former employee and nine other people familiar with Cruise\u2019s technology.  Cruise\u2019s Vogt said the next generation of hardware and software and sensors in the pipeline can help address these issues and will improve performance.  \u201cEarly in development I\u2019m sure there were phases where we were putting systems together where they didn\u2019t meet the requirements we needed for launch, and that\u2019s part of the testing and development process,\u201d he told Reuters.  \u201cSafety is our measure for launching, and so we certainly will (resolve that) by the time we will release cars on the road without drivers,\u201d he added.  GM\u2019s drive to be seen as a leader in autonomous vehicle technology is critical at a time when the automaker\u2019s shares are down more than 20 percent for the year. The delivery of capital promised by Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Honda depends on Cruise achieving certain performance targets.  Cruise\u2019s competitors face their own challenges, and some experts predict that a shakeout of rival efforts is inevitable. Uber, for example, had to overhaul its production timeline following a fatal crash with one of its self-driving SUVs. Though the autonomous vehicle program remains paused after the crash, a company official said Uber is making progress, building in safeguards to improve the overall functionality and safety of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars.  \u201cEveryone in the industry is becoming more and more nervous that they will waste billions of dollars,\u201d said Klaus Froehlich, a board member at BMW and its head of research and development.  \u201cCHALLENGE OF OUR GENERATION\u201d  GM President Dan Ammann calls developing an automated vehicle that can navigate city streets more safely than a human driver the \u201cthe engineering challenge of our generation,\u201d and a project that will ultimately take years and billions of dollars to fully develop.  \u201cRight now we are in a race to the starting line,\u201d he said in an interview with Reuters.  \u201cGetting stuck on one particular parameter, or one particular scenario, is missing the fundamental point of what is the total overall performance of the system,\u201d said Ammann.  Cruise\u2019s 2019 goal will go forward only if the Cruise system achieves the safety standards the automaker has established, and shown to regulators, he added.  Cruise says it has not begun offering rides to the public, and the cars are not operating without a safety driver. The company has yet to apply for permits to give passengers a ride without a driver, according to the California Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Utilities Commission.  SoftBank says it factored in setbacks for the technology into its $2.25 billion agreement with Cruise. One provision says more than half of SoftBank\u2019s investment will come only when Cruise can commercially deploy vehicles in fully driverless operation, according to GM public filings.  \u201cIt\u2019s a speculative investment,\u201d said SoftBank\u2019s Ronen. \u201cThese are still unproven technologies.\u201d  For a graphic on SoftBank's investments, click tmsnrt.rs\/2yrKBQ9  In unveiling plans for a $2.8 billion investment in Cruise earlier this month, Honda executive Seiji Kuraishi said he sees potential in Cruise because of its tie-up with GM, and most of its investment will come after Cruise\u2019s 2019 deadline and will be spread over 12 years.  Shortly after the GM acquisition in 2016, Cruise leadership acknowledged internally they faced a decade-long technical challenge, according to a former Cruise employee.  Vogt gave a speech at the time to his employees and asked them not to pull all-nighters or burn themselves out, said the source, who was present for the talk.  Cruise and GM began missing early milestones they had set together, including the first deadline less than a year after the GM acquisition of Cruise, according to two former Cruise employees and a former GM employee.  Public records with the San Francisco Department of Motor Vehicles and an industry source familiar with the matter tell of other missed targets. It failed, for example, to have Cruise cars record the fewest number of times a human has to take control of a vehicle versus is rivals in 2017. Cruise also missed the goal of logging a million miles a month by early 2018.  The company said the mileage goal was based on its testing footprint at the time, which still included a significant chunk of testing in settings like suburban Phoenix. It has since heavily refocused efforts on testing in San Francisco, where total mileage is lower, but the company expects a higher rate of \u201clearning\u201d due to the complexity of the environment.  \u201cWith 10 engineers, you can bolt a bunch of sensors onto a car and put a computer in it and get it to drive around the block,\u201d Vogt told Reuters. A commercial product is \u201cabout 10,000 times harder,\u201d he said.","479":"FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019.

Regulators in the United States have been grappling with how to regulate self-driving cars, with other countries watching closely to see how implementation of the emerging technology pans out.  Last year, U.S. lawmakers, unable to agree on a way forward, abandoned a bid to pass sweeping legislation to speed the introduction of vehicles without steering wheels and human controls onto roads, but may resurrect the effort later this year.  The new group, dubbed the Automated Vehicle Safety Consortium, will begin by deciding priorities, with a focus on data sharing, vehicle interaction with other road users and safe testing guidelines.  Randy Visintainer, chief technology officer at Ford\u2019s Autonomous Vehicles unit, said the goal was to work with companies and government \u201cto expedite development of standards that can lead to rule making.\u201d  Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked the public if robotic cars should be allowed on streets without steering wheels or brake pedals as they try to set the first legal boundaries for their design. NHTSA\u2019s existing rules prohibit vehicles without human controls.  The regulator will for the first time compare a vehicle in which all driving decisions are made by a computer versus a human driver.  Concerns are mounting about automated piloting systems.  A fatal 2018 accident involving a self-driving vehicle operated by Uber Technologies Inc and two deadly plane crashes involving highly automated Boeing 737 MAX airliners have put a spotlight on the ability of regulators to assess the safety of advanced systems that substitute machine intelligence for human judgment.

The company has been delivering on commitments and we ask the union to do the same for the future of GMK,\u201d GM Korea (GMK) said in a statement on Monday.  GM began production in South Korea after buying assets of failed local automaker Daewoo Motor in 2002. It has since only suffered partial strikes, with workers walking out for several hours during annual wage talks. Monday would mark the first time GM\u2019s Korean plants will be idle for a full day due to a labor dispute.","493":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Thursday it was working with design software company Autodesk Inc to manufacture new, lightweight 3D-printed parts that could help the automaker meet its goals to add alternative-fuel vehicles to its product lineup.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  Last year, the company announced ambitious plans to add 20 new electric battery and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023. Chief Executive Mary Barra has made a bold promise to investors that the Detroit automaker will make money selling electric cars by 2021.  The ability to print lightweight parts could be a gamechanger for the electric vehicle industry. With consumer concerns over the limited range of electric vehicles a major obstacle to their mass adoption, making them lighter improves fuel efficiency and could help extend that range.  GM executives this week showed off a 3D-printed stainless steel seat bracket developed with Autodesk technology - which uses cloud computing and artificial intelligence-based algorithms to rapidly explore multiple permutations of a part design.  Using conventional technology, the part would require eight components and several suppliers. With this new system, the seat bracket consists of one part - which looks like a mix between abstract art and science fiction movie - that is 40 percent lighter and 20 percent stronger.  Other manufacturers such as General Electric Co have also beefed up their use of 3D printers in manufacturing. GM rival automaker Ford Motor Co said last year it was testing lightweight 3D printing for mass production.  GM has used 3D printers for prototyping for years, but Kevin Quinn, the automaker\u2019s director of additive design and manufacturing, said within a year or so GM expects these new 3D-printed parts to appear in high-end, motorsports applications. Within five years, GM hopes to produce thousands or tens of thousands of parts at scale as the technology improves, Quinn said.  \u201cThat is our panacea,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to get to.\u201d  In the long run, Quinn said the 3D printed parts would help reduce tooling costs, cut the amount of material used, the number of suppliers needed for one part and logistics costs.  The 3D-printing based manufacturing industry is working toward mass production and trying to address issues with \u201crepeatability and robustness,\u201d said Bob Yancey, Autodesk\u2019s director of manufacturing.  GM getting into the game \u201cwill put tremendous pressure\u201d to make that happen, Yancey said.","494":"FILE PHOTO: A view of the entrance to the West Plant at the General Motors Lordstown Complex, assembly plant in Warren, Ohio, U.S., November 26, 2018.

Some suppliers have announced job cuts as a result of the end of production, while GM has said it is offering UAW workers jobs at other plants.  A company that provides janitorial and other services at the Ohio plant said it is cutting 73 jobs next month. Two other suppliers said earlier they are cutting 300 jobs that supported the Ohio plant operations.  GM chief executive Mary Barra has said the fate of the U.S. plants will be determined in contract talks with the UAW this summer.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  The U.S. senator from Vermont, an independent, joins a parade of Democrats who have met with some of the 48,000 striking hourly workers, using the walkout against General Motors Co GM.N to amplify their messages about income inequality and corporate power. Their oratory comes on the heels of President Donald Trump's vows to protect U.S. manufacturing jobs with tariffs on imported cars, and his frequent criticism of GM for shutting UAW-represented factories in Ohio and Michigan.  GM workers went on strike on Sept. 16, seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of GM\u2019s profit and protection of their healthcare benefits. Talks between the two sides continued on Tuesday.  The politicians\u2019 appearances at plants throughout the Midwest over the past week emphasize the importance of the UAW to winning in states that will be pivotal to the 2020 presidential election.  In 2016, Republican Trump convinced numerous UAW members to vote for him, helping him win Michigan, Ohio and other states. The UAW has traditionally supported Democratic candidates. The union and its members contributed almost $16 million during the 2012 election cycle when former President Barack Obama was re-elected, making it one of the most politically active groups tracked by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. However, UAW contributions dropped to less than $5.8 million in 2016.  UAW workers gave Trump a higher than normal share of their votes in 2016 - 32% of the almost 400,000 members by the union\u2019s reckoning.  \u201cHe is president because of this group of voters,\u201d Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the University of California-Berkeley, said of blue-collar workers in the Midwest. \u201cThe strike has become a symbol for how the U.S. might compete in the global economy.\u201d  UAW officials are not commenting publicly about the visits, but they are closely watching the 2020 candidates to see who is most involved with the strike effort as an audition for winning the union\u2019s support.  On Sunday outside a GM plant in Kansas City, Kansas, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said, \u201cThere used to be a basic deal in the old days. If you contributed to the welfare of the corporation you worked for, you got to share in the benefit ... That\u2019s not the deal anymore.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t bail out GM, the UAW bailed out GM,\u201d he told the striking workers. \u201cYou gave up more than anybody. That\u2019s why GM made it.\u201d  In Detroit on the same day, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of Biden\u2019s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, credited unions with building the middle class in America, but said the middle class was now under attack.  \u201cGM is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or to the people of America,\u201d she told striking workers outside GM\u2019s Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. \u201cTheir only loyalty is to their own bottom line and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.\u201d  Other Democratic candidates who have visited striking workers include U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar and U.S. Representative Tim Ryan. Former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke is visiting UAW members in West Chester, Ohio, on Tuesday and Lordstown, Ohio, on Wednesday.  GM REJECTS CRITICISM  The White House has said it is not involved in the talks, but Trump has repeatedly demanded GM find a new vehicle for its now-shuttered assembly plant in Lordstown. That region in the northeastern part of the state historically supported Democrats in presidential races but backed Trump in 2016.  Democratic candidates and labor leaders have blasted GM\u2019s decision to stop paying healthcare benefits for striking UAW workers. The union\u2019s strike fund is supposed to pay for coverage during a walkout.  GM officials have tried to counter charges that they are abandoning U.S. workers, releasing details of an offer to the UAW that included the promise of investing $7 billion in U.S. plants, annual raises in a new four-year deal, increased profit sharing and retention of existing healthcare insurance.  GM officials have expressed frustration with the attacks by the UAW and politicians on the company\u2019s worker compensation.  \u201cCriticism about the wages and benefits GM pays is unwarranted,\u201d GM spokesman Jim Cain said on Tuesday. \u201cThe total compensation of our UAW workforce \u2013 including wages, profit sharing and benefits \u2013 is the highest in the U.S. auto industry.\u201d  GM officials also privately say the decision on the health insurance was telegraphed well before the strike and no worker is without coverage thanks to the UAW strike fund.  Steven Bernstein, a management-side labor attorney from Tampa, Florida, said GM officials cannot afford to be drawn into a war of words.  \u201cThe best advice for management in circumstances like this is to make sure they don\u2019t lose sight of their end objective,\u201d he said.","497":"DETROIT (Reuters) - The head of General Motors Co\u2019s Cadillac luxury brand said on Thursday that a majority, and possibly all, of the brand\u2019s models would be electric vehicles by 2030.

GM\u2019s luxury brand also plans to introduce a compact electric SUV in China in 2022, with a companion model slated to go into production in the United States in late 2023, suppliers said.  Cadillac showed a concept for a midsized electric SUV earlier this year.  The division will use names for its future electric models, moving away from number and letter names such as CT6 or XT5. \u201cEscalade is an awesome name,\u201d Carlisle said.  Cadillac will refresh its existing gasoline-powered models one more time over the next decade and then focus on the electric models, he said.  \u201cNone of us knows how quickly the transition will take place,\u201d to a fully electric lineup, Carlisle said.  A key challenge for electric vehicles is driving range and Carlisle said Cadillacs will need a range of 300 miles to be competitive.

Hundreds of workers walked off the job and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed \"deep disappointment\" after the auto manufacturer's announcement caught governments and employees by surprise. The closure of the plant reminded markets \"that Canada does have a little bit of a competitiveness issue,\" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy in New York at BMO Capital Markets. Last week, Canada's government said it would allow businesses to write off additional capital investments to make them more competitive at a time when the United States is aggressively cutting taxes. [ ] Still, Ottawa did not announce measures that would help the country's energy sector, which has been hit hard by depressed oil prices. The price of oil clawed back on Monday some of the previous session's steep losses. U.S. crude oil futures settled 2.4 percent higher at $51.63 a barrel, while Wall Street rebounded as buyers returned in force after last week's sell-off. At 3:38 p.m. (2038 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3242 to the greenback, or 75.52 U.S. cents. The currency, which last Tuesday touched its weakest level in nearly five months at 1.3318, traded in a range of 1.3188 to 1.3248. Speculators have added to their bearish bets on the Canadian dollar, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. As of Nov. 20, net short positions had increased to 6,289 contracts from 2,791 a week earlier. Data on Friday showed that Canada's annual inflation rate remained above the central bank's target for the ninth straight month in October, but markets saw few signs the Bank of Canada would hike interest rates next month. Canada's gross domestic product data for the third quarter is due on Friday. Canadian government bond prices were lower across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year fell 2.5 Canadian cents to yield 2.245 percent and the 10-year declined 15 Canadian cents to yield 2.358 percent.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said Saturday it will boost strike pay for 48,000 hourly workers at General Motors Co GM.N by $25 a week to $275 as a strike against the largest U.S. automaker nears the end of its fourth week.  Talks were continuing late Saturday afternoon to try to resolve the longest nationwide strike at GM since 1970, both sides said.  The UAW also said it would allow members striking to take on part-time jobs without reducing their strike pay \u2013 as long as they perform picket-line duties. The strike pay hike was previously set to increase on Jan. 1.  Also Saturday, details of a revised GM contract offer emerged, with a person briefed on the matter confirming that GM had boosted its proposed ratification bonus by $1,000 to $9,000.  GM has proposed 3% pay raises in the second and fourth year of the four-year-contract and 3% and 4% lump sum payments in the first and fourth year respectively, the person confirmed. The company would agree to make temporary workers permanent with three years of service and they would get a $3,000 bonus upon ratification of the contract.  About 7% of GM\u2019s hourly workforce are temporary workers.  Details of the revised GM contract offer made earlier this week first emerged in a screen shot posted on the Facebook page of an ABC-TV affiliate in Flint, Michigan by a commenter. It\u2019s not clear if GM has since revised any proposals.  GM appealed directly to UAW employees in a blog post on Friday that laid out its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, drawing an angry response from the union that the automaker was trying to \u201cstarve ... workers off the picket lines.\u201d  The GM appeal highlighted the conflict that has already cost it more than $1 billion and has also forced it to idle about 10,000 workers in Mexico and Canada and idle operations throughout North America.  The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Credit Suisse estimated the loss could hit about $1.5 billion, and the Center for Automotive Research estimated the weekly costs to GM and the UAW strike fund at $450 million and $12 million, respectively.  As part of its revised offer, GM boosted the amount it plans to invest in the United States to about $9 billion from its previous offer of $7 billion, a source familiar with the offer said. The UAW responded with a counterproposal of its own on Friday.  Of the new total, $7.7 billion would be invested directly in GM plants and the rest in joint ventures including a potential battery plant near the Lordstown, Ohio, factory that has been idled, the source said.  The company said the offer also includes increased compensation through wages and one-time payments, preserves industry-leading healthcare benefits without increasing workers\u2019 costs and enhances profit sharing with unlimited upside.  One of the five issues still under discussion is the fate of four U.S. factories that GM has indicated could close.","500":"DETROIT, Feb 10 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is expected to report a healthy fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday thanks to strong demand for gas-burning pickup trucks and SUVs, but the company\u2019s future electric vehicles are now driving the stock, shareholders and analysts said.  Since November, when Chief Executive Mary Barra outlined plans to boost spending on electric vehicles, GM shares have surged by 60%. Long stuck near the 2010 initial public offering price of $33, the increase has long-time shareholders celebrating.  \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a more exciting time to be a GM shareholder,\u201d said Michael Razewski, a partner with Douglas C.

He thinks GM could be a $100 stock within a couple years.  GM helped change the narrative since November by boosting spending on and speeding development of EVs, announcing plans for an electric van and dedicated unit to serve commercial customers, and setting a target to stop selling gasoline-powered light vehicles by 2035.  Investors also credit a greater focus by the broader market on EVs, driven by Tesla Inc and the numerous companies going public through mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs.  \u201cThis never struck me as a business that greenfield competitors had an insurmountable advantage,\u201d said Josh Sandbulte, chief investment officer with Greenhaven Associates, one of GM\u2019s largest shareholders.  Investors are starting to hold companies to a higher standard regarding their climate plans. Last month, the head of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, warned companies it invests in they will need to show a game plan for surviving in a world aiming for net-zero emissions by mid-century.  Also boosting GM\u2019s stock was Microsoft Corp\u2019s investment last month in Cruise, the self-driving business in which GM holds a controlling stake. The Cruise business went from a $19 billion valuation to $30 billion with that deal, supercharging expectations.  Investors now see GM\u2019s sum-of-the-parts business adding up to a much larger number, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said.  \u201cIf you want to dream big on GM, you\u2019d take the EV business at a Tesla multiple, the (EV) van business at a SPAC multiple and the Cruise business at the Microsoft mark,\u201d said Johnson, who sees an upside case for a $100 share valuation.","501":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is ready to start building its new generation of large sport utility vehicles at a plant in Arlington, Texas, when it reopens North American assembly plants on May 18, Philip Kienle, the automaker's North American manufacturing chief, told Reuters on Thursday.

The strike has cost GM more than $1 billion and forced it to idle operations in Canada and Mexico.  GM declined to comment on the UAW letter, which the union released to the media. Talks are set to resume Wednesday morning and the sides have exchanged numerous proposals since the strike began.  GM\u2019s production of trucks and sport-utility vehicles in Mexico has drawn anger among union workers.  Through August, 526,000 of the 573,000 vehicles GM exported from Mexico were sent to the United States, equal to about a quarter of its U.S. sales. U.S. President Donald Trump and many lawmakers have also urged GM to build more vehicles in the United States.  GM announced in November 2018 it would close four U.S. factories, including two assembly plants, and cut 15,000 jobs in North America.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  GM said in September before the strike began that it had offered to make $7 billion in new U.S. investments in eight facilities in four states, but did not specify timing, location or products with the exception of a planned electric truck.  UAW workers are concerned that as GM shifts to more electric vehicles it will require fewer workers and that battery production may result in workers getting paid less than at existing transmission plants.  Reuters has reported that GM has told the UAW it could build a new battery plant near the now shuttered Lordstown, Ohio factory.  To date, the strike has hit as many as 150,000 workers in the auto industry, a report from research and consulting firm Anderson Economic Group (AEG) showed on Tuesday.  About 75,000 employees of auto parts suppliers have either been temporarily laid off or have seen their wages shrink due to the slump in demand from GM, according to the AEG report.  About 5,000 workers at Michigan auto suppliers have filed for unemployment benefits as a result of the strike, the state said on Tuesday.  AEG estimates that the strike has resulted in a $660 million profit hit for GM and more than $412 million in direct wage losses for all employees through the third week of the strike.

Masse, a member of the opposition New Democrats, said it was frustrating that Barra would not attend because she is the \u201cprincipal strategist\u201d behind GM\u2019s restructuring and could explain why Oshawa did not merit investment.  \u201cWe need to understand the future jobs and commitment of General Motors because we need to better understand how we fit in their global operations,\u201d Masse said.  Canada\u2019s auto union, which represents 2,600 assembly line workers in Oshawa and 1,800 workers at plants supplying the operation, has waged a high-profile campaign aimed at convincing GM to keep the plant open until September 2020, when the current collective agreement ends.

Now, it\u2019s show time for the first results of a project code-named GEM, for Global Emerging Market.  At events this week ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show, the No. 1 U.S. automaker plans to unveil two small SUVs that will be part of a new family of sedans and SUVs the automaker forecasts will make up one in five of its global vehicle sales by 2023.  This is just the opening salvo in a nearly $5-billion bet by GM to sell up to 2 million technology-laden, modern-looking vehicles annually to consumers who today cannot afford GM vehicles designed for the United States, but may someday as their incomes rise.  GM has struggled for years to crack the code for growing profitably outside rich markets, in part because vehicles designed for the U.S. or China\u2019s wealthy coastal cities cost too much for developing world consumers. The company has abandoned some Southeast Asian countries and pulled back from Africa because it could not compete.  This time around, GM says, through disciplined cost-control it has finally found a way to make affordable vehicles in bulk for emerging markets, loaded with the technology that consumers want and still make a profit.  The Chevrolet Tracker and the Buick Encore - not be confused with its American cousin of the same name - are the first tests of a new strategy for engineering vehicles to appeal to buyers in around 40 nations of the world\u2019s middle class such as Brazil and Mexico, and the huge developing market that exists within China\u2019s heartland.  The GEM project involved an unprecedented level of cooperation with GM\u2019s Chinese joint venture partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd. GM and SAIC shared engineering costs and collaborated on purchasing, GM executives said.  What potential customers will see are vehicles that include amenities such as touchscreens, mobile phone connectivity, rear-view cameras, and safety features like automatic emergency braking and airbags.  What GM is counting on them not to notice is that the number of options is limited, to reduce complexity in purchasing and manufacturing, or that touches such as fully-carpeted trunks are absent. \u201cWe may not be the absolute lowest price point in China,\u201d GM president Mark Reuss told Reuters at the automaker\u2019s downtown Detroit headquarters. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to be right in that segment where this is a pretty good-sized car... (with) a huge value for what you pay for it.\u201d  Slideshow ( 5 images )  FEWER PARTS, LESS COST  The team that set out to build GM\u2019s new vehicle family included engineers and designers from 14 different countries, meeting at the automaker\u2019s technical center in the Detroit suburb of Warren to hammer out details that were then executed in China and elsewhere, GM executives said.  As the basic design of the GEM vehicles took shape, the strategy for where they would be sold changed. GM pulled out of some markets like India and Vietnam that were originally slated to be among the target markets.  The challenge GEM project chief engineer Doug Houlihan faced was how to deliver low-cost vehicles that did not look cheap or lack key safety features.  Sometimes, that meant spending more. Houlihan gave the green light to spend extra on machines that could weld on the tops of car doors rather than stamping the door in one piece. The extra investment delivered a door that fit smoothly into the roof of the car for a sleeker look.  \u201cThis gives the customer more than they would expect,\u201d Houlihan said.  To offset that cost, Houlihan and his colleagues dug into logistics and the supply chain.  Shipping some vehicles by sea between Brazilian ports saved money in a market where moving goods by road can be a logistics nightmare.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Houlihan said that Brazilian logistics savings more than paid for the extra $2 per vehicle GM invested for a rear axle five times stronger than its predecessor in South America.One GM plant in Brazil took over some work on engines and bumpers that had previously been outsourced, saving $120 per vehicle - a significant figure for a low-cost vehicle.  Integrating the head-rest on the front seat for some models saved $7 per vehicle.  Chinese suppliers are key to the new GM vehicle line, but the automaker is shifting away from relying on Chinese production.  GM has tried to localize costs for these vehicles as much as possible which can help offset currency fluctuations that hit markets like Brazil. That can also mitigate the impact of tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump has escalated trade tensions with China and has threatened a broad tariff on U.S. autos and parts.  \u201cYou try and tariff-proof yourself and get it as local as you can,\u201d GM\u2019s Reuss said.  GM\u2019s new emerging market lineup will face plenty of competition. Chinese automakers are pushing into some of the same countries GM has targeted.  Jeff Schuster, a senior executive at auto forecaster LMC Automotive, said GM\u2019s advantage could last just a few years if rivals follow with their own low-cost models that offer modern amenities to match those in new Chevrolets and Buicks.  Internally, a key test will be how GM applies the cost-saving strategies used in the global emerging market project to other vehicle programs.  Houlihan has been named to lead efforts to apply the cost lessons learned from this project to GM\u2019s global lineup of crossovers for the Cadillac, Buick, Chevrolet and GMC brands.","517":"March 18 (Reuters) - General Motors Co will furlough all its employees in Brazil starting on March 30, the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, suggesting that GM\u2019s production in South America\u2019s main car market would stop due to the coronavirus outbreak.

GM\u2019s investment was to be over a 10-year period and was conditional on the company winning union concessions and getting government financial support.  State-run KDB previously said it may contribute about 500 billion won ($463.13 million), proportional to its 17 percent stake in GM Korea, to the total investment.  \u201cGM has expressed its intention to increase the size of new money injection from its previous plan to normalize management, and asked the KDB to expand its funding proportional to its stake,\u201d the person told Reuters, requesting anonymity as the matter was confidential.  The person declined to comment on the size of the increased investment.  South Korean online media MoneyToday reported on Wednesday that GM said it would expand the investment to more than 4 trillion won, meaning KDB\u2019s spending would rise to 700 billion won.  GM and KDB declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.  GM in February unveiled a major restructuring plan for the money-losing unit, involving shuttering one of its four South Korean plants and voluntary redundancies for 2,600 workers.

GM\u2019s actions add up to the biggest restructuring for the U.S. No. 1 carmaker since its bankruptcy a decade ago, and mark a turning point for the North American auto industry. U.S. automakers have enjoyed nearly a decade of prosperity since the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the government bailouts of GM and the former Chrysler Corp.  GM\u2019s announcement immediately drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, highlighting the political risks facing GM.  He demanded the automaker find a new vehicle to build in Ohio and added that he had told GM Chief Executive Mary Barra he was unhappy with her decision to cut production at an Ohio factory. Ohio will be a key state in the 2020 presidential campaign.  \u201cI have no doubt that in the not too distant future, they\u2019ll put something else. They better put something else in,\u201d Trump, who has pushed for more manufacturing jobs throughout his almost two years in office, said.  GM did not immediately comment on Trump\u2019s remarks, but the company noted it has other facilities in Ohio including a transmission plant in Toledo and metal center in Parma.  GM and its rivals are facing rising bills for technological transformation, increased risks from U.S. trade policy and investors reluctant to fund their traditional product strategies.  Barra on Monday portrayed the decision to put five North American factories on notice for potential closure and cut nearly 15,000 jobs as necessary to keep the company strong as it plows money into new technology and new businesses such as robo-taxi services.  \u201cThis industry is changing very rapidly,\u201d Barra said during a press briefing. \u201cThese are things we are doing to strengthen our core business.\u201d  GM shares rose as much as 7.8 percent following the announcement, and were nearly 6 percent higher at $37.97 in mid-afternoon trading. Shares of Detroit rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also rose, outpacing the broader market.  GM plans to halt production next year at three assembly plants: the Lordstown small-car factory near Youngstown, Ohio; the Detroit-Hamtramck complex in Detroit; and the Oshawa, Ontario, assembly complex near Toronto. It will also stop building several models now assembled at those plants, including the Chevrolet Cruze, the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse. The Cruze compact car will be discontinued in the U.S. market in 2019, although GM may continue building it in Mexico for other markets, Barra said.  Plants in Baltimore, Maryland, and the suburban Detroit community of Warren, Michigan, both of which make powertrain components, have no products assigned to them after 2019 and are at risk of closure, GM said. The company said it will also close two unidentified factories outside North America.  \u201cWe are right-sizing capacity for the realities of the marketplace,\u201d Barra said.  GM is also moving to cut capital spending overall, even as it says it will double the resources dedicated to electric and self-driving vehicles over the next two years.  GM last year promised to launch a fleet of 20 new battery electric vehicles in North America by 2023, along with at least 10 new electric vehicles in China by 2020. The expenditures to bring those vehicles to production will start to hit with new batteries and body architectures designed to generate profits.  GM also is ramping up hiring at its GM Cruise autonomous vehicle unit, pushing to overcome technical challenges and make good on a plan to launch a robo-taxi service next year.  Even with the higher spending on electric and autonomous vehicles, GM plans to reduce overall annual capital spending to $7 billion by 2020 from an average of $8.5 billion a year during the 2017-2019 period. The automaker has come under pressure from investors to return more cash in the form of share buybacks and dividends.  Slideshow ( 21 images )  Cost pressures on GM and other automakers and suppliers have increased as demand has waned for traditional sedans. The company has said tariffs on imported steel, imposed earlier this year by the Trump administration, have cost it $1 billion.  Barra did not link Monday\u2019s cuts to tariff pressures, but said trade costs are among the \u201cheadwinds\u201d GM faces as it deals with broader technology change and market shifts.  GM\u2019s actions provoked anger from political figures on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border, and from its main North American unions.  The United Auto Workers, which represents U.S. workers, vowed to fight the cuts. \u201cGeneral Motors\u2019 decision today ... will not go unchallenged by the UAW,\u201d said Terry Dittes, the union\u2019s vice president in charge of negotiations with GM. Some UAW workers could land jobs at other GM factories, but many will face uncertain futures unless GM reverses course.  Slideshow ( 21 images )  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he spoke with Barra and expressed \u201cdeep disappointment.\u201d  In the United States, Trump\u2019s economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was scheduled to meet with Barra on Monday.  GM said it will take pre-tax charges of $3 billion to $3.8 billion to pay for the cutbacks, but expects the actions to improve annual free cash flow by $6 billion by the end of 2020.  SMALLER WORKFORCE  GM\u2019s North American salaried workforce, including engineers and executives, will shrink by 15 percent, or about 8,000 jobs. The company said it will cut executive ranks by 25 per cent to \u201cstreamline decision making.\u201d  Even as GM is moving to lay off salaried staff, the company is hiring. At GM\u2019s Detroit headquarters on Monday, there were signs directing people to a \u201cnew hire orientation\u201d meeting.  Barra said GM can reduce annual capital spending by $1.5 billion and increase investment in electric and autonomous vehicles and connected vehicle technology because it has largely completed investing in new generations of trucks and sport utility vehicles. Some 75 percent of its global sales will come from just five vehicle architectures by the early 2020s, which means GM can reduce the people and capital required to keep its product portfolio updated.  Unlike Japanese automakers Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Honda Motor Co Ltd and Toyota Motor Corp, which rely on a more flexible system where they make multiple vehicles at a single plant, GM has too many factories that make just a single model.  The collapse in sales of compact and midsize sedans has hit certain GM models harder than rival Japanese brands. Sales of the Honda Civic are down 11 percent through the first 10 months of 2018. But sales of the Chevrolet Cruze are off 22 percent.  The Hamtramck and Lordstown assembly plants are currently operating on one shift. A rule of thumb for the automotive industry is that if a plant is running below 80 percent of production capacity, it is losing money. GM has several plants running well below that, and Barra said North American operations overall were operating at 70 percent capacity. Consultancy LMC estimates that Lordstown operates at just 31 percent of production capacity in 2018.  Through the UAW, workers at Lordstown have worked to improve quality, cut the number of union locals to make it easier for GM to negotiate and agreed to the outsourcing of some jobs, in a bid to persuade the automaker to add more models to its factory line.  Trump won Ohio in 2016 campaigning on bringing manufacturing jobs back to America.  \u201cSo far, President Trump has been asleep at the switch and owes this community an explanation,\u201d U.S. Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat whose district includes Lordstown, wrote on Twitter.  At the same time, many of GM\u2019s plants producing its higher-margin trucks and SUVs are running on three shifts, with some running six and sometimes seven days a week to keep up with demand. Some displaced GM car plant workers could find jobs at truck factories, GM officials said.  Rivals Ford and Fiat Chrysler have both curtailed U.S. car production. Ford said in April it planned to stop building nearly all cars in North America. Fiat Chrysler moved even earlier to discontinue most of its sedans.","523":"Slideshow ( 5 images )  SAN JOSE, Calif. - (Reuters) - Arm Holdings, the British chip technology firm owned by Japan\u2019s Softbank Group Corp, is joining with automakers General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp to establish common computing systems for self-driving cars, an effort the companies hope will speed development of the technology.  Arm supplies the underlying technology for the processors found in today\u2019s smart phones but does not make chips itself. Its ties to the automotive industry go back to the late 1990s, when automakers began to add computer chips to vehicles for functions like engine control and diagnostics.  On Tuesday the company said it was helping to create the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, or AVCC, along with the two automakers and industry suppliers Bosch Corp [ROBSCJ.UL], Denso Corp and Continental AG. Also helping found the group are semiconductor companies Nvidia Corp and NXP Semiconductors, both of which embed Arm\u2019s technology into their chips.  With automakers and tech companies working on self-driving vehicles, analysts expect the number of chips in cars to expand. But the current test vehicles being used to develop self-driving software are using the same kind of large, electricity-hungry chips found in data centers. Across the industry, chip firms and automakers agree that the power diet and size of the gear must be cut drastically to fit into cars for the general public, to perhaps a tenth or less the levels of current systems.  \u201cI just came back from trips in the U.S. and China and had the opportunity to ride in four different types of autonomous vehicles. They were great prototype platforms for proving the software, but when I asked to look at the electronics powering these vehicles, it literally was servers in trunks,\u201d Chet Babla, Arm\u2019s vice president of automotive, told Reuters in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d  The AVCC will be an independent group funded by membership fees from the companies that join. Arm officials said its work will be open to non-members.  The group\u2019s first task will be to establish a common computing architecture. That effort aims to make it easier for car companies to write software that will work on chips from different vendors, similar to how Microsoft Corp Windows-based software works on processors from Intel Corp or Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  \u201cThe massive amount of technological innovation required to power fully self-driving vehicles at scale requires collaboration at an industry level,\u201d Massimo Osella, chairman of the new group\u2019s board and a lab group manager for research and development at GM, said in a statement.","524":"FILE PHOTO: Kevin Wale, GM China group president, speaks during a news conference in Shanghai September 24, 2009.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  Under the alliance, Honda and GM said, the companies intend to share common vehicle platforms, including electrified and internal combustion propulsion systems.  The companies still need to complete a definitive agreement and officials said greater details on expected cost savings would be available then, but a person familiar with the matter said the savings would run in the billions of dollars for each company.  The partnership represents a significant expansion of existing collaborations between the two companies on electric and autonomous vehicles, connected vehicle technology and fuel cells. Honda is an investor in Cruise, the self-driving business that GM majority owns.  \u201cOverall, we believe this alliance would help both companies realize significant cost savings in the development of our vehicle portfolios,\u201d GM President Mark Reuss said in a statement.  The deal marks another milestone in the consolidation of the global auto industry, as pressures to cut emissions and move toward EVs strain the capital and engineering resources of even the largest players.  Former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) FCHA.MI Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne had for years pushed for consolidation in the global auto industry, arguing it was inevitable to manage prohibitive capital costs.  FCA announced a $50 billion merger with France's PSA PEUP.PA last year to create the world's fourth largest carmaker, Stellantis, in a move to address cost and scale issues. That deal is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2021.  Japan's Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T has been expanding ties with smaller Japanese automakers such as Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T and Subaru 9778.T. Ford Motor Co F.N and German automaker Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE have forged a wide-ranging alliance covering electric and commercial vehicles and autonomous driving technology.  Analysts and GM investors have been pushing for a transformational change at the Detroit automaker, with repeated questions around the spinoff of its EV operations into a separate company. GM CEO Mary Barra has said such an option was not off the table.  GM and Honda said in April they would jointly develop two new EVs for Honda and were planning to explore more ways to expand their alliance. They have already worked together on the design of an autonomous vehicle called Cruise Origin, and also collaborated on fuel cells and batteries.  Honda has for years remained largely independent, staying clear of industry mergers. But the GM alliance will give it economies of scale it cannot achieve on its own, Honda Executive Vice President Seji Kuraishi said. North America is Honda\u2019s largest market and GM\u2019s second largest behind China.  GM and Honda said joint development discussions will begin immediately, with engineering work starting in early 2021.  The companies plan to explore vehicle platform-sharing possibilities in more than four core segments including crossovers and midsized pickup trucks, along with propulsion systems, infotainment and connectivity services, advanced driver-assist features, vehicle connectivity and other technology. They also will cooperate on purchasing.  Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said in a research note that it was \u201cencouraging\u201d to see the companies teaming up on gasoline-powered engines as that technology still requires investment even as the industry shifts to EVs.","527":"SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors GM.N has agreed to set up its Asia-Pacific headquarters in South Korea, in a further commitment by the U.S. automaker to its loss-making local unit, the government said on Thursday.

In return, South Korea will provide funding to local suppliers of GM and other South Korean automakers for the development of parts for electric and self-driving cars, and other key automotive parts.  The statement did not give a figure for the level of support, but a ministry official said it would be worth a combined tens of millions of dollars.  GM agreed last month to keep its local arm afloat after coming close to seeking bankruptcy protection. The firm won major concessions from its labor union on wages and benefits and secured a planned $750 million in funding from state-run Korea Development Bank.  The new regional headquarters will oversee production, sales and technology development for Asia Pacific countries, which excludes China, but includes Australia, India and Thailand among others, a ministry official told Reuters.  GM had previously operated its regional headquarters for \u201cGM International\u201d in Singapore, which covered South Korea, Australia, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East and Africa.  However, the automaker slashed headcount at the Singapore office last year as part of a restructuring to focus on fewer, more profitable markets like China and the United States.  GM has stopped manufacturing in Australia and Indonesia, and significantly restructured its Thai operations. The company has also restructured operations in India and South Africa.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The Labor Department\u2019s monthly strike report showed 46,000 General Motors employees were idle at the automaker\u2019s plants in Michigan and Kentucky during the October payrolls count. Striking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the period are treated as unemployed.  The figure published by the government is only for striking workers. The GM strike by members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) union started on Sept. 16, with ripple effects on the auto industry that economists said bumped up claims for unemployment benefits early in October.  The strike depressed manufacturing output in September.  Drawing comparisons with the 1998 strike at GM, economists expect the current work stoppage to cut off between 75,000 and 80,000 jobs from October nonfarm payrolls. The estimates include industry layoffs related to the GM strike.  \u201cThe effects of this strike would wipe out most of September\u2019s job growth,\u201d said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network. \u201cThis is a crash we can see coming, but it is one that will be temporary.\u201d  The government will publish its closely watched employment report for October next Friday. Payrolls increased by 136,000 jobs in September, below the monthly average of 161,000 this year. The three-month average gain in private employment fell to 119,000, the smallest since July 2012, from 135,000 in August.  WEAK DATA STREAM  GM and the UAW reached a tentative deal last week. The union said workers would stay off the job while they vote on the proposed four-year contract. Voting that could end the strike was expected to conclude on Friday.  According to a preliminary Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 90,000 jobs in October. The household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived would likely consider the striking workers as employed. Still, economists are forecasting the unemployment rate rising to 3.6% this month from a near 50-year low of 3.5% in September.  Though payrolls growth is likely to pick up again, the small monthly gain could still rattle financial markets already on edge following a raft of weak data, including September retail sales, durable goods orders and manufacturing production. Collectively, these reports have cast a shadow on the longest economic expansion on record.  The expansion, now in its 11th year, is being hamstrung by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has eroded business confidence and weighed on business investment.  A strike by public school teachers in Chicago could temper expectations for a rebound in job growth in November.  \u201cIf the 25,000 Chicago teachers are still on strike next month, the bounce-back in November payrolls will look a little more muted,\u201d said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.","531":"WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - A group representing General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG and other major automakers filed suit Friday to block a Massachusetts state ballot initiative that seeks to expand consumer access to vehicle data.

GM workers have been staging two, four-hour strikes daily since Oct. 30 as they demand an end to a wage freeze put in place after the 2018 deal that saved the Korean operations from bankruptcy.  The strikes and other industrial action have cost the company 17,000 vehicles in lost production, a number that will hit 20,000 by the end of the week, Steve Kiefer, president of GM\u2019s international operations, told Reuters.  That blow to production was on top of the 60,000 units lost earlier in the year during the coronavirus pandemic, making it likely GM Korea would not turn a profit this year unless it could recapture that output, he added.  \u201cWe\u2019re basically being held hostage in the short term by lack of vehicle production,\u201d Kiefer said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s having a very significant short-term financial impact.\u201d  The industrial actions would \u201cbasically make it impossible for us to allocate any further investments or ... new products to the country of Korea. It\u2019s making the country non-competitive,\u201d he said.  \u201cIt is going to have long-term effects if we can\u2019t get this resolved in the coming weeks.\u201d  GM builds as many as 500,000 vehicles a year in South Korea, shipping many to the United States including the popular Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV. The automaker employs about 12,000 people in the country.  GM management wants a two-year labor deal instead of the usual one-year agreement, and have offered union members a signing bonus of 8 million won ($7,230) each for 2020 and 2021.  The union, however, wants to stick to a one-year deal and yearly performance bonus of 22 million won each, as well as continued operation at both plants in Bupyeong.  \u201cWe are not only striking over wage issues, but also over job security at our No. 2 plant in Bupyeong, which hires about 1,200 workers,\u201d union official Jung Jai-heon said.  The sides have failed to reach a deal after 24 rounds of negotiations.  Some current and former subcontract workers are also demanding to be hired as full-time staff with the same pay and benefits, potentially costing GM Korea about $320 million.  Government officials were unavailable to comment but the Korea Development Bank, GM Korea\u2019s second-largest shareholder, called on both sides to make concessions.  GM Korea reported an operating loss of 332 billion won ($300.8 million) in 2019, trimming a loss of 615 billion won a year earlier.  CHINA BECKONS  Faced with low production rates and poor sales, GM agreed on a rescue package worth $7.15 billion from the South Korean government in 2018. Under the terms of the binding deal, GM cannot exit its investment in the country for 10 years.  While it would be hard to quit South Korea in the short term, the long-term future was in doubt, Kiefer said.  GM would abide by any past agreements, including plans to build a 2023 Chevrolet crossover in Korea, but even spending on that program had been suspended due to the strikes.  \u201cWe would prefer to make this model work ... but as of now, we\u2019re losing confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to invest in that country,\u201d Kiefer said.

REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido  SHANGHAI\/BEIJING (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is accelerating the pace of electric vehicle (EV) launches in China as policymakers in the world's biggest auto market continue to promote EVs as an alternative to gasoline cars.  Matt Tsien, head of GM\u2019s China operations, said in Shanghai on Tuesday the U.S. automaker plans to launch 10 heavily electrified vehicle models in China from 2021 through 2023, adding to the 10 it has already planned for 2016 through 2020.  \u201cClearly, we have a strategy in place and there is an implementation in place to do that,\u201d Tsien told a small group of reporters, referring to GM\u2019s new-energy vehicles being developed and deployed by its two joint ventures in the China marketplace.  The acceleration of electric car launches by the Detroit automaker comes as stringent new energy vehicle production quotas are to take effect in China next year.  Those quotas, to be made more stringent over time, have prompted a flurry of electric car deals and new launches of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid models as automakers in China race to ensure they do not fall short.  In April, China\u2019s state planner said it would remove foreign ownership caps for companies making fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in 2018, for makers of commercial vehicles in 2020, and the wider car market by 2022.  GM\u2019s Tsien on Tuesday said the company does not plan to take advantage of the easing of those ownership restrictions.  GM plans to continue to work through its current joint ventures with local Chinese automakers to design and develop new-energy vehicles for the Chinese market, he told reporters.  New energy vehicles in China largely refer to all-electric battery cars, plug-in electric hybrids, as well hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.","536":"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - General Motors GM.N is overhauling its Chinese line-up with a greater emphasis on electric cars and smart-driving technology to stem a slide in sales after more than two decades of growth in a country that contributes nearly a fifth of its profit.  FILE PHOTO: A new Cadillac XT6 SUV of GM is presented during the media day for Shanghai auto show in Shanghai, China, April 16, 2019. REUTERS\/Aly Song  GM\u2019s new China boss Julian Blissett told Reuters it would renew its focus on luxury Cadillacs, roll out bigger but greener sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and target entry-level buyers with low-cost micro electric vehicles (EVs).  He said new technologies such as EVs and cars with near hands-free driving for highways would play a key role in GM\u2019s China initiatives, which are part of a push to regain momentum lost in the face of intense competition and shifting tastes.  Blissett, who replaced China veteran Matt Tsien this year, spoke to Reuters ahead of GM\u2019s Tech Day event in Shanghai later on Wednesday, where he and Chief Executive Mary Barra are expected to announce some of the new technology and product rollout plans.  \u201cThis market is rapidly electrifying. Cadillac is on a path to very heavy electrification. Buick is also going to heavily electrify,\u201d said Blissett, adding that GM\u2019s Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling would also go down the electric route.  \u201cThe market is changing dramatically. So the concept of standing still in China doesn\u2019t work.\u201d  GM sells its Chevrolets, Buicks and Cadillacs in China as well as its local brands Wuling and Baojun and has been one of the foreign success stories in the world's biggest auto market along with Germany's Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE.  But GM sales have taken a hit, falling to 3.1 million vehicles in 2019 from a record 4 million in 2017.  A slowdown in China\u2019s economy and the resulting weakness in its auto market have been a big factor behind GM\u2019s sales slump, but analysts say competition has become fierce too.  Toyota 7203.T, Volkswagen and Honda 7267.T have been eating into GM's business while Chinese automakers such as Geely 0175.HK and Great Wall 601633.SS are making better-quality cars that can compete more effectively with the global giants.  GM is also facing competition from Tesla TSLA.O while Lynk & Co and Polestar, brands affiliated with Volvo, have rolled out sleek eye-catching designs that Chinese consumers crave.  BACK TO 4 MILLION  In 2017, GM China had a 14.3% share of overall sales of 28.2 million vehicles. By 2019, that had fallen to a share of 12.2% out of 25.4 million cars.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Blissett said the key objective of its strategy was to get back to sales of 4 million vehicles a year as soon as possible.  \u201cOur business is a high engineering cost, high capital cost business, so, without scale, it\u2019s quite difficult to make money. We do need to return to that,\u201d he told Reuters.  He said he could not give a precise timeframe for when GM would hit its goal because of the uncertainty about how fast economies around the world recover from the coronavirus fallout.  Some GM officials have admitted privately that its brands, especially Chevrolet, have been slow to introduce more SUVs in China as they became increasingly popular.  However, both Buick and Chevrolet now have four SUVs each and Cadillac has three, Blissett said.  Analysts have also said the promotion of its top-end Cadillac brand came at the expense of Buick and Chevy sales, and that it failed to match rivals with their sleeker designs.  Blissett said GM would sell bigger SUVs, many of them electric, for its Chevy, Buick and Cadillac brands, though traditional gasoline-powered SUVs still offered GM \u201chuge opportunities\u201d to boost sales in China.  GM also wants to transform Wuling into a brand more focused on micro, electric \u201cpeople-mover\u201d vans, he said.  ELECTRIC REVOLUTION  \u201cIn the next five years, more than 50% of our capital and engineering deployment will go towards electrification and autonomous-drive technology. That should give you an indication where GM is betting on its future,\u201d GM\u2019s Blissett said.  \u201cChinese consumers are very embracing of technology, be that technology on the phone, be that e-commerce, be that intelligent driving technology, be that electrification. Although Europe and the U.S. have fairly significant plans on a governmental and market point of view, the electrification of cars is going to happen much faster here in China,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe intend to be right in the heart of that market. So, we will heavily play in the EV space. And that\u2019s the reason why we are investing as we are.\u201d  GM\u2019s Wuling and Baojun brands have borne the brunt of falling sales over the past two years as lower-income consumers bought fewer cars in the face of slower growth and as competition from Chinese rivals at the entry level intensified.  There are signs of life at Wuling, however, with sales up 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020.  GM hopes its new Wuling MINI EV launched this year, a micro two-door car, and a series of similar cars in the pipeline, will help it win back share. Before EV subsidies, the MINI EV can cost as little as 28,800 yuan ($4,150) for a basic model.  \u2018WINNERS AND LOSERS\u2019  To be sure, GM has made blunders, such as equipping some compact cars with unpopular three-cylinder engines. That hit GM sales significantly and it had to resurrect a four-cylinder gasoline engine for some models.  Still, analysts said much of the body blow GM\u2019s brands took in China has come from local brands that have significantly improved the quality of their cars and as Japanese and German rivals boosted sales despite a weaker overall market.  Beijing\u2019s emphasis on greener vehicles has also significantly pushed up the costs associated with the designing and manufacturing cars, which have combined to trigger a shake-up of China\u2019s auto industry.  Already, small Chinese brands such as Lifan have gone out of business while French carmaker PSA PEUP.PA has scaled back its operations significantly and Renault RENA.PA, which is in a global alliance with Nissan 7201.T, packed up and left.  \u201cThere is a revolution going on in the industry,\u201d said Blissett. \u201cThere are also winners and losers in the global brands. The trend is actually for the local brands to lose share if you look at the total trend. Luxury is a gain in share.\u201d  Analysts expect the consolidation in the auto industry to continue unabated in the coming years, with more failures, and also more mergers and acquisitions.  China auto industry expert Michael Dunne said if GM failed to manage its numerous brands in China properly, one might end up becoming a casualty.  \u201cThe introduction of Cadillac has had the effect of knocking Buick down a notch in the eyes of Chinese consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cBuick is tilting more towards where Chevy plays, and as a result the two brands are crowding each other and are now throwing weaker punches.\u201d","537":"WASHINGTON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Major automakers including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are asking to intervene in a lawsuit filed by 23 U.S. states last month, the companies said on Monday.

Trump said on Twitter that the 25 percent tariff placed on imported pickup trucks and commercial vans from markets outside North America in the 1960s had long boosted U.S. vehicle production.  \u201cIf we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio, Michigan & Maryland.\u201d  The United States currently has a 2.5 percent tariff on imported cars and sport utility vehicles from markets outside North America and South Korea. The new North American trade deal exempts the first 2.6 million SUVs and passenger cars built in Mexico and Canada from new tariffs.  Several automakers said privately on Wednesday they feared GM\u2019s action could prompt Trump to take action faster than expected on new tariffs.  GM did not directly comment on Trump\u2019s tweets, but reiterated that it was committed to investing in the United States. On Monday, the company said it would shutter five North American plants, stop building six low-selling passenger cars in North America and cut up to 15,000 jobs. The company has no plans to shift production of those vehicles to other markets.  The administration has for months been considering imposing dramatic new tariffs on imported vehicles.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  The U.S. Commerce Department has circulated draft recommendations to the White House on its investigation into whether to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on imported cars and parts on national security grounds, Reuters reported earlier this month.  \u201cThe President has great power on this issue - Because of the G.M. event, it is being studied now!\u201d Trump said.  The prospect of tariffs of 25 percent on imported autos and parts has sent shockwaves through the auto industry, with both U.S. and foreign-brand producers lobbying against it and warning that national security tariffs on EU and Japanese vehicles could dramatically raise the price of many vehicles.  \u2018ALL AVAILABLE TOOLS\u2019  Trump has also harshly criticized GM for building cars in China. The United States slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on Chinese-made vehicles earlier this year, prompting China to retaliate.  China currently imposes a 40 percent tariff on U.S. automobiles, while the United States has a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese vehicles.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said in a statement on Wednesday that he \u201cwill examine all available tools to equalize the tariffs applied to automobiles.\u201d  Additional tariffs on Chinese-made vehicle and parts would have a limited impact, said Kristin Dziczek, an economist at the Center for Automotive Research. She noted only a small number of vehicles were exported from China to the United States annually.  The White House previously pledged not to move forward with imposing national security tariffs on the European Union or Japan as long as it was making constructive progress in trade talks.  Trump wants the EU and Japan to buy more American-made vehicles. He wants the EU and Japan to make trade concessions including lowering the EU\u2019s 10 percent tariff on imported vehicles and cutting non-tariff barriers.  The White House in recent weeks has reached out to the chief executives of German automakers including Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, BMW AG BMWG.DE and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE about meeting to discuss the status of auto trade.","539":"SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors GM.N and South Korea have agreed to inject $4.35 billions into the carmaker's loss-making local arm to keep it afloat after it came close to seeking bankruptcy protection.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  GM has been struggling to turn round the debt-laden unit, which has been hit by GM\u2019s exit from Europe where it used to export many of its cars. GM Korea has announced plans to close one of its four South Korean plants and let go 2,600 workers.  On Monday, GM reached a preliminary deal with its South Korean labor union, winning concessions on pay and bonuses that allowed GM Korea to avoid seeking bankruptcy protection. The deal was approved by union members on Thursday.  In a non-binding preliminary deal also on Thursday, the state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) said it planned to provide $750 million to GM Korea, in proportion with its 17 percent stake.  Detroit-based GM will invest $3.6 billion, while converting a $2.8 billion loan to the unit into equity, the KDB said.  \u201cThe KDB has agreed to issue a conditional letter of commitment to GM on April 27, considering the urgency of GM headquarters\u2019 liquidity support for GM Korea and aggravated management difficulties of suppliers, and smooth due diligence on GM Korea,\u201d the KDB said in a statement.  The U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea. KDB holds 17 percent and China's SAIC Motor Corp Ltd 600104.SS controls the remaining 6 percent.  Under the preliminary deal with GM, the Korean state-run bank regains a veto power that allows it to block the carmaker\u2019s sale of more than 20 percent of its assets, a KDB official said, declining to give further details.  The KDB said it would sign a legal binding contract with GM after seeing the final results of the due diligence in early May.  The agreement came after GM president Dan Ammann said earlier on Thursday he was very close to finding a solution for the South Korean business.  \u201cOver the last few months, over the last few weeks a lot of very good progress has been made,\u201d he said in a meeting with South Korean ruling party lawmakers.","540":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation on Wednesday to expand the electric vehicle tax credit by 400,000 vehicles per manufacturer, a provision that would give a boost to Tesla Inc and General Motors Co before the existing credit comes to an end for them.  FILE PHOTO: A 2019 Chevrolet Bolt plug-in electric vehicle is displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., January 15, 2019. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  The bill is sponsored by Democratic Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Susan Collins and Democratic Representative Dan Kildee.  The bill could lift electric vehicle sales in a boost for automakers that have committed tens of billions of dollars toward meeting global emissions requirements.  GM and Tesla shares rose on Reuters report that the bill would be introduced. Tesla shares recently traded up nearly 1 percent, while GM was up 0.2 percent.  Supporters hope to attach the proposal to tax legislation that could be considered in the next few months.  The existing $7,500 EV tax credit, which allows taxpayers to deduct part of the cost of buying an electric car, phases out over 15 months once an automaker hits 200,000 cumulative EV sales. GM saw its tax credit cut to $3,750 on April 1. Tesla\u2019s tax credit fell to $3,750 on Jan. 1 and will end entirely at year\u2019s end.  The bill dubbed the \u201cDriving America Forward Act\u201d would grant each automaker a $7,000 tax credit for an additional 400,000 vehicles on top of the existing 200,000 vehicles eligible for $7,500 tax credits. It would shorten the phase-out schedule to nine months.  The bill would also extend the hydrogen fuel cell credit through 2028. The bill is estimated to cost $11.4 billion, with all but $91 million of that tally to extend the EV tax credit.  \u201cWe have a cap that\u2019s got to go up,\u201d Stabenow told a group of automakers at a dinner last week. \u201cI want to get this done as soon as possible.\u201d  The proposal has strong backing from automakers, environmental groups and others, but will face opposition.  Last month, the White House proposed immediately eliminating the $7,500 tax credit, a move it said would save the U.S. government $2.5 billion over a decade.  Senator John Barrasso, a Republican who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, in February proposed legislation to end the credit and impose a highway user fee on EVs to pay for road repairs.  The bill is backed by major automakers including GM, Tesla, Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, BMW AG, Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and utilities.  GM President Mark Reuss said in a statement \u201cthe EV tax credit provides customers with a proven incentive as we work to establish the U.S. as a leader in electrification.\u201d  Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said \u201cas we build and grow the clean energy economy, we must continue to invest in tackling the sector that generates the most pollution: transportation.\u201d  Both GM and Tesla have been lobbying Congress for more than a year to extend or expand the EV tax credit.

Gunsan employs 2,000 out of GM\u2019s 16,000-strong workforce in the Asian nation, with local authorities saying one out of five people in the city were dependent on GM for their livelihood.  \u201cEspecially, the decline in employment (at GM) and subcontractors will be difficult to bear for Gunsan City and North Jeolla province,\u201d Moon told his aides at a regular meeting, according to a statement released by his office.

Since taking office last May, Moon has pushed hard on job creation, especially those for young South Koreans, and the closure of the GM plant is viewed as a setback for his plans regarding boosting employment in Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy.  Workers at the Gunsan GM plant have called the shutdown a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d and threatened a strike.  The factory had been running at about 20 percent of capacity over the past three years even before the U.S. car maker announced the shutdown, the latest of steps taken by GM to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume.  A GM Korea spokesman said on Monday the company was committed to supporting the affected workers. The U.S. automaker launched a voluntary redundancy program last week for all its workers in the nation.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has recently approved import tariffs on washing machines, took the shutdown announcement last week as an opportunity to launch fresh criticism of the free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea.  Trump has been critical of the deal ever since his bid for presidential office and the two countries are in renegotiation.  Moon on Monday also asked his government to act sternly in trade talks with the United States, expressing worry over curbs on imports from other countries recently imposed by Washington.  \u201cDue to the expansion of U.S. import curbs on our export products like steel, electronics, solar panels and washing machines, I worry about our exports as a whole despite our international competitiveness,\u201d said Moon in the same meeting.  \u201cI ask the government to act firmly and sternly to unreasonable protectionist measures, such as by lodging complaints to the World Trade Organisation and checking for violations of the U.S.-South Korea free-trade agreement.\u201d","543":"(Reuters) - The president of General Motors Co's GM.N Mexican unit advised suppliers to prepare to resume operations after the Mexican government said the automotive industry could exit the coronavirus lockdown before June 1 with adequate safety measures.

A GM spokeswoman said the company could not confirm when it would restart operations at any of its facilities in Mexico because it is awaiting more guidance from the government.  The government\u2019s announcement, made on Friday, means that automakers from as early as this week can begin reconnecting supply chains between Mexico and the rest of North America, which depends heavily on parts made south of the U.S. border.  Senior U.S. politicians and auto companies had pressed the Mexican government to reopen factories.  Some politicians are wary, however, of opening too fast.

Slideshow ( 6 images )  The union said it made a counterproposal and warned \u201cthere are still many important issues that remain unresolved.\u201d Also on Tuesday, GM said the strike by U.S. workers forced it to halt production at its pickup and transmission plants in Silao, Mexico, resulting in temporary layoffs of 6,000 workers.  About 48,000 UAW members went on strike on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker\u2019s profit and protection of healthcare benefits.

Analysts estimate the strike could cost GM over $1 billion.  Both sides face broader risks should the U.S. economy slow down. Data released on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade. Stocks fell broadly on the report, and GM\u2019s share price was down more than 3%.  The strike had previously forced GM to lay off at least 2,000 Canadian workers and temporarily close an engine plant in Mexico. Many suppliers have halted or scaled back some operations.  JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in a research note that the strike has cost GM over $1 billion but it may be able to recover some lost profit in the fourth quarter.

Huston-Rough and a Nikola spokeswoman declined to comment further when asked if terms of the deal were being renegotiated.  Shares of Nikola were down 7.1%, while GM\u2019s stock was off 1.5% in midday trading.  When the deal was announced, Nikola said it expected it to close before Sept. 30, adding either side could terminate the agreement if it wasn\u2019t finalized by Dec. 3.  The alliance, announced Sept. 8, included plans for GM to receive an 11% stake in Nikola then worth about $2 billion and payments up to $700 million for building the startup\u2019s Badger pickup.  With Nikola shares now trading below $18 a share, GM\u2019s potential stake is worth less than half the initial value.  In return, GM agreed to supply Nikola with electric batteries, a chassis architecture and a factory to build the Badger pickup, as well as GM\u2019s fuel cell system for Nikola\u2019s planned heavy trucks.  As part of the deal, GM also would keep 80% of EV regulatory credits generated by the Badger and have the right to buy the rest at market rates, which would help GM offset sales of its gasoline-powered vehicles.  Short-seller Hindenburg Research then released a scathing report on Sept. 10 that called Nikola a \u201cfraud\u201d and said Nikola founder and then executive chairman Trevor Milton had made false claims about Nikola\u2019s proprietary technology.  Milton denied the allegations and Nikola threatened legal action while referring the matter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice have reportedly opened investigations into the matter, although neither has confirmed that to Reuters.  Milton, who owns 25% of Nikola, resigned on Sept. 21, citing a desire to not be a distraction. He was replaced by board member and former GM Vice Chairman Steve Girsky, whose firm VectoIQ took Nikola public earlier this year through a reverse merger.  Hindenburg previously said Milton\u2019s exit was \u201conly the beginning of Nikola\u2019s unraveling\u201d and warned GM to \u201ccarefully evaluate\u201d the potential damage to its brand.

The strike will also hit consolidated margins by about 30 basis points, the company said.  AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING HOLDINGS INC  The driveline and drivetrain systems maker said the strike reduced third-quarter sales by $57 million and also warned of an about $250 million hit to full-year revenue, prompting the company to lower its 2019 forecast.

The move by SoftBank\u2019s $100-billion Vision Fund is one of the highest profile, largest investments to date in self-driving technology, an industry that could revolutionize transportation but faces engineering, safety and regulatory challenges, as well as skepticism among potential users.  SoftBank has made a string of large bets in so-called mobility companies, such as ride services provider Uber Technologies Inc UBER.UL, expecting that transportation services for people and goods will explode. The Cruise deal extends that wager, betting that computers will displace drivers and cut operating costs.  GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said GM might explore \u201cother opportunities\u201d with some of the companies that SoftBank has funded, including Uber, China\u2019s Didi, India\u2019s Ola and Southeast Asia\u2019s Grab.  The partnership values Cruise at $11.5 billion, a figure exceeding some analyst targets and a triumph for GM, which was criticized for overpaying an estimated $1 billion for the startup two years ago.  The GM share jump on Thursday was the stock\u2019s largest one-day gain since the company re-listed after its 2009 bankruptcy.  GM Cruise and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo are often described as leading the pack of technology and auto companies competing to create self-driving cars and integrate them into ride services fleets.  Alphabet, which plans to launch a robo taxi service later this year, underscored its own ambitions on Thursday, announcing a deal to buy up to 62,000 minivans from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI for its self-driving fleet.  Ford Motor Co F.N and BMW BMWG.DE both plan to deploy self-driving cars in 2021; Tesla Inc TSLA.O has talked about creating a network of self-driving cars and Uber says it is sticking with a development effort despite an accident in which its self-driving car killed a woman in Arizona.  That accident raised concerns around the United States about the terms under which self-driving cars should be allowed to test and operate.  Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi on Wednesday also said he was in talks to use Waymo technology on the Uber network, a sign of how alliances and partnerships are still being formed.  \u2018REASON TO OWN\u2019 GM  GM\u2019s initial purchase of Cruise was met with skepticism over the price - a billion dollars for an unproven technology. Still, it ignited a deal frenzy in Silicon Valley and hiked self-driving startup valuations, both of which may accelerate after the SoftBank partnership.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  Cruise operated with an unusual amount of autonomy after the purchase by GM, although Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt last year told a Fortune event that it was \u201cnot smooth sailing\u201d at first. \u201cIt took us probably six months to a year to really figure out how to work well together and to achieve what we have now, which is mutual respect,\u201d he said last July.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said his firm had valued Cruise at $4 billion before the SoftBank investment. The deal affirmed that GM was one of the top contenders to deploy self-driving ride hailing. \u201cGM has a meaningful seat at the table,\u201d he said.  Barclays analyst Brian Johnson described the deal for GM as \u201ca reason to own the stock again\u201d.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  GM will also invest $1.1 billion in the unit after the deal closes, the company said.  SoftBank Vision Fund will own a 19.6-percent stake in GM Cruise once the transaction is completed, and will hold one of six seats on the company\u2019s board. Its investment will be held in a preferred security that can be converted to GM common stock after seven years.  SoftBank will initially invest $900 million and a further $1.35 billion when Cruise vehicles are ready for commercial deployment, subject to regulatory approval.  GM said it would break out reporting on GM Cruise financials as a standalone segment, starting in the second quarter. The automaker said it expects to spend about a billion dollars this year and next on self-driving vehicle development and commercialization.  GM has privately told lawmakers it needs Congress to approve long-stalled legislation on robot cars in order to eventually deploy the vehicles in big numbers.  SoftBank will take a stake in a newly created unit, GM Cruise Holdings, whose assets include Cruise Automation, based in San Francisco, and Strobe, a small self-driving sensor developer that Cruise acquired last year.  GM President Dan Ammann said GM Cruise also would oversee monetization of data generated by the company\u2019s self-driving vehicles, which he has said could provide greater margins than GM\u2019s traditional business of buying and selling cars.","550":"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday said it will supply a range of chips for General Motors Co\u2019s next generation of vehicles.

But a GM spokesman on Monday said the plan to reopen Arlington was \u201cfluid,\u201d and that the automaker would not restart production at the plant until it was safe to do so.  The big SUVs are among GM\u2019s most profitable vehicles.  In an email to suppliers viewed by Reuters and confirmed as authentic by GM, the automaker also said it was suspending development work on six future vehicle programs, including updates of the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain, Cadillac XT4, Bolt EV, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra.  GM said preproduction work on those programs would be pushed back to calendar year 2021, with most of the updated vehicles scheduled to be launched as 2022 models.  GM last week told employees and suppliers it was delaying work on some future vehicles while pushing ahead with near-term models such as its redesigned full-size SUVs and the GMC Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevrolet Bolt EUV and Cruise Origin, as well as its new Ultium battery system.  GM said previously that it was closing most of its U.S. plants indefinitely.  In its Monday email, GM asked suppliers to stop work on all pre-production tooling and pre-production parts manufacturing, but also not to dispose of any tooling or materials.  In separate emails to suppliers, GM said it planned to run out production this week of the outgoing Escalade, Yukon, Tahoe and Suburban SUVs in preparation for the launch of the redesigned 2021 models.  GM told Reuters it had solicited volunteers from its workforce to finish the build-out of the current SUVs on a single shift in Arlington. In addition, GM is installing more safeguards in the plant to help protect workers, including thermal temperature scanning and additional personal protective equipment.  The work is expected to be completed in a week.

General Motors Chief Executive Mary Barra departs after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., September 5, 2019. REUTERS\/David Shepardson  The head of the largest U.S. automaker met with Trump days after the president stepped up attacks on the Detroit automaker. He has been slamming GM for much of the last year after the company announced in November it would end production at four U.S. plants and eliminate thousands of jobs.  Barra, accompanied by GM general counsel Craig Glidden, declined upon leaving the White House to say if she discussed the fate of the shuttered Lordstown, Ohio plant with Trump. GM has been in talks to sell the plant to EV startup Workhorse Group Inc and an affiliated, newly formed entity.  People briefed on the matter said Trump and Barra were expected to discuss ongoing contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, the fate of the closing plants, trade issues with China and North America and the Trump administration\u2019s plan to rewrite fuel economy standards through 2026.  The White House declined to comment on the meeting.  Last Friday, Trump again criticized GM on Twitter saying the company \u201cwhich was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there.\u201d  Last week, Trump suggested GM should begin moving operations back to the United States from China. \u201cThey moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE.... Now they should start moving back to America again?\u201d Trump said on Twitter.  GM did not directly comment on Trump\u2019s tweet last week but said its China operations \u201care not a threat to U.S. jobs.\u201d  Trump has previously attacked GM for building vehicles in Mexico and for ending production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland. He has threatened to cut GM subsidies in retaliation and in June rejected a request to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Buick Envisions.  Trump has warned GM not to join Ford Motor Co F.N and three other automakers in backing a voluntary deal with California for stricter fuel economy standards than the administration has proposed. GM has not backed the agreement, arguing that it does not properly credit the company's electric vehicles.","553":"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The race for driverless autonomous vehicles is heating up and on Thursday Cruise became the first to receive a permit to test cars without anyone in them on the streets of San Francisco from California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles.  Cruise, which is majority owned by General Motors Co GM.N and counts Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and SoftBank Group 9984.T as investors, has been testing 180 self-driving cars in San Francisco with a safety driver behind the wheel, and the permit allows five of those cars to roam empty. But don\u2019t expect robo-taxis just yet.  \u201cSo that\u2019s a step or two beyond what we\u2019ll be doing initially with this permit,\u201d said Dan Ammann, Cruise\u2019s chief executive. \u201cIt\u2019s not too far down the road,\u201d he said, but declined to share a timeline.  In a blog post, he added, \"We\u2019re not the first company to receive this permit, but we\u2019re going to be the first to put it to use on the streets of a major U.S. city.\" (here)  It will be an important step for Cruise to charge customers.  For any of the companies to start making money in California, a separate permit is required, state officials said.  As part of SoftBank\u2019s investment, SoftBank is obligated to purchase additional Cruise shares for $1.35 billion when Cruise is ready for commercial deployment.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  \u201cThat\u2019s a nice incentive to get to commercial deployment,\u201d said Ammann, adding Cruise was in \u201cvery strong\u201d financial shape after raising more than $7 billion. Cruise booked a $1 billion loss in 2019, according to a GM filing.  Cruise is the fifth company to receive the driverless permit in California. Alphabet\u2019s Waymo was the first in late 2018 to receive it for about three dozen test vehicles with speeds of up to 65 miles per hour. This year SoftBank-backed Nuro, whose vehicle has no steering wheel or pedals, was also approved and has delivered medical supplies for temporary COVID-19 hospitals.  Chinese startup AutoX and Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Zoox also got their permits in recent months. The four previous permits are for cities in Silicon Valley that are easier to navigate.  Under its permit, Cruise cars can go anywhere on San Francisco streets at a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour, and can drive both day and night.  In Arizona, which has been more open to testing of self-driving cars without drivers, Waymo has already been charging a select group of customers since summer of 2019 for empty vans that pull up and shuttle them around. That program - temporarily paused for the pandemic - was restarted in October and is expected to soon open to the wider public.  To prepare for its robotaxi future, Cruise is working on improving its ride hailing app that employees use for free to get around the city, Ammann said.  That future would likely eventually include the Cruise Origin an electric vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals unveiled in January, but it would require approval from The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).","554":"DETROIT (Reuters) - At Planet Ford, which boasts it is the No. 1 Ford volume dealer in the Houston area, customers shopping for a 2019 F-150 pickup truck can get discounts from Ford Motor Co F.N of more than $8,000 - and that is just the start.  FILE PHOTO: A 2019 Ram 1500 pickup truck is on display in front of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) Sterling Heights Assembly Plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, U.S., October 22, 2018. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  The dealership\u2019s website lists a dozen other ways for truck buyers to get a price cut: being a student, a member of the military or a first-responder organization, a season-ticket holder for the National Football League\u2019s Houston Texans, or a member of the Farm Bureau.  \u201cFord is a sponsor of the Houston Rodeo, and offers an additional $1,000 rebate on the F-150 to people who volunteer with the rodeo,\u201d said Aaron Smith, general sales manager at Planet Ford.  Rodeo fans would feel right at home watching the frenzied competition in the U.S. large pickup truck market.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N, General Motors Co GM.N and Ford escalated a price war in June in one of the few vehicle market segments on the planet that offers substantial profits - and one in which the three Detroit automakers enjoy an oligopoly, shielded by heavy tariffs on foreign competition.  During the past month, dealers for FCA\u2019s Ram truck brand, GM\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks and Ford\u2019s F-series truck line have been offering discounts of up to 30% or more off the list price. The GMC brand is promoting June as \u201cTruck Month,\u201d signaling to consumers that deep discounts are on offer until the close of the sales reporting period, July 1.  U.S. automakers report June and second-quarter sales next week.  DRAMATIC DISCOUNTS  While the heavy discounts are available in much of the country, not all dealers are offering such deals. More popular limited-production models such as Ford\u2019s F-150 Raptor are selling for full retail price.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Overall, discounts on light-duty pickup trucks in June have averaged $5,250, 11% higher than the year-to-date average of $4,726, according to market research firm J.D. Power.  The price-cutting is unusual because FCA\u2019s Ram brand and GM\u2019s Chevrolet and GMC brands launched new versions of their large pickups within the last year. Normally, automakers avoid major discounts on freshly redesigned vehicles.  But these are not normal times. FCA Chief Executive Officer Mike Manley said last year he wants to move the Ram pickup line into second place in U.S. sales, displacing Silverado and closing the gap with Ford\u2019s F-series, the segment leader for 42 years.  The new Ram has received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch (30.5 cm) display screen, and sales are up nearly 22% this year through May, selling 22,000 more vehicles than the Silverado.  \u201cClearly, FCA is trying to grab market share while GM is still ramping up,\u201d said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs.  FCA said in a statement on Thursday the automaker will \u201cstick with what works for us.\u201d  BALANCED APPROACH  GM is under pressure to deliver as much as $10 billion in free cash flow in the final three quarters of 2019 to hit its full-year target, amid stagnant U.S. demand and plummeting industry sales in China.  GM will report second-quarter U.S. sales on July 2. Automotive News estimated Silverado sales fell 11.8% through May, while sales of the higher-priced GMC Sierra were up 4%.  \u201cWe will defend our franchise and we will do it the right way,\u201d said Barry Engle, head of GM\u2019s North American operations. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to just roll over and allow our truck business to be taken away from us.\u201d  Engle said Silverado sales numbers in part reflect an effort to build more higher-margin Sierras aimed at buyers willing to spend extra dollars on a luxury truck.  Ford, which has the oldest pickup truck in the market, had flat F-series sales through the end of May.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit unprecedented,\u201d said Ford\u2019s truck marketing manager, Todd Eckert, of the heavy discounting so early in the life cycle of his rivals\u2019 trucks.  Ford will defend its position, but not at any cost, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s about having a balanced approach.\u201d  Because incentives erode profit margins, the automakers continue to juggle discounts against diminished margins.  \u201cThis is a segment that has been profitable for all of us,\u201d said GM\u2019s Engle. \u201cWe\u2019d like to keep it that way.\u201d","555":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra said Thursday the automaker will boost capital spending over the next three years to speed development of electric vehicles, funded by expanded production of high-profit pickup trucks in North America.  Barra said GM was talking with automakers about partnerships to develop more vehicles using GM\u2019s battery technology.  GM plans EVs \u201cacross our brands ... into affordable high volume segments,\u201d she said.  The automaker\u2019s EV push is being funded by robust profit from sales of pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America, which drove a stronger-than-expected third quarter profit. GM said it will invest C$1 billion to overhaul an idle plant in Oshawa, Ontario, to expand pickup production, under a tentative agreement with its Canadian union.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to go hard at EVs ... and the North America performance allows us to do that,\u201d she told analysts on a call.  The Detroit company, whose shares were up about 2% in midday trading, also said it would generate cash flow of $7 billion to $9 billion during the second half of the year, as sales in its two largest markets recovered more quickly than anticipated during the global coronavirus pandemic.  Acting Chief Financial Officer John Stapleton said GM will boost annual capital spending through at least 2023 to above the $7 billion rate previously outlined to fund its accelerated EV plans.  Barra told reporters in an earlier call that third-quarter results were driven by \u201cthe faster and stronger-than-expected industry recovery in the U.S. and China.\u201d  Given the economic uncertainty over the impact of the pandemic and the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, she added: \u201cThere are a lot of moving pieces right now, but we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll continue to have a strong recovery\u201d in the fourth quarter.  She said uncertainty over the outcome of the election had been expected and cited greater concern over spiking coronavirus cases in the United States.  GM reported net income of $4 billion, or $2.78 a share in the quarter, compared with $2.35 billion, or $1.60 a share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, GM earned $2.83 a share, above the $1.38 a share analysts had expected. Its forecast for the second half of the year, implied fourth-quarter operating earnings in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion.  GM\u2019s third-quarter EBIT-adjusted margin in North America jumped 6.5 points to 14.9% in the quarter, reflecting the strength of its high-margin pickups and SUVs.  GM repaid $5.2 billion of its revolving credit facilities during the third quarter, and an additional $3.9 billion in October. It expects to repay the balance by year-end.  Earlier, both Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings.  Barra said GM remained in talks with electric and fuel cell vehicle maker Nikola Corp, but a deal to build EV pickups and supply fuel cells to the startup had not been finalized.","556":"The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Warren Transmission Operations Plant in Warren, Michigan October 26, 2015. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - New Buicks, Cadillacs and Chevys may soon start rolling out of factories across America again. On Wednesday, negotiators for the United Auto Workers and General Motors finally struck a deal aimed at ending their month-long dispute over the next four-year workers contract. Details may not emerge until Thursday, and the 48,000 or so union members who work at the $52 billion automaker have to vote on it. Either way, the resolution brings less relief than expected.  That\u2019s because the strike didn\u2019t seem to hurt much, overall. It ought not to have happened at all. GM was guilty of some reckless driving in mid-September by not submitting a decent proposal until the union downing tools was all but inevitable. Even then, more than a few days of picket lines made little sense.  Union politics is partly to blame, too. Perhaps the UAW wanted to be seen flexing its muscles after at least a decade largely accommodating the needs of a struggling industry. And the union is also caught in the middle of an FBI corruption investigation that led to a search of President Gary Jones\u2019 house, among other locations. That made the GM standoff a potentially useful distraction.  GM shareholders, meanwhile, were complacent. As of Wednesday afternoon, the company\u2019s stock was some 5.5% below its pre-strike level, implying a hit to 2019 earnings of $500 million. Yet the mean estimate of sell-side analysts reckons the cost could be as much as double that, Refinitiv data suggest, with some putting lost production alone as high as $2 billion.  The timing helped GM avoid the worst. It had an excess of vehicles waiting to be sold as the strike started. And it has the capacity to make up some of the lost production with overtime. That may have made a resolution less urgent for executives led by boss Mary Barra. Workers, who had to subsist on strike pay of just $250 a week for most of the time, clearly suffered. On this occasion, the company may have escaped with minor damage.","557":"FILE PHOTO - South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon speaks during his inaugural ceremony in Sejong government complex in Sejong, South Korea, June 15, 2017.

UAW leaders from the various U.S. plants will meet on Friday to approve the deal, which will then be sent to the 55,000 members at Ford for final approval, a union spokesman said.  Ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract.  Ford and the UAW began talks on Monday covering larger issues such as pay raises, the use of temporary workers and healthcare insurance coverage, but the union previously said the sides had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d addressing smaller issues.  Ford historically has had an easier relationship with the union than its Detroit rivals.

It also said it would create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs. The GM contract also will provide $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.  Under its deal, GM also will close three plants, but it left the UAW members\u2019 healthcare insurance coverage unchanged.

De Nysschen outlined bold plans to reshape Cadillac\u2019s lineup with a $12 billion product program. He moved Cadillac\u2019s headquarters to New York in 2015, saying the brand\u2019s executives should be closer to the urban customers who had for years shunned it.

The unemployment rate ticked back down to its lowest level in nearly half a century and wage gains remained near their strongest in a decade, the Labor Department\u2019s closely watched monthly employment report showed on Friday.  The numbers suggest consumers will keep the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, chugging along into next year when Americans will decide whether to re-elect President Donald Trump.  The report added to other fairly upbeat data on the trade deficit, housing and orders for big-ticket goods. Together, the improving data appear to validate the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision in October to signal no further interest rate cuts are needed for now. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times this year, starting in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.  U.S. central bank policymakers are expected to highlight the economy\u2019s resilience when they meet on Dec. 10-11, though trade tensions continue to reverberate in the background.  \u201cThis was a strong report, with a solid rise in payrolls, another drop in the unemployment rate, and decent growth in hourly earnings,\u201d said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. \u201cThe Fed will see this as clear vindication of their decision to stop cutting rates.\u201d  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last month, lifted by the gain of 60,200 healthcare workers, the most since March, and increased hiring at restaurants and bars, the government\u2019s survey of establishments showed. Manufacturing recouped all the 43,000 positions lost in October.  But colder-than-normal temperatures in November curbed hiring at construction sites and helped to sink mining payrolls.  The largest increase in payrolls since January pushed job growth well above its monthly average of 180,000 this year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 180,000 jobs in November. The economy created 41,000 more jobs in September and October than previously estimated.  Even discounting the roughly 46,000 GM returnees, employment growth exceeded 200,000 jobs last month. The robust payroll gains suggest the Trump administration\u2019s 17-month trade war with China, which has plunged manufacturing into recession, has not yet spilled over to the broader economy.  Some economists said this could buy the Trump administration more time as it negotiates a \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal with China. Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday the Dec. 15 deadline remained in place for a new round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods set to kick in, adding \u201cthere\u2019s no arbitrary deadline,\u201d on trade talks.  \u201cThe report alleviates pressure on the Trump administration to make a trade deal with China, giving negotiators more leverage to push for a harder line,\u201d said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor in San Francisco.  The dollar .DXY strengthened against a basket of currencies, snapping a five-day losing streak. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street rallied after a roller-coaster week.  STEADY WAGE GAINS  The U.S.-China trade spat has bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure, tipping manufacturing into recession. The magnitude of last month\u2019s increase in payrolls is at odds with other labor market data.  Job openings are near a 1-1\/2-year low, small business hiring intentions have softened relative to 2018 and the Institute for Supply Management survey\u2019s measure of factory employment has contracted for four straight months.  \u201cWhile this morning\u2019s reading is a definite improvement, it does little to explain waning momentum over the past ten months,\u201d said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. \u201cIt remains to be seen if such strength signals a turning point to more robust hiring patterns.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: SUVs move through the assembly line at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Arlington, Texas June 9, 2015. REUTERS\/Mike Stone  Though the labor market remains resilient despite the business investment downturn, hiring has slowed from last year\u2019s average monthly gain of 223,000 because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers. The government has said it could cut job growth for the 12 months through March 2019 by at least 500,000 jobs when it publishes its annual revision next February.  Still, job creation is well over the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.5% percent, matching September\u2019s reading, which was the lowest level since December 1969.  A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 6.9% from 7.0% in October. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, dipped to 63.2% in November from more than a six-year high of 63.3% in October.  Average hourly earnings rose seven cents, or 0.2%, after increasing 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through November, wages rose 3.1% after advancing 3.2% in October. Wages were held back by the concentration of hiring in low-paying industries.  Average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers, considered a more reliable wage measure, increased 0.3% and were up 3.7% on a year-on-year basis in November.  \u201cThat should keep consumer spending in good shape in the coming months,\u201d said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Manufacturing employment rebounded by 54,000 jobs in November. Construction hiring rose by only 1,000 jobs, while mining shed 7,000 jobs.  The leisure and hospitality industry hired 45,000 workers. It has added 219,000 jobs over the last four months, with about two-thirds of the gains at restaurants and bars.  There were also increases in professional and business services, financial activities, and transportation and warehousing jobs last month. Government employment increased by 12,000 jobs.","566":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s U.S. workforce productivity has declined since the automaker recovered from a 2009 bankruptcy, even as its profit per employee has risen, a Reuters analysis shows.  Those trends point to some of the root causes of the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that has shut down the automaker\u2019s U.S. manufacturing plants for 18 days, already costing the company about $100 million a day.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker wants to boost productivity to offset financial pressure from a slowing global economy and investments in electric vehicles. The UAW is focused on increasing the share of profit going to workers, and closing wage gaps between full-time and temporary employees in GM factories.  GM\u2019s unionized workers in the United States build some of the company\u2019s most profitable truck and sport utility vehicles.  GM does not publish direct measures of U.S. productivity. But the number of vehicles the Detroit automaker built in the United States per U.S. employee fell to about 19 in 2018, down 13.5% from the 2010 level.  The Reuters calculation is based on GM annual production numbers sourced from research firm Wards Intelligence and the U.S. employee count in GM\u2019s annual filings.  A GM spokesman declined to comment on the analysis, saying that the automaker was \u201cfocused on negotiating a new labor agreement that builds a stronger future for the company and our workers.\u201d  The UAW said it believes GM\u2019s productivity is better since 2010 and the data would be more accurate based on total hours worked rather than employment.  Between 2010 and 2018 GM\u2019s estimated U.S. profit per employee surged 40% to about $94,097 last year, based on analysts\u2019 assumptions that U.S. operations generate about 90% of the automaker\u2019s North American operating profit disclosed in GM filings.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  Click here for an interactive graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2p5MGjW  However, productivity and operating profit per worker have both slipped at GM between 2017 and 2018.  A broader measure of productivity in the U.S. auto sector shows declining productivity starting in 2013, according to data published by the Center for Automotive Research, an Ann Arbor, Michigan, industry research group.  One possible reason for the broad productivity declines at manufacturers including GM is the increasing complexity of vehicles and the federally mandated items, which result in more work elements, industry experts say.  Increasing production of large pickup trucks and SUVs is another factor causing potential productivity declines.  \u201cThe mix change to SUVs and pickups requires more work,\u201d said Ron Harbour, senior vice president for global automotive manufacturing at consulting firm Oliver Wyman. \u201cPickups for example are the most complex vehicles to build these days.\u201d  GM\u2019s U.S. vehicle production increased 15.5% to about 1.99 million vehicles in 2018, compared with the 2010 level. GM\u2019s U.S. hourly employment remained largely stable or fell slightly during that period, while the number of U.S. salaried jobs rose and eventually exceeded hourly workers.  The company\u2019s salaried hiring was part of a recovery from bankruptcy, as it added a finance arm and information technology staff.  GM\u2019s salaried employees - engineers, accountants, HR managers, marketers and other staff - nearly doubled to 53,000 in 2018 from 2010, lifting overall U.S. worker numbers by 34% to 103,000 last year.  NORTH AMERICAN JOB CUTS  Last November, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra ordered 15,000 jobs cut from GM\u2019s North American workforce to boost profitability at a time when the company is spending billions to develop next-generation technologies.  GM also said at the time that five North American factories had no future product assignments and could be shut down, including car assembly plants in Lordstown, Ohio; Detroit-Hamtramck, and Oshawa, Ontario.  \u201cThese are things we are doing to strengthen our core business,\u201d Barra said in November. \u201cWe are right-sizing capacity for the realities of the marketplace.\u201d  GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are $13 an hour higher than competing nonunion auto plants in southern U.S. states.  UAW said hourly labor costs equate to just 5% to 6% of the price of a vehicle.  Reuters arrived at the productivity figures by looking at GM\u2019s annual U.S. vehicle production as reported by Wards Intelligence and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes from the automaker\u2019s annual reports, and dividing those by GM\u2019s total U.S. salaried and hourly employees combined.  However, when GM\u2019s U.S. salaried employees, which include workers not directly involved in the manufacturing process, are left out of the equation, the company\u2019s productivity per employee rose between 2010 and 2016, while slightly dipping year-over-year in 2017 and 2018.

Slideshow ( 14 images )  The vehicle, named \"Cruise Origin\", was developed with Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T, which took a minority stake in Cruise in 2018 in an effort to catch up with rivals in developing a technology with enormous costs and risk and no market-ready products.  Cruise's Chief Executive Officer, Dan Ammann, said the boxy vehicle about the size of a large SUV with sliding doors on each side will be used for the company's own ride-hailing service, but did not say when the new competitor to Lyft Inc LYFT.O and Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N would launch.  Cruise was valued at $19 billion in May. In July, it delayed plans to launch a commercial robo-taxi service by the end of 2019, and still does not have a permit from California regulators to test self-driving cars without a safety driver. Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo is the only company that has received permission to test without a driver.  While car makers across the world are racing to develop self-driving vehicles, the technology has yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance as recent accidents involving such vehicles raised doubts about its readiness for public roads.  \u201cWe\u2019re obviously still working on something that\u2019s never been done before. So the time lines given aren\u2019t completely certain, but we\u2019re moving really quickly,\u201d Ammann told reporters following the event.  Cruise operates a ride service for its employees in San Francisco that have self-driving cars with safety drivers behind the wheel. Most of Cruise\u2019s 180 test cars operate in the city, and Ammann said they could be used to start a commercial ride-sharing service before the driverless prototype vehicle is ready.  While Ammann said the Cruise Origin was a \u201cfully engineered vehicle that\u2019s on its way to production,\u201d he said he was still talking to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for a waiver to be able to deploy vehicles without human controls on the roads.  He expects prototypes to be tested at private facilities this year and forecast the production cost of an Origin could be half that of a high-end electric sports-utility vehicle (SUV).  Details about where the prototype will be manufactured will come in the next few days, Ammann said.  Cruise is not the only company to propose using vehicles without human controls, and companies such as Navya and May Mobility have developed vehicles that can be used for ride sharing.","568":"WASHINGTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he did not like General Motors Co\u2019s announcement it would cut its North American workforce and slash production on slow-selling models.  He said he told the GM chief executive he was unhappy with the announcement.w (Reporting by Jeff Mason; Writing by Makini Brice; Editing by Doina Chiacu)","569":"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output fell more than expected in September, hampered by a strike at General Motors, and the outlook for factories remained weak amid slowing global growth and unresolved trade tensions.  The Federal Reserve said on Thursday that manufacturing production fell 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 0.6% rise in August. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall industrial production and manufacturing output still fell 0.2%.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would decline 0.2% and industrial output would slip 0.1% in September. Production at factories dropped 0.9% in September on a year-on-year basis.  The Fed\u2019s measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. Industrial output declined 0.4% in September after an upwardly revised gain of 0.8% in August as a result of the manufacturing softness and drop in mining production.  The manufacturing sector, which makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, has been weakened by a 15-month trade war between the United States and China, which has hurt business confidence and investment.  A separate survey of the sector released earlier this month showed manufacturing activity fell to a 10-year low in September as trade tensions weighed on exports.  U.S. President Donald Trump last Friday outlined the first phase of a deal to end the trade war with China and suspended a threatened tariff hike, but officials on both sides said much more work needed to be done before an accord could be agreed.  With overall output declining, the percentage of industrial capacity in use decreased 0.4 percentage point to 77.5 in September from an unrevised 77.9 in August.","570":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - For the first time, Tesla Inc's TSLA.O stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N.

(GRAPHIC: U.S. automakers' expected sales - )  While Tesla\u2019s recent progress has cheered supporters, many analysts and investors remain pessimistic about the company\u2019s ability to consistently deliver profit and cash flow.  The company has repeatedly missed targets in recent years and Musk\u2019s mercurial behavior has come under close scrutiny from financial regulators and shareholders of Tesla.  However, most mainstream automakers are still ramping up new generations of electric vehicles designed to compete with Tesla\u2019s combination of style, technology and performance.  German automakers Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and BMW AG all have promised to launch fully electric premium models. GM\u2019s Cadillac luxury brand is gearing up to launch a series of electric SUVs and cars, while Ford\u2019s Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, unveiled in November, will launch later this year and could compete with Tesla\u2019s Model X or soon-to-launch Model Y SUVs. Ford, GM and other manufacturers have electric pickups in the works to take on Musk\u2019s futuristic Cybertruck.  Rival electric vehicle models from Audi, Jaguar and Porsche have fallen short of Tesla\u2019s driving range between charges and failed to match Tesla\u2019s brand cachet.

GM said the new batteries, which it has branded EME 1.0 and first described last fall, will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.  Battery packs, typically the most expensive component of electric vehicles, can cost $10,000-$12,000 -- nearly a third the price of GM\u2019s Chevrolet Bolt EV. GM aims to cut that price nearly in half by 2021, sources told Reuters earlier this year.  GM and Honda on Thursday said they would \u201ccollaborate\u201d on the batteries, with GM supplying cells and modules, mainly for electric vehicles to be sold by both companies in North America.  A source familiar with GM\u2019s plans said its current battery cell supplier, Korea\u2019s LG Chem, is expected to provide cells for the new battery, which is mainly a GM design.  The new batteries are expected to begin production around 2021, the source said.  GM declined to provide further details, and said it had not finalized supplier agreements for the new batteries. LG Chem did not respond immediately to a request for comment.  GM and Honda have a partnership to jointly develop electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020.  Earlier this year, sources told Reuters that a key element of GM\u2019s new battery design is slashing the amount of cobalt, the most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells. Cobalt prices have soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers.  GM\u2019s new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, the sources told Reuters. Other battery makers are exploring similar changes in battery chemistry and design.

UAW officials and striking workers on the picket lines had said their focus in the dispute with GM was on jobs, pay equity and fairness for workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy. They also wanted to save factories in Ohio and Michigan GM had threatened to close.  This year\u2019s talks - also occurring with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - have been overshadowed by a widening federal investigation into corruption at the union.  The following is a timeline of events leading up to the tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the workers:  Nov. 26, 2018  GM announced the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s biggest restructuring since its 2009 bankruptcy, putting five North American plants on notice for potential closure and saying it would cut nearly 15,000 jobs.  The UAW, which represents U.S. workers at the four U.S. plants targeted, vowed to fight the cuts.  U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that GM save the Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant that was targeted.  Nov. 27, 2018  Trump threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the automaker cutting U.S. jobs and plants.  Dec. 5, 2018  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra warned the Detroit company had excess manufacturing capacity, and said the Lordstown plant\u2019s future would be determined during the 2019 labor talks.  Dec. 14, 2018  GM said more than 1,100 of the 2,800 hourly active U.S. workers at plants losing production had volunteered to transfer to other plants. That number has risen since then to more than 2,300.  Jan. 3, 2019  The UAW sued GM in federal court, claiming its use of temporary workers at a plant in Indiana violated its labor deal.  Feb. 22, 2019  GM extended production at its Detroit Hamtramck plant until January 2020, instead of ending work in June as earlier planned. However, on March 6, the last Chevrolet Cruze small car rolled off the assembly line at the Lordstown plant.  Feb. 26, 2019  The UAW sued GM over its restructuring plan, saying it violated a 2015 collective bargaining agreement.  March 13, 2019  UAW President Gary Jones at the union\u2019s bargaining convention in Detroit said job security and stopping the shift of U.S. jobs to Mexico were top priorities for the contract talks.  March 18, 2019  U.S. prosecutors in Detroit charged Norwood Jewell, a former high-ranking UAW official in charge of labor relations with Fiat Chrysler, of misusing funds to pay for lavish parties for himself and other union officials. The following month, he pleaded guilty.  May 8, 2019  GM said it was in talks to sell the idled Lordstown plant to a cash-strapped electric vehicle startup, Workhorse Group Inc . GM also said it would invest $700 million in three other Ohio plants. The UAW called on GM to put a new product of its own in the plant.  June 5, 2019  Barra defended GM\u2019s proposed sale of the Lordstown plant and said the automaker did not plan to add a new vehicle there.  July 16, 2019  GM and the UAW formally kicked off talks for a new four-year labor deal, with Jones calling on the automaker to keep open plants it had slated for shutdown.  Aug. 28, 2019  The FBI conducted searches at the home of Jones and other locations as part of a corruption probe into illegal payments to union officials.  Sept. 3, 2019  The UAW said it would target GM first in talks with the Detroit automakers for contracts set to expire on Sept. 14.  Sept. 12, 2019  U.S. prosecutors\u2019 probe of alleged corruption within the UAW expanded with the arrest of a senior union official. In a criminal complaint released the following day, a source said Jones was one of the unnamed officials singled out.  Sept. 16, 2019  The UAW workers went on strike against GM. The automaker disclosed it offered the UAW more than $7 billion in new investments, solutions for the Lordstown and Detroit assembly plants that included a battery plant in Ohio and an electric vehicle for the Michigan plant, a pay increase and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  Sept. 17, 2019  GM shifted health insurance costs for the striking workers to the UAW, prompting an outcry from the union and Democratic politicians. On Sept. 26, GM reversed its decision.  Oct. 1, 2019  The UAW rejected a new offer from GM to end the strike. Five days later, UAW senior negotiator Terry Dittes said the talks took a \u201cturn for the worse\u201d and later called on GM to boost U.S. auto production.  Oct. 10, 2019  The union disclosed that GM\u2019s Barra met with the UAW\u2019s Jones and Dittes at the company\u2019s Detroit headquarters, seeking to speed up talks, as the strike neared its fourth week.  Oct. 11, 2019  GM took the unusual step of appealing directly to striking employees, circumventing UAW\u2019s leadership, in a blog post that laid out the terms of its latest offer aimed at ending the strike, upsetting the UAW in the process. The union accused GM of undermining the talks.  Oct. 15, 2019  The sides near a deal after Barra and GM President Mark Reuss join the bargaining table.  Oct. 16, 2019  The UAW and GM announce they reached a tentative agreement, which still must be approved by the members before the strike will officially end.

GM posted a 16 percent jump in new vehicle sales from the previous March, led by a 14 percent increase in higher-margin retail sales to consumers. Fiat Chrysler (FCA) reported a 14 percent increase in sales in March. FCA said it saw a 45 percent spike in sales of its popular Jeep models, giving the brand its best sales month on record.  The strong results for March followed a weak performance in February.  Last year, U.S. auto sales fell 2 percent after hitting a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. Sales are expected to fall further in 2018 as interest rates rise and push up monthly car payments. Also, millions of nearly new vehicles will return to the market this year after coming off lease, providing a lower-cost alternative for consumers.  GM, the No. 1 U.S. automaker saw double-digit sales increases across all of its brands in March, with particularly strong gains for its SUV and pickup truck models.  \u201cMarch was an exceptional month for us,\u201d GM\u2019s U.S. head of sales Kurt McNeil said in a statement. \u201cA growing economy and strong new products helped us execute a very successful plan to conquest customers from other brands.\u201d  GM also reduced its dealer inventory of unsold vehicles - a key metric for analysts - to 72 days from 85 days at the end of February.  But while GM said its average transaction price was up $900 in the first quarter, the company\u2019s consumer discounts as a percentage of transaction prices hit 14.5 percent in March.  Industry analysts consider discounts of over 10 percent to be unhealthy as they undermine resale values.  FCA\u2019s retail sales to consumers outstripped those of No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co.  But FCA also saw a 22 percent increase in lower-margin fleet sales to rental car companies and government agencies. Over the past year FCA has pursued a policy of cutting fleet sales.  Ford reported a 3.4 percent increase in overall sales for March, led by an 8.7 percent rise in fleet sales. Retail sales were up just 0.8 percent in the month.  Ford said sales of its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks were the best since 2000.  Toyota Motor Corp reported a 3.5 percent increase in sales in March, with double-digit increase in SUV and pickup truck sales offsetting a 6.1 percent decrease in sedan sales. Sales of the company\u2019s completely-revamped flagship Camry sedan fell 1.1 percent.  In morning trading, GM shares were up 2.6 percent at $36.68, while FCA shares rose 5.2 percent to $21, and Ford shares were up 1.2 percent at $11.

The purchase price was not disclosed, but sources said it was similar to EV start-up Rivian Automotive LLC\u2019s 2017 acquisition of a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, for $16 million. Burns said the company got a \u201cgreat deal\u201d after 10 months of talks with GM.  Burns, a former Workhorse CEO, said the company has been working on engineering the new truck for the last six months but acknowledged the timetable is \u201caggressive.\u201d However, he said the company has the advantage that the Ohio plant is \u201cfully intact, still warm.\u201d  Burns hopes to have pre-production prototypes coming of the assembly line by April and start production by November 2020 with 400 hourly workers to start.  \u201cWhen you live in a factory area and the factory closes, there is a lot of pain there,\u201d Burns said, saying it wants to build a company for the long term. \u201cThis should be the electric epicenter of the Midwest if you do it right.\u201d  Burns declined to say how much money the company has raised but said they have raised enough to hire the management team and engineers and acquire the factory. He said \u201cthe serious\u201d effort to raise additional financing began on Thursday, and he is looking for new strategic investors.  The fate of the 6.2-million-square-foot Lordstown plant has been a major focus for Trump, who in June 2017 advised workers in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, that factory jobs were not leaving. \u201cDon\u2019t move, don\u2019t sell your house,\u201d he said.  GM last month said it plans an electric battery cell plant near the Lordstown complex that could eventually employ 1,000 people. Sources have said the battery plant would be a joint venture, where the workers are represented by the UAW and earn in the range of $15 to $17 an hour.","578":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co will supply advanced batteries to Japan\u2019s Honda Motor Co, the companies said Thursday, a move that could significantly reduce the cost of future electric vehicles at both automakers after 2020.  FILE PHOTO - The GM logo is seen at the General Motors headquarters in Sao Caetano do Sul, Brazil March 13, 2018. Picture taken March 13, 2018. REUTERS\/Leonardo Benassatto  GM said the new batteries, which it has branded EME 1.0 and first described last fall, will be smaller than current EV batteries, can be charged more quickly and will provide more energy.  Battery packs, typically the most expensive component of electric vehicles, can cost $10,000 to $12,000 - nearly a third the price of GM\u2019s Chevrolet Bolt EV. GM aims to cut that price nearly in half by 2021, sources told Reuters earlier this year.  GM and Honda on Thursday said they would \u201ccollaborate\u201d on the batteries, with GM supplying cells and modules, mainly for electric vehicles to be sold by both companies in North America.  A source familiar with GM\u2019s plans said its current battery cell supplier, Korea\u2019s LG Chem, is expected to provide cells for the new battery, which is mainly a GM design.  The new batteries are expected to begin production around 2021, the source said.  GM declined to provide further details, and said it had not finalized supplier agreements for the new batteries. LG Chem did not respond immediately to a request for comment.  GM and Honda have a partnership to jointly develop electric vehicles with hydrogen fuel cells that are expected to go on sale in 2020.  Earlier this year, sources told Reuters that a key element of GM\u2019s new battery design is slashing the amount of cobalt, the most costly ingredient in current lithium-ion battery cells. Cobalt prices have soared in the past two years in expectation of a surge in demand from automakers.  GM\u2019s new battery design increases the amount of nickel, which enables batteries to store and produce more energy, the sources told Reuters. Other battery makers are exploring similar changes in battery chemistry and design.  The GM batteries are an important element in the automaker\u2019s plan to dramatically ramp up electric vehicle production after 2020, especially in China.  In addition to the EME 1.0 battery system, GM also is developing a dedicated architecture for future electric vehicles that is modular and flexible enough to accommodate a variety of different vehicle types and sizes.","579":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N said on Wednesday they were in talks with White House officials about how they could support production of medical equipment like ventilators that may be needed to combat the coronavirus outbreak.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra spoke to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow about the issue after the Detroit automaker announced it will suspend North American production through March 30. Kudlow told Fox News on Wednesday that he had spoken to one automaker looking at producing ventilators.  GM spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said the automaker \u201cis working to help find solutions for the nation during this difficult time and has offered to help, and we are already studying how we can potentially support production of medical equipment like ventilators.\u201d  Ford said on Wednesday it \u201cstands ready to help the administration in any way we can, including the possibility of producing ventilators and other equipment. We have had preliminary discussions with the U.S. government and are looking into the feasibility.\u201dKudlow praised the idea of autoworkers producing medical equipment when plans were idled. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of can-do spirit that we are hearing and seeing,\u201d Kudlow said.  GM and Ford could face significant hurdles before it could build a complex piece of medical equipment like a ventilator and it is unclear how long it would take to do so, however.  Countries around the world have raised concerns about potential shortages of the ventilators needed to treat critically ill patients suffering from coronavirus. Running in the thousands of dollars per unit, ventilators are used to help people with respiratory difficulties to breathe.  Earlier this week, Britain asked manufacturers including Ford, Honda 7267.T and Rolls Royce RR.L to help make health equipment including ventilators and said it will look at using hotels as hospitals.  During World War Two, GM, Ford and other automakers retooled auto plants to build tanks, planes and other military equipment and weapons, earning Detroit the nickname the \u201cArsenal of Democracy.\u201d  As the coronavirus spread across China in February, a number of manufacturers in China including Apple Inc AAPL.O partner Foxconn 2317.TW and SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co Ltd, a joint venture automaker formed by GM and two Chinese partners, said they had set up production lines to make masks and medical clothing.","580":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Talks for a new four-year labor contract between General Motors Co GM.N and its striking workers took a \"turn for the worse\" on Sunday after the United Auto Workers rejected the largest U.S. automaker's latest offer but the two sides were still talking.  GM made an offer to the union that basically repeated one the UAW had previously rejected, Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the GM department, said in a letter to members. The union provided a copy of the letter to Reuters.  \u201cThese negotiations have taken a turn for the worse,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe, in this union, could not be more disappointed with General Motors,\u201d Dittes said. \u201cThe company has shown an unwillingness to fairly compensate ... the UAW.\u201d  Dittes said the UAW made an offer on Saturday to GM that covered wages, signing bonuses, job security, profit sharing and other issues. He said GM responded on Sunday morning with its counteroffer, which \u201cdid nothing to advance a whole host of issues.\u201d  GM said in a statement that it was committed to negotiating \u201caround the clock\u201d to reach a deal.  \u201cWe continue to negotiate in good faith with very good proposals that benefit employees today and build a stronger future for all of us,\u201d the company said in the statement.  The GM strike began on Sept. 16 with its 48,000 UAW members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker\u2019s profit and protection of healthcare benefits. The sides have been meeting daily.  One key issue is around assembly of future vehicles. The UAW wants GM to make commitments on future products it would build in various plants beyond what has currently been offered, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified.  GM officials previously said the Detroit company\u2019s labor rates are the highest in the industry and it needs the ability to build some vehicles in other markets to keep costs down.  Just before the strike began, GM, the largest U.S. automaker by vehicle sales, said that its offer to the UAW included plans to invest more than $7 billion in its U.S. plants over the life of the deal.  GM also said then it had \u201csolutions\u201d for the Lordstown, Ohio, and Detroit assembly plants that it had previously said would cease making vehicles. Sources said at the time those plans included a battery plant in Ohio and building an electric truck in Detroit.  The UAW has previously said it wants GM to shift vehicle assembly work back from other countries like Mexico and China. The source said that remains an issue in the talks.  Through August, 526,000 of the 573,000 vehicles GM exported from Mexico were sent to the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump and many Democrats have urged GM to shift production to unused or underused U.S. plants.  Other issues remaining in the talks include wages and pensions, the source previously said.  Analysts estimate the strike has cost GM over $1 billion, while LMC Automotive estimated on Thursday that GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2.","581":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed less than expected in October as the drag from a strike at General Motors GM.N was offset by gains elsewhere and hiring in the prior two months was stronger than previously estimated, offering some assurance that consumers would continue to support the slowing economy.  While the Labor Department\u2019s closely watched monthly employment report on Friday showed the unemployment rate rising from a near 50-year low of 3.5% last month, that was due to an influx into the labor force, a sign of confidence in the jobs markets. The report supported the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday to cut interest rates for the third time this year and signal a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.  The longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is being largely restrained by an almost 16-month trade war between the United States and China, which has led to a contraction in business investment and manufacturing.  \u201cThe expansion looks set to continue at least through the first part of next year despite the trade war drag,\u201d said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. \u201cToday\u2019s solid jobs report means that the Fed is likely to keep rates steady in the near term.\u201d  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 128,000 jobs last month, with manufacturing shedding 36,000 positions because of the strike - the most since October 2009, the government\u2019s survey of establishments showed. Striking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the payrolls survey period are treated as unemployed. The strike by about 46,000 workers at GM plants in Michigan and Kentucky ended last Friday.  Job growth in October was also held back by the release of 20,000 temporary workers hired by the government for the 2020 Census. Excluding the strike and Census temporary hires, economists estimate payrolls rose by about 190,000 last month.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by only 89,000 jobs in October. The economy created 95,000 more jobs in August and September than previously estimated.  Manufacturing continues to loom large over the labor market and overall economy, with a survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday showing factory activity firmly stuck in recession in October.  \u201cThe longer the drag from the manufacturing recession goes on it will increasingly weigh on service sector businesses and the health of the overall labor market,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.  The White House on Friday struck an optimistic note on trade negotiations, with economic adviser Larry Kudlow saying Washington was still aiming to sign an initial deal this month.  U.S. stocks rose on the payrolls data and trade hopes, with the Nasdaq .IXIC and benchmark S&P 500 .SPX hitting record highs. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.  HIRING SLOWING  Job growth has slowed this year, averaging 167,000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018, in part because of the U.S-China trade spat, ebbing demand and a shortage of workers.  FILE PHOTO: A \"Help Wanted\" sign reads \"Not Hiring\" in Livonia, Michigan, U.S., October 9, 2019. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  The ISM said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 48.3 last month from 47.8 in September, which was the lowest level since June 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. October marked the third straight month the index was below the 50 threshold.  The index had declined for six straight months. Though the ISM\u2019s new orders and factory employment measures rose, they remained mired in contraction territory.  There are fears the business investment malaise could spill over to the labor market, which is underpinning consumer spending. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said he did not see this risk as the labor market remains healthy. Others agreed, citing the stock market gains.  \u201cA stable equity market at the very least loops right back into supporting consumer spending,\u201d said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.  Solid consumer spending blunted some of the hit on the economy from weak business investment to limit the slowdown in growth to a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June quarter.  Consumers are likely to continue carrying the economy. Average hourly earnings increased six cents, or 0.2% last month after being unchanged in September. That kept the annual increase in wages to 3.0% in October.  The one-tenth of a percentage point rise in the unemployment rate to 3.6% last month reflected 325,000 people rushing into the labor force. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, increased to 7.0% last month from 6.9% in September, which was the lowest level since December 2000.  The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 63.3% last month, the highest since August 2013, from 63.2% in September.  October\u2019s plunge in manufacturing employment reflected the strike-driven 41,600 tumble in payrolls in the auto sector. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 5,000 in September. Manufacturing is struggling under the weight of trade tariffs, which the Trump administration has argued are intended to boost the sector.  Construction employment rose by 10,000 jobs in October. Hiring in the sector has slowed from a peak of 56,000 jobs in January. There were increases in professional and business services, healthcare, financial activities, retail and wholesale trade employment last month.  Employment in the low-paying leisure and hospitality industry jumped by 61,000 jobs, the most in nine months.  Government employment fell by 3,000 jobs in October as the drop in the temporary hires offset increases in state and local government hiring.","582":"May 6 (Reuters) - General Motors Co:  * GENERAL MOTORS CO SAYS AS RESULT OF COVID-19, ESTIMATE IMPACT ON EBIT-ADJUSTED OF ABOUT $1.4 BILLION IN THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020  * GENERAL MOTORS CO - EXPECTS COVID-19 WILL MATERIALLY IMPACT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DURING REMAINDER OF 2020  * GENERAL MOTORS CO SAYS ON TRACK FOR TRANSFORMATION ACTIVITIES TO DRIVE BETWEEN $5.5 BILLION AND $6.0 BILLION OF ANNUAL CASH SAVINGS BY END OF 2020  * GENERAL MOTORS CO SAYS ON TRACK TO REDUCE FY 2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO ABOUT $7.0 BILLION FROM ABOUT $8.5 BILLION ON NORMALIZED RUN-RATE BASIS Source text : (bit.ly\/2W9UizR) Further company coverage:","583":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of GM Korea is seen at its Bupyeong plant in Incheon, South Korea March 29, 2018.

GM, which likely lost production of about 100,000 vehicles in the third quarter, is at the risk of losing another 170,000 vehicles in the current quarter, the brokerage said, with the impact spreading to some of GM\u2019s facilities in Mexico and Canada that receive parts from its U.S. factories.  \u201cWhile investors may look through the one-time impacts...the strike reminds us of the challenge of investing in OEMs at this point in the cycle,\u201d analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note.  The brokerage said GM may now have to revise its target of $4.5 billion in cost savings through 2020, announced last year, as production curtailments and labor-related cost reductions may not happen as fast as the company had expected.  \u201cWe assume just under $900 million of reduced costs or 20% of the original (target),\u201d Levy said.  Credit Suisse said the strike will hurt suppliers, including American Axle AXL.N, Aptiv Plc APTV.N, Lear Corp LEA.N, Delphi Technologies DLPH.N, and Dana Inc DAN.N, whose exposure to GM varies between 5% and 18%, with American Axle at 40%.

Slideshow ( 7 images )  \u201cWe can sell every single vehicle we can produce here,\u201d Ford global operations president Joe Hinrichs said ahead of the announcement during a tour of the company\u2019s Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky where the new generation of Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs went into production last fall. \u201cThese are high-margin vehicles, so that is very meaningful.\u201d  The Expedition and Navigator are two of the highest-priced vehicles Ford sells, and the production increase at the Kentucky Truck factory comes as investors are growing restless as Ford\u2019s automotive profit margins have shrunk to 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 5.7 percent a year earlier. The company\u2019s margins have fallen behind rivals General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.  Even before recent market volatility, Ford\u2019s shares were slumping. Year to date they are down 14.7 percent while shares in No. 1 U.S. automaker GM, which is seen by analysts as having a clearer vision and better operational focus, are up 1.2 percent.  The average price for a Navigator in January 2018 versus January 2017 jumped 38 percent, or $21,300, to $77,400 while the price for an Expedition rose nearly $8,000 to $57,700. Both are well higher than the industry average vehicle selling price of $33,100, according to data cited by Ford.  GM is outperforming Ford financially in part because it dominates the U.S. large SUV segment with models such as the GMC Yukon and Chevrolet Suburban. Ford sold a little shy of 3,500 Expeditions and 1,300 Navigators in January. GM sold more than 19,000 of its large SUVs during the month.  \u201cThere is a big dog in the segment,\u201d Hinrichs said. \u201cWe aim to get out there and challenge them with vehicles with better fuel efficiency and driving dynamics.\u201d  Ford said it will add $25 million in investments at the plant to support the production target hike, bringing its total investment there to $925 million. Upgrades at the plant, which also produces the company\u2019s popular Super Duty pickup truck, have included 400 robots, a centralized data analytics center and a 3D printer to save time and a lot of money on parts and tools.  Ford is playing catchup to GM in the large SUV market in part because of past decisions to focus investment on smaller vehicles at a time when high oil prices and stiffening federal fuel economy rules threatened big trucks like the Navigator. This is the first complete makeover for the Expedition and Navigator since the late 1990s.  Stable, relatively low oil prices have since encouraged Americans to shun passenger cars in favor of higher-margin SUVs and pickup trucks. In 2017, passenger car sales in the United States fell to 36.8 percent of total light vehicle sales.  To improve mileage, the new Expedition and Navigator models have aluminum bodies, as do the Ford F-series pickup models with which they share many components.  That change required \u201cthe greatest technological transformation\u201d at the Louisville plant - one of two Ford has in the city - since the 1980s, said electrician Chuck Billingsley, a 33-year veteran worker at the automaker.  However, Ford has warned investors that its overall vehicle profit margins are threatened this year by rising prices for commodities such as steel and aluminum prices, even as most other automakers say those increases are manageable.  Ford says steel is its biggest problem, but analysts say its decision to switch to aluminum bodies for pickup trucks to reduce weight and boost fuel economy has cost it as aluminum prices spiked.","586":"DETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is open to working with other automakers on the development of electric vehicles, Chief Executive Mary Barra said on Thursday.

Two people briefed on the cuts said GM is cutting hundreds of jobs at its information technology centers in Texas, Georgia, Arizona and Michigan and more than 1,000 jobs at its Warren, Michigan Tech Center. GM is filing new required mass layoff notices with state agencies and disclosed the cuts to lawmakers.  The largest U.S. automaker announced in November it would cut a total of about 15,000 jobs and end production at five North American plants. The cuts include eliminating about 8,000 salaried workers, or about 15 percent.  GM cut about 1,500 contract workers in December and said 2,300 salaried workers accepted buyouts, officials said.  \u201cThese actions are necessary to secure the future of the company, including preserving thousands of jobs in the U.S. and globally. We are taking action now while the overall economy and job market are strong, increasing the ability of impacted employees to continue to advance in their careers, should they choose to do so,\u201d GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said, adding the bulk of the cuts should be completed in the next two weeks.  Morrissey said GM would provide salaried workers with severance packages and job placement services.  GM is also cutting its executive ranks by 25 percent and last week laid off three senior people in its Washington office and some other small salaried layoffs previously took place.  President Donald Trump and U.S. and Canadian lawmakers have blasted GM\u2019s plans to end production at plants in Ontario, Michigan, Ohio and Maryland. GM said in November it would end U.S. and Canadian production of the Chevrolet Cruze, Volt, Impala, the Buick LaCrosse and the Cadillac XTS and CT6 sedans.  Trump, who made a 2017 speech near GM\u2019s Lordstown Assembly plant in Ohio, said in November the company had \u201cbetter\u201d find a new product for that plant.  But GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra wrote last week: \u201cWe are more convinced than ever that our strategy is sound and in the long term.\u201d  Last month, Comprehensive Logistics said it would cease operations at its facility in Lordstown that provides logistics and warehousing, impacting about 180 jobs. Magna International Inc is also laying off about 120 people at its Lordstown Seating Systems plant that makes seats for GM vehicles.","594":"FILE PHOTO - The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Lansing, Michigan October 26, 2015.

The disengagement data is widely used as a yardstick to compare companies testing self-driving vehicles on California roads, and is often cited as evidence that Waymo leads the sector.  Both companies last week criticized the disengagement data.

Cruise said the data is more useful for showing an individual company\u2019s performance. It said its miles between disengagements in the second half jumped to 20,110, compared with 7,635 in the first half.  Cruise, which tests its self-driving vehicles mainly on the streets of San Francisco, noted that it is \u201cintensely focused on rate of improvement.\u201d  \u201cFocusing our testing in a dense urban environment has allowed us to improve at a much faster rate than in a simpler suburban setting,\u201d said Cruise spokesman Ray Wert.

Workers from U.S. auto parts maker Aptiv Plc arrive at the plant during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico May 18, 2020. REUTERS\/Jose Luis Gonzalez  With Mexico\u2019s coronavirus death toll having surged past 5,300, and with 51,633 known cases, officials are wrestling with how to restart key industries without triggering a greater spread of the highly contagious respiratory virus.  The moves to loosen restrictions follow growing pressure from the United States to reopen factories that are vital to supply chains of U.S.-based businesses, especially in the vast automotive sector.  Mexico\u2019s reopening plans have drawn criticism from some politicians worried that the still-rising pandemic tide in Latin America makes it unsafe to send more people to work.  Mexico\u2019s guidelines, published overnight, require companies to submit to authorities health protocols for exiting the coronavirus lockdown. Firms will then be told within 72 hours if they can resume operations.  General Motors Co, which operates one of its most important plants in the city of Silao in central Mexico, told workers there to prepare to return to work on Wednesday. GM also told Mexican suppliers the company expected to comply quickly with the new regulations.  Activists composed of former GM workers called on Monday for an independent committee elected by workers to inspect the company\u2019s plants for proper sanitary measures.  Slideshow ( 9 images )  \u201cWe think they are measures that they are not really going to take seriously,\u201d said Israel Cervantes, who says he was unjustly fired from the company last year after trying to create an independent union.  In a video sent to Silao employees, GM said workers would be spaced apart, screened for COVID-19 symptoms on entering each day and be given masks and glasses to be worn at all times.  In response to queries from Reuters, GM said its protocols were in line with or tougher than guidelines from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that Mexican authorities would be responsible for monitoring companies.  In the United States, the auto industry slowly returned to life on Monday, with some vehicle assembly plants reopening after the coronavirus lockdown, while suppliers geared up to support a sector that accounts for about 6% of U.S. economic activity.  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said companies would have to answer an extensive questionnaire as part of efforts to protect workers.  \u201cToday they can start doing the paperwork so that companies in the construction, transport and mining industries can start their activities, beginning with their health protocols,\u201d Lopez Obrador told his daily news conference.  The government said the guidelines would lead to a gradual reopening that follows a so-called traffic light system put in place by authorities.  \u2018MUNICIPALITIES OF HOPE\u2019  Some 300 municipalities with no coronavirus cases and bordering others with no cases - called \u201cmunicipalities of hope\u201d - were also due to start lifting the lockdown on Monday, although Mexican media reported some states did not allow the relaxation.  Last Tuesday, Mexico reported a record number of deaths in a single day, with 353 fatalities. That grim news was followed on Friday by a reported 2,437 new coronavirus infections, a one-day record rise in cases since the start of the pandemic.  A poll by newspaper Reforma showed on Monday that 67% of Mexicans believed the worst of the pandemic was still to come, while only 20% thought the worst was over. The poll surveyed 400 adults from last Tuesday to Thursday.","604":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  DETROIT (Reuters) - The union representing the 48,000 workers who have been striking General Motors Co for about a month have scheduled a meeting on Thursday to update the leaders of the various union locals from around the country on the status of the talks, several people familiar with the plans said on Monday.  The sides have not reached a tentative agreement that would end the strike, but progress has been made and the United Auto Workers leadership will give an update at 10:30 a.m. ET on Thursday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks continue. The meeting will take place in the Detroit building where GM is based, the people said.  \u201cIt\u2019s time to have a conversation one way or the other,\u201d one person said.  UAW and GM representatives said talks are scheduled again for Tuesday but declined further comment.  The UAW strike began on Sept. 16, with the union\u2019s members at GM seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits.  After GM angered the UAW negotiators last week by appealing directly to workers and revealing details of the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s latest offer, the sides have continued talking. The UAW made a counter offer to GM on Friday.  Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note on Monday that investors with whom he has spoken are \u201ccomfortable\u201d with an extended strike and potential upfront multibillion-dollar impact as long as GM preserves its long-term financial and strategic flexibility.  While a prolonged strike could trigger a credit rating agency downgrade on the company\u2019s debt, Jonas said most investors he has spoken with would accept that if the company retained an investment-grade rating.","605":"DETROIT\/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) went on strike at General Motors just after midnight Sunday and about 48,000 hourly workers at its facilities are headed for the picket lines in the morning, union officials said early Monday.  U.S. labor contract talks reached an impasse on Sunday, and the UAW called for the first nationwide strike at GM in 12 years.  \u201cWe do not take this lightly,\u201d Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the union\u2019s relationship with GM, said at a news conference in downtown Detroit on Sunday.  \u201cThis is our last resort.\u201d  GM said in a statement that its offer to the UAW during talks included more than $7 billion in new investments, 5,400 jobs - a majority of which would be new - pay increases, improved benefits and a contract-ratification bonus of $8,000.  \u201cWe have negotiated in good faith and with a sense of urgency,\u201d the automaker said.  Late on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump on Twitter urged the UAW and GM to \u201cget together and make a deal!\u201d. GM spokesman Tony Cervone said the automaker \u201ccouldn\u2019t agree more\u201d with Trump\u2019s call.  A strike will very quickly shut down GM\u2019s operations across North America and could hurt the broader U.S. economy. Prolonged industrial action would also cause hardship for GM hourly workers on greatly reduced strike pay.  GM\u2019s workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks. A more painful strike occurred in Flint, Michigan, in 1998, lasting 54 days and costing the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion.  No further talks were scheduled before the strike is set to begin, a union spokesman and GM said.  Talks are set to resume on Monday at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT).  The union has been fighting to stop GM from closing auto assembly plants in Ohio and Michigan, and arguing workers deserve higher pay after years of record profits for GM in North America.  GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are expensive compared with competing non-union auto plants in southern U.S. states. In its statement, the automaker said its offer to the union included solutions for the Michigan and Ohio assembly plants currently lacking products.  A person familiar with GM\u2019s offer said that could include producing a future electric vehicle in Detroit.  It could also include turning a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, into an electric vehicle battery plant or going through with the proposed sale of the plant to a group affiliated with electric vehicle start-up Workhorse Group Inc.  A new battery plant could give some UAW workers at Lordstown the chance to remain with GM.  The closure of Lordstown drew widespread criticism, including from Trump, who met with GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Sept. 5. Ohio is crucial to Trump\u2019s re-election bid in 2020.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  But several Democratic presidential candidates said they backed the UAW, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden and Representative Tim Ryan.  Sanders noted GM received a U.S.-taxpayer funded $50 billion bailout a decade ago. \u201cOur message to General Motors is a simple one: End the greed, sit down with the UAW and work out an agreement that treats your workers with the respect and the dignity they deserve,\u201d Sanders said in a statement.  Biden said on Twitter he backed the UAW\u2019s demand for \u201cfair wages and benefits for their members. America\u2019s workers deserve better.\u201d  The union has framed the plant closures as a betrayal of workers who made concessions in 2009 to help GM through its government-led bankruptcy.  Slideshow ( 8 images )  \u201cGeneral Motors needs to understand that we stood up for GM when they needed us,\u201d Ted Krumm, head of the union\u2019s bargaining committee in talks with GM, said at the Sunday news conference. These are profitable times ... and we deserve a fair contract.\u201d  The UAW says significant differences remain between both sides over wages, health care benefits, temporary employees, job security and profit sharing.  The strike will test both the union and GM at a time when the U.S. auto industry is facing slowing sales and rising costs for launching electric vehicles and curbing emissions.  Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research (CAR), said the strike at GM\u2019s U.S. facilities will also shut its plants in Canada and Mexico as the automaker\u2019s supply chain is so integrated.  \u201cThat\u2019s going to have a big effect on the economy,\u201d she said.  GM starts off the strike with healthy levels of inventory of some its key, high-margin vehicles.  As of Sept. 1, the automaker had 96 days supply of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, 59 days supply of its Chevrolet Equinox SUV and more than 100 days supply of the Cadillac Escalade.  If the strike is short, hourly workers should not suffer much. But strike pay provided by the UAW, which has been building up reserves in preparation for possible industrial action, is just $250 per week.  The automaker has 12 vehicle assembly plants, 12 engine and power train facilities and a handful of other U.S. stamping plants and other facilities.  On Friday, the UAW announced temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) while it focused its attention on GM.  The union had targeted GM as the first automaker with which it wanted to conclude contract talks.  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which transports some GM vehicles to dealerships, said it would honor the UAW\u2019s GM picket lines.","606":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N is seeking an exemption to a 25 percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility, the automaker said on Thursday, in a move to prevent the key model in the brand's U.S. lineup from becoming a victim of the U.S.-China trade war.  FILE PHOTO: General Motors Co. displays its U.S. version of the Buick Envision crossover, the first China-built car imported to the U.S. by a Detroit automaker, during a media event before the start of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, January 10, 2016. REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook\/File Photo  The midsize SUV, priced starting at about $35,000, has become a target for critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio. The Envision, assembled only in China, last year accounted for about 19 percent of Buick brand sales in the United States.  GM said in a statement that it filed the request on July 30 with the U.S. Trade Representative. An official notice was posted on Thursday on the regulations.gov website, which is tracking requests for exclusions from the so-called Section 301 tariff on certain imported goods from China.  GM, the largest U.S. automaker, argued in its request that Envision sales in China and the United States would generate funds \u201cto invest in our U.S. manufacturing facilities and to develop the next generation of automotive technology in the United States.\u201d  GM said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Envisions, about 200,000 a year, are sold in China. About 41,000 were sold last year in the United States.  Because of the lower U.S. sales volume, \u201cassembly in our home market is not an option\u201d for the Envision, which competes with such mid-size crossover vehicles as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Cadillac XT5.  GM President Dan Ammann defended the vehicle, saying it benefits the U.S. market.  \u201cThe profitability we generate on that vehicle, selling it in the U.S. market, we obviously reinvest it here,\u201d he said on Friday on the sidelines of a conference in Detroit.  However, the UAW said it was opposed to the exemption.  \u201cIt will continue to be the position of the UAW that products sold in the U.S.A. be made in the U.S.A.,\u201d Terry Dittes, the union\u2019s vice president and head of its GM department, said in a statement. \u201cThey can simply build these 41,000 Buicks right here in the U.S.A. and create American jobs!\u201d  GM has taken other steps to soften the blow of tariffs, which hit just as the automaker had lowered the price of the Envision to make it more competitive.  Ahead of the July 6 start for higher import tariffs, GM shipped in a six-month supply of Envisions at the much lower 2.5 percent tariff rate.  Envision sales from April through June plunged to just 7,000 vehicles, while inventories climbed to more than 13,000 vehicles at the end of June. At the current sales rate, the Envision supply should be enough to keep many dealers stocked through the end of the year.  GM had lowered prices by as much as $2,500 on the 2019 models, which it started shipping in late April. That means Buick\u2019s 2,000 U.S. dealers should have lower-priced Envisions to sell well into the fall.  \u201cThe previous price point was too high\u201d on the 2018 Envision, said Casey Clark, sales manager at Serra Buick GMC Cadillac in Washington, Michigan, in an interview. \u201cThat put off some customers.\u201d  With help from GM, Casey said, the mid-Michigan dealership has been able to offer hefty discounts on Envision of $5,000 and more.  GM has announced no plans to stop U.S. sales of the Envision or to relocate production of U.S.-bound models to another plant outside China, a source familiar with the company\u2019s strategy said on condition of anonymity.  GM has provided Buick dealers with incentives to keep Envisions in stock. These include financial offers to put Envisions into fleets of vehicles loaned to customers whose cars are being repaired, the source said.  This year, GM plans to cut Envision imports to around 35,000 vehicles, more than half of which will be hit with the higher tariff, the source said.","607":"May 22 (Reuters) - General Motors Co is delaying the resumption of second shifts at truck assembly plants in Michigan, Indiana and Mexico because of a lack of parts from Mexico, a person briefed on the matter said.

The action came after Unifor, the union representing the autoworkers, failed to win GM\u2019s support for its proposals to save the plant. Unifor, which has vowed to block GM\u2019s plan to close Oshawa by the end of 2019, met with GM officials in Detroit on Tuesday.  While different parts of production were shut down Wednesday morning, the entire line was halted intermittently, said Unifor spokeswoman Kathleen O\u2019Keefe.  The union was not able to quantify the impact on production, noting the line typically assembles 300 Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS cars per shift.  On Tuesday night, truck assembly stopped completely for nearly five hours, Unifor said. The shift, which typically assembles 225 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks, only completed 55 vehicles, the union added.  It was also unclear if any work stoppages would coincide with a Unifor rally in Windsor, Ontario on Friday.  \u201cThe majority of people are prepared to battle GM and try to get them to change their decision,\u201d said Tony Leah, a welder at Oshawa for over 38 years. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t classify that as hopeful. I would classify that as angry and determined.\u201d  Oshawa\u2019s closure, which GM said would affect 2,973 assembly-line jobs, was announced in November as part of a broad restructuring aimed at cutting costs as investments increase in electric and autonomous vehicles.  GM has also not allocated new products for four U.S. plants, raising the possibility of closure and the elimination of a total of about 15,000 jobs in North America.  \u201cWe understand our union\u2019s frustration, but need to now work together to deliver supports, transition and training for our employees,\u201d said GM spokesman David Paterson.  In 2020, the closure is forecast to reduce Ontario\u2019s GDP by C$5 billion ($3.78 billion) and cost 4,000 jobs, according to a study by QED Inc consultancy, commissioned by Unifor and released on Wednesday. By 2025, 14,000 jobs are projected to be lost in Ontario and another 10,000 across Canada.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  \u201cGeneral Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?\u201d Trump said in a post on Twitter.  Trump appeared to be referring to a Bloomberg News story that reported GM's hourly workforce of 46,000 U.S. workers has fallen behind that of Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI as the smallest of the Detroit Three automakers. Over the past four decades, GM has dramatically cut the size of its overall U.S. workforce, which numbered nearly 620,000 in 1979.  GM did not directly comment on Trump\u2019s tweet.  \u201cGM\u2019s China operations are not a threat to U.S. jobs,\u201d the company said in a fact sheet, noting that its joint ventures have sent $16 billion in equity income to GM since 2010 and that it has invested $23 billion in U.S. operations since 2009.  GM\u2019s U.S. hourly workforce has fallen by about 4,000 jobs since the end of 2018 to about where it was a decade ago.  Trump\u2019s ire with GM comes as contract talks with the United Auto Workers union with the Detroit Three automakers intensify ahead of a Sept. 14 deadline. Trump has previously attacked GM for building vehicles in Mexico and for ending production at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland and threatened to cut GM subsidies in retaliation.  GM\u2019s decision to close four plants in the United States is a central issue in the contract talks.  Trump has made boosting auto jobs a key priority and has often attacked automakers on Twitter for not doing enough to boost U.S. employment. His 2020 re-election bid will hinge on holding key industrial battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan that narrowly voted for him in 2016.  China is the world\u2019s largest auto market, and government policy favors automakers assembling vehicles there, and not importing them from overseas.  In response to Trump\u2019s latest tariffs, China said last week it will reinstitute 25% tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles. The U.S. is imposing 15% tariffs on more than $125 billion in Chinese goods starting Sunday.  GM sold 3.6 million vehicles in China last year accounting for 43% of its worldwide sales. GM booked $2 billion in equity income from its China operations last year.  GM imports a small number of vehicles from China. In June, the Trump administration rejected a request from GM to exempt its Chinese-made Buick Envision from a 25% U.S. tariff on sport utility vehicle models.  The midsize SUV has become a target for U.S. critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the UAW members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.","618":"SEOUL, Feb 14 (Reuters) - General Motors\u2019 South Korean unit is offering workers three times their annual base salary, money for college tuition and more than $9,000 towards a new car as part of a voluntary redundancy plan at the troubled automaker.

China\u2019s automobile sales have been falling more broadly in recent months, with a slowing economy and trade frictions making consumers cautious about spending, an industry body said last month.  GM has been shifting its Buick cars to a new type of more efficient three-cylinder engine to meet emissions targets, which Chinese dealers told Reuters had hit sales because consumers were not yet convinced by the smaller engines.  \u201cMany consumers still have concerns because they read negative comments about three-cylinder technology online, which aren\u2019t really fair,\u201d said a sales manager surnamed Hu at a Buick dealer in Zhejiang province.

GM\u2019s accusations came as Fiat Chrysler and French automaker Peugeot SA were in the early stages of preparing for a merger. Fiat Chrysler has said the suit was aimed at disrupting that deal. GM has said the suit has nothing to do with the merger.  In a statement, GM rejected Borman\u2019s characterization of the suit as a \u201cdistraction\u201d and defended its decision to press the case.  \u201cWe filed a lawsuit against FCA for the same reason the U.S. Department of Justice continues to investigate the company: former FCA executives admitted they conspired to use bribes to gain labor benefits, concessions and advantages.

FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is pictured at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Ramos Arizpe, state of Coahuila, Mexico October 7, 2019. REUTERS\/Daniel Becerril  The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said on Tuesday that the automaker did not agree to contractually assume liability for punitive damages as part of its federally-backed Chapter 11 reorganization.  GM filed for bankruptcy in June 2009, and its best assets were transferred to a new Detroit-based company with the same name. The other assets and many liabilities stayed with \u201cOld GM,\u201d which is also known as Motors Liquidation Co.  Tuesday\u2019s 3-0 decision may help GM reduce its ultimate exposure in nationwide litigation over defective ignition switches in several Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn models.  It is also a defeat for drivers involved in post-bankruptcy accidents, including those who collided with older GM vehicles driven by others, as well as their law firms.  The ignition switch defect could cause engine stalls and keep airbags from deploying, and has been linked to 124 deaths.  A lawyer for the drivers and their law firms did not immediately respond to requests for comment. GM had no comment.  Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said GM\u2019s agreement to acquire assets \u201cfree and clear\u201d of most liabilities excused it from punitive damages claims for Old GM\u2019s conduct.  He also noted that the judge who oversaw the bankruptcy concluded that the new company could not be liable for claims that the \u201cdeeply insolvent\u201d Old GM would never have paid.  The decision upheld a May 2018 ruling by U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan, who oversees the ignition switch litigation.  Drivers have sought a variety of damages in that litigation, including for declining resale values.  GM has recalled more than 2.6 million vehicles since 2014 over ignition switch problems.  It has also paid more than $2.6 billion in related penalties and settlements, including $900 million to settle a U.S. Department of Justice criminal case.

GM has said it will close Oshawa by the end of this year, but Unifor wants GM to continue production until September 2020, when the current contract expires, hoping that provides enough time to secure the plant\u2019s future.  The closure, which GM said will affect 2,973 assembly-line jobs in Oshawa, is part of a broad restructuring aimed at cutting the automaker\u2019s costs as investments increase in electric and self-driving vehicles.  Some 650,000 GM vehicles produced annually in Mexico are sold in Canada and the United States, representing approximately $20 billion in sales, Unifor President Jerry Dias said in an interview.  Dias stopped short of calling for a total boycott of GM vehicles because Unifor also represents GM workers in Ontario who assemble the Chevrolet Equinox and work at a propulsion plant.  If the boycott does not result in negotiations with GM, Unifor would consider a strike, Dias said, adding that job action is not currently planned.  \u201cThe only way to get General Motors\u2019 attention is if we fight back,\u201d Dias said at a press conference, adding that any vehicle with a vehicle identification number, or VIN, that starts with a 3 is Mexican made.

GM will also no longer report monthly sales in China, its largest market, and Brazil. GM will provide monthly data to the U.S. Federal Reserve, industry associations and government agencies across the globe but that data is not made public.  Analysts and investors rely on monthly U.S. vehicle sales not just to track the performance of individual automakers, but as a barometer of the health of the world\u2019s second-largest auto market and as an indicator of consumer confidence in the U.S. economy overall.  GM and its Detroit rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have relied heavily on sales of high-margin pickup truck and SUV sales to boost profits.  GM\u2019s total U.S. sales, its second-largest market, are down 3.2 percent for the first two months of 2018, reflecting a 6.8 percent drop in retail sales to individual customers, the company reported last month.  GM executives have expressed frustration that comparisons of monthly U.S. sales results among rival automakers are distorted by short-term discount programs, and by differences in strategy for selling vehicles in bulk to rental car fleets.  \u201cThirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market,\u201d Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president for sales operations said in a statement.

Until the early 1990s, most U.S. automakers released sales results every 10 days. The former Chrysler Corp, a forerunner of today\u2019s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, stopped reporting sales on a 10-day basis in 1990, and rivals followed suit over the next three years.  GM executives are betting that investors will quickly adapt to receiving U.S. sales data every three months, as investors in other retail sectors already have.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  After reporting a fourth-quarter profit of $2.8 billion and a 2021 profit outlook some saw as conservative, GM shares were down 4.5% in early trading.

GM officials have repeatedly stressed they will protect production of its highest profit vehicles.  U.S. rival Ford Motor Co previously said it lost some production of its high-profit, top-selling F-150 pickup truck.  On Tuesday, GM extended production cuts at three North American plants and said it would partially build and later finish assembling vehicles at two other factories due to the chip shortage.  GM expects the shortage to trim $1.5 billion to $2 billion from its 2021 operating profit, or up to about 90 cents a share.  Including that hit, it forecast a profit this year of $4.50 to $5.25 a share. Analysts had expected $5.89 according to Refinitiv data, but that did not account for the chip hit.  \u201cWhile some may focus on a guidance, which is optically soft versus consensus due to semi shortage impact, we ultimately believe investors should look through it,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said in a research note.  The global chip shortage also will have a short-term impact on production and cash flow, GM said.  Asked whether GM would invest in a chipmaker to secure supplies, Barra said the automaker is always looking at what to integrate into its operations. She added, however, that taking a stake in a semiconductor company was a longer-term solution the company would evaluate.  GM said it expects to accelerate spending on electric and autonomous vehicles in 2021. Projected capital expenditures this year are $9 billion to $10 billion, including more than $7 billion for EVs and AVs.  Investors and Wall Street have increasingly focused on GM\u2019s strategy to roll out electric vehicles rather than quarterly results, and the stock has responded to the company\u2019s announcements around increased and accelerated EV spending.

In the city of Gunsan, where the factory with 2,000 workers is, shuttered store fronts and empty streets near the plant are a stark reminder of the depressing impact on the rural town.  The factory had already been running at about 20 percent of capacity over the past three years even before the U.S. carmaker announced the closure.  \u201cGunsan city worked really hard to rescue GM, buying GM cars produced from the factory. The whole town is now in panic,\u201d Park Chung-hi, chairwoman of the Gunsan city council, told Reuters.

GM\u2019s South Korean unit launched a voluntary redundancy scheme for its 16,000 workers in the Asian nation after announcing on Tuesday it will shutter the plant in Gunsan by May and decide within weeks on the fate of the remaining three plants in the country.  Unionised workers at the Gunsan plant wore red headbands saying \u201cSolidarity, Fight\u201d and held leaflets demanding the withdrawal of the closure plan. Some had shaved their heads.

GM\u2019s planned revamp of its loss-making South Korea operations is the latest in a series of steps by the automaker to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015 GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia.  It is offering South Korean workers three times their annual base salary, money for college tuition and more than $9,000 toward a new car as part of a redundancy package.  A spokesman of GM Korea, the local unit, said the company would continue discussions with the union and seek their understanding over the closure plan.  But workers were far from placated. The union will establish a detailed plan in protest against the shutdown that may include a strike and holding of a sit-in rally at the headquarters of GM Korea, according to the union\u2019s Gunsan branch.  \u201cWe can\u2019t accept this. The company informed us about the closure plan, not asking for our opinion. It was already the end of the discussions,\u201d Dang Sung-geun, a senior official at the union of GM Korea, told Reuters by telephone.  \u201cThis is like a death sentence notice before the Lunar New Year holidays.\u201d  Dang said about 1,200 unionized workers from GM Korea joined the protest at the Gunsan factory, a day before the Asian country begins Lunar New Year holidays. Gunsan is located in the southwest of the country.  U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday used GM\u2019s decision to close the plant to launch fresh criticism of the U.S.-South Korea trade agreement.  Trump recently approved tariffs on South Korean washing machines, while South Korea has vowed to take countermeasures through the World Trade Organization (WTO).  South Korea\u2019s trade ministry said it will take a dispute against the United States to the WTO, involving the imposition of high anti-dumping duties on South Korean steel and transformers.  WAGES, PRODUCTIVITY IN FOCUS  GM executives have complained about South Korea\u2019s relatively high wages and its strike-prone labor union. But Dang of GM Korea\u2019s union blamed the company for reducing output, saying lower wages were not acceptable.  The automaker\u2019s restructuring plan places South Korean President Moon Jae-in in an uncomfortable spot, as he has pledged more new jobs and job security.  South Korea\u2019s strong labor unions have weighed on the country\u2019s automobile industry, which Moon\u2019s administration views as a challenge, a trade ministry official said.  \u201cThe South Korean auto industry\u2019s high cost and low productivity has been a deep-rooted issue, which can\u2019t be fixed overnight, but we will try to resolve this issue by building trust with the unions and the companies,\u201d said the official who asked not to identified.

It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles or setting state emissions rules.  The administration of former President Barack Obama had adopted rules, effective in 2021, calling for an annual increase of 4.4 percent in fuel-efficiency requirements from 2022 through 2025.  GM has been lobbying Congress to lift the existing cap on electric vehicles eligible for a $7,500 tax credit. The credit phases out over a 12-month period after an individual automaker hits 200,000 electric vehicles sold.  GM said the current tax credit puts \"companies like GM and Tesla TSLA.O at severe pricing disadvantage in the market for several years.\" On Friday, GM called for a nationwide zero-emission vehicle program, while 20 U.S. states called for the administration to abandon its proposal to weaken the Obama rules.

The Detroit automaker has slashed costs and made other moves during the COVID-19 outbreak, including suspending its dividend and share buybacks, closing its Maven car-sharing unit, delaying work on some product programs, reducing marketing budgets and cutting white-collar workers\u2019 salaries. It also added $16 billion to its cash position by drawing down credit lines.  GM also has suspended its 2020 profit outlook given the uncertainty.  Smaller U.S. rival Ford Motor Co last month raised another $8 billion from corporate debt investors to further shore up its finances after previously drawing down its credit lines.  GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara warned employees in an internal video on March 26 that \u201csignificant austerity measures\u201d were necessary to avoid \u201cserious damage\u201d to GM\u2019s long-term viability.  One ray of hope has been China, where the pandemic began but where GM has resumed production. While first-quarter sales there fell 43%, they rebounded to grow by double digits in April. That offers hope for the U.S. market, where sales declined 7% in the first quarter.  U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states reopening their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can safely restart.  GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) are aiming to resume production some time in May and are negotiating with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents their U.S. hourly workers, about when and how to safely restart.  The Detroit automakers are anxious to end the cash burn that has occurred during the shutdown. While FCA said Tuesday it expects most of its North American plants to reopen by May 18, GM and Ford have not announced restart dates.  The UAW said last month that it was \u201ctoo soon and too risky\u201d to reopen plants in early May. President Rory Gamble said last week the union was asking for \u201cas much testing as possible\u201d to protect its workers.  In its restart playbook, GM\u2019s strategy relies heavily on social distancing, temperature checks, regular sanitizing, improved plant ventilation and use of personal protective equipment, but does not address assembly line workstations.  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer previously extended the state\u2019s stay-at-home order through May 15 but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday.  Once production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand rebounds, with some dealers expecting big discounts to lure consumers back to showroom floors.  Some industry officials have said some level of government stimulus for the U.S. auto sector will be needed for consumers once the pandemic recedes.  During the Great Recession of 2008-09, the U.S. government rolled out a \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers.  Other U.S. automakers already outlined the pain caused by the crisis.  FCA on Tuesday reported a first-quarter loss of $1.8 billion, said it expected a significant loss in the second quarter and scrapped its full-year profit outlook.  Last week, Ford said its second-quarter loss would more than double to over $5 billion from $2 billion in the first quarter. Executives said the current economic environment was too unpredictable to offer a full-year profit outlook.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The No. 1 U.S. automaker disclosed a long-term compensation plan that incentivizes Dan Ammann, chief executive of the Cruise unit, to develop the technology and commercial plans that could lead to the stock offering within 10 years, according GM\u2019s annual 10K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Ammann, who stepped down as GM\u2019s president and assumed the Cruise position at the start of the year, was awarded 16,914 restricted stock units for common shares of Cruise and stock options for 101,485 common shares of Cruise by the unit\u2019s board on Monday.  The incentives are based on meeting certain targets, including \u201ca change of control or initial public offering\u201d that occurs prior to the 10-year anniversary of the stock grant, according to the SEC filing.  Ammann stands to make at least about $25 million based on the stock units, which have a value of $1,515 a share, according to the filing. However, his compensation could be much more lucrative if an eventual IPO drives the value of the stock options far above their strike price of $1,515 a share.  \u201cMr. Ammann\u2019s compensation plan is consistent with CEO benchmarks from tech companies with similar market cap to Cruise and is heavily weighted toward the attainment of specific technology and commercial targets,\u201d GM spokesman Tom Henderson said in a telephone interview.  Analysts have speculated that GM eventually will sell shares in Cruise or spin it off. Cruise, with more than 1,100 employees, is aiming to launch a robo-taxi service by the end of 2019.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday after the company reported stronger-than-expected earnings that the Detroit automaker was making \u201crapid progress\u201d with the technology, and the company\u2019s self-driving vehicle plans were \u201cnot squishy at all.\u201d  \u201cI think it\u2019s in a strong position from funding,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s in a strong position as we continue to do the development.\u201d  Cruise has a value of about $14.6 billion despite no significant revenue and a product not ready for commercial launch.

Ammann joined GM in 2010 from Morgan Stanley, where he was an adviser to GM\u2019s government-led bankruptcy restructuring in 2009. He became GM\u2019s president in 2014.","658":"FORT WAYNE, Ind. (Reuters) - When General Motors Co GM.N engineers were developing the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, some of them joined public tours of Ford Motor Co's F.N Dearborn, Michigan factory to watch aluminum-bodied F-series trucks go down the assembly line.  The redesign of the Ford F-series trucks, launched in 2014, set a new standard for fuel economy and lightweight vehicle construction. But armed with stopwatches and trained eyes, the GM engineers believed they saw problems.  \u201cThey had a real hard time getting those doors to fit,\u201d Tim Herrick, the executive chief engineer for GM truck programs told Reuters.  His team did more intelligence gathering. They bought and tore apart Ford F-series doors sold as repair parts. Their conclusion: GM could cut weight in its trucks for a lower cost using doors made of a combination of aluminum and high strength steel that could be thinner than standard steel, shaving off kilograms in the process.  These pounds and penny-based decisions will have major implications in the highest stakes game going in Detroit: dominance in the world\u2019s most profitable vehicle market, the petrol-fueled large pickup segment. What\u2019s more, GM is banking on strong sales of overhauled 2019 Silverados and GMC Sierras to fund its push into automated, electric vehicles \u2013 a business many investors see as the auto industry\u2019s long term future.  The risks are high given the hits automakers have taken from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies.  Rising aluminum prices spurred by Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up costs on the Ford\u2019s F-series, while rising steel and aluminum prices drag on GM results. GM also has a significant risk should the United States, Mexico and Canada fail to agree on a new NAFTA trade deal, given GM trucks built at its Silao, Mexico factory could face a 25 percent tariff if NAFTA collapses.  Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2IgOECU  Interviews with GM executives and a tour at its factory here in northwest Indiana provide a detailed look inside GM\u2019s plan for the most important vehicles in its global lineup.  These big pickups are everything Tesla Inc's TSLA.O Model 3 or a Chevy Bolt electric car is not.  The mostly steel body is bolted to the truck\u2019s steel frame, rather than the one-piece body and frame electric vehicles. The majority of trucks will have a V-8 gasoline engine in front powering the rear wheels \u2013 like the classic GM cars of the 1950s. Some Silverados will have new four-cylinder engines, but there is no electric or hybrid offering as of now. The new Silverado - GM\u2019s top-selling vehicle in the United States - is a technology achievement of a different kind.  It is taller and has a longer wheelbase than its beefy predecessor, which can help it more easily meet federal fuel efficiency rules. But it is 450 pounds lighter, and its V-8 engine achieves 23 mile per gallon on the highway that rivals smaller SUVs.  Wall Street investors give Tesla and its electric vehicles a higher value than GM\u2019s shares. GM is betting that its core customers in the American heartland will keep paying premium prices - 27 percent of GM trucks sell for more than $55,000 - for these vehicles capable of hauling a trailer by day and substituting for a luxury sedan by night.  Slideshow ( 18 images )  Large pickups generate at least $17,000 a vehicle in pre-tax profit for GM, the company has indicated in disclosures to investors. GM executives told Reuters that with the new trucks, GM will have a big cost advantage they can use to chop at Ford\u2019s leading market share.  \u201cWe think we have thousands of dollars advantage (over Ford) just in the aluminum costs. It\u2019s big,\u201d said Herrick during a walk through the Fort Wayne plant, which began shipping the new Silverados and Sierras late last month.  He said GM plans to use its Silverado cost advantage to put more safety or entertainment technology in the trucks, fund programs such as a promised fleet of electric cars and return money to shareholders.  At Ford, truck marketing manager Todd Eckert said the company plans to stick to its game plan. For 41 years, the F-series trucks have been the best-selling single model line in the United States. For the first half of this year, the F-series line \u2013 which ranges from the light-duty F-150 to medium duty commercial trucks \u2013 has a 59,000 vehicle lead over the combined Chevrolet and GMC large pickups.  \u201cThere\u2019s always been competition in this segment and there always will be,\u201d Eckert said.  Ford\u2019s purchasing director Hau Thai-Tang at an investor conference on Wednesday called the F-series pickup \u201cone of our profit pillars,\u201d and said Ford plans to increase the share of its 2018-2022 product development budget allocated to trucks and commercial vehicles to 29 percent from 24 percent in its prior 2015-2019 plan.  Ford said it cuts costs by recycling about 20 millions pounds of aluminum scrap every month in its operations, enough to build about 37,000 F-series bodies.  A LIGHT METAL DUEL  For decades, Ford and GM matched each other\u2019s moves closely and built trucks that were similar in design, technology and capability.  With the launch of GM\u2019s new trucks, the rivals\u2019 technology strategies have diverged.  Ford in 2014 launched a new generation of F-series trucks with all-aluminum body structures for its big pickup trucks, and challenged rivals to find a better way match the fuel efficiency and towing power achieved using the lightweight metal and turbo-charged, six-cylinder engines.  Rising pressure from the U.S. government to slash carbon dioxide emissions made Ford\u2019s move look smart.  Slideshow ( 18 images )  The debate within GM over whether to follow Ford\u2019s aluminum strategy \u201cwas a really hotly contested item for us,\u201d said Herrick. He recalled skeptical questions when he sought approval from GM\u2019s board for the billions of dollars required to launch the new Silverados at three factories.  \u201cSon, it really costs this much to build all those trucks?\u201d the 58-year-old executive recalled being asked by a member of the board.  Herrick, and Global Product Development chief Mark Reuss, said the shareholders\u2019 billions would be better spent on what they call a \u201cmulti-material\u201d strategy.  The new Silverado and Sierra got close to the Ford truck\u2019s weight using seven different grades of steel in the cab, aluminum hoods, door exterior panels and tailgates. Reuss pushed development of a novel carbon fiber plastic that will be molded to make load beds for certain high-priced GMC models \u2013 and perhaps be used in different ways in future GM models, Reuss said.  Before GM\u2019s direction was clear, a supplier to Ford sent Reuss a box of the rivets his competitor was using to fasten the F-series aluminum body panels together, anticipating he\u2019d be ordering them, too.  \u201cThey\u2019re still on my desk,\u201d Reuss said in an interview.  The combination of weight reduction and engine technology produces a rear-wheel drive 2019 Silverado with a 5.3 liter V-8 and an eight-speed automatic transmission that averages 17 miles per gallon in the city and 23 on the highway, with a combined rating of 19 miles per gallon. Different versions of the truck get different mileage ratings.  A Ford F-150 with a 3.5 liter turbo six cylinder and optional equipment that boosts the payload to about 3,230 pounds is rated at 17 miles per gallon in the city, 21 on the highway and 19 combined, according to the government. An F-150 with a lighter payload rating of about 2,640 pounds is rated at 18 miles per gallon city, and 25 miles per gallon on the highway, according to the government. Chevrolet claims a payload of 2,190 pounds for a 2019 Silverado with a 5.3 liter engine and an eight-speed transmission.  FOUR DOORS FOR PROFIT  In some crucial ways, GM is following Ford.  GM previously could not keep pace with demand for crew cab pickups \u2013 models with four, sedan-style doors in the cab. Ford used its lead in crew cab design to develop luxury truck models, such as the F-450 Limited, that have sticker prices as high as $100,000.  Average selling prices in the segment are around $42,000 to $45,000 - higher than the industry average.  GM has now dedicated two factories to building light duty pickups - in Fort Wayne and Silao, Mexico - which have the flexibility to build \u201cdarn near 100 percent crew cabs if we wanted,\u201d Herrick said.  The GMC marketing division, meanwhile, is putting more emphasis on its Denali luxury truck brand, while Chevrolet will market more luxurious versions of the Silverado such as the frontier-themed High Country, which has leather seats and a Bose sound system. GM executives said they want to increase the company\u2019s share of trucks sold at prices above $55,000 from the current 27 percent.  John Bergstrom, who owns a multi-brand network of dealerships based in Neenah, Wisconsin, said the new GM trucks should pull in buyers who currently don\u2019t drive a pickup.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the technology we needed,\u201d Bergstrom said. With the new truck, \u201cwe\u2019ve got that. They almost magically figured out how to get fuel economy out of these things.\u201d","659":"DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk raised hopes again on Thursday that he could ride to the rescue of a threatened General Motors Co GM.N car plant at the center of a political storm about auto jobs, and GM replied, saying the Ohio factory's fate depends on union talks next year.  FILE PHOTO: A view of the entrance to the West Plant at the General Motors Lordstown Complex, assembly plant in Warren, Ohio, U.S., November 26, 2018. REUTERS\/Alan Freed\/File Photo  Musk suggested in a Twitter exchange with outgoing Ohio Governor John Kasich that he would consider acquiring GM\u2019s Lordstown small-car factory in Warren, Ohio, which GM has signaled it could close next year. The decision has prompted bipartisan anger in Washington, led by U.S. President Donald Trump.  Musk had dropped a hint in an interview with the CBS TV program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Dec. 9 that he might be interested in buying one of the three North American vehicle assembly plans GM has said have no work allocated after next year.  On Monday, Kasich tweeted at Musk, \u201cHey @ElonMusk. Call me. There are no better workers than Ohio workers. And Lordstown is ready for you.\u201d Musk responded on Thursday, \u201cThanks, will consider next year.\u201d  GM, however, owns the factory, and in a statement following the Musk tweet, GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said: \u201cGM has said the plant is unallocated and the next steps are a matter of UAW-GM negotiations.\u201d  GM and the United Auto Workers will negotiate new master contracts for the automaker\u2019s U.S. operations next year, with a resolution likely in the fall.  The Lordstown assembly plant, which builds GM\u2019s slow-selling Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan, is one of five plants in North America GM has marked for possible closure.  Trump has put pressure on GM to find a new vehicle for the Lordstown plant, threatening to kill a $7,500 federal tax credit program for electric vehicles that is beneficial to GM. That program has also benefited Tesla, and both automakers have lobbied Congress for months to lift the cap on electric vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit from the present level of 200,000 vehicles.  HIGH STAKES  Analysts on Thursday tried to sort out the pros and cons of a deal that has not happened.  For Trump, the stakes are clear. Ohio is a battleground state the president won in 2016 and needs to win again to be re-elected in 2020. Trump said during a July 2017 visit to nearby Youngstown that jobs were coming back to the region. \u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he told local residents. \u201cDon\u2019t sell your house.\u201d  For GM, selling Lordstown to Tesla could help \u201creduce costs, improve sentiment and de-escalate political pressure,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note on Thursday.  GM, however, plans to compete more aggressively with Tesla by launching a fleet of electric vehicles over the next several years. Enabling Tesla\u2019s expansion could undermine its own electric-vehicle strategy.  Tesla's sole assembly plant in Fremont, California, used to be a GM factory. The electric vehicle maker acquired the plant in 2010 for $42 million after GM and then-partner Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T abandoned production there. Tesla has begun building a plant in China.  Ohio\u2019s incoming governor, Mike DeWine, plans to meet with senior GM executives next month at the Detroit auto show to discuss the fate of the Lordstown plant, but GM officials have told Congress it is extremely unlikely the company will add a new vehicle there.  If GM did reverse course and decide to retool the plant, it could take at least three years to prepare it for production, including potentially replacing the paint shop, GM told lawmakers.  The United Auto Workers reiterated on Thursday that the union \u201cwill leave no stone unturned contractually, legally and through bargaining to keep the GM plant open.\u201d  Musk has had a tense relationship with the UAW, which is seeking to represent workers at Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant. The union in May filed a complaint accusing Musk of illegally threatening to take away benefits from workers who join the union.  Musk previously accused the UAW of driving GM and Chrysler FCHA.MIFCAU.N to bankruptcy and losing \"200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect,\" apparently referring to effects of the crisis in the U.S. auto industry in 2008-2010. UAW officials called Musk's comments \"ridiculous\"  GM shares were down 2.7 percent at $33.97 and Tesla shares were down 5.8 percent at $313.76 on Thursday afternoon.","660":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N posted a better-than-expected net profit on Thursday as high-margin pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers helped overcome slowing sales in the United States and China, and reiterated its full-year earnings forecast.  GM shares gained 3.3% to over a one-year high.  Virtually all of the No. 1 U.S. automaker\u2019s profit came from North America, where it posted a profit margin of 10.7% and profits came in $400 million ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations.

GM is open to working with other automakers on the development of electric vehicles, Barra also said.

Other automakers, including U.S. rival Ford Motor Co F.N and Germany's Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, offered disappointing forecasts last week.  GM also faces an escalating price war in the lucrative U.S. pickup truck segment for its newly-revamped Chevrolet Silverado. Nevertheless, GM was able to add $1 billion in profits in the quarter in North America thanks to stronger pricing and higher sales of more lucrative vehicles.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N has been battling for market share with its all-new Ram pickup and outsold the Silverado in the second quarter.

GM said industry-wide sales in China should remain weak for the rest of the year, but added that its vehicle lineup in that market will be boosted by the addition of new SUVs.  GM\u2019s equity income from its Chinese operations fell to $235 million from $592 million a year earlier. The automaker said Chinese equity income in the second half of the year should roughly match the $611 million it posted for the first half.  The company said it still expects full-year 2019 earnings per share in a range from $6.50 to $7. Analysts are expecting $6.62 a share.  The automaker also said it still expects full-year adjusted automotive free cash flow in a range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion, meaning it would need to generate between $5.9 billion and $7.4 billion in the second half of the year. Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois said in a research note that hitting the cash flow target \u201cstill looks challenging.\u201d  GM\u2019s capital spending in the second quarter fell $700 million from last year to $1.4 billion.  GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara said the carmaker still expects capital spending for the year of $8 billion to $9 billion. She added that the impact of tariffs and commodity costs this year will be half the $1 billion the company forecast in January.  GM has achieved $1.1 billion in savings so far this year related to the restructuring that included plans to cut 15,000 jobs and end production at five North American plants, Suryadevara said. GM previously forecast savings in 2019 in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.  The plan came under withering criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and members of Congress.  GM reported second-quarter net income of $2.41 billion or $1.66 per share, compared with $2.39 billion or $1.66 per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM reported earnings of $1.64 per share.  Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $1.44, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

REUTERS\/Shannon Stapleton  Cadillac moved to New York under Johan de Nysschen, who ran the brand from 2014 until his abrupt ouster in April. The move to the Big Apple in 2015 accompanied bold plans to reshape Cadillac\u2019s lineup with a $12 billion product program in 2015 and was meant to bring the brand closer to the urban customers who for years had shunned it.  GM replaced De Nysschen with Steve Carlisle, who previously served as managing director of GM\u2019s Canadian operations.  After betting heavily on sedans models that are increasingly unpopular with U.S. consumers, last summer Cadillac announced a plan to catch up with market shifts by shrinking its lineup of sedans in favor of larger, more popular sport utility vehicles.  Through the first six months of this year, Cadillac\u2019s U.S. sales were up 5.4 percent, driven by growth in SUV sales.  Next April, Cadillac will move to Warren, Michigan, a stone\u2019s throw from GM\u2019s main design hub.  A GM spokesman said Cadillac will remain a separate business unit. The brand employs 110 people in New York, all of whom will be offered jobs in Michigan, the spokesman said.  The spokesman said that Cadillac will also play a \u201cbig role\u201d in the automaker\u2019s plans for developing self-driving vehicles and that it made sense for the brand to be closer to the rest of GM.  Cadillac was founded in Detroit in 1902.  Modern Detroit traces its origins back to a man named Cadillac \u2014 Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, to be precise, a French adventurer who founded Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit in 1701.  When Cadillac moved to New York it was eligible for state investment incentives, which a GM spokesman said the automaker had never used.","662":"DETROIT (Reuters) - The head of Canada\u2019s auto union blasted General Motors Co on Tuesday for pushing ahead with plans to phase out work at its Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant despite calls by workers and politicians in Canada to find a new vehicle to build there.

The question is do they have the political will to do so.\u201d  GM said in a letter to Dias that it had already considered several proposals including those the union raised at the meeting.  \u201cUnfortunately, all Unifor\u2019s proposals would involve substantial incremental costs and a further deterioration of GM\u2019s competitive position,\u201d GM said, adding that \u201cit cannot pursue them\u201d because of the weakening market in North America.  GM confirmed it has no plans to build vehicles in the Oshawa plant after the end of 2019, which is part of a broad restructuring announced in November. GM also has not allocated new products for four U.S. plants, raising the possibility of their closure and the elimination of a total of about 15,000 jobs in North America.  Dias previously promised \u201cone hell of a fight\u201d to prevent the Oshawa plant\u2019s closure. Going into the Tuesday meeting, he has voiced optimism a solution could be found.  Dias also previously said one option would be to extend operations for nine months, when regular contract talks are scheduled to begin, allowing more time for a long-term solution.  The union has said the decision is contrary to commitments made by GM in contract negotiations with Unifor in 2016. Unifor said the deal stipulates there will be no plant closures before Sept. 21, 2020.  After he returned from the meeting with GM, Dias told reporters in a press conference in Windsor, Ontario, that the union was looking at its legal options regarding whether the Detroit company violated the labor contract.  GM officials have said the fate of the U.S. plants is subject to talks with the United Auto Workers union, which represents the U.S. workers at those plants. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra promised in early December to keep an \u201copen mind\u201d about another affected plant, Ohio\u2019s Lordstown Assembly.

GM engineers test the 'Ultium Drive' unit in the dyno chamber at the General Motors Propulsion Systems Center in Pontiac, Michigan, U.S. in an undated photograph obtained September 16, 2020. Jeffrey Sauger\/General Motors\/Handout via REUTERS  The move, which follows earlier GM initiatives on next-generation batteries, comes as the Detroit automaker looks to build a vertically integrated electric car business, comparable to Tesla, inside its ongoing operations.  According to a GM media release viewed by Reuters, the automaker is set to announce that it has designed and plans to produce on its own five interchangeable drive units and three motors, which it calls the \u201cUltium Drive\u201d system.  GM said its new electric drive systems, sometimes referred to as e-axles in the industry, will have a versatile enough power output to allow them to be used with vehicles ranging from beefy pickup trucks to performance vehicles.  GM already has some EV partnerships, such as with truck startup Nikola Corp, but has chosen here to design its own e-drive technology, rather than buy from suppliers that might be able to offer greater scale and lower cost.  Adam Kwiatkowski, GM\u2019s executive chief engineer for global electrical propulsion, said that by designing its own e-axles, GM could better integrate them with an EV\u2019s battery and the rest of the car. E-axles combine gear, motor and power electronics into a single system and help convert the electricity from batteries efficiently to propel the vehicle.  GM \u201cdesigned these drive units simultaneously with a full gambit of electric vehicles that fill out our portfolio,\u201d Kwiatkowski told Reuters in an interview last week.  \u201cThey become synergistic and make them a really efficient package that\u2019s good for the performance of the vehicle, good for driving customer enthusiasm, and most importantly it\u2019s good for cost efficiency,\u201d he said.  The new self-designed technology means \u201cmore of the battery energy now goes to the road\u201d, which helps make GM\u2019s EVs more economical, Kwiatkowski said.  That in turn meant GM could give its EVs greater driving range, or vehicles could have less batteries, he added.  Other benefits include size, leading to a smaller drive train and more room for passengers, and also a more spontaneous motor response, Kwiatkowski said.  \u201cThere is very very little, totally imperceptible motor lag, so as soon as you touch the accelerator pedal the vehicle responds in a very smooth fashion.\u201d  The new technology highlights GM\u2019s effort to transform itself and catch up with Tesla, whose share price has jumped over 400% this year as it has reported improved profitability.  GM will still consider purchasing drive units and components from suppliers in some cases, said Detroit-based company spokesman, Phil Lienert.  However, it will continue to lead the design, development and manufacturing of Ultium Drive units, he said.","666":"FILE PHOTO: The General Motors logo is seen outside its headquarters at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan in this file photograph taken August 25, 2009.

GM has invested more than $1 billion in its Lansing plants since 2015.","667":"(Repeats story originally published on Thursday)  Oct 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s U.S. workforce productivity has declined since the automaker recovered from a 2009 bankruptcy, even as its profit per employee has risen, a Reuters analysis shows.  Those trends point to some of the root causes of the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike that has shut down the automaker\u2019s U.S. manufacturing plants for 18 days, already costing the company about $100 million a day.  The No. 1 U.S. automaker wants to boost productivity to offset financial pressure from a slowing global economy and investments in electric vehicles. The UAW is focused on increasing the share of profit going to workers, and closing wage gaps between full-time and temporary employees in GM factories.  GM\u2019s unionized workers in the United States build some of the company\u2019s most profitable truck and sport utility vehicles.  GM does not publish direct measures of U.S. productivity. But the number of vehicles the Detroit automaker built in the United States per U.S. employee fell to about 19 in 2018, down 13.5% from the 2010 level.  The Reuters calculation is based on GM annual production numbers sourced from research firm Wards Intelligence and the U.S. employee count in GM\u2019s annual filings.  A GM spokesman declined to comment on the analysis, saying that the automaker was \u201cfocused on negotiating a new labor agreement that builds a stronger future for the company and our workers.\u201d  The UAW said it believes GM\u2019s productivity is better since 2010 and the data would be more accurate based on total hours worked rather than employment.  Between 2010 and 2018 GM's estimated U.S. profit per employee surged 40% to about $94,097 last year, based on analysts' assumptions that U.S. operations generate about 90% of the automaker's North American operating profit disclosed in GM filings. Click here for an interactive graphic: tmsnrt.rs\/2p5MGjW  However, productivity and operating profit per worker have both slipped at GM between 2017 and 2018.  A broader measure of productivity in the U.S. auto sector shows declining productivity starting in 2013, according to data published by the Center for Automotive Research, an Ann Arbor, Michigan, industry research group.  One possible reason for the broad productivity declines at manufacturers including GM is the increasing complexity of vehicles and the federally mandated items, which result in more work elements, industry experts say.  Increasing production of large pickup trucks and SUVs is another factor causing potential productivity declines.  \u201cThe mix change to SUVs and pickups requires more work,\u201d said Ron Harbour, senior vice president for global automotive manufacturing at consulting firm Oliver Wyman. \u201cPickups for example are the most complex vehicles to build these days.\u201d  GM\u2019s U.S. vehicle production increased 15.5% to about 1.99 million vehicles in 2018, compared with the 2010 level. GM\u2019s U.S. hourly employment remained largely stable or fell slightly during that period, while the number of U.S. salaried jobs rose and eventually exceeded hourly workers.  The company\u2019s salaried hiring was part of a recovery from bankruptcy, as it added a finance arm and information technology staff.  GM\u2019s salaried employees - engineers, accountants, HR managers, marketers and other staff - nearly doubled to 53,000 in 2018 from 2010, lifting overall U.S. worker numbers by 34% to 103,000 last year.  NORTH AMERICAN JOB CUTS  Last November, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra ordered 15,000 jobs cut from GM\u2019s North American workforce to boost profitability at a time when the company is spending billions to develop next-generation technologies.  GM also said at the time that five North American factories had no future product assignments and could be shut down, including car assembly plants in Lordstown, Ohio; Detroit-Hamtramck, and Oshawa, Ontario.  \u201cThese are things we are doing to strengthen our core business,\u201d Barra said in November. \u201cWe are right-sizing capacity for the realities of the marketplace.\u201d  GM argues the plant shutdowns are necessary responses to market shifts, and that UAW wages and benefits are $13 an hour higher than competing nonunion auto plants in southern U.S. states.  UAW said hourly labor costs equate to just 5% to 6% of the price of a vehicle.  Reuters arrived at the productivity figures by looking at GM\u2019s annual U.S. vehicle production as reported by Wards Intelligence and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes from the automaker\u2019s annual reports, and dividing those by GM\u2019s total U.S. salaried and hourly employees combined.  However, when GM's U.S. salaried employees, which include workers not directly involved in the manufacturing process, are left out of the equation, the company's productivity per employee rose between 2010 and 2016, while slightly dipping year-over-year in 2017 and 2018.

The $50 billion automaker\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 were over twice analysts\u2019 estimate, according to Refinitiv. U.S. consumers \u2013 possibly buoyed by stimulus or less spending on services \u2013 scooped up trucks and SUVs. Belt-tightening, like salary reductions, also helped the North American business post adjusted operating profit margins of 15% \u2014 over four percentage points higher than in the same period last year.  And Covid-19 may have actually helped the financing unit. Its adjusted pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion roughly equaled the total for the entire second half of 2019 \u2013 driven by higher used vehicle prices. Demand was likely boosted by consumers worried about public transportation. And constrained supply issues may have also pushed more toward this market. But if government stimulus fails to pump up consumer wallets and repossessions increase, some of these positive trends could go into reverse. (By Anna Szymanski)  COVID RELIEF. America\u2019s biggest companies are toughing out the pandemic. Over 80% of the S&P 500 Index members have now published third-quarter earnings, according to Refinitiv. As the period began, analysts expected them to report, on average, 25% less profit than a year earlier. As things turned out, the year-on-year earnings decline is looking like a mere 8%.  Part of the explanation is an economic rebound. In the second quarter, U.S. GDP slumped 9% from a first-quarter level already dented by early lockdown damage. Last quarter, it rebounded more than 7%, according to an initial estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, leaving output down 3.5% from the final three months of 2019.  Full-year earnings are currently forecast to be 16% below last year\u2019s level, with only technology and healthcare companies bucking the trend with meaningful growth. Analysts foresee 2021 more than compensating. But whether the coronavirus, the economy and whoever occupies the White House help or hinder remains up in the air. (By Richard Beales)  NOW OR LATER. U.S. health insurers have had a good pandemic, but Cigna\u2019s third-quarter results show they will do fine afterwards, too. In the year\u2019s first half, premiums poured in but fewer people visited doctors for fear of catching Covid-19. Even if some of these are postponed indefinitely, patients are now somewhat catching up. Cigna\u2019s medical care ratio \u2013 or the percentage of premiums spent on healthcare \u2013 rose to 82.6% compared to 80.5% in the same period last year.  Earnings per share rose 6% though, beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. Cigna raised its revenue estimate for the rest of the year. Even once life returns to normal, Cigna is well-positioned. The health insurance industry simply isn\u2019t that competitive. Three-quarters of American metro areas have highly concentrated insurance markets, using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. That\u2019s something even Democrats in Washington have struggled to change.

Despite making about half of its revenue in places like Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe, the bank run by Jean-Pierre Mustier suffered a risk premium due to Italy\u2019s wobbly public finances. This meant UniCredit had to pay more for its capital than northern European rivals. In response, Mustier even unveiled a plan last year to hive off UniCredit\u2019s foreign operations into a sub-holding company.  Such a carve-out is no longer needed, Mustier said on Thursday. The European Central Bank\u2019s bond-buying spree has compressed Italian sovereign yields so much that the gap between Italian 10-year state bonds and their German equivalent is now just 126 basis points, from nearly 290 in mid-2019. As such, the expensive reorganisation no longer makes sense. Then again, Mustier could dust it off if M&A options materialised at home or abroad. (By Lisa Jucca)  END OF THE SHOW.

Investors may be getting overexcited about Covid-19 treatments. The head of the United Kingdom\u2019s Vaccine Taskforce said on Wednesday that AstraZeneca could release a booster by the end of the year. This could in theory see it take a share of a $10 billion market, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. The estimates assume the general public will need a dose each year and assume a price of $20 per shot.  AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have already promised to make successful vaccines available at cost during the pandemic. Although the treatment may become as ubiquitous as the annual flu jab, it will be difficult for pharmaceutical giants, already under scrutiny for price-gouging, to make too much money. Shares of companies that have promised to develop remedies are outperforming the broader index of pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks. But not all vaccines will succeed, and pharma investors may not see the financial benefits of those that do. (By Aimee Donnellan)  CASE OF RED. Pour one out for Treasury Wine Estates.

Lower costs and the resumption of limited flights mean the German carrier is burning through 200 million euros of cash a month. That\u2019s a massive improvement from April, when the airline was incinerating as much as 1 million euros an hour. Worryingly, it may not be able to maintain such a lean course.  Unveiling third-quarter results on Thursday, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr admitted the cash drain might climb to 350 million euros per month as the normal winter slowdown hits revenue. That implies Lufthansa\u2019s day-to-day operations will have burnt through 2.1 billion euros by March. Throw in limited capital spending and finance charges, and Lufthansa will have eaten up more than a quarter of its reserves.

Like other luxury brands, Cadillac has also been scrambling to come out with new SUV and crossover models to appeal to changing consumer appetites.","672":"Feb 12 (Reuters) - General Motors Co:  * GM KOREA ANNOUNCES FIRST STEP IN NECESSARY RESTRUCTURING  * GM KOREA COMPANY (GM KOREA) ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL CEASE PRODUCTION AND CLOSE ITS GUNSAN PLANT BY END OF MAY 2018  * AS A RESULT OF CLOSURE, CO EXPECTS TO TAKE CHARGES OF UP TO $850 MILLION, INCLUDING ABOUT $475 MILLION OF NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENTS  * GENERAL MOTORS - CO ALSO EXPECTS TO TAKE CHARGES OF UP TO $375 MILLION OF PRIMARILY EMPLOYEE-RELATED CASH EXPENSES; SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CHARGES TO BE RECORDED BY END OF Q2 2018 Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","673":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co shares jumped on Tuesday to their highest level since the company\u2019s post-bankruptcy IPO in 2010, as the automaker announced its entry into the growing electric delivery vehicle business.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  After Chief Executive Mary Barra outlined plans for GM\u2019s first BrightDrop commercial vans to be delivered to FedEx later this year, GM shares rose as high as $48.95 in morning trading, pushing the company\u2019s market cap over $68 billion.  The new BrightDrop delivery business will put GM squarely in competition in the commercial sector with cross-town rival Ford Motor Co, as well as startups such as Rivian, Arrival and Canoo that are developing electric commercial vehicles for customers ranging from Amazon to Hyundai Motor.  Fueled in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, GM estimates the U.S. market for parcel and food delivery will climb to more than $850 billion by 2025. It is one sector that EV sales leader Tesla has yet to crack.  Barra said BrightDrop will offer delivery and logistics customers such as FedEx a range of products and services that leverage the automaker\u2019s expertise in electrification and fleet management.  The BrightDrop EV600 will use a version of GM\u2019s Ultium battery system that will power many of the company\u2019s future electric vehicles, including the Hummer EV pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq crossover.  Barra introduced BrightDrop in an online keynote address at the CES annual tech and gadget show.  As part of Barra\u2019s presentation, GM design chief Mike Simcoe hosted a virtual unveiling of two battery-powered Cadillac concepts: A flying car and a boxy shuttle with sliding doors. Simcoe said Cadillac also is working on a luxury electric two-seater.  In a pre-show briefing, Pam Fletcher, GM vice president of global innovation, said the BrightDrop EV600 is a large, purpose-built delivery van that will have a range of 250 miles (400 km) between charges, with a long list of advanced safety features and built-in internet connectivity.  Unlike Cruise, the San Francisco self-driving startup that is majority-owned by GM and is developing a robotaxi business, BrightDrop does not plan to operate its own vehicle fleet. It will focus on supplying electric vans and related services to commercial customers.  A source familiar with details of the EV600 said it will share basic underbody architecture with the Hummer EV and a variety of other large GM trucks and SUVs that will hit the market over the next three years.  The first 500 units will go to FedEx by the end of the year, with deliveries to other customers starting in early 2022, Fletcher said.  The BrightDrop commercial van family could eventually include a smaller model designed for medium-distance deliveries and a larger model designed for rapid loading and unloading, she said.  In November, GM said it would challenge Tesla with increased spending and accelerated vehicle production targets. The higher investment will be funded by expanded pickup and SUV production.  GM said it planned to increase spending on electric and autonomous vehicles to $27 billion by 2023, up 35% from previously disclosed plans. The Detroit automaker will offer 30 EVs globally by 2025 and wants to exceed annual sales of 1 million EVs in China and the United States by then.","674":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N Chief Executive Mary Barra said Wednesday the Detroit automaker will invest $20 billion by 2025 in electric and automated vehicles as it races to catch up with Elon Musk's Tesla Inc TSLA.O as vehicles go electric.  A new modular platform and battery system named Ultium is unveiled by General Motors at the Design Dome on the GM Tech Center campus in Warren, Michigan, U.S. in this handout photo provided March 4, 2020. Steve Fecht\/General Motors\/Handout via REUTERS  The previously undisclosed investment figure was part of detailed presentations Barra and other GM executives gave to reporters and investors, to show that GM can make the transition from an internal combustion world to a battery electric one.  \u201cWe\u2019ll grow\u201d as the company offers more electric vehicles (EVs), Barra said at GM\u2019s design center in Warren, Michigan.  And by slashing the number of powertrain combinations and moving to modular electric vehicle components, including battery packs and motors, GM can be profitable and maintain its profit margins, she said.  Simplifying batteries and vehicle architectures would be critical to achieving profitability.  With its new Ultium battery technology, GM is on track to cut the battery cell costs - the single greatest expense in electric vehicles - to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour, Barra said. That would be down from about $140 now.  That, in turn, could make battery packs - for electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV - up to 45% cheaper, experts say.  In a similar light, Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, told investors last month that the Silicon Valley automaker was working on battery cost and range breakthroughs that it would describe at a \u201cBattery Day\u201d in April.  Instead of 555 internal combustion powertrain combinations, GM will be able to move to just 19 different electric vehicle propulsion systems, slashing costs, GM officials said.  Barra reiterated a goal of selling 1 million electric vehicles annually in the United States and China by 2025.  The $20 billion investment would go towards planned engineering and capital spending, she said, adding it was not a figure \u201cwith crazy things added to make it look big.\u201d  GM shares were trading up about 2.3% at $31.24, still below the $33 a share price in its post-bankruptcy 2010 public offering.  At the design center, analysts questioned GM\u2019s EV competitiveness, whether EVs can be sold at a premium and how the company will manage the transition away from gas-powered vehicles. Executives maintained GM is well positioned in the EV market, where they see profitable growth, especially on the U.S. coasts.  The skepticism of investors and analysts over GM\u2019s electric vehicle plans has become clear in recent months, with Tesla\u2019s market value soaring to around $137 billion as of Wednesday, more than triple GM\u2019s $44 billion.  GM is by far the larger manufacturer by volume, and generates more cash and profits. But in the electric vehicle market, Tesla is the leader.  Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 electric vehicles globally, including 223,000 in the United States. GM sold just 16,400 Chevrolet Bolt EVs to U.S. buyers, and 60,000 Baojun E-Series models in China with joint venture partner SAIC Motor 600104.SS.  Barra, GM President Mark Reuss and other executives outlined their electric vehicle strategy in GM\u2019s 65-year-old vehicle design center, ringed by prototypes of future electric vehicles ranging from a redesigned Chevrolet Bolt compact vehicle to hulking electric GMC Hummer trucks, an electric Cadillac SUV the size of the current, gasoline-fueled Escalade and a never-before-seen prototype of a large Cadillac sedan called the Celestiq.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The first of the new generation electric vehicles, the GMC Hummer pickup, will be launched in late 2021, followed by the Cadillac Lyriq crossover utility vehicle in 2022. GM has promised 20 new electric vehicle models globally by 2023.  A central part of GM\u2019s pitch to investors focuses on the company\u2019s new Ultium electric vehicle batteries, which will offer a GM-estimated electric driving range of 400 miles or more on a single charge.  These batteries use 70% less cobalt and less nickel than current designs, and they are packaged in long, thin \u201clarge format pouch\u201d type cells that hold 20 times more energy than conventional cylindrical cells, GM engineers said.  The Ultium batteries use chemistry called NMCA, for nickel- manganese-cobalt-aluminum, GM officials said.  Cobalt and nickel are two of the most expensive raw materials used in electric vehicle batteries.  Reuss said GM was moving to directly buy battery materials as it works on new technology that will cut or eliminate cobalt use.  GM has previously revealed its electric vehicle strategy in incremental steps - announcing the Hummer brand will be reborn as an electric pickup, and a partnership with Korean battery maker LG Chem 051910.KS to build a $2.3 billion battery plant near a shuttered GM car plant in Lordstown, Ohio.","675":"(Corrects headline and first sentence to show that total potential incentive package is \u201cmore than $25 million,\u201d not \u201cmore than $179 million.\u201d Corrects 2nd paragraph to show that the stock options will only have value above the $1,515 strike price, not that all the shares in the restricted stock units and the stock options are valued at $1,515 each.)

The No. 1 U.S. automaker also said it would invest $700 million in three other plants in Ohio - a state important to Trump\u2019s re-election chances in 2020 - and maintain some operations at a Canadian factory that had been slated to close by year end.  The decisions came after GM faced months of criticism over its plan announced in November to close five North American plants and cut 15,000 jobs. GM\u2019s decision to close the small-car assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, had become fodder for Trump and several Democratic presidential candidates.  Trump, who disclosed GM\u2019s plans for Lordstown in a Wednesday tweet, said the deal with Cincinnati-based Workhorse Group Inc will require the approval of the United Auto Workers union. However, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine expressed caution.  \u201cThis is a step, but we have a long way to go,\u201d DeWine told reporters. He also cited Workhorse\u2019s ongoing efforts to win a truck supply contract with the U.S. Postal Service as a key step.  Loveland, Ohio-based Workhorse is a small electric truck and drone startup that has reported losses totaling almost $150 million since its launch in 2007, according to the company\u2019s financial documents. It had just $2.8 million in cash on hand at the end of March and reported first-quarter sales of $364,000.  UAW OPPOSES DEAL  Workhorse and a newly formed entity, in which Workhorse holds a minority stake, would initially employ \u201chundreds\u201d at the plant building a commercial electric pickup truck, Workhorse officials said. As recently as 2016, GM employed 4,500 people at the plant and in March cut the final 1,500 jobs when production of the slow-selling Chevrolet Cruze ended.  Of the 2,800 hourly employees affected by the plans to end production at the four U.S. plants, 1,350 have accepted transfers to other GM plants, the company said. At Lordstown, about half of those employed when production ended have transferred elsewhere.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  GM also said on Wednesday it will invest $700 million and add 450 jobs at its Toledo, Parma and Moraine, Ohio, operations. \u201cGreat news for Ohio,\u201d Trump tweeted.  GM is not reversing the bulk of its restructuring efforts, including its decision to slash 15 percent of its salaried workforce and end vehicle production at three North American plants, including Lordstown. Last week, GM ended production at a plant near Baltimore that built transmissions.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said Workhorse \u201ccould help preserve Lordstown\u2019s more than 50-year tradition of vehicle assembly work.\u201d  The UAW said on Wednesday in a statement GM should add a new product at Lordstown \u201cand continue operating it,\u201d adding it would continue with its federal lawsuit against GM to protect the contractual rights of its members. Workhorse officials said they intend to work with the union, but a previously unionized plant it bought from Navistar in 2013 now operates with a non-union work force, according to the company\u2019s annual report.  The fate of the Lordstown plant has been a big focus of Trump\u2019s. He spoke to Barra earlier on Wednesday before the Detroit company announced its plans in Canada.  Trump in June 2017 advised workers in nearby Youngstown, Ohio, that factory jobs were not leaving. \u201cDon\u2019t move, don\u2019t sell your house,\u201d he said.  It likely would take at least a year before the plant, which halted production in March, could reopen after a deal was reached, Ohio\u2019s governor, DeWine, said.  \u201cThis potential agreement ... will help solidify the leadership of Workhorse\u2019s role in the EV community,\u201d Workhorse CEO Duane Hughes said in the GM statement, referring to electric vehicles.  Slideshow ( 12 images )  Workhorse shares jumped 190 percent to $2.45 on the news, while GM\u2019s shares were almost unchanged, down 5 cents at $38.48 in late afternoon.  CANADIAN PM: \u2018GOOD NEWS\u2019  Separately, GM and the largest union representing Canada\u2019s auto workers have reached a deal to partly rescue an Ontario assembly plant by turning it into a parts-making facility, the automaker said in a statement.  The transformation of GM\u2019s Oshawa site, which would also be used to conduct advanced vehicle testing, would save 300 jobs and have \u201cthe potential to grow and generate significant additional jobs in the coming years,\u201d GM said.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the announcement \u201cgood news for our autoworkers.\u201d  Canadian union Unifor, which had fiercely opposed the shuttering of the plant, had previously said the closure was contrary to a contract that stipulates there would be no plant closure.  \u201cThere are 300 families that are better off than they would have been in December,\u201d said Unifor President Jerry Dias in Toronto.","678":"DETROIT, April 3 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it will stop reporting monthly U.S. vehicle sales, saying the 30-day snapshot does not accurately reflect the market and will instead issue quarterly sales.  GM will also no longer report monthly sales in China, its largest market, and Brazil. GM will provide monthly data to the U.S. Federal Reserve, industry associations and government agencies across the globe but that data is not made public.  Analysts and investors rely on monthly U.S. vehicle sales not just to track the performance of individual automakers, but as a barometer of the health of the world\u2019s second-largest auto market and as an indicator of consumer confidence in the U.S. economy overall.  GM and its Detroit rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have relied heavily on sales of high-margin pickup truck and SUV sales to boost profits.  GM\u2019s total U.S. sales, its second-largest market, are down 3.2 percent for the first two months of 2018, reflecting a 6.8 percent drop in retail sales to individual customers, the company reported last month.  GM executives have expressed frustration that comparisons of monthly U.S. sales results among rival automakers are distorted by short-term discount programs, and by differences in strategy for selling vehicles in bulk to rental car fleets.  \u201cThirty days is not enough time to separate real sales trends from short-term fluctuations in a very dynamic, highly competitive market,\u201d Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president for sales operations said in a statement.  GM\u2019s actions could prompt other automakers to also switch to quarterly U.S. sales reports. Major automakers will report March U.S. new vehicle sales on Tuesday.  Until the early 1990s, most U.S. automakers released sales results every 10 days. The former Chrysler Corp, a forerunner of today\u2019s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, stopped reporting sales on a 10-day basis in 1990, and rivals followed suit over the next three years.  GM executives are betting that investors will quickly adapt to receiving U.S. sales data every three months, as investors in other retail sectors already have. Retailers such as Walmart Inc report sales on a quarterly basis.","679":"FILE PHOTO: General Motors auto assembly workers work on partially finished Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks at the Flint Assembly in Flint, Michigan January 24, 2011.

Sales of heavy-duty pickups in the United States have grown to more than 600,000 vehicles a year, up more than 20 percent since 2013, according to industry data. Prices for luxury models can easily top $70,000.  GM on Tuesday will celebrate the launch of a new generation of heavy-duty GMC and Chevrolet pickups at the assembly plant in Flint, Michigan, that is now building all such trucks for the company.","680":"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Thursday it will pay for the health insurance of its striking hourly workers, reversing a decision to push the costs onto the United Auto Workers union as officials on both sides said major issues remain to be resolved.

REUTERS\/Roosevelt Cassio  No agreement was expected Thursday even as talks were continuing and could continue into the weekend, UAW and GM officials said.  Because of the complex nature of shifting health care coverage costs, GM said Thursday that UAW members\u2019 coverage had never lapsed.  \u201cGiven the confusion around what was happening, we chose to work with our providers to ensure that the benefits would remain fully in place,\u201d GM spokesman Jim Cain said.  The UAW had accused GM of blindsiding its members with the decision to drop coverage during the strike, and some workers had claimed they could not pay their medical bills as a result. The union seized on this issue to rally public and political support for the 48,000 striking workers.  \u201cThere is no doubt that public sentiment sees these actions of GM as a shameful act,\u201d Terry Dittes, the UAW vice president in charge of the GM department, said on Thursday in a letter to GM that the union released publicly.  UAW members went on strike at GM on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker\u2019s profit and protection of their healthcare benefits. GM immediately shifted responsibility for the health insurance to the union\u2019s strike fund.  GM officials had previously indicated that the decision on health insurance had been telegraphed to the union well before the strike and no worker had lacked coverage thanks to the UAW strike fund.  The strike is costing GM about $100 million a day, analysts said.  The walkout - the longest autoworker strike in nearly 30 years - has become a political event, attracting the attention of Democratic presidential hopefuls, who have been visiting the striking workers on the picket lines.  The Democratic candidates have echoed the striking workers in saying GM employees deserve fair treatment from the Detroit automaker they helped get through bankruptcy, and several criticized GM for its previous decision to stop paying for the workers\u2019 health insurance.  People familiar with the talks said progress has been made, but the two sides are still grappling with issues over pay and job security of newer and temporary workers. The sides were still meeting late on Thursday.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  GM shocked South Korea in February with plans to close one local plant and leaving the fate of three others unclear. It is seeking government funding and incentives as well as wage concessions to save the unit, which just posted an annual net loss of $1.1 billion, its fourth straight year in the red.  But the April 20 deadline, first given late last month, looks challenging given growing tensions with the union and as state-funded Korea Development Bank (KDB) says it needs until early May to complete due diligence on GM Korea and the proposed restructuring.  \u201cOur preferred path remains to find a successful outcome here,\u201d GM President Dan Ammann told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing for all the stakeholders. But everybody has got to come to the table by next Friday.\u201d  Complicating matters, GM Korea must make payments to workers who agreed to leave the company as part of a voluntary severance plan in the week beginning April 23. The unit does not have the cash to make the payments, and GM has so far indicated it will not provide any more cash unless there is a deal with unions and the South Korean government.  An interim report on the due diligence will come out on April 20, KDB Chairman Lee Dong-geol told reporters on Friday, adding that meaningful progress in talks can be made after that. KDB owns 17 percent of GM Korea.  TRAVEL BAN TO S.KOREA  While there were early signs that GM Korea\u2019s union may be more accommodating than in the past, tensions have flared.  Last week, some union members entered the office of GM Korea\u2019s CEO and destroyed furniture as the automaker was unable to make planned bonus payments. Talks with the union on Thursday were canceled after the company demanded security cameras be set up at the site due to safety concerns.  GM headquarters this week also banned employee travel to GM Korea sites until further notice due to worries about security.  GM has offered to invest $2.8 billion in GM Korea, part of which would be shouldered by KDB. It is also seeking tax incentives and has proposed converting $2.7 billion debt owed to it by GM Korea into equity.  If GM Korea sought protection in South Korean bankruptcy courts, it could continue to build cars. However, it is not clear where the financing to continue operations would come from. The unit\u2019s creditors and employees also could take financial hits if GM Korea is restructured in court.  Quitting Korea would, however, not be an easy call for GM as it relies on those plants as a key export hub - building vehicles for the United States and Latin America, although it could build models such as the Chevrolet Trax elsewhere.  GM also uses GM Korea to prepare what are known as \u201cknock down\u201d kits - partially assembled vehicles that are shipped to other markets for final assembly and it has strong relationships with South Korean suppliers that could suffer from a messy exit.  GM has abandoned several money-losing markets over the past three years as part of a broader strategy to boost profit margins and conserve capital to fund electric and automated vehicles as well as new models for core markets in China, the U.S. and Latin America.

We\u2019re feeling a sense of crisis,\u201d Ha Bu-young, the head of the Hyundai Motor union, South Korea\u2019s biggest and most powerful union, told Reuters in an interview late last week.  He said that at three of Hyundai\u2019s five plants in Ulsan, the world\u2019s biggest car factory complex, some workers had been asked to take longer holidays as sales of sedans and older model SUVs like the Santa Fe slow in the United States and other markets.  Hyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors 000270.KS were also hit by diplomatic tensions between Seoul and Beijing last year, leading to a slump in sales in the world's biggest auto market. The two automakers have flagged only modest global sales growth in 2018.  Longer term, Ha worries about the advent of electric cars, which when they go mainstream could wreak havoc on traditional auto jobs as they don\u2019t require engines and transmissions.  Hyundai\u2019s union has predicted a drastic shift into electric cars could lead to a loss of 70 percent of Hyundai jobs in a worst case scenario.  \u201cElectric cars are disasters. They are evil. We are very nervous,\u201d he said.  Ha said the union is studying how cars of the future might be built without slashing headcount and has proposed the automaker revive a committee to review the impact of new vehicles and new technology on jobs.  He also noted that some 30,000 workers out of 50,000 union members will retire in 15 years, which could cushion the impact that cars of the future could have on staffing levels.  FREE TRIPS TO EUROPE  At GM\u2019s South Korean unit, the threat of potential plant closures has led its union to offer to freeze wages and skip bonuses while about 15 percent of its employees have applied for a voluntary redundancy package.  While there is a sense of crisis at Hyundai\u2019s union, the situation is not that dire.  Hyundai\u2019s management has proposed the scaling back of some benefits such as free week-long trips to Europe for 500 workers annually as well as support for some employees\u2019 sporting events - a proposal that the union plans to oppose, a union official said.  But the union will for the first time seek pay raises for temporary workers this year that are higher than those of full-time auto workers, responding to criticism that regular auto works are generously paid.  It will ask for a 7.4 percent wage increase for temporary workers versus a 5.3 percent wage raise for regular workers, Ha said, in line with a policy advocated by the umbrella union for South Korea\u2019s metal workers.  Last year Hyundai\u2019s union initially demanded annual wage increases of 7 percent for its full-time workers and won a raise of less than 5 percent after tense negotiations that involved strikes.  The shift towards improving pay for non-full time workers could invite opposition within the union, said Ha, adding that he was trying to right old wrongs.","683":"DETROIT, Aug 1 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Thursday posted a flat quarterly net profit that handily beat market expectations, helped by U.S. sales of high-margin pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

TSLA.O  \u201cWe have demonstrated time and again that we are willing to make tough and strategic decisions to not only meet our commitments but to secure the company\u2019s future,\u201d Barra said.  Barra\u2019s charm offensive had proven successful for most of President Donald Trump\u2019s first two years in office. Atop Barra\u2019s list of accomplishments: shielding GM\u2019s profitable Mexican truck production and its $5 billion investment in its Mexican operations announced in 2014 to double capacity in Mexico from punitive trade measures from the Trump administration.

REUTERS\/Edgard Garrido  But the new conflict with Washington comes at a critical time for GM, which wants to sell many more electric vehicles and has been lobbying Congress to expand the $7,500 tax credits. It still needs help from regulators to get self-driving cars without steering wheels on U.S. roads.  And GM stands to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s plan to weaken fuel efficiency standards  \u201cWe\u2019ve done this to help you, and I think his disappointment is it seems like they kind of turned their back on him,\u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters in November, referring to Trump\u2019s reaction.  Kyle Martin, research analyst with Westwood Management in Dallas, which owns GM shares, said GM needs the cash to develop to electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle technology.  \u201cThat money has to come from somewhere,\u201d he said.  WORKING WASHINGTON  Trump\u2019s election win brought a dire warning from GM executives in a presentation in late 2017 and early 2018 to the company\u2019s board: an end to the North American Free Trade Agreement could cost the automaker billions of dollars in tariffs on GM\u2019s Mexican vehicles. They concluded that the costs would still be less than the billions of dollars and years it would take to shift production to the United States, people briefed on the matter said.  GM argued that while it was building autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles in the United States, it needed to keep generating profits on Mexican-built trucks to fund those operations, people briefed on the talks said.  So Barra made engaging with the White House after Trump\u2019s election a key focus, three people briefed on the matter said.  She went to dinner at the house of Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, and spoke on several occasions with Trump himself. Barra hired a former senior Trump aide who handled trade policy issues, Everett Eissenstat, to run GM\u2019s DC office in August.  And she has had numerous talks with U.S. officials, including conversations with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, about the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada - including a key call in August to address concerns from GM that the new trade deal could have disadvantaged its Mexican operations.  Barra is now counting on those relationships to help her steer through 2019, and mend fences in Washington.  She invited Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to Michigan to attend a board meeting in June 2017 and take a ride in an self-driving car in Michigan, according to previously unreported government records reviewed by Reuters. Barra also had a previously unreported lunch in April 2017 with Chao at the White House with other officials.  She spent two days last month on Capitol Hill meeting with angry lawmakers and explaining the cuts. In a brief interview with Reuters in December, Barra said she understands \u201cthat there\u2019s a lot of emotion and concerns\u201d but emphasized that the actions were about safeguarding the company\u2019s future.  She has her work cut out for her.  Representative Andy Levin, a Michigan Democrat who took office this month, noted the Detroit-Hamtramck plant - one of the facilities losing production - is on a site that GM won approval in the early 1980s to dislocate more than 4,200 people as the state tore down about 1,500 homes and 140 businesses.  \u201cWe as a society made a huge sacrifice for GM so they could have a new plant. And 30 years later they are just going to throw it away?\u201d Levin said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop and just say, \u2018Oh this is a cost of doing business.\u2019\u201d","685":"July 29 (Reuters) - General Motors Co on Wednesday swung to a loss for the second quarter, reflecting a forced shutdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic that left its North American plants idled through to May 18.

The automaker and the union were continuing talks late on Monday to resolve a strike by 48,000 hourly workers that shut down GM\u2019s highly profitable U.S. operations.  GM said on Saturday it would make investments in eight facilities in four states, but did not specify timing, location or products other than the electric pickup and a battery cell plant.

FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors plant in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, January 22, 2019. REUTERS\/Roosevelt Cassio  GM, the largest U.S. automaker, and Sweden\u2019s Volvo both said they were aware of the respective denials of their nearly year-old petitions. Both companies had not raised the sticker price to account for tariffs, which came into play last July.  The denial of GM\u2019s petition for its Buick Envision came in a May 29 letter from the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office saying the request concerned \u201ca product strategically important or related to \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 or other Chinese industrial programs.\u201d  The midsize SUV, with a starting price of about $35,000, has become a target for U.S. critics of Chinese-made goods, including leaders of the United Auto Workers union and members in key political swing states such as Michigan and Ohio.  Buick Envision sales fell in the United States by nearly 27% to 30,000 last year and fell another 21% in the first three months of 2019.  Only a small number of vehicles are built in China and sold in the United States.  Last month, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office also rejected a request by Volvo Cars for its mid-size XC60 SUVs, its top selling U.S. vehicle.  Volvo, which is owned by China\u2019s Geely, had already last year begun switching production of U.S.-bound XC60s from China to Europe as part of a global shake up of production plans for most of its lineup in an effort to dodge tariffs.  A spokeswoman said the XC60 shift, Volvo\u2019s biggest move to mitigate the impact of tariffs, was completed in the Spring, meaning Volvo was no longer paying tariffs on XC60 imports and would not see any fresh cost impact due to the rejection.  Volvo had argued in its exemption request that it could \u201canticipate\u201d the XC60 would be eventually produced in its recently opened South Carolina plant, where it is building S60 sedans, but the spokeswoman said no decision had been taken.  \u201c(New production setup) is a cost so that would of course depend on the permanence of tariffs and what the situation looks like going forward. It\u2019s a continuous evaluation that we always do with the flexible manufacturing footprint,\u201d she said.  Besides the shift, Volvo has also split production of its S60 luxury sport sedan between the two countries; altered some European production plans; and reduced shipments of its S90 sedan, which is only produced in China, to the United States.  U.S. retail sales for the S90 sedan this year to May were down 63.7 percent year on year, company data showed.  GM had argued in its request that Envision sales in China and the United States would generate funds \u201cto invest in our U.S. manufacturing facilities and to develop the next generation of automotive technology in the United States.\u201d  GM said last year the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Envisions, about 200,000 a year, are sold in China.  Because of the lower U.S. sales volume, \u201cassembly in our home market is not an option\u201d for the Envision, which competes with such mid-size crossover vehicles as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Cadillac XT5.  Ahead of the July 2018 start for higher import tariffs, GM shipped in a six-month supply of Envisions at the much lower 2.5 percent tariff rate, Reuters reported in August 2018.","692":"TUSTIN, Calif. (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N unveiled on Thursday its newly designed mid-engine 2020 Corvette in a splashy tribute to its emblematic sports car, even as the No. 1 U.S. automaker faces mounting pressures in a sluggish and uncertain global sales environment.  In a glitzy presentation in Orange County outside Los Angeles, the eighth generation of the 66-year-old \u201cVette,\u201d in red, white, and blue, roared down a runway stopping short before an audience of Corvette enthusiasts, GM executives, dealers and media.  Revved up to take on high-performance European rivals, the new Corvette, dubbed the C8, provides a breath of fresh air to GM, which along with other carmakers faces slowing sales and new financial pressures related to global trade, electrification and unresolved emission standards.  With a 495 horsepower, V8 engine and dual clutch, the Corvette will go from zero to 60 mph in under 3 seconds, executives said, adding that the starting price in the United States will be less than $60,000.  The sports car gives the Detroit automaker a sorely needed shot in the arm after a difficult year, Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell said.  \u201cA Corvette is not going to help pad margins the way a Silverado would,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cBut from an image and excitement standpoint ... that halo effect the Corvette fills is unique.\u201d  The Chevy Silverado full-size pickup truck, a perennial best-seller, ranks among GM\u2019s most profitable vehicles.  Since 2013, GM has sold over 100,000 C7-model Corvettes in the United States, according to Edmunds. The car ceased production this summer.  Bidding adieu to the front-engine configuration that has marked the two-seater since its appearance in 1953, GM has opted for a mid-engine architecture for better handling and weight distribution, the choice of many European sports carmakers.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  Corvette Chief Engineer Tadge Juechter said GM had reached the limits of what could be done with the front engine, but that the new mid-engine design allowed a \u201cquantum leap forward in driving dynamics.\u201d  Far below the $113,000 starting price for the rear-engine Porsche 911, the Corvette's opening price of under $60,000 could attract a younger buyer lured in recent years to high performance vehicles from Tesla Inc TSLA.O and others.  One such potential customer, who professed to be a Tesla fan as well, was Jonathan Opatowsky, 22. He drove three hours to the unveiling in his dad\u2019s 2017 Grand Sport - with his mom in the passenger seat.  Opatowsky, whose father was absent due to work, said his dad first let him drive his 2014 Stingray when he was only 17.  \u201cHe was shocked. He didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to drive it like I did,\u201d he said.  THE LAUNCH  The massive hangar where the gasoline-fueled Corvette took the stage is less than 40 miles (64 km) from Tesla\u2019s Southern California design center, where Chief Executive Elon Musk in 2017 unveiled a prototype of a new electric Roadster - dubbed \u201cthe quickest car in the world\u201d by the automaker.  Whether the Corvette can generate enough excitement to attract even the loyal buyers of the pricier European brands - from Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, McClaren and Lotus - remains to be seen.  Slideshow ( 7 images )  GM has teased the launch for months.  In April, Juechter and Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra drove a camouflaged C8 Corvette through New York\u2019s Times Square during rush hour in a high-profile tease.  Almost mythic in the American imagination, the car has been immortalized in television and film from \u201cRoute 66\u201d and \u201cHot Rods to Hell\u201d in the 1960s to \u201cCorvette Summer\u201d in 1978.  Even Elvis drove the Corvette Stingray Racer in the 1967 film \u201cClambake.\u201d  Ahead of the evening launch inside a vast hangar, Corvette owners mingled at a \u201cCorvette Corral\u201d alongside their parked sportscars, with a selection of vintage Corvettes from GM inside.

The UAW on Monday launched the first company-wide strike at GM in 12 years, saying negotiations toward a new national agreement covering about 48,000 hourly workers had hit an impasse.  This year\u2019s talks between the union and GM, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) were expected to be tough, with thorny issues such as healthcare costs, profit-sharing and the use of temporary workers on the table.  Negotiations between GM and the union resumed on Tuesday morning.  Workers on picket lines outside GM factories waved signs declaring \u201cUAW On Strike.\u201d In Bowling Green, Kentucky, they blocked the three entrances to the assembly plant, which normally builds the Chevrolet Corvette.  Salina Alexander, who works in the Kentucky plant\u2019s paint shop, said the strike is about GM sharing some of its profits with union-represented employees who helped bail out the carmaker during its bankruptcy. \u201cWe hung in there with them; they can give us something back.\u201d  Meanwhile, GM said coverage for the striking workers\u2019 health insurance reverted to the union, which unsuccessfully sought to have the No. 1 U.S. automaker cover those costs through the end of the month. That places another drain on the union\u2019s strike fund.  \u201cWe understand strikes are difficult and disruptive to families,\u201d GM spokesman Jim Cain said in an email. \u201cWhile on strike, some benefits shift to being funded by the union\u2019s strike fund, and in this case hourly employees are eligible for union-paid COBRA so their health care benefits can continue.\u201d  GM has said in the past that it annually spends about $1 billion a year on health care coverage for its hourly workers, suggesting the monthly cost per worker is in the range of $1,700 to $2,000. The UAW on its website said its strike fund covers certain benefits such as medical and prescription drugs, but not dental, vision and hearing. (uaw.org\/strike-faq\/)  A UAW spokesman had no immediate comment.  During the walkout, UAW members also receive $250 a week from the union\u2019s strike fund.

GM also said the union would retain \u201cnationally leading\u201d health care benefits.  Charlie Highlander, 59, who also works in the Bowling Green plant\u2019s paint shop, said the strike was about protecting the rights of younger workers who are paid at a lower wage or are hired as temporary workers.  \u201cI\u2019m out here mostly for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the young people for me.\u201d  The contract talks with GM have been overshadowed by a mushrooming U.S. federal corruption probe of top union officials. The investigation has raised questions about UAW President Gary Jones, who a source said was an unnamed official cited in a federal complaint last week detailing alleged embezzlement by union leaders.  The strike has also become a political issue, and both U.S. President Donald Trump and Democrats who want to unseat him in 2020 have weighed in. Trump and Democrats see the votes of UAW members in the Midwest as critical to victory.  GM\u2019s workers last went out on a brief two-day strike in 2007 during contract talks.

The job reductions at the Brownstown plant are in addition to cuts GM announced last month. The Detroit automaker said it would end production at five plants in North America, including four in the United States, and eliminate up to 15,000 jobs. GM is cutting production of six cars: the Volt, LaCrosse, Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Cruze, Cadillac CT6 and Cadillac XTS.  GM said last week it will offer jobs at other assembly plants to 2,800 active hourly workers who work at the plants ending production in Michigan, Ohio and Maryland.  In a separate notice posted on Tuesday, GM said it will lay off nearly 700 people in February at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant that is scheduled to halt production next year. The plant will end production of the Buick LaCrosse and Chevrolet Volt by March 1 and two other cars by June.  GM is cutting 15 percent of its 54,000 North American salaried workforce and plans to lay off thousands of white-collar workers in January after some workers agreed to incentives to depart voluntarily.","701":"BEIJING, July 5 (Reuters) - General Motors Co\u2019s January to June vehicle sales in China fell 15%, as the U.S. automaker was hurt by a slowing economy amid the Sino-U.S. trade war and by heightened competition in its key mid-priced SUV segment.  GM delivered 753,926 vehicles in China in the second quarter this year, according to a company statement. The drop for the quarter ended June 30 marks the fourth straight quarterly sales decline for GM in China, the world\u2019s biggest auto market.  It delivered 1,567,899 vehicles in the first half, according to Reuters calculation.

Slideshow ( 14 images )  That is not what auto factories are like in the era of COVID-19. A General Motors Co GM.N operation set up in a shuttered transmission factory in Warren, Michigan to assemble face masks provides a glimpse of what manufacturing will look like for the foreseeable future.  People entering the plant rub their hands in sanitizer made by a Detroit brewery. A surgical face mask and safety glasses are required equipment. They stand while a security guard points a temperature scanner at them.  GM\u2019s face mask factory sits in a sprawling maze of abandoned transmission gear machining stations. Automakers have compared their crash programs to manufacture medical equipment for the COVID-19 outbreak to the \u2018Arsenal of Democracy\u2019 of the World War Two era, when Midwestern auto plants were converted to build tanks and airplanes. The Warren plant, built in 1941, has now played a role in both crises.  On the way to lockers and an air shower that blows dust off their clothes, workers pass a small break area. The space looks like a cafe for loners: small round tables, six feet apart, with a single chair at each one.  About 140 people currently work on two shifts producing surgical masks and more robust N95 masks at a pace of about 1.5 million masks a month, said Joe Mizzi, the GM manager who launched and oversees the operation.  Before the COVID-19 crisis, Mizzi traveled the world, working with plants to launch new GM vehicles on time. Shortly after GM\u2019s U.S. plants were forced to shut down in March, Mizzi said his boss called to ask if he could lead the crash project to start making masks.  Making a surgical mask starts with rolls of fabric. The fabric GM uses is produced by the same suppliers who provide sound insulation and other textiles for GM vehicles.  The fabric is fed into machines the size of a large microwave oven that automatically pleat and cut it into masks.  The masks then go to workers who sit in front of small machines that use sonic waves to attach elastic ear straps.  Dave Zakalowski is a 13-year veteran GM employee who agreed to work on the mask line. A United Auto Workers union member, Zakalowski said he used to work in the Warren transmission plant before it was shut down last year. Then he moved to GM\u2019s truck plant in Flint.  Asked about going back to his regular job, Zakalowski said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time. I hope they don\u2019t rush things too fast. Otherwise we\u2019ll be right back where we started.\u201d  Hours later, the head of the United Auto Workers said early May would be too soon for GM, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI to restart vehicle plants.  Among the UAW\u2019s concerns is that workers have enough masks.","703":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it had started producing ventilators in the volume needed to treat severely ill coronavirus patients and would deliver the first batch of the medical equipment to the U.S. government this month.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded nine contracts totaling nearly $2.6 billion to produce 137,000 ventilators by the end of 2020 for the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, including a contract to GM worth $489.4 million for 30,000 ventilators by the end of August after President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act.  Other contracts announced by HHS in recent days include a $646.7 million contract to Dutch health technology company Philips and others to General Electric Co, Hill-Rom Holdings Inc, Medtronic Plc , ResMed Inc, Vyaire Medical Inc, Hamilton Medical AG and Zoll Medical Corp.  Hamilton is receiving a $552 million contract for 14,115 ventilators, while Vyaire is receiving a $407.9 million contract for 22,000 ventilators produced by June 29 and Zoll is receiving a $350.1 million contract for 18,900 ventilators, HHS said on Monday.  HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement the contracts \u201cwill mean we have more capacity to respond to the pandemic as it evolves.\u201d  GM, which is working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems to produce the medical equipment, said it would ship more than 600 ventilators in April.  It added that it expected to fill nearly half the order by the end of June and the full order by the end of August. The ventilators will be produced at a plant in Kokomo, Indiana.  White House adviser Peter Navarro said that \u201cas these lifesaving ventilators roll off GM\u2019s assembly line as fast as tanks once did in an earlier World War, they will be rapidly deployed.\u201d  GM\u2019s shares closed flat. The stock has fallen more than 37% this year, as coronavirus-related lockdowns weigh on automobile sales.","704":"(Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N on Wednesday said if the U.S. economy continues to recover from the coronavirus pandemic and the auto industry does not experience any further production shutdowns, the No. 1 U.S. automaker should be able to generate enough cash to pay off a $16 billion loan by the end of the year.

REUTERS\/Rebecca Cook  \u201cObviously, it is still a very fluid situation as you know and we\u2019re watching the virus, the economy and its impact on the overall industry very closely,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara told reporters.  She spoke after GM posted a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss thanks to solid high-margin pickup truck sales and aggressive cost-cutting that helped mitigate the impact of a forced shutdown that left its North American plants shut for eight of the 13 weeks in the quarter.  After initially rising, GM\u2019s shares were off 1.7% in early afternoon trading.  \u201cWe maintain a sell (rating) following the stock\u2019s sharp rebound, not expecting GM\u2019s vehicle sales to return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon and consider its new model pipeline as relatively unexciting compared to peers,\u201d CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said in a research note.  If the recovery continues, GM expects adjusted operating earnings in the second half of the year in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion, with the third quarter slightly stronger than the fourth quarter, Suryadevara told analysts on a later call. She said in that scenario GM should generate cash flow of between $7 billion and $9 billion during the second half.  Analysts were expecting second-half operating earnings of more than $4.4 billion.  Suryadevara also said GM should repay its $16 billion revolving credit line by the end of 2020, an action that again depends on a continued economic recovery and annual industry-wide U.S. new vehicle sales of 14 million units this year.  But spiking COVID-19 cases across Southern and Southwestern U.S. states have left that recovery in doubt.  Weekly jobless claims numbers from the Labor Department released last week showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose, unexpectedly, for the first time in nearly four months, suggesting the labor market was stalling amid the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and depressed demand.  Asked whether spiking COVID-19 infection rates were hurting demand anywhere, Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts GM was \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d citing improving China and U.S. sales.  GM said it was \u201cworking all avenues\u201d to boost U.S. dealer inventories and all of its U.S. full-size pickup truck and full-size SUV plants are back at three shifts. Nearly all of its other plants are now working at pre-pandemic shift levels.  GM also said it would increase production of light-duty full-size pickups at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, assembly plant by about 1,000 units a month beginning Sept. 1.  GM reported a net loss for the quarter of $758 million, or 56 cents per share, down from a profit of $2.4 billion, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the loss was $806 million.  Excluding onetime items, GM reported a loss of 50 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.77 per share.","705":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Thursday it will invest more than $100 million in two facilities as it prepares to build production versions of its Cruise self-driving car next year at its Orion Township assembly plant in Michigan.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The largest U.S. automaker also said roof modules for GM\u2019s self-driving vehicles will be assembled at its Brownstown Battery Assembly plant.  In January, GM filed a petition seeking U.S. government approval for a fully autonomous car - one without a steering wheel, brake pedal or accelerator pedal - to enter the automaker\u2019s first commercial ride-sharing fleet in 2019.  The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has been reviewing the petition for more than two months and has not yet deemed it \u201ccomplete\u201d - a step before it releases details of the proposal. A final decision might not come until later this year or 2019.  GM Chief Executive Mary Barra met with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Tuesday and discussed the company\u2019s self-driving car efforts, the company said.  GM is part of a growing throng of vehicle manufacturers, technology companies and tech startups seeking to develop so-called robo-taxis over the next three years in North America, Europe and Asia. Most of those companies have one or more partners.  NHTSA said in January that GM had petitioned for approval to operate up to 2,500 vehicles without steering wheels or human drivers.  Other companies, from Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] to Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo, have been testing self-driving vehicle prototypes in limited ride sharing applications, but have been less explicit than GM in announcing plans for commercial robo-taxi services.  GM said earlier the automaker had asked NHTSA to allow 16 alterations to existing vehicle safety rules - such as having an airbag in what would normally be the driver\u2019s seat, but without a steering wheel - to enable the deployment of the Cruise AV.  The automaker would then need to obtain similar approval from individual U.S. states.  GM executives have said seven U.S. states already allow the alterations sought by the automaker. In other states - including those that stipulate a car must have a licensed human driver - GM will work with regulators to change or get a waiver from existing rules.","706":"FILE PHOTO - Jami Miscik, President and Vice Chairman, Kissinger Associates Inc. and former Deputy Director for Intelligence, CIA, pumps her fists as she takes part in the panel discussion \"Global Risk\" at the 2011 The Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California May 3, 2011.
