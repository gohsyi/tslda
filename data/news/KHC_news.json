The unit, which makes Oscar Mayer bacon and Velveeta cheese, is Kraft Heinz\u2019s biggest contributor to sales.  Abrams-Rivera, 52, has previously worked at Kraft Heinz and Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O and will start his new role at Kraft Heinz on Feb. 3. Most recently, Abrams-Rivera managed Campbell's snacks division.  Kraft Heinz will share details about Abrams-Rivera\u2019s U.S. strategy in the first quarter, Patricio said in an interview.  He said the company plans to invest more in media - which includes advertising, brand development and packaging - but declined to say how much it would spend this year.  Analysts and investors have criticized Kraft Heinz for underinvesting in branding, advertising and innovation at a time when grocers like Walmart WMT.N and Kroger KR.N are aggressively making cheaper own-brand products similar to those made by Kraft Heinz.  Over the past year, Kraft Heinz has withdrawn its full-year outlook, written down the value of several key brands and assets by more than $15 billion, and struggled to overcome competition from retailers\u2019 private-label brands.  It also disclosed in February that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over an investigation into its accounting practices.  Aiming to revitalize Kraft Heinz, Patricio, a veteran marketing executive, was brought in from Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR. Since Patricio's move was announced in April, Kraft Heinz's Chief Marketing Officer Eduardo Luz has stepped down and is yet to be replaced.

Shares of Kraft Heinz, whose products include Philadelphia cream cheese and Planters peanuts, were down 7% at $27.93 on Thursday afternoon.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s sales have been muted for 14 straight quarters as consumers turn to cheaper private-label brands, online shopping and fashionable, non-processed and organic food. Thursday\u2019s results mark the one-year anniversary of Kraft Heinz reporting a surprise loss and taking a $15.4 billion writedown of key brands - a move that rocked the consumer goods industry and led to the ousting of former chief executive Bernardo Hees and several other executives.  At the time, the company also slashed its dividend by 36% and disclosed an investigation into its accounting practices by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company still believes in ZBB, and will continue to cut costs but will focus more on efficiency, Patricio told Reuters in an interview. Under his management, very few employees will now have all their targets based on reducing costs.  The company said on a post-earnings call that currency fluctuations, divestitures, supply chain costs and bonuses related to the turnaround would likely lead to a decline of about $460 million in full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).  \u201cWe see this as a good sign that the incoming CEO is taking the necessary steps to stabilize the business rather than rearranging the deck chairs,\u201d Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said.  The company, which also makes Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Kraft cheese slices, said fourth-quarter sales declined 5.1% due to lower U.S. demand for cheese, coffee, bacon and other products. The company said this was prompted by higher costs for key raw materials - including dairy and meat - that forced Kraft Heinz to raise U.S. prices by 3.1 percentage points.  \u201cWe have never seen such big volatility in meat, specifically in pork, as we are seeing now,\u201d Patricio said. Most of the world\u2019s pork is consumed by China, which accounts for 2% of Kraft Heinz\u2019s sales.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with consumption in China - nobody knows because right now, the restaurants are closed.\u201d  Kraft Heinz took a $453 million charge in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 28 due to lower goodwill in businesses in Australia, New Zealand and Latin America. It also wrote down the value of its Maxwell House brand by about $213 million.

The lawsuit was filed by wheat futures and options traders who accused Kraft and Mondelez of illegally manipulating the grain\u2019s price at their expense.  The complaint alleged the companies had no intention of sourcing wheat from the futures market and the $90 million of wheat futures at issue exceeded their actual sourcing needs.

Complan, along with GlaxoSmithKline's GSK.L health drinks brands Horlicks, was very popular until about a decade ago, when consumers used these products for supplemental nutrition along with milk.  Their popularity has since waned, with sales growth slipping, as consumers grew wary of the sugar content in these products and the health claims made by these brands.  \u201cThe sale of this niche business fits into our overall global growth strategy and our focus on investing in and growing brands within our core categories,\u201d Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Bernardo Hees said in a statement.

The deal value includes net working capital of 400 million rupees and cash of 150 million rupees, but does not assume any debt, Zydus said here in a statement on Wednesday.

Shares fell to a record low as the Chicago-based company marked a 12th straight quarter of lackluster sales.  Kraft Heinz, which counts billionaire Warren Buffett as its largest investor, has been battered by competition from private-label brands, changing consumer tastes and lower investment in its brands due to heavy cost-cutting under leaders installed by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.  The earnings report, delayed by an internal investigation into accounting practices at Kraft Heinz\u2019s procurement team, underscored these issues and pushed shares down by more than 15%.  \u201cSome may say that it\u2019s not a disaster and thus better than feared \u2013 we\u2019re not yet in that camp,\u201d J.P.Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.

REUTERS\/Scott Morgan\/File Photo  Retailers from Walmart Inc WMT.N and Kroger Co KR.N to Amazon.com AMZN.O have ramped up investment in store-brand products in recent years, eating into sales at major packaged goods companies and forcing them to revamp products.  Warren Buffett - who teamed up in 2015 with 3G Capital to orchestrate the merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz Co - said in February that pressure from retailers' store brand products had changed Kraft Heinz's ability to price, adding that Costco Wholesale Corp's COST.O Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products. Buffett said at the time that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N had overpaid in the deal.  \u2018SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE\u2019  3G, Kraft Heinz\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, has used its so-called zero-based budgeting cost-strategy successfully at holdings including Heinz and Anheuser-Busch. The controversial budgeting tool requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use the prior year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.  But this approach resulted in smaller marketing budgets for key brands like Oscar Mayer bacon and the loss of brand managers and market share, according to former Kraft Heinz marketing employees.  Kraft Heinz needs to pivot from cost-cutting and instead focus on efficiency and a stronger balance sheet, the company's new CEO Miguel Patricio said on a call to discuss earnings. Patricio, a 30-year marketing veteran from Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR, was named to the role in April. \"Setting short-term targets publicly won't be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities.\"  Kraft Heinz said it was withdrawing its previously announced full-year outlook of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion. The company also said net income halved in the first six months of the year.  The company took a charge of about $744 million on its U.S. refrigerated, Latin American exports and Brazil units among others, blaming lower five-year operating forecasts. It also booked an impairment charge of about $474 million in the second quarter to write down the value of six brands, including Velveeta and Cool Whip. The impairment charges are preliminary and subject to finalization of control procedures, it said.  This marks Kraft Heinz\u2019s second major writedown since Feb. 21, when the company knocked $15.4 billion off the value of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, posted a surprise quarterly loss, and disclosed a U.S. Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting practices.  After an internal review, Kraft Heinz said in May it had increased the initial brand writedown by about $13 million due to misstatements in reports for 2016, 2017 and the first nine months of 2018. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois is working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate this matter.  Net income attributable to the company\u2019s shareholders fell more than 51% to $854 million, or 70 cents per share. Excluding items, the Chicago-based company earned $1.44 per share. Kraft Heinz said net sales fell about 5% to $12.37 billion. The company, whose shares have lost a third of their value since February, said it expects better second-half sales and earnings growth.","12":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co's KHC.O quarterly profit beat expectations as the Tater Tots-maker benefited from tax changes in the United States and raised prices to counter higher input costs, sending shares up 4 percent after the bell.

Kraft Heinz, whose brands include Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup, said it raised prices in the United States and in other parts of the world, driving overall pricing up by 1 percentage point. Pricing was positive for the third straight quarter.  Net income rose 11.1 percent to $993 million, or 81 cents per share, primarily reflecting benefits from the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in over 30 years, which slashed the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.  Excluding items, earnings were 89 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 82 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Net sales slipped 0.3 percent to $6.30 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 as weakening demand for processed foods in the United States more than offset growth in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

To prove to investors that it can grow through innovation, Kraft Heinz has been investing in e-commerce and food and beverage startups, joining a growing list of U.S. food companies looking at new ways to spur growth. Finance chief David Knopf said the rise in first-quarter pricing also helped make up for higher expenses from the company\u2019s aggressive commercial investment plans.  Changing consumer habits and retail industry woes due to online competition are some of the hurdles to Kraft Heinz making an acquisition, Weissman added.","13":"PARIS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Kraft Heinz shares reached their zenith two years ago, the day Unilever rejected an unwanted takeover approach from the aggressive maker of ketchup and processed cheese.

Is the role of the company, as the monetarist Milton Friedman argued decades ago, solely to produce profit, and pay dividends, to shareholders? Or must it consider other constituents, like workers, the communities in which it operates and the environment \u2013 as well as stock owners?  The divergent fortunes of Kraft and Unilever since their dalliance would suggest the Friedman view embraced by Kraft\u2019s top owners is outdated, and the more expansive one, which undergirded Unilever\u2019s lightning defense against Kraft\u2019s bid, is ascendant. But in that brief interlude when Unilever was forced to weigh all its strategic options, one that emerged is what investment bankers call a \u201cPac-Man defense,\u201d where a takeover target flips the script and bids for its would-be acquirer.  Chicago-based Kraft is a shell of its former financial self. The rent-seeking, dividend-paying model of its overlords at Brazilian investment group 3G, with an assist from Warren Buffett\u2019s investment company Berkshire Hathaway, appears to be in tatters. What better way for Unilever to show the world that its more inclusive form of capitalism is dominant than to pounce on Kraft, revive the business and make a fortune for shareholders all at once?  Unilever can afford to swallow the much-diminished Kraft, led by 3G partner Bernardo Hees. In a straight takeover, rather than a merger like the one Kraft sort-of proposed two years ago, Unilever would also be in a prime position to call the shots, and export its culture and management approach \u2013 one where growth is not sacrificed at the altar of cost savings. Nonetheless, there would be copious synergies to harvest from combining overlapping functions, from corporate overheads to global procurement.  Consider the arithmetic of a hypothetical Unilever bid mimicking Kraft\u2019s from two years ago. At a 20 percent premium to current market prices, a bit more than the markup Kraft offered, a deal would cost Unilever about $48 billion. At the same ratio of cash and stock as Kraft had proposed, that would leave Unilever needing to hustle up $29 billion in cash. That would take the debt load of the combined group close to a punchy $80 billion, or more than four times EBITDA for this year, according to I\/B\/E\/S estimates from Refinitiv. But with as much as $4 billion worth of cost savings potentially achievable, the ratio might drop to below 3.5 times EBITDA.  And there are other ways to reduce indebtedness. Buffett might be persuaded to take only equity. Perhaps even 3G could do the same. Together they own 49 percent of Kraft. That would bring debt to well below three times EBITDA. And then there are potential disposals of parts of Kraft. Unilever, for instance, might want to focus on its Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise and jettison Kraft\u2019s Miracle Whip. Or it might sell its Maille brand of Dijon mustard to focus on Kraft\u2019s Grey Poupon, and so on and so forth.  Which gets to the reason Unilever would probably decide against a bid: Kraft\u2019s portfolio. Many Kraft brands \u2013 think Velveeta, Oscar Mayer and Jell-O - give off a bouquet of flavor attributes that might best be described as over-processed, under-nourishing and ultra-long shelf-life. Revenue excluding rebates and returns at Kraft rose just 0.8 percent in 2018.  Unilever has some more appealing food brands, for sure, like Ben & Jerry\u2019s and Magnum ice creams. And its consolidated underlying sales growth, adjusted for the divestiture of its margarine-spreads business, came to 3.1 percent for 2018. But the victuals line\u2019s growth, at 2 percent, lagged beauty and personal care, at 3.1 percent; and home care, which grew 4.2 percent. Even if Unilever could get Kraft\u2019s food businesses to grow at the same rate as its own, a deal would drag down the overall top line. All of which raises the question of why Unilever is in the edibles business at all.  That\u2019s a matter the company\u2019s new chief executive, Alan Jope, will need to address when he takes over at May\u2019s annual meeting. While the Scotsman looks as if he might enjoy a Magnum or two, he ascends to the top job after running the bigger arm that includes Dove soap and Axe body wash. Snagging Kraft, while it\u2019s cheap, might make a nice prelude to splitting the whole food complex off down the road.","14":"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O has agreed to sell a portfolio of its Indian businesses, including children's drink brand Complan, to Indian drugmaker Zydus Wellness Ltd, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing sources.

Patricio, a 52-year-old Portuguese native who will take over the helm of the world\u2019s fifth biggest food company from July 1, said he plans to focus more on efficiency, investing in brands and growing sales organically at a company that has been reeling from a $15.4 billion writedown on some of its brands.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s focus on cost-cutting and interest in scoring a big acquisition have been key to the company\u2019s strategy under management installed by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital. 3G, along with Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, forged the $49 billion merger of Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz in 2015.  \u201cI think the obsession for efficiency has to be much bigger than the obsession for cutting costs,\u201d Patricio, 52, told Reuters on Monday.  \u201cCost cutting should be a priority for any company. However, you cannot cut costs every year,\u201d said Patricio, who most recently was the global head of marketing for brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s. He previously worked at Philip Morris, Coca-Cola Co and Johnson & Johnson.  3G Capital, which is Kraft Heinz\u2019s second largest shareholder, behind Berkshire Hathaway, with a 22.15 percent stake, is known for scoring large M&A deals and using a controversial cost-cutting tool called zero-based budgeting to keep profit margins high.  Zero-based budgeting requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use the prior year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s outgoing CEO, Bernardo Hees, a 3G partner, told Reuters in September that he was considering M&A to fuel growth.  Asked on Monday if Kraft Heinz was still considering big acquisitions, Patricio said he was sure the company would do so one day, but that his focus, for now, was on growing existing brands.  \u201cAt this moment, I\u2019m really focused on the organic part of it. I think we can - and we need \u2013 to get organic growth and I\u2019m going to put a lot of my time figuring that out.\u201d  INVESTORS WANT PROOF  The announcement comes two months after Kraft Heinz took the massive writedown on some of its brands, cut its dividend and disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into accounting practices at its procurement unit. Intense competition from private-label brands, changing consumer habits and pressure from retailers to lower prices has sent the food industry reeling in recent years.  \u201cGiven what\u2019s happened at Kraft Heinz in the past several months, that 3G model has come into question,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. \u201cI think they realize they cut a little too far.  \u201cAnd to Patricio\u2019s point, it may now be about investing where you need to while maintaining cost discipline. Investors want to see proof that can grow sales.\u201d Weissman said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear they\u2019re not thinking about an imminent acquisition. From a balance sheet perspective, they\u2019re not there yet.\u201d  3G did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Under Hees, Kraft Heinz lost half its market value, as it ceded market share to competitors and failed to snap up Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever Plc in a proposed $143-billion merger. At the time, Unilever cited concerns about Kraft Heinz\u2019s culture.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s cost-focused strategy also gave way to a high-pressure, anxious environment, according to four former Kraft Heinz employees who worked at the company\u2019s Chicago headquarters and two former employees from Europe.  The deep cuts and layoffs also ate away at advertising budgets and decades of industry experience, said two sources who worked at Kraft Heinz\u2019s marketing department.  \u201c3G are known for being ruthless and brutal when it comes to cost and what does that do to culture?\u201d Edward Jones\u2019 Weissman said. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to see how much flexibility Patricio will have to change the culture or improve processes at the company. Can he get those brands back to growth? That\u2019s probably going to take a lot of investment.\u201d  Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a pillar of the Kraft Heinz culture, spokesman Michael Mullen said, noting that cost savings help the company increase support for its brands, drive innovation, and invest in top-tier talent.  \u201cIn 2018, and again this year, savings from ZBB allow us to invest in new capabilities, emerging channels, and new product platforms for top-line growth,\u201d Mullen said.  Industry analysts have raised concerns that Kraft Heinz was pricing its brands too high at a time when private-label brands from Walmart, Aldi and Kroger were gaining popularity. Kraft Heinz\u2019s ketchups, sliced cheeses and hot dogs were some of the first products these retailers sought to replicate at a lower price.  Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns 26.7 percent of Kraft Heinz, highlighted the pressure from retailers in February, saying Costco Wholesale Corp\u2019s Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products.  \u201cThese next two months, I\u2019m going to dedicate fully to knowing the people (at Kraft Heinz), to build on culture, to agree or tweak the long-term strategy of the company, and to know the financials behind the business in detail. These are the four big things I want to do,\u201d Patricio told Reuters.  \u201cI bring diversity of thought to the team. My background is very different from the background of the other team members. And I think that this is critical in any company.\u201d (Reporting by Richa Naidu in Chiago additional reporting by Martine Geller in London editing by Vanessa O\u2019Connell and Leslie Adler)","19":"(Reuters) - U.S. food companies Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O and Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O have been short-listed to participate in the second round of Campbell Soup Co's CPB.N auction of its international business, people familiar with the matter said.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The development boosts Campbell Soup\u2019s chances of divesting its international portfolio, which includes its Australian cookie brand Arnott\u2019s and Danish baked snacks maker Kelsen Group, with one deal, two sources said on Sunday.  Both Kraft Heinz and Mondelez are interested in the assets so they can expand their global footprint. Based on the first-round bids received, Campbell Soup could fetch close to $3 billion for its international business, the sources added.  Private equity firms Bain Capital LP, KKR & Co Inc KKR.N and FinTrek Capital Hong Kong Co Ltd also made the shortlist to participate in the second round of the auction for Campbell Soup's international business, according to the sources.  Nutella maker Ferrero SpA, which had previously also expressed interest in the assets, is currently in talks with Campbell Soup over whether it will remain involved in the auction process, the sources added.  Campbell Soup could wrap up the auction for its international business in the first quarter of 2019, the sources said, asking not to be identified because details of the process are confidential.  Campbell Soup, Kraft Heinz, Mondelez, Ferrero, Bain, KKR and FinTrek Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Under pressure from investors to boost its profitability and stock performance, Campbell Soup announced in August it would make preparations to divest its international portfolio as well as its \u201cfresh\u201d business, which includes Bolthouse Farms and Garden Fresh Gourmet.  This will allow it to reduce its $8 billion debt pile and focus on its core North American market, as well as its snacks, meals and beverages businesses. Most of the debt weighing on Campbell Soup is the legacy of its $6.1 billion acquisition in March of snack maker Snyder\u2019s-Lance Inc.  Last Thursday, Campbell Soup named Mark Clouse, the former CEO of Pinnacle Foods, as its new chief executive, in another key step in the company\u2019s efforts to regain market share and boost profits. The pick had the backing of Campbell Soup shareholder Third Point LLC.  In November, Campbell Soup settled a proxy contest against Third Point by agreeing to add two of the activist hedge fund\u2019s nominees to the food company\u2019s board, and giving the investor a say in selecting Campbell Soup\u2019s next CEO.","20":"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O has launched an incubator program for food and beverage startups, joining a growing list of U.S. food companies looking at new ways to spur growth as consumers shun processed packaged food in favor of healthier offerings.  Kraft said on Wednesday the platform, called Springboard, will focus on supporting and developing brands that make healthy, organic and experiential products, giving them access to the company\u2019s distribution and marketing expertise, research and development and consumer insights.  Smaller, independent brands are seen by many consumers, especially younger ones, to be more hip and healthy and rather than compete with them many big food and drink companies have looked to buy into and learn from startup innovation, a leaf straight out of Silicon Valley\u2019s playbook.  Other big U.S. food makers making similar forays into the startup world include Campbell Soup Co CPB.N, General Mills GIS.N and Kellog Co K.N.  As part of the program, Springboard will review applications from \u201cdisruptive\u201d food and beverage startups, which will then receive financial support to build their brands and guidance to raise additional funding, Kraft Heinz said.  Investors were positive about the new venture, but said the platform may not be enough to drive long-term sales growth for Kraft Heinz, which has a market value of about $82.6 billion.  \u201cIt will take time to effect change at a company this size, and the Springboard initiative itself will not be sufficient. Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction,\u201d Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group, told Reuters. Roosevelt Investment owns Kraft Heinz\u2019s shares worth $9.8 million.  Kraft Heinz's move comes a year after Kraft Heinz walked away from a $143 billion bid for Unilever ULVR.L after the European consumer goods behemoth dismissed the offer as having no financial or strategic merit.","21":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tater tots maker Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O missed quarterly earnings estimates, sending its shares down more than 7 percent, as steep commodity costs, other expenses and pricing promotions overshadowed higher-than-expected sales.

Hees said U.S. cost inflation in the third quarter had been greater than expected, and that Kraft Heinz had delayed some supply chain projects that would have cut expenses. The company also decided to invest in customer service to boost sales volumes, he said.  Chief Financial Officer David Knopf said the company expects profitability to improve \u201csignificantly\u201d beginning with the current quarter, with growth continuing into the first half of next year.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s stock, which has declined 27 percent in the past year, was down 7.5 percent at $52 in extended trading.  \u201cThe big surprise was the EBITDA miss,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said. \u201cWhile sales were decent, we were disappointed by the decline in profitability.\u201d  Excluding items, the Chicago-based company, which owns the Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup brands, earned 78 cents a share, falling 3 cents short of analysts\u2019 average expectations, according to data from Refinitiv IBES.  Net sales rose 1.6 percent to $6.38 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of about $6.31 billion.  Kraft Heinz said pricing fell 0.9 of a percentage point during the third quarter, a disappointing reversal from the higher prices the company reported in the first half of the year.  Pricing in the third quarter was weighed down by the U.S. business, as the company passed along lower prices for some commodities, including bacon. Pork belly prices were down during the period as China, the world\u2019s biggest pork consumer, was importing less from the United States over trade tensions.  The company also increased promotions on some of its products, including natural cheese and ready-to-drink beverages.  Big food makers have been spending more on promotions and discounts this year, hoping to win back consumers who are increasingly turning to fresh, trendier brands.  Kellogg Co K.N cut its full-year profit outlook on Wednesday due to higher spending on advertising, sending shares of the Corn Flakes maker tumbling 9 percent.

Shares fell to a record low as the Chicago-based company marked a 12th straight quarter of lackluster sales. Kraft Heinz, which counts billionaire Warren Buffett as its largest investor, has been battered by competition from private-label brands, changing consumer tastes and lower investment in its brands due to heavy cost-cutting under leaders installed by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.  The earnings report, delayed by an internal investigation into accounting practices at Kraft Heinz\u2019s procurement team, underscored these issues and pushed shares down by more than 15%.  \u201cSome may say that it\u2019s not a disaster and thus better than feared \u2013 we\u2019re not yet in that camp,\u201d J.P.Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s struggles have rocked other major consumer goods companies this year, highlighting the industry\u2019s struggle to cut costs without gutting marketing budgets amid soaring input and transportation costs.  \u201cOn the whole, we are dissatisfied with our financial performance year-to-date,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer David Knopf, a 3G Capital partner who was named to the role in 2017 when he was 29 years old. Knopf called Kraft Heinz\u2019s earnings decline \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d and said sales were held back as U.S. and Canadian retailers cut inventory.  Retailers from Walmart Inc and Kroger Co to Amazon.com have ramped up investment in store-brand products in recent years, eating into sales at major packaged goods companies and forcing them to revamp products.  Warren Buffett - who teamed up in 2015 with 3G Capital to orchestrate the merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz Co - said in February that pressure from retailers\u2019 store brand products had changed Kraft Heinz\u2019s ability to price, adding that Costco Wholesale Corp\u2019s Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products. Buffett said at the time that his Berkshire Hathaway Inc had overpaid in the deal.  \u2018SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE\u2019  3G, Kraft Heinz\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, has used its so-called zero-based budgeting cost-strategy successfully at holdings including Heinz and Anheuser-Busch. The controversial budgeting tool requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use the prior year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.  But this approach resulted in smaller marketing budgets for key brands like Oscar Mayer bacon and the loss of brand managers and market share, according to former Kraft Heinz marketing employees.  Kraft Heinz needs to pivot from cost-cutting and instead focus on efficiency and a stronger balance sheet, the company\u2019s new CEO Miguel Patricio said on a call to discuss earnings. Patricio, a 30-year marketing veteran from Anheuser-Busch InBev , was named to the role in April. \u201cSetting short-term targets publicly won\u2019t be productive as we set and work to deliver against our strategic directions and priorities.\u201d  Kraft Heinz said it was withdrawing its previously announced full-year outlook of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion. The company also said net income halved in the first six months of the year.  The company took a charge of about $744 million on its U.S. refrigerated, Latin American exports and Brazil units among others, blaming lower five-year operating forecasts. It also booked an impairment charge of about $474 million in the second quarter to write down the value of six brands, including Velveeta and Cool Whip. The impairment charges are preliminary and subject to finalization of control procedures, it said.  This marks Kraft Heinz\u2019s second major writedown since Feb. 21, when the company knocked $15.4 billion off the value of its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, posted a surprise quarterly loss, and disclosed a U.S. Security and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting practices.  After an internal review, Kraft Heinz said in May it had increased the initial brand writedown by about $13 million due to misstatements in reports for 2016, 2017 and the first nine months of 2018. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois is working with the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate this matter.  Net income attributable to the company\u2019s shareholders fell more than 51% to $854 million, or 70 cents per share. Excluding items, the Chicago-based company earned $1.44 per share. Kraft Heinz said net sales fell about 5% to $12.37 billion. The company, whose shares have lost a third of their value since February, said it expects better second-half sales and earnings growth.

That\u2019s probably going to take a lot of investment.\u201d  Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a pillar of the Kraft Heinz culture, spokesman Michael Mullen said, noting that cost savings help the company increase support for its brands, drive innovation, and invest in top-tier talent.  \u201cIn 2018, and again this year, savings from ZBB allow us to invest in new capabilities, emerging channels, and new product platforms for top-line growth,\u201d Mullen said.  Industry analysts have raised concerns that Kraft Heinz was pricing its brands too high at a time when private-label brands from Walmart, Aldi and Kroger were gaining popularity. Kraft Heinz\u2019s ketchups, sliced cheeses and hot dogs were some of the first products these retailers sought to replicate at a lower price.  Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns 26.7 percent of Kraft Heinz, highlighted the pressure from retailers in February, saying Costco Wholesale Corp\u2019s Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products.  \u201cThese next two months, I\u2019m going to dedicate fully to knowing the people (at Kraft Heinz), to build on culture, to agree or tweak the long-term strategy of the company, and to know the financials behind the business in detail. These are the four big things I want to do,\u201d Patricio told Reuters.  \u201cI bring diversity of thought to the team.

FILE PHOTO: Tins of Heinz Baked Beans rest on a palette in the company's factory in Wigan, northern England, May 21, 2009. REUTERS\/Phil Noble  Velveeta-cheese maker Kraft Heinz saw its e-commerce sales double in 2020, now representing more than 5% of its global sales, Chief Executive Miguel Patricio said at the virtual Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference this week.  The company sells Heinz baked beans and tomato soup by subscription or in bundles directly to consumers on a \u201cHeinz To Home\u201d website in the United Kingdom, Australia and Europe.  Sales on the site are \u201cgiving us valuable insights into consumer behavior, enabling us to quickly test and learn from innovations,\u201d Kraft\u2019s head of international business, Rafael de Oliveira, said at the conference.  Kraft would continue to use the site as a channel to generate strong sales in developed markets, he said.  The company also counts sales of its products through marketplaces such as on Amazon.com and Walmart.com as part of its e-commerce sales.  U.S. shoppers spent on average $1,271 buying groceries online last year, 45% more than they did in 2019 as the pandemic spurred shopping online, according to market research firm Earnest Research. In contrast, the average dollars spent in stores rose only about 7% to $3,849.  PepsiCo sells products including Doritos, Quaker oats and Gatorade directly to consumers through two websites, pantryshop.com and snacks.com, both launched in 2020.  Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said that more than 45% of the company\u2019s capital investments over the next few years would be dedicated toward manufacturing capacity, automation, and a \u201cramping up of investments in our e-commerce channel.\u201d  As major online retailers including Amazon.com and Walmart.com continue to gather valuable data on shoppers, many packaged food manufacturers are keen to gather their own data on shoppers, too.  \u201cCOVID (has) simply accelerated our digital growth and has provided us with yet another source of data and insight,\u201d Monica McGurk, chief growth officer at breakfast cereal maker Kellogg Co., told the conference.  Kellogg, producer of Corn Flakes as well as Pringles chips, said on Wednesday it had launched a direct-to-consumer website focused on digestive wellness. The group plans to sell its new Mwell Microbiome Powder for gut health via the site to gather data on customer interest before it launches the product more widely.  E-commerce sales have doubled in the past year and now represent about 8.5% of the group\u2019s $13.77 billion in annual sales, Kellogg said.  Pillsbury dough-maker General Mills also sees the benefits of tracking consumer habits more closely.  \u201cWe\u2019re aggressively investing in data and analytics. We are gathering unparalleled insights from the first-party data we collect through our brand websites,\u201d General Mills\u2019 Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said at the conference.  On its Bettycrocker.com website, General Mills provides hundreds of recipes using Betty Crocker cake mixes and frosting. The site leads people to the closest store or an online retailer where they can purchase the products, thereby generating data for General Mills on what a particular customer from a certain zip code is buying. The company does not sell the food products directly on its website.  Consumers, however, may have to shell out more if they shop directly from brand websites.  Prices on the two PepsiCo sites, for example, were generally higher than those on Walmart.com or Amazon.com, Reuters checks show. On Walmart.com, for example, a 10 oz pack of Doritos Nacho Cheese was on sale for $2.50 compared to $4.29 on Pepsico\u2019s website.  Kraft Heinz offers tins of soup, beans, pasta and baby food bundled into packs ranging from six to 25 items and costing between 10 and 20 pounds ($14.01-$28.03) on its UK website. It told Reuters the relatively higher prices of items and bundling of packs than on some other online marketplaces was to be able to eke out a margin after including delivery costs.  \u201cLonger term, we see real value in this channel to be an insight and data channel for us,\u201d Jean-Philippe Nier, head of e-commerce for Kraft Heinz\u2019s business in the UK and Ireland, told Reuters. People are more prepared to order directly from manufacturers than they were before.

With people on lockdown cooking more at home \u2013 and still stockpiling in some parts of the world \u2013 prices for commodities like sugar, wheat and soy are surging, forcing food companies to absorb higher costs.  U.S. consumers on average paid 3.7% more for food consumed at home in January than they did a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index. Year-over-year increases in food prices have topped 3.5% each month since last April, the longest such stretch in nearly a decade.  \u201cWe have inflation, we are seeing inflation, we are concerned about inflation. We have to mitigate that inflation, or at least part of it, with hedges and with efficiencies in the factories,\u201d Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Miguel Patricio told Reuters in a recent interview. \u201cWill we have price increases in food this year? Maybe in some categories that are very exposed to specific commodities.\u201d  \u201cWhere we are seeing (inflation) is in grains and everything related to grains ... It\u2019s across the board. Sugar has big inflation; mac & cheese because it has wheat; mayo because it has oil; salad dressing because it has oil; all sweet products like desserts,\u201d Patricio said.  Kraft Heinz - which makes Jell-O, Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and a slew of Heinz mayonnaise products and salad dressings \u2013 said it did not increase prices in the most recent quarter, but did cut down on promotions and discounts.  Other major food companies, including Lipton tea and Hellmann\u2019s mayonnaise maker Unilever, have also signaled higher prices due to global commodity inflation.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got some inflationary pressures coming forward. And we do expect mid-to-high single-digit commodity inflation in the first half. So we have to be at the top of our game in pricing going forward,\u201d Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said on a recent earnings call.  The food producers are not the only U.S. manufacturers beginning to respond to sharply higher input costs - the highest in a decade in some national surveys - with price increases of their own. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve\u2019s monthly factory survey for January showed prices received by manufacturers for their goods rising by the most since 1989.  U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers, however, have downplayed any imminent inflation risk.

Kraft, which owns Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup brands, forecast adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion in 2019, lower than analysts\u2019 estimates of $7.47 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  On a post-earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees said the entire packaged foods industry will likely remain challenged, blaming the rising popularity of private label brands and higher commodity costs.  \u201cKraft Heinz is in a worse position than many other consumer packaged goods companies because it has got a very weak portfolio of brands. They are not delivering the level of growth that\u2019s needed in this sort of market,\u201d GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders said.  The company, which competes with General Mills Inc and Kellogg Co, cut its quarterly dividend to 40 cents per share from around 63 cents per share on Thursday.  Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Brazil\u2019s 3G Capital control Chicago-based Kraft Heinz.  In addition to lower-than-expected earnings, the company disclosed it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October, related to an investigation into its accounting policies, procedures and internal controls related to procurement.  The company said it was working on ways to improve its internal controls and determined the problems required it to record a $25 million increase to the cost of products sold.  \u201cThat has really made a bad set of results even worse because it has also thrown some uncertainty into the mix,\u201d Saunders said.  For the quarter ended Dec. 29, Kraft had a net loss of $12.6 billion. It earned 84 cents per share on an adjusted basis, missing Wall Street estimates of 94 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

He also said he has \u201cabsolutely no intention\u201d of adding to or subtracting from Berkshire\u2019s stake in Kraft Heinz, saying the company had \u201cvery, very strong\u201d brands and that he would be happy to own it a decade from now.  The comments were a rare admission of error by the 88-year-old billionaire on a major investment at his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.  Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013, and own about half of the merged company.  Buffett said he may have learned about the SEC probe seven to 10 days before it was announced.  Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman widely considered a candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire\u2019s chief executive officer, is a Kraft Heinz director.

Buffett acknowledged the changes, but said greater pressure is coming from retailers such as Amazon.com Inc, Walmart Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp, saying the latter\u2019s Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products.  Stronger brands can \u201cgo toe to toe with Walmart or Costco\u201d but weaker brands \u201ctend to lose out,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe ability to price has changed, and that\u2019s huge.\u201d  Still, Buffett added: \u201cIf I had to bet one way or another, I think people will eat more of our products this year than last year.\u201d  Berkshire\u2019s own $3 billion writedown related to Kraft Heinz contributed to a $25.39 billion fourth-quarter net loss for Berkshire.  \u201cHe monumentally overpaid for Kraft,\u201d said Doug Kass, founder of the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc. \u201cIncreasingly, the moats he initially saw in his investments have been damaged.\u201d  The bad news also called into question 3G\u2019s signature business model of zero-based budgeting, which requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use last year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s belt-tightening resulted in more than $1.7 billion in annual savings, including the loss of thousands of jobs, mirroring 3G\u2019s similar efforts at such companies as Anheuser-Busch InBev and Tim Hortons.  The strategy has resulted in leaner companies, but could backfire if the companies lacked products that people wanted, or failed to spend enough to develop and market those products.  Buffett said he did not believe 3G underinvested in Kraft Heinz, but it was hard for him to tell. Berkshire is not involved in day-to-day operations.","45":"Oct 29 (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co on Thursday beat analysts\u2019 estimates for quarterly revenue, as consumers cooking more at home bought more of its packaged foods and condiments.

The move put the spotlight on Kraft\u2019s slowing growth and the changing tastes of consumers, who have been shunning older, established brands for newer hipper products, cheaper private label brands and non-processed food.  Shares of rivals also fell, with General Mills, Conagra Brands Inc, Unilever and Nestle SA all down between 1 percent and 4 percent.  Kraft Heinz, controlled by Brazil\u2019s 3G Capital and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, has been combating higher transportation and commodity costs by tightening overall expenses. But that has come at a price.  \u201cInvestors for years have asked if 3G\u2019s extreme belt-tightening model ultimately would result in brand equity erosion,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said.  \u201cWe think the answer arguably came yesterday in the form of a $15 billion intangible asset write-down for the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands,\u201d said Goldman, who cut his rating to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight\u201d.  Kraft also hit investors with the announcement of a regulatory probe, a chop in its dividend and a quarterly loss on Thursday.  The shares tanked 20 percent in late trade and are set to open at a record low at the open.  H.J. Heinz merged with Kraft in 2015 in a deal engineered by 3G, and under its stewardship carried out extreme cost cuts that risked hurting the company\u2019s top line by stifling investment in innovation and marketing.  A year later, 3G was praised for making Kraft Heinz\u2019s operating margin the best amongst its peers, but that came at the cost of closing six factories and cutting 7,000 jobs in 18 months.  Analysts now doubt if 3G\u2019s model was effective, given that the company\u2019s margins before interest and taxes fell to 23.2 percent in 2018 from 27.2 percent in 2015.  \u201cKraft Heinz results confirmed all our worst fears \u2013 plus more,\u201d Guggenheim Partners\u2019 analyst Laurent Grandet said in a note.  Stifel downgraded the stock to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d and more than halved its price target to $35, well below the current median target of $52.  Credit Suisse cut its price target by $9 to $33, making it the lowest on Wall Street.  \u201cThis is not your typical \u201creset the base and everything will be fine\u201d story,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote.  \u201cThe dividend cut, the $15.8 billion write-down of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks, and the guidance for further divestitures demonstrate the hallmarks of a company that has a serious balance sheet problem,\u201d Moskow said.

Basilio had been Heinz\u2019s finance chief when it merged with Kraft in 2015 and remained in the role in the unified company until October 2017, when Kraft Heinz\u2019s second largest shareholder 3G Capital persuaded the board to embark on changes centering around heavy cost-cutting.  Under 31-year old Knopf, who would return to his role as a partner at 3G Capital, Kraft Heinz has this year written down $15.4 billion in the value of two marquee brands, slashed dividends and withdrawn its financial outlook.  The change is the first big move by new CEO Miguel Patricio since the Portuguese marketing veteran was brought in from Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR in April with the aim of rebooting Kraft Heinz.  The packaged food company, which counts billionaire Warren Buffett as its largest investor, has been battered by competition from private-label brands, changing consumer tastes and lower investment in its brands.

This has freed up enough people for Kraft Heinz to create a third shift in many factories, up from two, Patricio said.  Patricio said sales of Mac & Cheese, Oscar Mayer cold cuts and Planters nuts have increased, and that people are also buying more Heinz vinegar to use as an alternative to cleaning products.  \u201cWe\u2019re breaking production records every day,\u201d Patricio said, adding that a Davenport, Iowa-based Oscar Mayer plant he visited yesterday had increased weekly capacity by 40% compared with the same week last month.

(Reuters) - Mounting troubles at Kraft Heinz, revealed late on Thursday with a triple-punch of bad news, call into question its reliance on cost-cutting as a way to generate profit growth.  FILE PHOTO: Heinz tomato Ketchup is show on display during a preview of a new Walmart Super Center prior to its opening in Compton, California, U.S., January 10, 2017. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Shares of Kraft Heinz fell 27 percent on Friday to their lowest level since the 2015 merger of the eponymous cheese and ketchup makers that formed the world\u2019s fifth-largest food and drinks company.  Late on Thursday, it revealed a $15.4 billion write-down tied to its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, slashed its dividend by about a third and disclosed an SEC investigation of its procurement accounting practices.  The news validated investors\u2019 concerns about the health of the company\u2019s brands and its pricing power in an environment of rising commodity and transportation costs and more competition.  Half of the group\u2019s market value vanished over the last two years even before Friday, dampening enthusiasm for its backers, private equity firm 3G Capital, and its notorious embrace of a tool called zero-based budgeting (ZBB), used to keep costs low and profit margins high.  \u201cAt some point, having best-in-class margins doesn\u2019t matter if the sales growth doesn\u2019t eventually come,\u201d said Guggenheim analyst Laurent Grandet.  A Kraft Heinz spokesman said the company\u2019s ZBB efforts continued to drive savings that can be invested in growing the business.  \u201cIn 2019, we will increase brand support, go-to-market with a more innovation than ever and invest in talent\u2026 and this will be partially funded by ZBB savings,\u201d spokesman Michael Mullen said. 3G could not immediately be reached for comment.  ZBB FIT FOR EVERYONE?  Zero-based budgeting is an approach requiring corporate managers to justify each item of spending every year, or even build their budgets from scratch, rather than the more common process of using the prior year\u2019s budget as a starting point.  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter wanted to apply it to federal spending, but it never took off and was abandoned.  It came back into fashion among corporations over the last decade, after 3G Capital used it to great margin effect at brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose creation it orchestrated, and then at Kraft Heinz.  Both clocked industry-leading profit margins, and that led more consumer companies to adopt it in recent years as investors\u2019 focus shifted to profits from sales, which were slowing amid a slowdown in once-hot emerging markets, new competition from independent challenger brands and weak pricing power due to e-commerce and discounters like Aldi and Lidl.  At the same time, high-profile activist investors set their sights on the sector, prompting many CEOs to squeeze out costs.  \u201cThe cuts can be impressive, and that\u2019s a big win,\u201d said consultants BCG in a report from 2017. They noted, however, that faster growth was not a guaranteed result. \u201cWhen it\u2019s applied clumsily, ZBB can have a demoralizing impact that distracts the organization from growth and value creation.\u201d  Kraft on Thursday missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates and forecast a decline in operating earnings for 2019.  \u201cKHC\u2019s EBITDA has not grown over the last five years, its revenue has declined, and its balance sheet has ballooned,\u201d said analysts at JP Morgan. \u201cThis is not an ideal progression of financial metrics.\u201d  Unilever, Mondelez International, Diageo and Kellogg are among companies that have used ZBB, though none has seen as bad results as Kraft\u2019s.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a black eye for Kraft Heinz management for not implementing it in as a sophisticated way as might be necessary, or maybe they just implemented it too hard, too fast,\u201d Investec analyst Eddy Hargreaves said. \u201cI don\u2019t think ZBB per se is the problem.\u201d  Others said it was not just cost-cuts that led to the write-down of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands.  \u201cAre these the kinds of things people are buying these days? Are they fresh? Novel? Healthy? They don\u2019t tick any of the boxes,\u201d said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt.  The head of investment at a European consulting firm said ZBB was not the answer for problems ailing Kraft and its packaged food peers, which are suffering as consumers eschew traditional staples like macaroni-and-cheese and bologna for fresher, less-processed or healthier options.  \u201cTo catch up with the shift of consumer demand for better-for-you and sustainable food, you have to innovate.

REUTERS\/Adrees Latif  At the Kraft Heinz annual meeting to be held in Pittsburgh on Thursday, shareholders will vote on a proposal asking the company to reveal its long-term strategy for imitation meat and alternative proteins.  Products by rivals Beyond Meat Inc BYND.O and Impossible Foods have become the hottest food trend in recent years, gaining popularity among mainstream consumers looking to cut back on meat consumption.  \u201cIt\u2019s a fast-growing market and they\u2019ve been really silent with investors on how they plan to tackle that,\u201d said Kyle Kempf, a spokesman for Green Century Funds, which proposed the proxy vote and owns a more than $460,000 stake in Kraft Heinz.  Kraft Heinz has been ranked one of the least proactive major food makers in the plant-based protein market, according to FAIRR, a major investor coalition that includes several Kraft Heinz shareholders. The company\u2019s main meat-alternative brand, 40-year-old BOCA Burger, has lost market share since 2013.  \u201cAny company ranking at the bottom clearly has some catching up to do,\u201d said Peter van der Werf, head of responsible investment management at Robeco, which owns an $9.6 million stake in Kraft Heinz.

Neither company would disclose whether they will vote for the proposal, which Kraft Heinz\u2019s board of directors has recommended rejecting.  Kraft Heinz, which took a $15.4 billion writedown this year on its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands, has been criticized for spending too little on innovation and marketing after years of cost cuts under managers from 3G Capital, Kraft Heinz\u2019s No. 2 shareholder. Since the writedown, the company\u2019s shares have fallen about 40%.  BOCA LOSES SIZZLE  BOCA Burger, credited by some as the original U.S. veggie burger for the masses, was bought by the then-Kraft Foods in 2000. One problem for the aging BOCA Burger, however, is that the current alternative-meat craze is actually being driven not by vegetarians, but by so-called flexitarians - meat-eaters who occasionally buy alternative-protein products. To appeal to these shoppers, Beyond Meat and other upstarts are convincing grocers to stock their products next to fresh-looking animal burgers in chilled-meat cases.  BOCA Burgers, by contrast, are frozen and sit in refrigerators with vegetarian and vegan products, where meat-eaters may not think to look.  Kroger Co KR.N, one of the first grocers to sell Beyond Meat patties in meat cases, said on Tuesday it was testing a plant-based protein section in the meat departments of 60 stores to gauge shopper behavior.  BOCA Burger\u2019s share of the U.S. plant-based burger market shrank to 3.8% last year, compared with 7.3% in 2013, according to Euromonitor.  Kraft Heinz declined to provide details on its plans for plant-based proteins or comment on the forthcoming shareholder vote. In a filing ahead of the meeting, Kraft Heinz said several named executives had forfeited their bonuses for 2018 due to the company\u2019s performance.

Kraft Heinz, owner of brands such as Velveeta cheese and Heinz ketchup, said on Friday that retailers in Canada were stocking fewer of their products \u2014 a factor that is likely to be permanent.  The company\u2019s shares were down 3.3 percent in afternoon trading. They earlier fell as much as 7 percent to their lowest since August 2015.  \u201cThere is no question our financial results in 2017 did not meet our potential,\u201d Kraft Heinz Chief Executive Officer Bernardo Hees said on a call with analysts.  Kraft Heinz and Campbell are the worst performing large-cap consumer staples stock over the past 12 months, losing 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The S&P 500 .SPX, in contrast, is up 15 percent.  Other food companies have in recent months spoken about escalating pressure from retailers, who are asking suppliers to offer lower prices and limit shipments so that they can control inventories better.  Food companies have tried to promote their healthier products but these have often failed to gain the sort of popularity their traditional products enjoyed.  Sales in Kraft Heinz\u2019s U.S. business fell 1.1 percent to $4.79 billion, declining for the seventh straight quarter. They missed analysts\u2019 average estimate of $4.81 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Total sales and profit for the fourth quarter fell short of estimates as well.  Other issues that weighed on sales included a supply shortfall of its Ore-Ida branded potato-based foods and cold cuts.  Kraft Heinz said several of these problems are likely to persist this year.  Net sales inched up 0.3 percent to $6.88 billion, but missed estimates of $6.92 billion.  Kraft-Heinz, the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, achieved its target of cutting $1.7 billion in costs by the end of 2017.  \u201cAfter looking at the company\u2019s slide presentation yesterday, one might have come away with the impression that KHC is firing on all cylinders; today\u2019s print was a reminder that the company still has a long way to go before this is the case,\u201d JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Having booked billions of dollars in writedowns this year on the value of some of its most well-known brands, including bacon and cold-cuts maker Oscar Mayer, Kraft Heinz has been criticized for gutting spending on brands under a chief executive installed by No. 2 investor, Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.  The company, whose biggest investor is billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N, has reported 13 quarters of lackluster sales amid changing consumer tastes and competition from private-label brands owned by Walmart WMT.N, Costco COST.O and Kroger KR.N.  Newly appointed Chief Executive Miguel Patricio, who will outline a detailed plan after a strategic review of the business in 2020, said Kraft Heinz would now direct more marketing funds toward its flagship brands. The company, whose major brands include Heinz ketchup and Velveeta cheese, also said it plans to halve the number of project launches planned for 2020.  \u201cWhile we have been working hard to finish the year in a much better place than we started, we have also been investing a lot of energy in our future,\u201d Patricio said on a post-earnings call.  Shares of Chicago-based Kraft Heinz were up 13% at $32.23 in midday trading. Earnings excluding items fell 9.2% to 69 cents per share, but handily beat the 54 cents expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Given the disappointing news earlier this year on weak sales and brand writedowns, and a massive drop in the stock\u2019s valuation since February, the results are encouraging for investors who had been concerned about the company\u2019s future, Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard said.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s earnings beat comes after a rough year that saw it slash dividends and scrap its full-year forecast after taking two major writedowns - one in February of $15.4 billion and another in August of $1.22 billion. The company\u2019s procurement practices are also under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The stock has tumbled about 40% since the company disclosed the probe and its first writedown in February.  Net sales fell nearly 5% to $6.08 billion, missing analysts\u2019 estimates of $6.13 billion. The company said it expects fourth-quarter sales and EBITDA to be \u201cgenerally similar\u201d to those of the third quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to take a hit of up to 10 cents per share.  Expenses sank nearly 25% to $767 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 28 as supply chain cost inflation slowed compared to the first half of the year. The company raised product prices by 1% while sales volume fell 2.1 percentage points.","59":"FILE PHOTO: Heinz tomato ketchup is show on display during a preview of a new Walmart Super Center prior to its opening in Compton, California, U.S., January 10, 2017.

Before AB InBev, Patricio worked at major consumer companies including Philip Morris, Coca-Cola Co and Johnson & Johnson.  He succeeds Bernardo Hees, 49, who was made CEO in 2015 when Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz merged.  His appointment comes two months after Kraft Heinz slashed its quarterly dividend, wrote down the value its marquee Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and other assets by more than $15 billion. It also disclosed that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, Brazilian private equity fund 3G Capital, has pushed the company to rein in expenses to tackle higher costs and sluggish growth, a strategy it has successfully implemented at holdings including Heinz and Anheuser-Busch.  \u201cGreat companies are the ones that have the costs in control, that grow the top line, and grow the bottom line \u2013 it\u2019s not one or the other, Patricio said in an interview. \u201cI have very good experience on that - on being more efficient every year, which doesn\u2019t mean cutting costs. It means to be more efficient.\u201d  Kraft\u2019s cost cuts, made at the urging of 3G, resulted in smaller marketing and advertising budgets for key brands like Oscar Mayer bacon and the loss of brand managers, which translated to market share loss to cheaper, private-label competitors, according to two former Kraft Heinz marketing employees.  On top of that, the broad sector has struggled with rising transportation and commodity costs along with a shift in consumer preferences to more niche health-focused brands.  Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and 3G together own close to 50 percent of Kraft Heinz. Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately response to requests for comment.  SEC PROBE  The company also disclosed in February that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to an investigation into its accounting policies, procedures and internal controls related to procurement.  At the time, Kraft said it was working on ways to improve its internal controls and determined the problems required it to record a $25 million increase to the cost of products sold.  \u201cThe change at the top of Kraft Heinz is a positive development,\u201d said Roosevelt Investment Group fund manager Jason Benowitz, which previously held a stake in Kraft Heinz.  \u201cIt shows that management and the board understand the serious nature of the challenges facing the company.

And its energetic chief executive, Bernardo Hees, is under pressure to manage Street expectations.  While he says he is in no rush to do deals, does not need a big acquisition now, and is not talking much with investment bankers, opportunities may be coming.  \u201cOur M&A framework has not changed,\u201d Hees, 48, said in an interview at Berkshire\u2019s recent annual shareholder weekend in Omaha, Nebraska. \u201cWe continue to like big brands. We continue to like businesses that can travel. We continue to like businesses that we can find synergies that we can reinvest behind growth.  \u201cThe relative and absolute valuations are more attractive today than they were six months ago, or a year ago,\u201d Hees added. \u201cIf more consolidation would happen in the food and beverage industry, we want to be a force.\u201d  Hees (pronounced \"Hess\") is a partner at 3G, which is known for engineering big mergers, such as the creation of Restaurant Brands International Inc QSR.TO by combining Burger King with Canada's Tim Hortons, and then imposing draconian cost cuts.  That reputation helped prompt Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream maker Unilever Plc UNc.AS to rebuff 3G's $143 billion Buffett-backed takeover approach last year.  Kraft Heinz decided to walk away, and Hees is not dwelling on the rejection.  INVESTORS HAVE DOUBTS  For now, his challenge is to create buzz for familiar brands such as Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, and not just for products capable of riding the newest food trends.  The company eliminated $1.7 billion of costs, including six factories and about 4,900 jobs, following the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. The combined company is co-headquartered in Chicago and Pittsburgh.  \u201cBig brands have scale, they have profitability, they allow you to grow when you have the right product offerings, and it\u2019s relevant,\u201d said Hees, who previously led Heinz and Burger King.  So as Kraft Heinz takes celebrity chef David Chang\u2019s Momofuku Ssam Sauce national, and partners with Food Network on \u201cglobally inspired\u201d salad dressings, cooking sauces and meal kits, so too it must inspire consumers to fill their pantries with Planters Signature nuts and Philadelphia cheesecake cups.  At Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting, Buffett praised 3G\u2019s and Hees\u2019 ability to cut unnecessary costs.  \u201cThe people at 3G are great, great managers, and they are wonderful partners,\u201d Buffett said.  Investors aren\u2019t as convinced they will succeed at Kraft Heinz.  Since peaking on Feb. 17, 2017, Kraft Heinz's share price had fallen 40 percent through Tuesday. The S&P 500 .SPX rose 14 percent in the same period.  \u201cWe believe the stock market will take care of itself if we deliver upon our commitments,\u201d Hees said. \u201cThe stock price today is not in the way of anything we want to achieve in the mid- or long-term.\u201d  Rivals\u2019 stock prices have also taken hits.  Through Tuesday, the S&P 500 Packaged Foods & Meats index .SPLRCFOOD had fallen 9.9 percent in the last six months. Mondelez International Inc MDLZ.O dropped 7.3 percent, while Campbell Soup Co CPB.N and General Mills Inc GIS.N lost a respective 12.4 percent and 19 percent.  \u2018MAYOCHUP\u2019  Last week, Kraft Heinz reported better-than-expected first quarter profit, even though organic sales fell 1.5 percent.  \u201cWe maintain our concern that the management team lacks the marketing acumen necessary to adapt to the dynamic changes in the market and grow its collection of \u2018retro\u2019 brands in highly commoditized categories,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote.  Kraft Heinz is trying.  Two months ago, Kraft Heinz launched Springboard, a brand incubator to develop natural and organic, specialty and craft, healthy and what it called \u201cexperiential\u201d foods.  And in April, Kraft Heinz created a viral frenzy when it took to Twitter to gauge whether consumers would buy \u201cMayochup,\u201d a hybrid of mayonnaise and ketchup.  Some called it similar to \u201cfry sauce.\u201d Others noted that many people mix the two already.  \u201cWe truly believe that our brands need to be relevant, to the product offering, to the position, and to communicate it to consumers, wherever they are,\u201d Hees said.  \u201cPop culture is a great way to do that. Mayochup is a great example. We started, we have these two sauces, can you put them together, is that disgusting, is that good?\u201d  With the Kraft Heinz integration \u201cbehind us,\u201d Hees said he is investing more into its businesses, armed with knowledge it has gained since the merger.  \u201cThings move fast today, that\u2019s a good thing, but we\u2019re a young organization,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there are many things we need to learn.

CEO Bernardo Hees said in an interview that the maker of Heinz ketchup and Maxwell House coffee is \u201cbeing hurt\u201d by retaliation over U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, which Canada responded to by slapping taxes on goods ranging from sauces to coffee. Kraft Heinz has described coffee as one of its key commodities in the United States and Canada.  Hees said the company and food industry was seeking exemptions from the tariffs on specific products.  Febreze and Gillette manufacturer Procter & Gamble Co told Reuters in July that some of its products sold in Canada would be affected by the tariffs as well.  Canada\u2019s top trade negotiator and her U.S. counterpart started a third day of talks to save the North American Free Trade Agreement on Friday as differences between the two sides appeared to have narrowed.  Yet the trade conflict is adding to the pressures on Hees and industry peers trying to fatten profits even as consumers change their eating habits and U.S. inflation perks up.  Kraft Heinz topped quarterly profit and revenue estimates when it reported results last month as it raised product prices and posted higher-than-expected U.S. sales for the first time in several quarters.

He did not specify how much he expected costs to hit the company\u2019s earnings, saying that consumption and other economic trends are \u201creally on the right foot.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s why for us to have an agreement on this - it would be very positive,\u201d Hees said of U.S.-Canada trade negotiations. \u201cIn reality it takes the uncertainty out so we can invest for the long run.\u201d  Many analysts believe Kraft Heinz, controlled by Brazil\u2019s 3G Capital and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, should include an acquisition among those investments.  Hees is a partner at 3G, which is known for engineering big mergers, such as the creation of Restaurant Brands International Inc by combining Burger King with Canada\u2019s Tim Hortons, and then imposing draconian cost cuts.  Since peaking on Feb. 17, 2017, Kraft Heinz shares have fallen more than 40 percent. The S&P 500 rose 22 percent in the same period. Hees has said the stock market will take care of itself if the company delivers.  The company\u2019s potential acquisition targets are getting cheaper and, arguably, more vulnerable. The S&P 500 Packaged Foods & Meats index is down 9 percent this year.  One possible acquisition target, Campbell Soup Co, is fighting off a proxy fight by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb\u2019s Third Point LLC. Loeb is moving to remove Campbell\u2019s entire board just one week after Campbell unveiled a strategic review, deciding to sell two businesses.  While Kraft Heinz had considered a Campbell acquisition in the past, it was not currently exploring a bid, a source told Reuters in August.  Asked about the subject, Hees declined to comment on Campbell but said valuations are more attractive than 12 months ago.  \u201cIf there would be more consolidation for the industry, we\u2019d like to be a force behind it,\u201d he said, noting that the company would be disciplined.  \u201cWe like strong brands, we like business that can travel, and we like businesses that have synergies, that can be reinvested behind brands, product and people. When we find a combination of that, we tend to move very fast.\u201d","63":"(Reuters) - Food company Kraft Heinz Co has hired investment bank Credit Suisse to review options for its Maxwell House coffee business, including a potential sale, CNBC reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Kraft Heinz, which was Kraft Foods until 2015, and Mondelez bought $90 million of December 2011 wheat futures, which gave the companies a dominant position in the market, even though they never intended to take possession of the grain, the CFTC said.  The move sent a false signal that the companies had demand for wheat and caused an artificial price fluctuation that earned them more than $5 million in profits, the CFTC said.  Both companies said they strongly disagree with CFTC\u2019s statement, which \u201cblatantly violate and misrepresent the terms and spirit of the consent order\u201d, and will be seeking immediate relief from the court.  The commission said the companies\u2019 goal was to narrow the price spread between the December 2011 and deferred-month wheat futures contracts, causing the market to sell cash wheat to the companies at lower prices, while earning them a profit on their speculative futures positions.  Wheat futures and options traders had also accused the companies of illegally manipulating the grain\u2019s price at their expense.

Packaged food companies like Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup CPB.N that market canned food and salty snacks have for years faced a perception that their products are unhealthy. At the same time, the industry is battling aggressive competition from cheaper private-label brands from Walmart WMT.N and Kroger KR.N.  At its virtual investor day, Chicago-based Kraft Heinz said it would now manage its business by distributing brands among six platforms built around the occasions people consume Kraft products and the foods they are paired with. The company previously managed its business as 55-plus categories, which created complexities.  For example, the company\u2019s biggest platform will be called \u201cTaste elevation,\u201d which will include brands such as Heinz Ketchup, Master and ABC, which as sauces and condiments add \u201cincreased taste and texture\u201d to regular foods. Other platforms include \u201ceasy meals made better\u201d for products such as Mac & Cheese, and \u201cFlavorful Hydration\u201d for its Capri sun type drinks.  Kraft also plans to increase spending on marketing by 30% to just over $1.4 billion, a move many shareholders have hoped for since media and advertising veteran Miguel Patricio took over as chief executive in July 2019. Shares of Kraft Heinz have risen 4.6% since then.  \u201cKraft Heinz has played defense for far too long ... but now we are moving to offense. We are making decisions to win big,\u201d Patricio said during the presentation - his first major strategic update, which was initially planned for the spring but was pushed to September due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The company also announced that it would sell its natural, grated, cultured and specialty cheese businesses in the United States - including its Breakstone\u2019s and Cracker Barrel brands - to Lactalis, while retaining its more popular Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Kraft Singles, Velveeta Processed Cheese and Cheez Whiz brands.  The sale is part of plans to reduce its net leverage of about $27 billion to about four times EBITDA by the end of this year from the 4.2 times EBITDA it achieved at the end of the second quarter.  COST CUTS  Fueled by shoppers in lockdowns buying more packaged food, Kraft Heinz forecast high-single-digit quarterly adjusted core earnings growth and mid-single-digit full-year adjusted core earnings growth. Patricio said sales growth has slowed from that early peak, but is still faster than last year.  The company expects third-quarter net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range versus last year, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of a 2% increase in sales, according to Refinitiv data.  The company has begun streamlining its supply chain, Patricio said, and is trying to build better relationships with suppliers - many of whom have been critical about Kraft Heinz\u2019s culture under the management of cost-focused private equity firm 3G Capital.  \u201cInvestors might be cautious with the $2 billion savings plan announcement since aggressive cost cutting is what led to KHC\u2019s downturn in the first place,\u201d CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram said, pointing to the company\u2019s muted stock reaction on Tuesday.  Kraft Heinz CEO Patricio tried to assuage concerns saying while the company will continue to reduce costs, it wont be as aggressive if it can work with factories, transportation and logistics companies to preserve margins by being more productive.  \u201cWhen you cut costs too much, actually your costs increase because you lose efficiencies,\u201d Patricio said.  Of the $2 billion cost cuts, $1.2 billion will come from procurement and $800 million will come from making Kraft Heinz\u2019s logistical network more efficient.  The Portuguese CEO said Kraft Heinz will invest most of its media budget in five areas, including ready-made meals like Mac & Cheese and healthy snacks.  It also aims to promote products that can be used as ingredients, such as Oscar Mayer bacon and Planters nuts that can be used in salads.  The company, whose portfolio doesn\u2019t currently include many sweet foods, plans to spend heavily on promoting \u201cindulgent desserts\u201d and children\u2019s beverages and will invest in making existing brands better, not making more types of products, he said.","68":"Feb 21 (Reuters) - Packaged food maker Kraft Heinz Co reported a 6.7 percent fall in quarterly adjusted earnings on Thursday, hit by rising commodity and freight costs.

They should not even have been surprised.  Various Heinz sauces of U.S. food company Kraft Heinz are offered at a supermarket of Swiss retail group Coop in Zumikon, Switzerland December 13, 2016. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann  The U.S. food giant is part of a longstanding stock-market tradition of investors seeking companies with invincible management that guarantees incredible prospects. This time the magic was supposed to come from the cost-cutting and debt-loading genius of the company\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, Brazilian investment group 3G Capital.  While the fervour had already cooled - Kraft Heinz\u2019s share price before its latest plunge was already 50 percent below where it had been two years earlier \u2013 investors were still pricing in a triumph of hope over experience. The slowdown in economic growth in developed economies ought to have been a clue that things were going to get tougher.  Think back to the beginning of the century. In 2000, the United States was coming out of a five-year period where real GDP grew at an annual compound rate of 4.3 percent. Even if that seemed unsustainably high, something close to 3 percent seemed plausible. In the subsequent 18 years, the actual rate has been 2 percent. Demographics suggest a decline from here.  Kraft Heinz is one of the American companies which have been caught in the downdraft. Despite extensive foreign operations, the annual inflation-adjusted growth rate of revenue per share since 2000 for all the constituents of the U.S. S&P 500 stock-market index has been a meagre 1.1 percent, just over half the rate at which real GDP grew.  It\u2019s not just bottles of ketchup that are subject to economic gravity. Consider the big basic consumer goods of transport and housing. Average light vehicle sales over the last five years have been merely 8 percent higher than they were between 1996 and 2000. For housing starts, the same comparison shows a 24 percent decline. In such sectors, there is just not much growth for companies to capture.  Most economists and stock-market forecasters claim to accept something like this dull reality. Vanguard Research, for example, says that the long-term real growth rate of U.S. GDP is 2 percent. And consultants at McKinsey have suggested that it is reasonable for average companies to plan on a 2.5 percent real growth rate in profit.  Those numbers are far below what many corporate managers promise and many stock-market investors expect. The average is too often taken as a bare minimum, leading to unnecessary Kraft Heinz-style disappointments. Even after analysts reset their expectations, the Velveeta cheese maker is expected to report $2.97 of earnings per share in 2019, according to I\/B\/E\/S estimates from Refinitiv. That\u2019s equivalent to almost 8 percent annual growth since 2015, largely thanks to tax-rate cuts.  There are three ways to better align operations and expectations with reality. First, give up on excessively positive thinking. It\u2019s foolish to believe that strategies which have worked on a small scale, for example the 3G Capital approach, can be expanded infinitely. A wise manager remembers that aggressive expansions rarely pay off when overall growth is slow or non-existent, and is not afraid to cut capacity when demand in an industry is shrinking.  Second, try less hard to please financial markets. Overly demanding and optimistic investors often do not really understand what is in the best interests of companies. For example, shareholders were wrong to be miffed when Unilever rejected a merger with Kraft Heinz in 2017. The Brazilian shock therapy might have juiced up profits for a little while, but the Anglo-Dutch consumer conglomerate needs to spend enough to stay competitive in industries which have little growth and a fair number of eager competitors.  Finally, shareholders may have become surplus to requirement at many companies. Solidly profitable enterprises which face neither enormous risks nor great opportunities are extremely unlikely to need new equity capital. Their dividends on existing shares look suspiciously like what economists call rents, unmerited cashflows from customers to equity holders.  Many of these companies have been buying back shares in significant quantities. While those transactions are disguised dividends, they could be made real. Imagine that shareholders were all bought out, and companies adopted a not-for-profit structure like a typical university or non-American hospital. Freed from outside pressure for growth, the trustees could decide to aim for steady and unspectacular results.  Such structural transitions are almost unheard of. But the number of industries that have moved from rapid growth to mature stability is also relatively few. Perhaps it is time to develop new corporate forms to serve the new economy better.  Slow growth is not everyone\u2019s problem. Mature economies only account for about 15 percent of the world\u2019s population. The opportunities for economic expansion remain large for enterprises which serve the other 85 percent. However, only a few companies from rich countries will succeed at that task. For most established industry leaders, dynamic opportunities are yesterday\u2019s story. Corporate styles need to change with the times.","75":"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O has agreed to sell its Canadian natural cheese business to Parmalat SpA PLT.MI in a C$1.62 billion ($1.23 billion) deal that will help Kraft trim its debt and extend the North American footprint of Parmalat owner Lactalis.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Lactalis Group is seen on the headquarters of the French dairy group Lactalis in Laval, western France, January 12, 2018. REUTERS\/Stephane Mahe\/File Photo  The deal comes a month after the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was signed, under which Canada partially opened its protected domestic market to the United States.  The cheese business being sold by Kraft, which includes brands like Cracker Barrel, P\u2019tit Quebec and aMOOza, generated about C$560 million in net sales in 2017, Kraft and Parmalat said in statements on Tuesday.  The transaction followed a competitive bidding process, Parmalat said.  Under the deal, expected to close in the first half of 2019, Kraft will sell its production facility in Ingleside, Ontario and transfer 400 employees to Parmalat.  The U.S. food group will continue to own and market other cheese products, including Philadelphia, Cheez Whiz and Kraft Singles, which are processed in Quebec.  Kraft, which like other consumer goods firms has been struggling with rising costs for raw materials and transportation, expects to use proceeds from the deal to pay down debt, which amounted to nearly $31 billion as of Sept. 29.  RBC Capital Markets served as exclusive financial adviser to Kraft Heinz Canada, while Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP served as legal advisers.  Parmalat said the activity will reinforce its century-old Canadian business that already comprises 3,000 employees and 16 dairy processing plants, helping to secure jobs and farm revenue.  The revised North American trade deal has irked Canadian farmers who see a threat to the country\u2019s supply management system, but the agreement may bring limited gains for U.S. producers.  Parmalat\u2019s acquisition in Canada marks a further addition to the North American footprint of France\u2019s Lactalis, the world\u2019s largest dairy firm that controls nearly 90 percent of Parmalat.  The deal would reinforce its presence \u201cin the strategic market for cheese with high added value in Canada,\u201d Lactalis said in a separate statement on Wednesday.  Lactalis has in the past year struck deals to acquire U.S. organic yoghurt brand Stonyfield, previously owned by fellow French group Danone DANO.PA, and agreed to buy siggi's, a U.S.-based maker of Icelandic yoghurt.  In another overseas acquisition, Lactalis last month agreed to buy the infant formula business of Aspen Pharmacare APNJ.J, in a move to revive its baby milk after a health scandal in its home market.  A salmonella outbreak at its sole infant formula production site in northwest France last year caused dozens of babies to fall sick and led to a global product recall.  Natural cheeses can include unripened cheeses such as cottage cheese, soft cheese such as Camembert or hard cheeses such as Cheddar.  Processed cheese is made by pasteurizing, emulsifying, and blending natural cheese. Several varieties of natural cheeses may be mixed, and powdered milk, whey, cream or butter, and water may be added, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Kraft Heinz\u2019s share price sank 27.5 percent on Feb. 22 after the company took a $15.4 billion writedown on its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and Canadian assets, as consumers shifted to healthier and fresher alternatives or private-label products.  The company, headquartered in both Chicago and Pittsburgh, also slashed its dividend and announced a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accounting probe. Kraft Heinz\u2019s stock plunge erased more than $16 billion of market value.  In his damages complaint, shareholder Steve Walling accused Kraft Heinz, Chief Executive Bernardo Hees, 3G and others of concealing damage to Kraft Heinz\u2019s iconic brands and internal controls, including from 3G\u2019s signature belt-tightening.  Walling also said the defendants had been \u201cmotivated\u201d to engage in improper conduct to allow 3G to \u201csell\u201d $1.23 billion of stock last August at artificially inflated prices. The complaint was filed in the federal court in Pittsburgh.  In an Aug. 7 regulatory filing, 3G said an affiliate had transferred 20.63 million Kraft Heinz shares worth $59.83 each to an entity called HK3 18 LP.  The Brazilian private equity firm said none of the shares sold related to 3G partners\u2019 original Kraft Heinz stake.  Hees told Reuters in a Sept. 7, 2018 interview that the transfer was made on behalf of institutional investors that had a \u201cwindow to liquidity\u201d and were exiting a 3G fund.  \u201cIt\u2019s not 3G, as we know 3G,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very optimistic about the profile of what the investment can be for the long run.\u201d  Kraft Heinz and 3G did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, a law firm representing Walling, did not respond to similar requests.  Berkshire and Buffett are not defendants. Buffett told CNBC on Monday the market reacted \u201cprobably quite properly\u201d to Kraft Heinz\u2019s news.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Shares of the Chicago-based company, which makes Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Singles, were down 4% in afternoon trading.  Higher employee bonuses, foreign exchange fluctuations and climbing commodity costs - particularly the price of cheese - are expected to soften second-half results, Kraft Heinz said.  Adjusted EBITDA growth - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization - will now be about 9 percentage points lower than last year, versus the 7-percentage-point hit the company predicted in April.  With movement outdoors restricted due to lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus, people around the world bought significantly more groceries during the period for meals at home.  While Kraft Heinz\u2019s retail sales rose, the lockdown took its toll on its U.S. and Canadian food service businesses, which provide ketchup, mayonnaise and other products to restaurants, offices and school cafeterias. These units were included in a nearly $1.8 billion writedown taken during the quarter.  Kraft Heinz - which has written down about $20 billion of its brands and businesses since February 2019 - also took nearly $1.1 billion off the value of Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and seven other brands.  Due to the most recent impairment charges, the company reported a second-quarter loss attributable to common shareholders of $1.65 billion, versus a profit of $449 million a year earlier. Excluding items, adjusted earnings were 80 cents per share, handily beating analysts\u2019 average estimate of 65 cents.  Food companies have particularly benefited from sales in developed countries, which have strong e-commerce infrastructure and adaptable distribution systems.  Revenue from Kraft Heinz\u2019s U.S. business rose 8.5% to $4.9 billion in the quarter ended June 27, as it ramped up inventory and boosted sales across nearly all its retail categories. Overall sales grew 3.8% to $6.65 billion, beating analyst expectations for $6.54 billion, according to Refinitiv.  Bernstein analysts called this a \u201csolid quarter\u201d for Kraft Heinz, but said they would remain \u201con the sidelines\u201d until September, when the company is due to announce a strategic update at its investor day.

Buffett spoke four days after Kraft Heinz said it had taken a $15.4 billion writedown for its Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and other assets, slashed its dividend, and that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its accounting.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s share price sank 27.5 percent on Friday, causing Berkshire to lose $4.3 billion on its stake. Berkshire owns 26.7 percent of Kraft Heinz. Shares rose 0.7 percent to $35.21 in early trade on Monday.  \u201cI was wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz,\u201d Buffett said on CNBC television. \u201cWe overpaid for Kraft.\u201d  The comments were a rare admission of error by the 88-year-old billionaire on a major investment at his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.  Berkshire and Brazilian firm 3G Capital had teamed up in 2015 to combine the former Kraft Foods with their H.J. Heinz, and together own about half of the merged company.  Buffett also said he has \u201cabsolutely no intention\u201d of adding to or subtracting from Berkshire\u2019s stake, and that he would continue to do business with 3G and its co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, calling him \u201can absolutely outstanding human being.\u201d  \u2018TOE TO TOE\u2019  Kraft Heinz\u2019s disclosure raised questions about 3G\u2019s financial strategy for the company, whose brands include Jell-O, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia cream cheese, and whether it is out of step with consumers seeking healthier, fresher alternatives to processed food.  Buffett acknowledged the changes, but said greater pressure is coming from retailers such as Amazon.com Inc, Walmart Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp, including through the latter\u2019s Kirkland brand.  Stronger brands can \u201cgo toe to toe with Walmart or Costco\u201d but weaker brands \u201ctend to lose out,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cThe ability to price has changed, and that\u2019s huge.\u201d  Berkshire\u2019s own $3 billion writedown related to Kraft Heinz contributed to a $25.39 billion fourth-quarter net loss for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire.  \u201cHe monumentally overpaid for Kraft,\u201d said Doug Kass, founder of the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc. \u201cIncreasingly, the moats he initially saw in his investments have been damaged.\u201d  Buffett said he learned about the SEC probe about seven to 10 days before it was announced.  Greg Abel, a Berkshire vice chairman widely considered a candidate to succeed Buffett as Berkshire\u2019s chief executive officer, sits on Kraft Heinz\u2019s board.  3G STRATEGY  The announcement also called into question 3G\u2019s signature business model of zero-based budgeting, which requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use last year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.  Kraft Heinz\u2019s belt-tightening resulted in more than $1.7 billion in annual savings, including the loss of thousands of jobs, mirroring 3G\u2019s similar efforts at such companies as Anheuser-Busch InBev and Tim Hortons.  While the strategy has resulted in leaner companies, it could backfire if the companies lacked products that people want, or failed to spend enough to develop and market those products.

Risks that are too difficult to quantify include foodservice sales and their pace of recovery, the potential for consumer pantry deloading and supply disruptions as well as the possibility that costs for key commodities such as meat could become more volatile as the year progresses.  In addition, the company forecast a 700 basis point headwind to second-half EBITDA from the loss of its coffee partnership with McDonald\u2019s, incentive compensation and the strength of the U.S. dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales.  Kraft Heinz said first-quarter sales were $6.16 billion, slightly ahead of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $6.14 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding hits from currency fluctuations and divestitures, organic sales rose 6.2 percent, in line with a forecast the company gave earlier this month.  About 6 to 7 percentage points of sales growth were due to increased consumer demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as shoppers stocked up on pantry staples.  About one-quarter of the sales growth was due to price increases. Nearly three-quarters came from selling a larger volume, and higher-priced mix, of goods, as the growth in at-home consumption more than offset lower shipments to foodservice outlets like restaurants, which remain closed to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Meanwhile, sales of rival brands like Hormel Foods' HRL.N Applegate and Tyson Foods' TSN.N Hillshire surged 37% and 27%, respectively.  Cheese and chilled processed meat are Kraft Heinz\u2019s top two U.S. businesses by retail sales, but Euromonitor data shows Kraft Heinz\u2019s market share in both categories has steadily shrunk since 2015. The company is due to report quarterly earnings on Thursday.  To fuel growth, Kraft Heinz needs to innovate, a process that could take several years, analysts said.  \u201cThe higher priced brands are seeing the strongest growth. People aren\u2019t trading down to private-label, they\u2019re buying the quality stuff,\u201d Wells Fargo analyst John Baumgartner said. \u201cOscar Mayer doesn\u2019t have that quality perception with consumers - they\u2019re going to have to launch a product that\u2019s really clean-label so they can charge more.\u201d  To appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, the labels of Applegate\u2019s roughly $16-a-pound hams say prominently that its pigs are \u201chumanely raised\u201d and given vegetarian feed on family farms. The packaging of Oscar Mayer products, which cost about $4.85 per pound in stores, say they don\u2019t contain hormones, nitrates or artificial ingredients - a years-old declaration in the industry.  While Hillshire has rolled out cheese and cracker snack plates with premium prosciutto and wine-infused salami, Oscar Mayer\u2019s cheaper plates come with hickory-smoked ham and hard salami.  Kraft Heinz CEO Miguel Patricio, who began revamping operations when he took over about a year ago, said in April the company had postponed a lot of innovation this year to spend more on media and reduce the number of products it makes. Kraft Heinz declined to comment for this story.  The company\u2019s U.S. cheese sales rose 24% in the 8 weeks to June 13, the Nielsen data shows, once more lagging rivals - including premium private-label brands - that drove 32% growth in the $19 billion U.S. packaged cheese market.  Kraft Heinz has taken some steps to innovate. In September, a fund backed by the company led a $3.5 million investment in animal-free dairy cheese startup New Culture.

In a brief and accompanying declaration from New York City Law Department Senior Counsel Alan Kleinman, the pension funds allege that Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz misused confidential information about the funds\u2019 trading in Kraft Heinz to undermine the New York funds\u2019 motion to lead the shareholder class action against the company. Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz represent a competing lead plaintiff candidate in the securities fraud case in federal court in Chicago, which alleges that Kraft misled investors in the run-up to its $15 billion writedown of brand assets in February. Kraft Heinz counsel Daniel Kramer of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison declined to comment.  Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.  Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz sent me a joint statement: \u201cBLBG and KTMC unequivocally deny the allegations by the New York City funds and their lawyers,\u201d it said. \u201cAt no time did BLBG or KTMC represent the NYC funds in the Kraft Heinz case or violate any confidentiality or ethical obligations relating to the New York City funds.\u201d The firms are scheduled to file a brief Friday addressing the funds\u2019 assertions. They said they are looking forward to providing the court with that response.  I reached out to the New York City comptroller\u2019s office, which oversees the city\u2019s pension funds, to ask if Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz still have a client relationship with the funds. In a response on behalf of the New York funds, their outside counsel in the Kraft Heinz case, Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, declined to comment.  According to the pension funds, Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz received proprietary trading data because they are among the six firms pre-approved to represent New York City funds in securities class actions. The panel was selected in a competitive process in 2018, according to the funds. Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz learned of their selection in the fall of 2018 and both subsequently signed agreements with New York City\u2019s Law Department. The agreement requires firms on the securities panel to obtain a written conflict waiver if they want to represent different clients in matters involving the pension fund, according to the declaration by NYC senior counsel Kleinman. The agreement also contains a confidentiality provision barring lawyers from panel firms from disclosing pension funds\u2019 trading data.  In April 2019, as the NYC funds contemplated a pitch to lead a shareholder class action against Kraft Heinz, the city sent data about its trading in Kraft Heinz to its panel firms. The city funds eventually submitted a motion in late April to run the Kraft Heinz case, represented by Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll. New York\u2019s funds claimed losses of nearly $60 million in Kraft Heinz trading \u2013 the biggest alleged losses of shareholders who want to lead the case.  Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz submitted a motion for the Swedish pension fund AP7 and the German fund Union Asset Management to serve jointly as lead plaintiff. The foreign funds alleged losses of \u201ctens of millions of dollars.\u201d (Other investors are also competing to lead the shareholder class action, which is before U.S. District Judge Robert Dow of Chicago. The other lead plaintiff candidates are not involved in the dispute between the New York funds and Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz.)  Typically, in securities class actions, judges pick the shareholder with the biggest losses to lead the case, especially if, like the New York City pension funds, that investor is a sophisticated institution with experience in major fraud litigation. But in an extraordinary brief filed on May 24, Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz asked Judge Dow to permit discovery on the New York funds\u2019 alleged losses, suggesting that because some of the funds\u2019 investments were in commingled vehicles, the funds may not have directly owned all of the Kraft Heinz shares on which they supposedly lost money.  The May 24 brief accused NYC officials of \u201cobfuscating the record\u201d and refusing to answer the foreign funds\u2019 questions about commingled investment vehicles. It also attacked Kleinman, the city lawyer who signed the pension funds\u2019 certification of their investment losses, as having \u201cno apparent expertise in calculating financial interest under the (Private Securities Litigation Reform Act), finance or mathematics.\u201d  Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz said in the May 24 brief that were relying on public information, making no mention of the firms\u2019 relationship with the New York City pension funds. In fact, the firms said that the trading data they sought through the motion was not privileged or confidential and would eventually be demanded by Kraft Heinz. The pension funds\u2019 arguments for secrecy, they said, were baseless.  The May 24 motion for discovery triggered the funds\u2019 accusations Friday against Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz. The funds assert that despite the conflict waiver provision in the agreement between the firms and New York City, Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz did not ask for or receive waivers to represent the Swedish and German funds in the Kraft Heinz case \u2013 and then turned around and used the funds\u2019 own trading data against them.  \u201cNYC believes that BLBG and Kessler Topaz have engaged in continuous violations of their contractual and ethical obligations,\u201d the funds\u2019 brief said. In his declaration, NYC lawyer Kleinman said, \u201cAt a minimum, it should be beyond dispute that (Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz) should not have used the NYC funds\u2019 confidential data in a manner adverse to their clients, the NYC funds.\u201d  I should note that I didn\u2019t find evidence of Bernstein Litowitz or Kessler Topaz appearing publicly as counsel for the New York City funds after they joined the panel of approved firms in 2018. Years ago, New York City pension funds were one of the co-lead plaintiffs in a securities class action against Cendant, in which Bernstein Litowitz was co-lead counsel. The city funds successfully appealed the $262 million fee award in the $3.2 billion case. The court ultimately approved a reduced fee award of $55 million.  As Bernstein Litowitz and Kessler Topaz said in their statement, their brief addressing the funds\u2019 accusations is due Friday. It\u2019s going to be a must-read.","103":"April 24 (Reuters) - Discovery Inc:  * KRAFT HEINZ - CO, FOOD NETWORK ANNOUNCE LAUNCH OF FOOD NETWORK KITCHEN INSPIRATIONS, A NEW LINE OF SALAD DRESSINGS, COOKING SAUCES AND MEAL KITS Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","104":"Feb 23 (Reuters) - Sinking stocks and deteriorating prospects from an investment in Kraft Heinz Co pummeled the bottom line of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc , which on Saturday reported a large quarterly net loss even though operating profit rose.

People briefed on the talks said more time is likely needed in the talks given China\u2019s resistance this week to U.S. demands for specific steps by Beijing to end forced transfers of U.S. technology and certain other policies.  Signs of progress in the ongoing trade talks between the two countries supported the market for much of the session, leaving the Dow and Nasdaq on course to post a ninth straight week of gains.  Top trade negotiators from the two countries met to wrap up a week of talks on some of the thorniest issues in their trade war. If the two sides fail to reach a deal by midnight on March 1, then their seven-month trade war could escalate.

Kraft\u2019s revenue growth has stagnated in the years since it merged with Heinz as consumers shun older, established brands for newer products, cheaper private label brands and non-processed and organic food.  The shares fell as much 28 percent to a low of $34.51, wiping $17 billion off the company\u2019s market value. In mid-afternoon trading, shares were down $13.10 at $35.07.

Brazil\u2019s buyout fund 3G Capital and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc together own more than 50 percent of Kraft Heinz. 3G has advocated the company combat higher transportation, commodity costs and sluggish growth by reining in expenses companywide. But that has come at a price.  \u201cInvestors for years have asked if 3G\u2019s extreme belt-tightening model ultimately would result in brand equity erosion,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said.  \u201cWe think the answer arguably came yesterday in the form of a $15 billion intangible asset write-down for the Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands,\u201d said Goldman, who cut his rating to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201coverweight.\u201d  On Thursday, Kraft Heinz, whose brands include Jell-O gelatin dessert and Velveeta processed cheese, reported a quarterly loss, said it would cut its dividend 36 percent and disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company\u2019s accounting policies.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Ketchup-maker Heinz merged with Kraft in 2015 in a deal engineered by 3G. Under 3G\u2019s stewardship, the new company embarked on extreme cost cutting that risked stifling investment in innovation and marketing.  Warren Buffett releases his annual letter to shareholders on Saturday and investors will scour the document for any insight from the billionaire on his Kraft stake and relationship with 3G.  ZERO-BASED BUDGETING  Under 3G, Kraft Heinz embraced zero-based budgeting, a cost-conscious strategy intended to improve operating margins that requires managers to justify all expenses, from pencils to forklifts.  Some analysts are now questioning the effectiveness of 3G\u2019s model, given that the company\u2019s margins before interest and taxes fell to 23.2 percent in 2018 from 27.2 percent in 2015, the year Kraft Heinz was formed.  \u201cWe see the 3G model as highly dependent on deal-making and synergy realization and at some point having best-in-class margins doesn\u2019t matter if the sales growth doesn\u2019t eventually come,\u201d Guggenheim Partners\u2019 analyst Laurent Grandet said in a note.  \u201cKraft Heinz results confirmed all our worst fears \u2013 plus more,\u201d Grandet wrote in a note.  Stifel downgraded the stock to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d and more than halved its price target to $35, well below the current median target of $52.  Credit Suisse cut its price target by $9 to $33, making it the lowest on Wall Street.  \u201cThis is not your typical \u201creset the base and everything will be fine\u201d story,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote.  \u201cThe dividend cut, the write-down of the Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks, and the guidance for further divestitures demonstrate the hallmarks of a company that has a serious balance sheet problem,\u201d Moskow said.  The news also hit the company\u2019s bond investors. Kraft Heinz\u2019s nearly $31 billion of bonds were among the most heavily traded paper in the U.S. corporate debt market on Friday morning, according to MarketAxess, and yields on several of their largest bonds shot higher and their prices dropped by a full point or more.  Spreads on their bonds, or the premium demanded by investors as compensation for holding Kraft paper over safer U.S. Treasury securities, widened by the most ever across a range of the company\u2019s bonds."}}
