Chevron\u2019s assets in Venezuela were effectively \u201cmothballed\u201d after the U.S. Treasury Department imposed tight restrictions on businesses operating in the nation as part of a crackdown on money going to the government of socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  The license gives Chevron until Dec. 1 to \u201cwind down\u201d operations in Venezuela, an OPEC member, but the license could be renewed at a later date.  If the deadline is not extended, it would force the California-based company to exit the nation after operating there for about 100 years.  Wirth told CNBC here that the U.S. Treasury Department's order only restricted some of Chevron's activities and does not require it to leave the country, where it is only a supporting partner in two ventures and not an operator of any assets.  \u201cWe intend to comply, obviously, with the requirements of the (U.S.) government, but we\u2019re not actually winding down or leaving the country,\u201d he said in a CNBC interview. \u201cWe\u2019re winding down certain activities.\u201d","1":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A Chevron Corp CVX.N crude oil cargo has become embroiled in U.S. sanctions on shipping companies for violating restrictions on doing business with Venezuela, the company confirmed on Friday.

REUTERS\/Marco Bello  Adamant Maritime Ltd, owner of very large crude-oil carrier (VLCC) Seahero was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury on Tuesday for carrying a Venezuelan cargo in February. The vessel is heading to Asia after recently stopping in Trinidad and Tobago, according to vessel tracking data.  The tanker is on short-term charter and \u201cperforming a voyage that is not related to Venezuela,\u201d Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said. \u201cWe are working with the appropriate government agencies to ensure compliance with U.S. laws and regulations,\u201d he said.  Chevron is the last U.S. oil producer operating in Venezuela.  It put the vessel on a six-month charter a week ago, prior to the sanctions, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Adamant Maritime and three other shipping firms for transporting Venezuelan oil, the latest escalation in Washington\u2019s effort to oust President Nicolas Maduro by cutting off the OPEC nation\u2019s crude exports.  Washington is considering imposing sanctions on dozens of additional foreign oil tankers for trading with Venezuela, a U.S. official confirmed on Friday.  Vessels that could be targeted included 25 supertankers, which can each carry a maximum of 2 million barrels of oil, and 17 smaller vessels, sources said.  The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Seahero\u2019s manager was listed as Greek company Thenamaris, according to shipping data and Thenamaris\u2019 website.

FILE PHOTO: Logo of Hungarian oil and gas group MOL at the company's refinery in Szazhalombatta ,Hungary March 22, 2016. REUTERS\/Laszlo Balogh\/File Photo  MOL said on Monday the deal agreed with Chevron includes a 9.57% stake in the BP-operated Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea and a 8.9% stake in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline that transports the crude to the Mediterranean.  Reuters first reported on the talks between MOL and Chevron last month.  \u201cWhat this deal gives us is longevity and stability,\u201d MOL\u2019s executive upstream vice president Berislav Gaso told Reuters by telephone after MOL announced the transaction in a filing.  He said MOL will keep looking for acquisitions, but is \u201cnot in a rush\u201d and any further steps will not be as big, with the aim on maintaining the ability to generate cash.  \u201cI like barrels but I love dollars even more than that.\u201d  He said the Azeri purchase will add about 20,000 barrels per day to MOL\u2019s production guidance, which will rise to 120,000-130,000 barrels per day.  MOL said in a presentation last month that it was seeking to add 350 million barrels of oil and gas reserves by 2023.  The company also said the largest potential for organic reserve replacement was in Norway, but opportunities other than organic growth would be required to achieve this.  MOL is focused on Croatia and Hungary, which account for 64% of its total upstream oil and gas production, while it also produces in the North Sea, Iraq and Russia.  Chevron\u2019s larger U.S. rival Exxon Mobil is also seeking to sell its 6.8% stake in ACG, banking and industry sources have said.  Discovered in the early 1970s when Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union, ACG is the largest oilfield in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian basin.  In 2018, ACG\u2019s total production for the full year was on average 584,000 barrels per day.  Investment bank Jefferies advised Chevron on the deal.","3":"(Reuters) - Chevron is reviewing political donations after last week\u2019s violent invasion of the U.S. capitol, Chief Executive Mike Wirth said on Tuesday while speaking at the Reuters Next conference.

Several companies have said they would suspend or review some political donations in the wake of the riots, including Marriott International Inc, Archer Daniels Midland Co and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.  \u201cI specifically asked my team to take a look at the events of last week and make sure those are brought into account as we make our decisions going forward,\u201d Wirth said.  About two-thirds of Chevron\u2019s contributions went to Republicans and one-third to Democrats in the most recent election cycle, Wirth said.  The second-largest U.S. oil producer last week called for \u201cthe peaceful transition of the U.S. government\u201d and said it looked forward to working with President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s administration \u201cto move the nation forward\u201d.  Wirth also said on Tuesday that Chevron expected to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d with the Biden administration on the economy and jobs, and expected the world to transition to a \u201clower-carbon energy system over time\u201d.  \u201cWe intend to be a part of that,\u201d Wirth said. Chevron is working to reduce its carbon impact and integrate renewables and offsets into its business, he added.  Biden, a Democrat, has promised to end U.S. fossil fuel subsidies and seeks to usher in sweeping measures to combat climate change.  Wirth said he expected 2021 to be a better year for the hard-hit oil industry, which has slashed jobs and spending since last spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron (CVX) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  The company would like to have refining operations on the Houston Ship Channel, in the western part of the U.S. Gulf, to complement an existing eastern Gulf refinery in Mississippi that makes lubricants and other materials, Pierre Breber, Chevron\u2019s head of downstream and chemicals, said.  \u201cSomething on the ship channel side could make a lot of sense for our company,\u201d Breber said in an interview on the sidelines of the Oil & Money conference in London.  Chevron is a major oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. The company\u2019s Permian production jumped 51 percent sequentially in the second quarter to 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By expanding its refining capacity to Houston, Chevron would be able to process its Permian crude closer to where it is produced.

The Pasadena refinery is the second on the U.S. Gulf Coast for Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, California.  Chevron wanted the refinery to process sweet crude coming from its oil fields in the Permian Basin of Texas.  \u201cThis acquisition builds on the strength of our existing Gulf Coast business, enabling us to supply more of our retail market in the region with Chevron-produced products, and positions us for connectivity to our strong upstream assets in the Permian Basin,\u201d said Mark Nelson, Chevron\u2019s executive vice president for downstream and chemicals.  In addition to the refinery, Chevron acquired PRSI, a Petrobras subsidiary that operates the refinery and owns subsidiary PRSI Trading, which trades in crude and refined products markets. PRSI owns a 5.1-million-barrel storage tank farm and an additional 143 acres (58 hectares) of land along the Houston Ship Channel.  Chevron also operates a 352,000-bpd refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi.  The Pasadena refinery was at the center of several investigations in Brazil of corruption within Petrobras.  The Brazilian oil company paid $360 million for half of the Pasadena refinery in 2006, more than eight times what its previous owner, Astra Oil, a unit of Belgian-controlled Astra Transcor Energy, paid for the complex a year earlier.  By 2012, Petrobras had sunk $1.18 billion into it, including the cost of buying out Astra\u2019s remaining half after a legal dispute with Astra.","7":"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has decided Pertamina will take over operation of the Rokan oil block, the country\u2019s second-biggest crude producing field, once Chevron\u2019s operating contract there expires in 2021, Deputy Energy Minister Arcandra Tahar said late on Tuesday.  Rokan has been a focus area for Chevron, which asked Indonesia earlier this year to extend its operating contract beyond 2021.  A proposal made by Chevron for an extension of its contract after 2021 was \u201cfar below\u201d an offer made by Pertamina, Tahar told reporters at a press conference, referring to a comparison of projections of state revenue and other terms proposed by both companies.  State-owned energy company Pertamina will operate Rokan from Aug. 8, 2021 to 2041, under a gross split production sharing contract, Tahar said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed on terms and conditions. All that\u2019s left is for us to put this into a document that will be signed by Pertamina and the government,\u201d Tahar said.  Chevron acknowledged the news in a written statement.  \u201cWhile we are disappointed to hear the news, we are coordinating with respective parties to seek more information,\u201d Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and Production External Affairs Advisor Cam Van Ast said.  \u201cChevron has been a proud partner with Indonesia for more than 90 years,\u201d he added.  Pertamina acting chief executive Nicke Widyawati thanked President Joko Widodo and the government for the decision.  \u201cWe are sure we can compete with other production sharing contractors,\u201d she said in a statement.  \u201cBy managing the Rokan block, we will increase Pertamina\u2019s upstream production, which will reduce oil imports, resulting in savings of $4 billion per year, and reducing downstream costs over the long term,\u201d Widyawati said.  Pertamina estimates its capital expenditure on Rokan will reach around $70 billion over the 20-year life of its contract, Pertamina Upstream Director Syamsu Alam told reporters.  \u201cThere\u2019s several opportunities there to optimize several fields,\u201d Alam said. He added the company plans to trial the use of chemical enhanced oil recovery methods in Rokan from 2024.  He also said Pertamina would initially \u201cfocus on managing fields that Chevron hasn\u2019t focused on, where the potential is quite large.\u201d  \u201cThere are several layers we\u2019ve identified that still need exploration,\u201d Alam added.  \u201cIf all of this runs well, hopefully we can control the decline so that production from 2021 onward doesn\u2019t drop much.\u201d  Pertamina hoped to begin talks with Chevron regarding the operational transition as soon as possible, Alam said.  \u201cWe have to talk about everything.\u201d  Crude oil lifting by Chevron unit Chevron Pacific Indonesia, operator of the Rokan block, hit 207,148 barrels per day in the first half of 2018, below a 2018 budget target of 213,551 bpd.","8":"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. oil group Chevron has a potential buyer for its stake in one of the UK North Sea\u2019s biggest oil and gas developments, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday.

The ratings slipped to \u2018AA-,\u2019 weeks after the agency warned it was considering downgrades for 13 of the world\u2019s largest oil companies due to the rising risk from energy transition and volatile commodity prices.  Several oil companies posted billions of dollars in losses in 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic brought global travel to a standstill, slashing fuel demand and sending crude prices to historic lows.  The sector is also under pressure from investors and pension funds demanding companies to disclose their carbon footprint and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in renewable energy projects.  While companies including Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have announced steps to tackle climate change, S&P said it does not see those \u201cproviding material credit differentiation\u201d.

The justices will weigh whether the lawsuit must be heard in state court as the city would prefer or in federal court, which corporate defendants generally view as a more favorable venue. The suit targets 21 U.S. and foreign energy companies that extract, produce, distribute or sell fossil fuels.  The outcome could affect around a dozen similar lawsuits by U.S. states, cities and counties including Rhode Island and New York City seeking to hold such companies liable for the impact of climate change.  Baltimore and the other jurisdictions are seeking damages under state law for the harms they said they have sustained due to climate change, which they attribute in part to the companies\u2019 role in producing fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.  The plaintiffs have said they have had to spend more on infrastructure such as flood control measures to combat sea-level rise caused by a warming climate. Climate change has been melting land-based ice sheets and glaciers.  The Supreme Court in 2019 declined the companies\u2019 emergency request to put the Baltimore litigation on hold after a federal judge ruled that the case should be heard in state court. In March, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge\u2019s decision.  In the absence of federal legislation in the bitterly divided U.S. Congress targeting climate change, the lawsuits are the latest effort to force action via litigation.  The Supreme Court in a landmark 2007 ruling said that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that could be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the agency issued the first-ever regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gases. But efforts in Congress to enact sweeping climate change legislation have failed.  The court took action in the case three days before it begins its new nine-month term short one justice after the Sept. 18 death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

It was the second consecutive quarter that refining weakness, especially outside the United States, clipped improved profit.  Strength in the Chevron division that pumps oil and gas helped overcome the refining weakness and beat Wall Street profit expectations for the quarter.  Exxon, though, has struggled in recent quarters to boost oil and gas output, and its overall first-quarterly results badly lagged expectations.  Shares of Exxon fell 3.7 percent to $77.88 in afternoon trading while Chevron rose 2.0 percent to $126.71. Exxon is off about 6.6 percent in the last two years while Chevron has soared 24.5 percent.  \u201cWhile the fourth quarter was a disaster for both, Chevron got back on track\u201d in the first quarter, said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst at Edward Jones. \u201cExxon\u2019s still trying to get back on the road.\u201d  Both Exxon and Chevron have consistently touted the benefits of owning businesses that produce and refine oil, saying they better balance earnings as commodity prices rise and fall.  U.S. oil prices fell slightly to $67.98 per barrel.  Rising oil prices typically harm refiners by squeezing their margins on products, but they also boost profit at divisions that produce crude.  The strategy worked for Chevron during the quarter, helping the company top Wall Street expectations. At Exxon, weak refining results were coupled with lower oil production, fueling concern about Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods\u2019 turnaround plan for the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer.  Refining margins in Europe BRT-ROT-REF, for instance, fell more than 14 percent in the quarter and were on track for a 38 percent drop in the second period, the biggest quarterly decline since the fourth quarter of 2015.  Profit fell 12 percent in Exxon\u2019s downstream refining unit, and 14 percent in its chemical unit.  At Chevron, earnings in refining and chemical operations dropped 21 percent to $728 million.  Both companies have sought to bolster refining operations. Reuters reported earlier this month that they have asked U.S. regulators for exemptions to U.S. biofuels rules that are typically only given to small companies in financial distress.  \u2018NOT WHAT THE MARKET WANTS\u2019  Both companies said they are accelerating shale drilling in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, helping to lift the nation\u2019s output so far this year to more than 10 million barrels per day, a new record.  (To view a graphic on Exxon's quarterly results, click here: reut.rs\/2Kg4peq)  Exxon\u2019s U.S. production swung to a $429 million profit from a year-earlier loss. But Exxon has continued to invest heavily in projects that will not produce oil or gas for years. In contrast, Chevron is benefiting from past investments that have boosted output, especially in liquefied natural gas.  Exxon also has struggled in the past 16 months to unwind some of the biggest bets taken by former CEO Rex Tillerson, who left to become U.S. secretary of state in early 2017 before being fired by President Donald Trump last month.  \u201cThe Exxon strategy right now is not what the market wants,\u201d said Mark Stoeckle, portfolio manager of Adams Natural Resources Fund, which holds Exxon shares.  \u201cThe market wants the cash back.

In a rare step, the federation of Dutch trade unions, the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation and Public Services International lodged the complaint with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in The Hague.  Chevron did not respond to repeated requests for comment by email and phone.  Reuters was unable to determine why the U.S. oil major had been singled out in the complaint, but the trade unions said tax avoidance deprived workers they represented of basic government services and pressured their wages.  \u201cThe workers and communities we represent suffer when government-provided services such as health care, education, infrastructure, water, energy, and public safety decline.\u201d the complaint said. \u201cUnfortunately, multinationals\u2019 practice of avoiding paying taxes in the countries in which their wealth is earned deepens global wealth inequality and empowers multinationals against workers and governments.\u201d  Scores of multinationals use the Netherlands, which has a network of tax treaties with roughly 100 countries, to shift dividends, interest and royalties untaxed through Dutch shell companies to tax havens overseas.  In their 35-page complaint the unions alleged Chevron had used its Dutch subsidiaries to breach OECD disclosure guidelines in respect of their operations with Chevron\u2019s Nigerian, Argentinian, and Venezuelan businesses. In those examples, the complaint states that Chevron specifically failed to meet requirements to pay tax in the country of extraction and to adhere to Dutch financial disclosure requirements.  The unions\u2019 statement said Chevron\u2019s Dutch subsidiaries, through frequent intra-group operations whose main purpose was the avoidance of taxes in multiple jurisdictions, breached the spirit of Dutch corporation tax law.  \u201cThe American company is carrying out tax avoidance on a massive scale,\u201d the groups said in a statement to the media, detailing the complaint.  \u201cThe Netherlands is already a tax haven which encourages companies to pay less.\u201d  The Dutch government, which says it wants to help stop tax avoidance, has come under pressure from the OECD and the European Commission to take measures to halt tax avoidance.  A spokeswoman at the Dutch Finance Ministry said the government does not generally comment on cases involving individual companies and had no immediate reaction.  A major complaint expressed by the OECD and the European Commission, is the Dutch finance ministry\u2019s practice of granting \u201cadvance rulings\u201d, or agreeing in advance with large corporations on how a given structure will be taxed.  In 2015 the European Commission ordered the Dutch to reclaim up to 30 million euros ($34.7 million) in back taxes from Starbucks after ruling that the tax arrangement with the U.S. coffee company amounted to illegal state aid.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The United States last year imposed sanctions that barred imports of Venezuelan oil and transactions made in U.S. dollars with Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company PDVSA. The move was designed to starve the country of oil dollars and oust President Nicolas Maduro.  The restrictions cut Venezuela\u2019s oil exports by 32% last year, but Maduro has remained in power, supported by PDVSA and the country\u2019s military.  Chevron and oilfield service firms Baker Hughes Co, Halliburton Co, Schlumberger NV, and Weatherford International have regularly received permission to remain in the country. The four services firms have largely ceased operations there.  The extension was a win for some Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who see value in keeping the company in Venezuela, which has the world\u2019s largest reserves of oil.

A 1 million-barrel cargo of Venezuelan crude consigned to Chevron was scheduled to load this month at Venezuela\u2019s Jose port, according to internal PDVSA documents seen by Reuters.  The oil export does not violate sanctions and its proceeds will cover maintenance costs at a joint venture, Chevron said.

REUTERS\/Toru Hanai\/File Photo  The No. 2 U.S. oil producer laid out its plan to weather what is turning into one of the most challenging markets in years, as coronavirus concerns dent short-term demand and environmental and investor pressures cloud the longer-term outlook for the industry.  Oil prices are down 20% this year and natural gas prices have fallen to their lowest since the 1990s. Industry returns have lagged the broader market for a decade, souring investors. European majors like BP Plc BP.L have set significant commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their operations.  Chevron\u2019s Wirth, however, laid out a long-term case for growing global demand for oil and gas.  \u201cThe world will need more of what we produce, not less,\u201d Wirth said. Chevron currently produces about 3 million barrels of oil daily.  Chevron will stick to its previously announced capital spending plan of $19 billion to $22 billion annually through 2024, setting it apart from chief U.S. rival Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, which is spending heavily to boost production.  But the company has based its plans on a $60 international oil price, about $7 higher than current prices, and is working toward \u201cincreased growth in a world which looks to not need it,\u201d analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said.  Returning cash to shareholders is the \u201cnumber one priority,\u201d Wirth said in a meeting with analysts and investors in New York.  While the emergence of coronavirus - which emerged in China late last year and has spread to more than 60 countries - has depressed demand for its products, Wirth said \u201csupply chains are functioning normally.\u201d  The spending plan is \u201ca positive and affirming their capital-disciplined philosophy,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones.  The top U.S. shale field will continue to drive Chevron\u2019s oil growth, and the company expects \u201csustained production over 1 million barrels per day in the Permian Basin through 2040 at relatively flat activity levels,\u201d said Jay Johnson, executive vice president. Chevron reached 514,000 barrels per day of output in the field at the end of 2019, up 36% in a year.  Chevron and Exxon are racing to boost Permian output, but Chevron has owned land in the Permian for decades, which gave it a zero cost of entry into that shale boom.  Shares traded up 0.4% on Tuesday morning to $97.00. The company has posted a total return of -7.6% in the last two years, compared with a 13.6% total return for the S&P 500 index, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.","26":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of commodities trader Glencore is pictured in front of the company's headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, November 20, 2012.

Chevron agreed last year to sell its stake to state-owned Sinopec before miner and commodities trader Glencore swooped in after reaching a deal with minority shareholders, who backed it and exercised preemptive rights on the sale.

For Glencore, the deal would secure the trader\u2019s first refining asset since it ventured into downstream investments. For Sinopec, it would mark its second major refinery investment as the company looks to expand overseas amid a saturated home market.

Somers, I told you about a radical idea floated by Digital Realty Trust\u2019s lawyers at Williams & Connolly.  In the company\u2019s reply brief, the real estate investment trust repeated its primary argument that the statutory language of Dodd-Frank\u2019s whistleblower provisions limits anti-retaliation protection to employees who report their concerns to the Securities and Exchange Commission, not those who follow the Sarbanes-Oxley directive to report problems to bosses. But in a parting shot, Digital Realty said that if the justices determined the SEC\u2019s more expansive interpretation of the scope of Dodd-Frank\u2019s whistleblower protection was entitled to deference under the Supreme Court\u2019s 1984 precedent in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, this case might be a good opportunity for the court to blow up Chevron \u2013 the longtime bedrock of U.S. administrative law.  That\u2019s not going to happen.  The Supreme Court issued its decision Wednesday in the Digital Realty case, and it wasn\u2019t even close. All of the justices agreed that Dodd-Frank\u2019s text expressly defines whistleblowers as those who report suspected fraud to the SEC. Employees who claim they were fired after informing their supervisors, but not the SEC, of potential issues are not shielded by Dodd-Frank\u2019s robust whistleblower protections \u2013 a conclusion, said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that aligns with Congress\u2019s intention of encouraging whistleblowers to alert the SEC of fraud allegations. (Justice Clarence Thomas, in a partial concurrence joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito, wrote that the court should have ended its analysis with the statutory text and not proceeded to discuss congressional intent.)  Because the justices concluded the statute was not ambiguous in its definition of a whistleblower, the court never had to decide whether to defer to the SEC\u2019s interpretation that Dodd-Frank protection extends to employees who have reported internally and not to the commission. The first part of the Chevron deference test, as you know, is whether the underlying statute is ambiguous. (The second part is whether the agency\u2019s statutory interpretation is reasonable.) In Digital Realty, the court\u2019s Chevron analysis ended almost as soon as it began.  \u201cWe find the statute\u2019s definition of \u2018whistleblower\u2019 clear and conclusive. Because \u2018Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,\u2019\u201d Justice Ginsburg wrote, quoting Chevron, \u201cwe do not accord deference to the contrary view advanced by the SEC \u2026 The statute\u2019s unambiguous whistleblower definition, in short, precludes the commission from more expansively interpreting that term.\u201d  The court\u2019s decision seems to spell the end of Paul Somers\u2019 case against Digital Realty, which he accused of firing him when he told his supervisors he suspected financial fraud by the company. Somers failed to follow Sarbanes-Oxley\u2019s administrative procedures for whistleblowers alleging retaliation, so he is apparently out of options. His Supreme Court counsel, Daniel Geyser of Stris & Mayer, declined to comment.  Whistleblower lawyers said Wednesday that the court\u2019s decision will drive employees to the SEC when they\u2019re worried about possible corporate misconduct. Whistleblowers receive more powerful protection under Dodd-Frank than under Sarbanes-Oxley, including a longer statute of limitations, fewer administrative hurdles and higher potential recovery. If concerned employees are not entitled to those Dodd-Frank benefits without reporting concerns to the commission, their incentive is to call the SEC hotline.  That\u2019s a mixed blessing for employers, said Sean McKessy of Phillips & Cohen, founding director of the former SEC Office of the Whistleblower. \u201cPreviously, we might have advised whistleblowers to report their concerns through internal compliance systems, when those systems were legitimate and strong, as well as report claims to the SEC,\u201d McKessy said in an email statement. \u201cNow we will tailor our advice to whistleblowers to take the Supreme Court decision into account, so as to avoid the risk of losing the right to be protected from retaliation.\u201d  Digital Realty Trust\u2019s Supreme Court counsel, Kannon Shanmugam of Williams & Connolly, was arguing a different case at the Supreme Court on Wednesday so was not available for comment.","32":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth\u2019s decision to opt out of a bidding war for Anadarko Petroleum Corp has raised the bar for deals, and dampened expectations that oil majors will drive a new wave of consolidation in U.S. shale.  FILE PHOTO: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  Wirth last week ruled out increasing his $33 billion offer for Anadarko after being outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp, walking away from a company he had described as a perfect match. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee that it will use toward share buybacks.  The decision will make rivals think twice about splurging on companies operating in the largest U.S. oilfield, but will not put an end to shale deals given the weak valuations of independents, analysts said.  Even Wirth refused to rule out another deal.  \u201cWe are always scanning the landscape for opportunities,\u201d Wirth said in an interview on Thursday.  However, Wirth added that Chevron has a \u201crich queue\u201d of existing projects.  \u201cWe have no intention to do an acquisition unless it\u2019s exceptionally good for us,\u201d he said.  Many companies with shale assets are trading at depressed prices and would \u201cbe accretive to the larger caps or majors,\u201d said Geoffrey King, a portfolio manager at investment firm Macquarie Group.  Price-to-earnings ratios for producers\u2019 Carrizo Oil & Gas, Devon Energy Corp and Cimarex Energy Co are in the single digits compared to the 14 to 17 times earnings multiple that BP Plc, Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corp trade.  Weak shares prices have chilled deal-making among similar-sized oil producers. Last quarter, the value of U.S. energy deals fell to a 10-year low.  Investor reaction to the Chevron-Occidental contest for Anadarko also may cause potential for the majors to think twice before getting involved in a bidding contest.  Occidental traded on Friday at $54.97, down 9 percent from the day it launched its bid for Anadarko and at a 10-year low. Chevron was up 3.8 percent to $121.99 since withdrawing, but is down 5.3 percent in the last 52 weeks.  Chevron has been a poster-child for spending restraint and called the bid for Anadarko a reaction to the \u201cindustrial logic\u201d of two companies with similar operations. It pledged to restrict annual capital spending to around $20 billion through next year to return more cash to investors.  Avoiding overspending on shale is \u201cwhat shareholders have been advocating for,\u201d said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. \u201cChevron stock got a decent pop on a lousy day for the market.\u201d  Despite a large acreage position and the \u201cstrongest royalty position of anybody in the Permian,\u201d Wirth said the No. 2 U.S. oil producer this year will restrict its drilling program in the top U.S. shale patch to just 20 rigs, less than half that of rival Exxon, while aiming to reach output of 900,000 barrels per day by 2023.  The issue for Chevron and other large producers thinking of expanding in the Permian is how much more production they can wring from an asset, said Kris Nicol, head of U.S. corporate research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  \u201cA lot of companies are undervalued,\u201d Nicol said.  There is more involved to making an acquisition pay off than the purchase price. \u201cThe question is, once you get that company, what can you do with it?\u201d Nicol asked.  Still, after years of letting small independents dominate shale, the majors have \u201ccome around\u201d to the importance of the fields\u2019 fast-cycle production, said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager with Tortoise Capital.  Anadarko\u2019s agreement to be acquired by Occidental for $38 billion in cash and stock \u201cmakes it more likely that others will want to do something big to compete,\u201d he said.","33":"March 15 (Reuters) - SA\u2019s Competition Tribunal:  * APPROVES GLENCORE AND CHEVRON MERGER, WITH CONDITIONS  * APPROVED GLENCORE S.

REUTERS\/Andres Stapff\/File Photo  RIO DE JANEIRO\/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp CVX.N has permanently assigned its Brazil country chief to run its Venezuelan operations after the months-long detention of two executives escalated tensions between the OPEC-member nation and foreign oil firms.  Javier La Rosa, who had been president of Chevron Brazil since 2016, this month was named president of Chevron Venezuela, the company confirmed on Friday. He replaced the company\u2019s Venezuela general manager, Christopher Whatley.

He flew to Caracas shortly after Chevron employees were detained to temporarily lead the Venezuela unit, according to two other people familiar with the matter.  La Rosa\u2019s appointment comes after a tense showdown between foreign oil companies and the government in recent months as Venezuela\u2019s political and economic meltdown deepened.  Venezuelan authorities this week released the two executives jailed since April as part of an ongoing graft probe into the oil sector, which has unnerved other foreign companies operating in partnership with state oil company PDVSA.  The arrests, related to the executives\u2019 refusal to sign a supply contract for furnace parts for a PDVSA joint venture, were made public after some oil-service companies pulled back from Venezuela, writing off billions of dollars in assets.  La Rosa is leaving Brazil just as Chevron begins to flex its muscle in Latin America's largest crude oil producer. In a consortium with Petrobras PETR4.SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, Chevron clinched its first block in Brazil's coveted offshore pre-salt oil play on Thursday.  It was not immediately clear who will run Chevron\u2019s Brazil operations.  Reuters reported in December that Chevron was in talks with oil services firm Schlumberger NV SLB.N to resume drilling in an offshore field after a 2011 oil spill there cut production.  Chevron, the world\u2019s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer, with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects.

Chevron earnings rose 26%, in line with forecasts, as it benefited from a one-time, $1-billion breakup fee from Anadarko Petroleum APC.N, which accepted a higher bid from Occidental Petroleum OXY.N after agreeing to sell itself to Chevron.  Shares of both companies fell on Friday with Exxon off 1% at $71.75 a share and Chevron down a penny at $120.73 as the market fell on U.S.-China trade concerns.  Exxon's weaker earnings mirrored those at rivals Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Total SA TOTF.PA, and both U.S. companies said natural gas prices and chemical margins fell from a year-earlier.  Shell\u2019s profit was its smallest in 30 months, due to weaker chemicals, refining and tumbling natural gas prices. Total also cited weaker natural gas and refining operations for earnings that fell 19% from a year ago.  Exxon\u2019s net income fell to $3.13 billion, or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $3.95 billion, or 92 cents per share, last year.

After spending on major projects and dividends, Exxon had a free cash flow shortfall of $2.7 billion, she said. Investors closely watch that measure as a sign of the company\u2019s financial health.  Exxon\u2019s chemicals business fell to a loss in the United States for the first time in at least three years and earnings have declined for five quarters in a row. It collected lower profits from refining due to higher costs and lost production at several plants.  The largest U.S. oil producer by volume has been investing in major projects to boost production at a time when investors have been pressing oil companies to cut spending and increase returns to shareholders.  In a call with analysts, Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said despite weak market conditions in three of the company\u2019s businesses, \u201con the whole, our businesses performance extremely well.\u201d  He pointed to the company\u2019s 90% year-over-year in Permian production and a 7% overall increase in its oil and gas production.

In the aftermath, Chevron evacuated other staff.

Chevron, the world\u2019s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer, with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects.  The firm has about 150 employees in its Puerto la Cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country.

Wheatstone Train 2 is the last of five LNG production units built by Chevron in the state of Western Australia over the past decade at a combined cost of $88 billion.  \u201cWith the Chevron-operated Wheatstone and Gorgon LNG facilities now operational, we are delivering a significant new source of energy for customers in the region,\u201d Chevron Australia Managing Director Nigel Hearne said in a statement on Friday.  Wheatstone LNG, with a total capacity of 8.9 million tonnes a year, is the eighth LNG project to be completed in Australia. That puts the nation on track to challenge Qatar as the world\u2019s biggest LNG exporter when the two remaining ongoing projects - Inpex Corp\u2019s Ichthys and Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s Prelude floating LNG - are finished.  At full capacity, Wheatstone is expected to make up about 6 percent of the Asia Pacific region\u2019s LNG production, Chevron said.  The first cargo from Wheatstone was shipped from Train 1 in October, 2017, a few months behind target, following hiccups in the start-up of Chevron\u2019s $54 billion Gorgon project, which slowed work on Wheatstone.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  It was the second consecutive quarter that refining weakness, especially outside the United States, clipped improved profit.  Strength in the Chevron division that pumps oil and gas helped overcome the refining weakness and beat Wall Street profit expectations for the quarter.  Exxon, though, has struggled in recent quarters to boost oil and gas output, and its overall first-quarterly results badly lagged expectations.  Shares of Exxon fell 3.7 percent to $77.88 in afternoon trading while Chevron rose 1.9 percent to $126.64. Exxon is off about 6.6 percent in the last two years while Chevron has soared 24.5 percent.  \u201cWhile the fourth quarter was a disaster for both, Chevron got back on track\u201d in the first quarter, said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst at Edward Jones. \u201cExxon\u2019s still trying to get back on the road.\u201d  Both Exxon and Chevron have consistently touted the benefits of owning businesses that produce and refine oil, saying they better balance earnings as commodity prices rise and fall.

[O\/R]  Rising oil prices typically harm refiners by squeezing their margins on products, but they also boost profit at divisions that produce crude.  The strategy worked for Chevron during the quarter, helping the company top Wall Street expectations. At Exxon, weak refining results were coupled with lower oil production, fueling concern about Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods\u2019 turnaround plan for the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer.  Refining margins in Europe BRT-ROT-REF, for instance, fell more than 14 percent in the quarter and were on track for a 38 percent drop in the second period, the biggest quarterly decline since the fourth quarter of 2015.  Profit fell 12 percent in Exxon\u2019s downstream refining unit, and 14 percent in its chemical unit.  At Chevron, earnings in refining and chemical operations dropped 21 percent to $728 million.

Earnings of $1.5 billion at Shell\u2019s trading unit in the quarter was about 30 times higher than a year ago. This mirrored Equinor\u2019s results last week, where trading helped the Norwegian company avoid an operating loss.  Oil prices plunged below $16 a barrel in April from above $60 at the start of the year, as daily global crude consumption plunged by as much as a third. Prices have regained some ground since then to trade above $40.  Eni\u2019s refining and marketing unit\u2019s second-quarter profit shot up by 76% to $139 million compared with a year ago, although the company overall still swung to a loss, it said on Thursday.  But trading earnings have not protected the companies from the gloomier longer term prospects for demand. The pandemic has prompted energy firms to slash long-term crude price outlooks, cutting the value of their assets.  France\u2019s Total wrote down $8 billion in the quarter, while Shell cut the value of its assets by $16.8 billion. Eni wrote down 3.5 billion euros ($4.1 billion) and BP, due to report second-quarter results on Aug. 4, has guided for a $17.5 billion hit.  Shell responded to the pandemic by cutting its dividend for the first time since World War Two and lowering planned spending this year by $5 billion to a maximum of $20 billion.  Eni cut its dividend and introduced a new dividend policy based on the oil price. Equinor also cut its dividend and suspended a share buyback.  BP and Total have not cut their dividends.  U.S. oil and gas majors Chevron and Exxon are due to report on July 31.

It gave no further details.  The project partners have invested more than A$34 billion ($23 billion) over the life of the project, however the gas fields that feed the NWS LNG plant are expected to start running out in the next few years.  The plant owners are looking to line up supply from new fields, and plan to charge a fee to process that gas from third parties.  Chevron\u2019s stake could fetch $3 billion to $4 billion, said one analyst, who declined to be named.  The sale is not a must, as the U.S. giant has said it is on track to meet its $5 billion to $10 billion target for asset sales between 2018 and 2020.  Chevron said it remains committed to its Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects, also in Western Australia.  Analysts said it made sense for Chevron to sell its NWS LNG stake now, after it failed to seal a deal to supply gas to the plant from its undeveloped Clio and Acme fields.

Oil companies are expected to benefit from a bounceback in oil and gas prices after a one-two punch of falling demand and prices put the industry in a tailspin last year. But as Chevron\u2019s final quarter showed, pandemic-related travel restrictions continue to hammer fuel demand.  Chevron was quick to respond to the downturn last year, cutting up to 15% of its global workforce, slashing new project outlays more than a third, and pulling back on oil production goals. It used a relatively strong financial position to acquire Noble Energy for $4.2 billion in stock and the assumption of $8 billion in debt.  The second-largest U.S. oil producer reported an adjusted loss of $11 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with a profit of $2.8 billion, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier. The net loss was $665 million including acquisition costs, the effect of foreign exchange and pension payouts.  The Noble deal added \u201chigh-quality assets, opportunities and people to Chevron\u201d that along with cost cuts, are \u201cpositioning the company for the future,\u201d said Chief Executive Michael Wirth.  Improved oil and gas prices and a 6% increase in output from the Noble purchase boosted Chevron\u2019s oil and gas earnings to $501 million, compared with a loss of $6.7 billion a year earlier.  The gain came as Chevron\u2019s international production business sold oil for about $40 per barrel, up from $39 in the prior quarter and down from $57 a year earlier.  The company\u2019s refining and chemical business reported a fourth-quarter loss of $338 million compared with profit of $672 million the year prior. Fuel sales fell 10.55% from the year-ago period as COVID-19 travel restrictions continued to reduce demand.  Its closely watched cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion, short of covering the $2.5 billion dividend and $3.2 billion in capital spending for the period.  Chevron has said it plans to spend $14 billion this year on projects and about $15 billion annually through 2025, well below the prior forecast of up to $22 billion.  It reported a full-year loss of $5.54 billion compared with earnings of $2.92 billion in 2019.  Rivals Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc report financial results next week.

Chevron\u2019s 10%-15% cuts would imply a reduction of between 4,500 and 6,750 jobs, while job cuts at Noble will reduce the total workforce by roughly another 570 positions.  Most of the cuts will take place this year, Chevron said in an email.  Chevron\u2019s purchase of Noble boosted its investments in U.S. shale patches of Colorado and the Permian basin and gave the company a foothold in Israel through Noble\u2019s flagship Leviathan project, the largest natural gas field in the eastern Mediterranean.

It was not immediately clear whether Chevron would have to shut down trains 1 and 3 at the 15.6 million tonnes a year plant, one of the world\u2019s largest LNG projects, to conduct the inspection and any necessary repairs.  \u201cWe are evaluating, based on the learning that we\u2019ve got, how to best address trains 1 and 3,\u201d Chevron Vice President Jay Johnson told analysts on an earnings call on July 31.  Last month, Australia\u2019s Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS) said it would inspect the plant following calls by a trade union to shut it down, after the company reported it had found a weld problem in the propane kettles on train 2 while the unit was undergoing maintenance.  The department\u2019s Dangerous Goods and Petroleum Safety Director Steve Emery said in a statement that the nature of reported cracking in train two could mean \u201cthere may be similar defects in trains one and three\u201d.  \u201cThe short-term measures Chevron has taken to mitigate the consequences of any potential gas leaks appear sufficient until the welds are inspected,\u201d Emery said.  Chevron confirmed it received the notices from the regulator relating to improvements on the propane heat exchangers of Gorgon train 2 and remediation notices for trains 1 and 3.  \u201cWe are working closely with the regulator in planning and implementing repair work at Gorgon that was identified by Chevron in a safe and efficient manner,\u201d the company said in an email.

Slideshow ( 2 images )  The move marks a U-turn for Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The top two U.S. oil and gas producers had resisted joining the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) after its launch in 2014.  Exxon and Chevron differ from their rivals on several topics around climate, and in the past have refused to join a call by the European firms for a global price on carbon.  Together with its three newest members, the group will account for around 30 percent of global oil and gas production and 20 percent of primary energy consumption, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a tweet.  \u201cThe addition of 3 U.S. companies gives us more impact to lead the industry\u2019s response to climate change,\u201d he wrote.  The OGCI currently comprises 10 firms including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, France\u2019s Total as well as national oil companies of China, Mexico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.  The announcement comes ahead of Climate Week in New York next week, a global gathering of world and company leaders around climate change.  \u201cWe are pleased to be joining OGCI to work constructively on addressing the risks of climate change,\u201d Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said in the statement.  The OGCI created a $1 billion fund to develop technologies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the sector as the world aims to shift toward a low-carbon economy.  Exxon and Chevron will each contribute $100 million to the fund, the statement said.  Exxon in recent years came under fire from investors and faced lawsuits over its climate policies and disclosures.  It will expand its investment in greenhouse gas emission-reduction research as part of the initiative, the company said in a statement. Earlier this year, Exxon pledged to reduce its methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020 and last year began an equipment upgrade at its XTO Energy shale business unit to cut emissions during production.  \u201cIt will take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society to develop scalable, affordable solutions that will be needed to address the risks of climate change,\u201d Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in the statement.  \u201cOur mission is to supply energy for modern life and improve living standards around the world while minimizing impacts on the environment. This dual challenge is one of the most important issues facing society and our company.\u201d  The news of the U.S. firms\u2019 joining was first reported by Axios.","87":"The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018.

Announcing its final investment decision (FID) on the project, the company said first oil from the field is expected in 2024.  \u201cChevron\u2019s sanction of the Anchor project shows that the U.S. Gulf of Mexico still offers attractive investment opportunities for large greenfield developments,\u201d said Justin Rostant, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie\u2019s Gulf of Mexico team.  The Anchor field is located about 140 miles off the coast of Louisiana and is in water depths of 5,000 feet. It also requires technology capable of handling pressure of 20,000 pound-force per square inch.  The planned facility has a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 28 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. The total potentially recoverable oil-equivalent resources for Anchor are estimated to exceed 440 million barrels.  Chevron, through its unit, holds a 62.86% working interest in the project and is the operator, while Total SA\u2019s unit holds the remaining working interest.  Chevron said earlier this week that it expects writedowns to the tune of $10 billion to $11 billion this quarter related to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico project, which needs higher oil prices to churn a profit. The impairment was also related to its shale gas assets in Appalachia, which has suffered from low natural gas prices.  Anchor is the first of three ultra-high-pressure projects that Wood Mackenzie had expected to reach FID within the next 18 months. The energy research firm estimates that the three projects combined hold about 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves and will require over $10 billion in capital investments.","91":"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Delek Group DLEKG.TA said on Sunday its Ithaca subsidiary, which it plans to spin off via a London listing, completed a deal to buy most of Chevron's CVX.N British North Sea oil and gas fields for $2 billion.  Delek said the deal, backdated to Jan. 1, will quadruple Ithaca\u2019s pro-forma production to 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and raise the company\u2019s proven reserves by 150% to 225 million barrels.  Delek, which is a partner in large natural gas projects off Israel\u2019s Mediterranean coast, paid $1.68 billion, with the rest coming from cash flow accumulated coming from the sale of oil and gas at Chevron\u2019s North Sea fields after the start of 2019.  Under pressure from a fall in oil prices, major oil and gas companies in the North Sea have been forced to sell assets to private equity-backed investors and specialized operators.  Following the close, Delek said Ithaca signed a five-year marketing and distribution agreement for the acquired Chevron fields with energy giant BP BP.L.  \u201cThe closing of the Chevron transaction, concurrently with the closing of the Phoenix sale, are two significant steps in the group\u2019s strategy for turning from a local company to a leading international energy company,\u201d said Delek chief executive Asaf Bartfeld.  Last week, Delek sold a 32.5% stake in insurer Phoenix Holdings PHOE1.TA for 1.57 billion shekels ($450 million) to two private equity firms after it was forced to divest from Phoenix due to regulation that prohibits conglomerates from holding stakes in financial and non-financial businesses.  The 10 fields acquired in the Chevron transaction are expected to generate Ithaca an estimated EBITDA of $3 billion in the next three years and substantial cash flow of hundreds of millions of dollars per year, which Delek said would allow it to repay its loans taken out for the deal and to distribute dividends.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  The decision capped a series of moves by Occidental to finance and reduce hurdles before its $38 billion deal after Anadarko balked at several earlier offers. Occidental received the board\u2019s endorsement after raising $18.8 billion in cash pledges that allowed it to avoid a vote by its shareholders on the deal.  Chevron has four days to decide whether it wants to alter an existing merger agreement that Anadarko already accepted or make a new bid. A spokesman confirmed it had receive the notice of termination from Anadarko and declined comment on its next steps.  Anadarko said its board had unanimously determined that the revised Occidental proposal constituted a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d and that it intended to terminate the Chevron merger agreement, a decision that would see it pay Chevron a $1 billion termination fee.  The decision was a victory for Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, who pressed Anadarko\u2019s board to reject the Chevron agreement and pulled in support from billionaire Warren Buffett for the deal. She convinced Buffett to invest $10 billion in the deal after flying to Omaha, Nebraska, to make the case.  Days later, Hollub won a deal with French oil giant Total SA to take most of Anadarko\u2019s international assets, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique estimated to cost up to $25 billion to complete. Total agreed to pay $8.8 billion for the assets once the merger goes ahead.  Hollub wants her target\u2019s prime position in the top U.S. shale field. Anadarko holds nearly a quarter million acres (102,000 hectares) of land in the Permian Basin, the biggest prize for Chevron and Occidental. The Permian has become the epicenter of the shale oil-and-gas boom, helping drive U.S. oil output to a record 12 million barrels a day (bpd), more than Russia and Saudi Arabia.  Anadarko first disclosed a merger deal with Chevron on April 12 after snubbing a higher bid from Occidental. That prompted Occidental\u2019s Hollub to go public with her offer, to pressure Anadarko to reconsider its stance.  The change of heart came after Occidental increased the proportion of cash in its $76 per share offer to 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, removing a stock exchange requirement for the approval of Occidental\u2019s shareholders.  Some investors in Occidental oppose the decision to bypass a shareholder vote of approval. T.

REUTERS\/Marco Bello  At issue is a six-month U.S. Treasury Department license that expires on July 27 that has allowed Chevron to keep operating its four joint ventures in Venezuela despite U.S. sanctions on the OPEC nation\u2019s oil sector.  Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] in January as part of an effort to slash cash flow to socialist President Nicolas Maduro and pressure him to step down. Venezuela\u2019s economy is on the brink of collapse.  Pompeo, who was once the president of oilfield services company Sentry International, understands that having an American beachhead in Venezuela would help speed an economic recovery if Maduro\u2019s government falls, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow also favors renewing the license, the sources said.  John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, opposes renewal as part of keeping maximum pressure on Maduro, the sources said. If Chevron is forced to leave, it could further crimp cash flow to Maduro\u2019s government, as oil production could dip.  \u201cThose in the administration who have looked at the enormous task of bringing Venezuela back from the abyss realize that the revival of the oil industry, the main source of foreign earnings, is a difficult multiyear process,\u201d one of the sources said of Pompeo\u2019s view.  \u201cMaintaining an American lever will be very helpful on Day One,\u201d said the source, who has spoken with Trump Cabinet members about reviving the economy after Maduro.  Amid the split, the easiest thing for the administration to do would be to renew the license for up to three months, rather than the original six, two of the sources said.  The State Department and the White House\u2019s National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Chevron, which has been in Venezuela for nearly 100 years, produces the equivalent of about 40,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas there. It declined to comment about the license, saying it is focused on employees\u2019 safety and on conducting business in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  If Chevron leaves, its assets would likely end up in the hands of Russian oil giant Rosneft, which would be counter to U.S. foreign policy goals, the sources said.  \u201cIf they pull the plug on Chevron, it\u2019s just a gift on a big platter to the Russians,\u201d one said. The assets could also wind up in the hands of PDVSA or Chinese oil companies.  Opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of the National Assembly, said on Tuesday he would seek to protect Chevron\u2019s assets in the country if Washington does not renew the license.  A source in Venezuela expected the license to be extended for either three or six months, with an announcement on Friday or Monday.","97":"March 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Tuesday it expected supply shortage in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market by around 2025, echoing comments made last month by top LNG trader Royal Dutch Shell.  Demand for natural gas, which burns cleaner than coal and oil, has surged as countries such as China look to curb environmental pollution.  Chevron, owner of the giant Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects in Australia, said it expects global demand to be nearly 600 million metric tonne per annum (mmtpa) by 2035, while supply could be just about half of that.  \u201cChina\u2019s demand is increasing significantly - they\u2019ve had a very active program to move off of coal in heating industrial applications, and that\u2019s pulled on LNG,\u201d Pierre Breber, EVP -downstream at Chevron, said during the company\u2019s analyst day.  China imported record levels of LNG in January, as the world\u2019s second-largest economy shored up supplies ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations.  Shell in February estimated that more than $200 billion of investments in LNG is needed to meet the boom in demand by 2030.  The global LNG market is set to continue its rapid expansion into 2020 as facilities approved for construction in the first half of the decade come on line.  However, a decline in spending in the sector since 2014 will create a supply gap from the mid-2020s unless new investments emerge, Shell said in its 2018 LNG Outlook.

While one-time asset sales or write downs were large factors, the two companies said earnings suffered from weaker margins in crude oil, chemicals and fuel production. They gave tepid outlooks for the near term.  Shares of Exxon and Chevron were both at least 3% lower in morning trade on the mixed results and worries about slowing global economic growth.  Fourth-quarter results at Exxon fell below Wall Street\u2019s recently lowered estimate, with earnings of $5.6 billion, down from $6 billion a year ago. Its per share profit excluding one-time gain from asset sales was 41 cents, below Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 43 cents and 71 cents prior to a recent warning.

Slideshow ( 4 images )  Exxon is hoping to raise up to $2 billion from the sale of its 6.8 percent in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea, according to industry sources.  Rival Chevron said in a statement to Reuters it had also decided to launch the sale of its 9.57 percent stake in ACG as well as its 8.9 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.  Exxon spokeswoman Julie King declined to comment, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on market rumors or speculation\u201d. A spokesman for Azerbaijan\u2019s state energy company Socar said: \u201cThe report is about Exxon and there is no need for Socar to get involved.\u201d  For both companies, the sale would mark the end of a 25-year involvement. Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan\u2019s current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994.  The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the \u201cthe contract of the century\u201d thanks to the field\u2019s large reserves and hopes of future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas.  Even though the project is operated by British oil major BP BP.L, it had received substantial U.S. government support and a total of five American companies initially participated in the deal, including Exxon, Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil and McDermott.  BP said it had no information about Exxon\u2019s or Chevron\u2019s plans.  The ACG project received particular Western support due to hopes it would help cut Europe\u2019s reliance on Russian energy, but those hopes faded as new large discoveries failed to materialize.  Most U.S. companies sold out of the project or were acquired by rivals, while U.S. support to the Azeri administration also shrank.  Azerbaijan also became more assertive in controlling its energy wealth by building up large stakes in its energy projects via state company Socar.  Other than Exxon and Chevron, BP holds a 30.4 percent stake in ACG and Socar a 25 percent stake.  The ACG fields still account for the lion\u2019s share of Azeri oil output. They produced around three quarters of overall Azeri crude output, or nearly 600,000 barrels per day, in the first half of 2018.  Other ACG consortium members include Japan\u2019s Inpex with 9.3 percent and Norway\u2019s Equinor with 7.3 percent. Turkey\u2019s TPAO, Japan\u2019s Itochu, and India\u2019s ONGC Videsh have smaller stakes.  Exxon and Chevron have in recent years increasingly focused on developing shale fields in the United States. Exxon is also set to invest billions in developing a string of large oil discoveries in Guyana, while Chevron is developing the extension of the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan, estimated to cost $37 billion.

A second senior U.S. official said the Chevron action, part of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy aimed at stifling trade in Venezuelan crude, \u201cwill further deprive access to financial lifelines\u201d the Venezuelan leader depends on to keep his hold on power.  The Trump administration has waged a campaign of sanctions and diplomatic measures in an effort to oust Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.  Venezuela\u2019s oil exports have dropped by one-third since the United States and dozens of other countries recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s legitimate interim president in January of last year. Even so, Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela\u2019s military as well as Russia, China and Cuba.  Chevron said the new license permits the company to undertake limited maintenance of essential operations in the country.  \u201cWe will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations,\u201d spokesman Ray Fohr said.  \u2018WHAT LITTLE WAS LEFT\u2019  Washington has ramped up sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s key oil industry in recent months. Trump\u2019s hardline approach has strong support in the Cuban-American community in south Florida, a key constituency in an important swing state as he seeks re-election in November.  Still, some U.S. officials have privately said Trump is frustrated over the failure of his Venezuela policy to unseat Maduro.  Chevron\u2019s joint ventures with PDVSA accounted for 23% of Venezuela\u2019s total output of just over 700,000 barrels per day as of late March, according to private estimates. Even before the new restrictions, the company canceled service contracts at its two largest joint ventures, which it attributed to falling crude prices.  \u201cThe collapse in prices made it practically irrelevant if Chevron was there or not,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, an energy economist at Rice University, saying that investing in oil production in Venezuela was not profitable at current prices. \u201cIt becomes more relevant in three or four months if oil prices recover.\u201d  The Petropiar <C}RO7309543407> heavy crude upgrader - a Chevron-PDVSA joint venture key for turning Venezuela\u2019s sludgy crude into exportable grades, was operating normally on Wednesday to produce some 90,000 barrels, said one person familiar with the plant\u2019s operations.  The new restrictions also apply to oilfield services companies like Halliburton HAL.N and Schlumberger SLB.N, which have significantly scaled back activities in Venezuela but maintain a presence. The vast majority of their remaining contracts were with Chevron joint ventures, two industry sources said.  \u201cThis has dynamited what little was left of the national oil industry,\u201d said one person close to a Western oil company in Venezuela. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have contracts with Chevron, well, we don\u2019t have contracts with anybody.  Halliburton declined to comment. Schlumberger said it was working with outside counsel \u201cto interpret the new license and what this means for operations in Venezuela.\u201d  The U.S. Treasury recently blacklisted two trading units of Russian oil giant Rosneft ROSN.MM, for conducting business with PDVSA. Rosneft had accused Washington of double standards for allowing U.S. companies to continue working in Venezuela.  Rosneft announced last month it was exiting Venezuela and had sold its assets to an unnamed Russian state oil company. The company has since stopped shipping gasoline to Venezuela in exchange for some crude shipments, resulting in acute shortages of motor fuel across the South American country.  Washington has also pressured other companies that swap fuel for Venezuela's crude, including Spain's Repsol REP.MC, to stop. The official said on Wednesday it had made clear to Repsol such swaps were \"sanctionable.\"  Asked whether Rosneft has done enough to get sanctions lifted on its trading unit, the official said: \u201cNot yet.\u201d  Washington was watching closely to see whether Rosneft Trading \u201cpermanently ceases any interaction with the Maduro regime,\u201d the official said.","103":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp\u2019s proposed $33-billion deal for Anadarko Petroleum Corp vaults the company into top ranks of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies and cements its chief executive, Mike Wirth, as a dealmaker.

The Anadarko deal was negotiated over the last few weeks, though Chevron has been thinking about the deal for some time, Wirth, a chemical engineer by training, said.  Chevron regularly evaluates potential deals and has a number of companies \u201cthat we\u2019re watching,\u201d said Wirth. But completing the latest purchase is now his priority. \u201cExecuting it well is important, so that will be our focus,\u201d said Wirth.  The Chevron executive is detailed-oriented and a relentless worker, said Mike Sommers, president of industry group American Petroleum Institute, where Wirth is a member of the executive committee. After a recent dinner concluded at 10 p.m., Wirth headed off to make calls to staff overseas, Sommers said.  \u201cHe is not someone who enters into every conversation but when he engages on an issue, he has a way of bringing the room together,\u201d said Sommers.  His agreement with Anadarko marks the company\u2019s biggest expansion since its acquisition of Texaco in 2000. The purchase makes Chevron the top producer in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale field. It also expands its oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico and in liquefied natural gas.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago you wouldn\u2019t have heard the word \u2018Permian\u2019 in anything from Chevron,\u201d said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise Capital.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Marco Bello\/File Photo  The Treasury Department renewed the license through Oct. 25 for Chevron, the last U.S. oil company operating in OPEC member Venezuela.  In January, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company PDVSA in an effort to oust Maduro. But it issued Chevron, which has been in Venezuela for nearly 100 years, a six-month license to operate.  Washington supports opposition leader Juan Guaido, head of the National Assembly. The sanctions on PDVSA have cost Maduro\u2019s government billions of dollars in oil assets.  A senior Trump administration official said most U.S. agencies had argued against any renewal of the license, and the Treasury Department had pressed for a full six-month renewal.  \u201cUltimately what came about was a compromise position,\u201d amid concerns from President Donald Trump about staying tough on Maduro, the official said.  Chevron has four joint ventures with PDVSA that produce the equivalent of about 200,000 barrels per day of oil, and its stake in the ventures recently produced about 40,000 bpd.  Chevron has about 8,000 employees, contractors and direct suppliers involved in the ventures. \u201cOur operations in Venezuela continue in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations,\u201d Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said in a release.

Tweaking the language from the original license, the department said the renewals were granted for \u201cmaintenance of operations\u201d in Venezuela, showing companies were not allowed to expand their local operations.  \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019re giving them an opportunity to maintain a foothold but we don\u2019t want them to become Maduro\u2019s crutch,\u201d the senior official said. The three-month period signals that any further extensions after late October will be harder for companies to come by, the official said.  An analyst said U.S. presidential politics could make it harder to get renewals going forward.  \u201cAs we got closer to the 2020 presidential election, I see the Trump administration wanting to get tougher,\u201d said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington and an Energy Department official under former President George W.

Other officials, including national security adviser John Bolton favored letting Chevron\u2019s license expire in hopes it would dent energy production and tighten the noose on Maduro\u2019s leadership.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo\/File Photo  Shares of both companies rose about 3 percent.  The two U.S. oil majors missed the first stage of the shale boom in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and have been investing billions of dollars to make up for lost time. They are betting their size and other businesses offer advantages smaller producers cannot duplicate.  Combined, the two companies pumped 677,000 barrels of oil and gas per day in the shale field last quarter, close to a fifth of the region\u2019s total oil production, according to figures released on Friday.  Exxon said its fourth-quarter Permian production was 300,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, up 93 percent from a year ago and up 12 percent over the third quarter. Chevron\u2019s output in the Permian jumped to 377,000 barrels per day, up 84 percent from the same period a year earlier.  \u201cIn just two years we have doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development and operating costs, and more than doubled our production,\u201d Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said on an earnings call.  Both companies are tying their shale operations to logistics and refining arms that independents do not have.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to be advantaged versus the rest of industry,\u201d Exxon CEO Darren Woods said on an earnings call, noting the company\u2019s close coupling of pipeline, logistics and oil refining operations to shale.  In nine of the previous 10 quarters Exxon\u2019s overall oil and gas output dropped, but its fourth-quarter production edged up to just over 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 3.9 million in the year-ago period.  Production at Exxon, the nation\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, was \u201cvery strong,\u201d said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones.  The Permian, now producing 3.85 million barrels per day, is forecast to generate 5.4 million barrels per day by 2023, greater than any single OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia, according to consultancy IHS Markit.  Shale fields\u2019 fast payoff is lifting both companies\u2019 earnings and cash flow. Chevron generated $9.2 billion in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, up from $8.0 billion a year earlier. Its 2019 capital spending budget is going toward projects that can deliver cash within two years, Wirth said.  Exxon, in addition to shale, continues to invest heavily in major refining, chemical and offshore projects.  That has not sat well with some investors. Its stock is off 13 percent in the 12 months ended Jan. 31. Exxon is the only international oil company \u201cnot currently repurchasing shares,\u201d Simmons Energy said in a note.  Exxon shares were up 3.03 percent at $75.50 in afternoon trading, and Chevron shares were up 3.04 percent at $118.13.  Exxon\u2019s fourth-quarter net income fell to $6 billion, or $1.41 a share, from $8.38 billion a year ago, when results benefited substantially from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impacts of tax reform and asset impairments, earnings rose to $6.4 billion from $3.73 billion a year ago.

Chevron\u2019s stock is down a lesser 38% year to date compared to a 52% decline at Exxon, which this year was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a position it held since the index was created.  Exxon\u2019s weak earnings have forced it to borrow to finance its nearly $15 billion a year shareholder dividend and cover spending on new projects.  In part, Chevron\u2019s finances have benefited from its faster divesting of unwanted assets. Exxon has struggled to unload unwanted oilfields despite promising to accelerate the sales in early 2019. Exxon officials have said they are reviewing all its operations for cuts, but have signaled that major savings will not come this year.","111":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand.  Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world\u2019s top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.  Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. U.S. crude prices have plunged nearly 70% this year to under $20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever.  Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts.  \u201cWe would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,\u201d Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.  The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output.  Exxon\u2019s biggest cuts will come in the Permian, \u201cwhere the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted,\u201d said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods.  FILE PHOTO: A logo of the Exxon Mobil Corp is seen at the Rio Oil and Gas Expo and Conference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 24, 2018.

The company posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.  (For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: )  Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30% this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to $14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at $23 billion, the lowest in four years.  Even though their results topped Wall Street\u2019s reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7% to $43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8% to $89.44.  Chevron\u2019s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it \u201ca defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.  Exxon\u2019s balance sheet \u201cis strong enough to withstand the current environment,\u201d but it needs oil prices around $75 per barrel this year to break even versus around $50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.  U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around $19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around $26 per barrel.  Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.  Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc\u2019s first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.","112":"(Repeats with no changes)  Sept 16 (Reuters) - EQT Corp, the largest U.S. natural gas producer by volume, has placed a bid on Chevron Corp\u2019s Appalachia gas properties and a pipeline stake, people familiar with the matter said.  EQT offered $750 million for the properties, one of the people familiar with the matter said.  Chevron last year said it was considering sale of the properties and took an $8.17 billion charge to earnings to write down their value and an unrelated U.S. offshore project. Most of the impairment charge was for the gas properties.  Chevron is marketing about 800,000 acres in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins of Pennsylvania and neighboring states and a 31% non-operating interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, which has intrastate and gathering lines servicing the Marcellus shale area.  EQT declined to comment. EQT Chief Executive Toby Rice in July described Appalachia shale as \u201ca buyer\u2019s market,\u201d and called consolidation an opportunity for the Pittsburgh-based company.  Bids for the properties were received on Aug. 12 and are being evaluated, Chevron said in response to inquiries. It declined to comment on the bids.  There is no guarantee the talks will lead to a sale to EQT or another company.  The shale assets are from Chevron\u2019s purchase of producer Atlas Energy for $4.3 billion including debt in 2010, a time when shale gas fields were selling at large premiums. A year earlier, Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to pay $30 billion for XTO Energy, then a large Appalachian shale basin operator.  The deals soured for both companies. In addition to Chevron\u2019s writedown, Exxon later took a $2 billion writedown on the value of its natural gas assets.  U.S. natural gas futures are trading at about $2.27 a million British Thermal Units (BTUs) and have languished well below their peak 12 years ago when gas traded as high as $12.78 per million British Thermal Units.  The Appalachian assets last year produced 262 million cubic feet of natural gas, on a net daily basis. EQT had average daily sales volumes of about 4.1 billion cubic feet equivalent.

Chevron confirmed that it was offering buyouts to workers in its shale gas business in the eastern United States but did not comment on any other U.S. job cuts.  Other oil and gas producers and service companies have begun cutting workers as prices have dived on soaring production and tepid demand, which has been made worse by the coronavirus outbreak.  One of the sources said some employees who accept Chevron\u2019s buyout offer could remain until October. Another source said the company hopes to open spots for people who currently work for its shale gas operation in the Appalachian region of the United States, which is on the auction block.  Chevron notified Pennsylvania state officials last month that it planned to cut up to 320 jobs in the state, which includes the shale gas business.  The company said in a statement it could not yet say how many employees in that business would be affected. \u201cWe are taking active steps to reduce job loss,\u201d including moving employees to other operations, a spokeswoman said.  Employees who ultimately lose their jobs will be offered severance pay and outplacement services, the spokeswoman said. The restructuring is part of a business review \u201ctoward capturing efficiencies and directing resources where they will generate the most value,\u201d she said.  Chevron overall employed 48,200 workers globally at the end of last year, down 7,000 from three years ago. About 53% of its workers, or 25,400 employees, are in the United States.  Chevron\u2019s results swung to a loss last quarter on a $10.4 billion impairment charge, mostly from writing down the value of natural gas fields and projects.  The U.S. shale boom has led to a glut of crude oil and natural gas in world markets, especially since the coronavirus outbreak has slashed energy demand, with experts forecasting growth this year to be the lowest in a decade.  U.S. oil futures CLc1 have fallen 24% since the year began to $46.69 a barrel and natural gas futures have collapsed 40% since hitting an eight-month high in November. [O\/R]  This week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will consider a further output cut to prevent prices from falling further. About 16% of U.S. natural gas production comes as a byproduct of oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Shale gas has so overwhelmed demand that producers in West Texas are paying customers to take the fuel and some are burning it as waste.  Chevron's rivals, including Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N, Apache Corp APA.N and Gulfport Energy Corp GPOR.O, have already cut workers in response to the gas glut.

After production began at Bangka, Chevron submitted a revision for the second phase of the development, to extract gas from the Gendalo and Gehem fields.  Chevron has a 62% interest in the Bangka project and about 63% in the Gendalo-Gehem project, it says on its website.  Indonesia is negotiating with Chevron and its partners, Italy\u2019s ENI and China\u2019s Sinopec, to revise the development plan for the next stage of the IDD project.  In 2018, the government said Chevron planned to halve its investment for the project to $6 billion, from $12.8 billion.  In September, oil and gas regulator SKK Migas said Chevron was cutting its planned investment in IDD, resulting in lower peak gas output than expected.  Peak output was expected to reach about 700 million to 800 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd), compared with an initial estimate of more than 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), when the Gendalo and Gehem hubs start production.  The regulator is targeting a production start date of 2025 for the two gas hubs and aims to have the project supply gas to the Bontang LNG plant in East Kalimantan.  \u201cWe believe the project will have value for another operator and the Kutei Basin can continue to be developed safely and responsibly,\u201d Chevron said.","118":"Oct 3 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp aims to reduce oil production-related greenhouse gas emissions by 5% to 10% over a seven-year period ending 2023 as part of an ongoing effort to combat global climate change, the U.S. energy major said on Thursday.  Chevron, part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) along with Exxon Mobil Corp and BP Plc, said it will also target a reduction of 2% to 5% in green house gas emissions from gas production over the same period.  OGCI, formed in 2014, is a group of 13 major oil companies that account for 32% of global oil and gas production. It aims to reduce methane emissions and increase carbon efficiency. The companies have also been investing in carbon capture technology that traps carbon in caverns or porous spaces underground.  The oil and gas industry has been under pressure from activists concerned about the effects of climate change, with scientists saying that the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade to avoid catastrophic warming.  Energy companies are on the front line of a global transition to a low-carbon economy, with investors potentially on the hook for hefty losses if the companies do not overhaul their business models in time.  Chevron said it had so far spent more than $1 billion on carbon capture and storage projects in Australia and Canada and the investment is expected to reduce greenhouse emissions by about 5 million metric tons per year.

The move comes ahead of the Dec. 1 expiration of Chevron\u2019s license to continue operating in Venezuela despite U.S. sanctions on state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to choke off revenue to President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government.  A Chevron spokesman confirmed that the company was making an \u201corganizational adjustment\u201d in Venezuela, as part of the global reduction in headcount by 10-15% prompted by the crude price plunge and drop in oil and gas demand spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chevron's oil and gas production writedowns totaled $5.6 billion, mirroring those in recent days at Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and Eni ENI.MI, and an anticipated asset writedown of up to $17.5 billion from BP BP.L.  The lowering of valuations reflect the slump in second-quarter demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a growing realization that a prolonged economic downturn could depress energy prices for years. U.S. gross domestic product contracted last quarter at a 32.9% annualized rate, the deepest decline in economic activity in modern history.  \u201cIt will take years for that to recover and the price for our products is tied to economic activity,\u201d Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.  Chevron\u2019s writedowns included its entire investment in crisis-ravaged Venezuela, where it was the last major U.S. oil company still operating. The Trump administration has directed it to wind down its business there.  The loss includes $1 billion to cover severance pay for up to 15% of its 45,000-person workforce as part of an ongoing restructuring of its global operations.  Rival Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N also posted a loss on lower prices and production and said it was in the midst of reviewing operations, promising \"significant\" cost cuts.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Chevron\u2019s latest writedowns follow a $10 billion charge it took to reduce the value of mostly natural gas properties in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Output last quarter fell by about 189,000 barrels of oil and gas per day compared with a year ago, reflecting its efforts to limit losses by curtailing production and earlier property sales.  The writedown of oil and gas properties included non-shale operations in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, offshore Gulf of Mexico fields, and undefined properties outside the United States, Breber said.  \u201cWe would need to see sustained economic recovery and much lower inventory levels before we would add capital back to the Permian or other basins,\u201d Breber said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a lower-for-longer world where demand is down and there\u2019s ample supply.\u201d  Chevron, which has won plaudits for its recent ability to fund shareholder payouts and capital spending from operations, generated no cash flow from operations, instead consuming $643 million in the quarter.  Despite this, the company \u201cexited the worst quarter in recent history with a strong balance sheet and well-positioned to support its dividend,\u201d said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.  The writedowns pushed Chevron\u2019s loss to $8.27 billion, or $4.44 a share, compared with a profit of $4.3 billion, or $2.27 a share, a year ago. Adjusted loss was $3 billion, or $1.59 per share, compared with a profit of $3.4 billion, or $1.77 per share, last year, it reported.  The loss reflects an average 65% reduction in the prices received for its petroleum produced last quarter as demand plummeted amid COVID-19 travel restrictions and declining industrial demand for fuels.  Chevron shares fell 2.7% to close at $83.94 and are off 31% year to date.  The company has resisted leaving Venezuela, arguing its presence was a stabilizing presence and supported local workers. Any exit would hand over its assets to Russian or Chinese oil companies, it has said. Chevron has operated in the country for nearly 100 years, mostly recently through joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.  But the Trump administration gave Chevron until December to wind down its business there amid U.S. sanctions designed to oust the government of socialist President Nicolas Maduro. Chevron wrote off the $2.6 billion value of its Venezuelan assets, which in June produced 7,000 barrels per day, Breber said.","126":"Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp said on Wednesday it would buy an oil refinery in Pasadena, Texas from Brazil\u2019s Petrobras for $350 million.

Seeking to ratchet up pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed tight new restrictions on Chevron\u2019s joint ventures with Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA, which could pave the way for the California-based company\u2019s departure.  Chevron has had a special U.S. operating license exempting it from sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s vital oil sector since January, but the latest three-month waiver was due to expire on Wednesday.  The action targets what some Trump administration officials say is a key financial lifeline for Maduro as Washington seeks to stifle trade in Venezuelan crude and remove his grip on power.  Chevron and other U.S. oil companies are being squeezed amid a coronavirus-induced supply glut. The collapse in oil prices has threatened to tilt the once-booming U.S. oil industry into bankruptcy. Chevron\u2019s shares have fallen sharply over the last two days, after U.S. crude futures on Monday fell into negative territory for the first time in history.  The decision on Chevron was made after a fierce debate in the administration, with some officials arguing the United States needed to keep a corporate beachhead in the crisis-hit country, while more hawkish Trump aides said staying in Venezuela was helping Maduro keep his grip on power, according to people familiar with the matter.  Treasury\u2019s announcement appeared to mark a partial compromise by setting a potential end point for Chevron\u2019s operations in Venezuela, where the company has been active for about a century, while giving it more than seven months to bring it to a close.  Treasury said Chevron, under a much more restrictive temporary license, would be allowed only to conduct transactions with PDVSA \u201cnecessary for the limited maintenance of essential operations in Venezuela or the wind down of operations\u201d by the beginning of December.  Chevron would be barred from the drilling, sale and transport of Venezuelan oil, infrastructure work except for safety reasons and any financial transactions with PDVSA. Treasury stopped short of formally ordering Chevron out of Venezuela, but will allow so little activity there that it might be untenable to stay.  FILE PHOTO: A Chevron gas station sign is seen in Del Mar, California, in this April 25, 2013 file photo. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The announcement also covered oilfield service firms Baker Hughes Co BKR.N, Halliburton Co HAL.N, Schlumberger NV SLB.N and Weatherford International, which had regularly received U.S. permission to remain in the country. The four services firms, however, have already largely ceased operations in Venezuela.  Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the company will comply with applicable laws and regulations on activities it is authorized to undertake in Venezuela. Fohr said Chevron is committed to its employees and its social and humanitarian programs in Venezuela.  \u2018MAXIMUM PRESSURE\u2019  The Trump administration has waged a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign of sanctions and diplomatic measures in an effort to oust Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.  Venezuela\u2019s oil exports have dropped by one-third since the United States and dozens of other countries recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s legitimate interim president in January of last year.  But Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela\u2019s military as well as Russia, China and Cuba. Some U.S. officials have said this has been a growing source of frustration for President Donald Trump.  Washington has ramped up sanctions on Venezuela in recent months. Treasury recently blacklisted two trading units of Russian oil giant Rosneft ROSN.MM, for conducting business with PDVSA. Rosneft accused Washington of double standards for allowing U.S. companies to continue working in Venezuela.  Chevron\u2019s waiver allowed it to continue producing oil in collaboration with PDVSA and trade cargoes of Venezuelan crude in international markets.  Some U.S. officials justified the waiver extensions as a way to help Venezuela safeguard its crumbling oil infrastructure for a future democratic government. They also argued that Russia could fill the void if Chevron pulled out.  Chevron holds stakes in four oil and gas joint ventures with PDVSA. Those include two of Venezuela\u2019s largest oil fields - Petroboscan in western Zulia state and Petropiar in the Orionoco oil belt - which together produce around a quarter of the country\u2019s total crude output.  Chevron last month canceled service contracts and procurement processes at the two joint ventures, a move the company attributed to falling crude prices. The company said its share of output at its joint ventures dropped 16% in 2019 to 35,000 barrels per day, mirroring the decline in crude output across the country.","128":"March 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp:  * CHEVRON AFFIRMS CASH FLOW GROWTH AND CAPITAL DISCIPLINE  * CHEVRON CORP - INTEND TO GROW FREE CASH FLOW IN 2018 AND THEREAFTER  * CHEVRON - EVEN WITH NO COMMODITY PRICE APPRECIATION, EXPECT TO DELIVER \u201cSTRONGER\u201d UPSTREAM CASH MARGINS, PRODUCTION GROWTH IN 2018  * CHEVRON - TENGIZ GROWTH PROJECT IN KAZAKHSTAN IS ON TRACK TO DELIVER FIRST PRODUCTION IN 2022  * CHEVRON SAYS $18 BILLION TO $20 BILLION ANNUAL INVESTMENT RANGE PROJECTED THROUGH 2020  * CHEVRON - CO IS ADVANCING DEVELOPMENT OF UNCONVENTIONAL RESOURCES, PARTICULARLY IN U.S. PERMIAN BASIN  * CHEVRON CORP - \u201cAS WE GENERATE SURPLUS CASH, WE WOULD EXPECT TO BE IN A POSITION TO RESUME OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\u201d Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:","129":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron (CVX) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016.

FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows the newly arrived foundation platform of Leviathan natural gas field, in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Haifa, Israel January 31, 2019. Marc Israel Sellem\/Pool via REUTERS\/File Photo  CEO Michael Wirth\u2019s pivot away from home is underpinned by a bet that the Middle East is entering an era of reconciliation that will make it ideal for tapping natural gas, as demand for the cheaper and cleaner fuel is forecast to outstrip oil.  The new strategy is seeing the company pitch new gas deals in Egypt, Israel, Qatar, while cutting spending on American shale exploration.  The plan is anchored by Wirth\u2019s $11.8 billion purchase this month of U.S.-based Noble Energy, which holds a stake of about 40% in the aptly-named Leviathan gas field in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Israel.  \u201cFive years ago the Eastern Med wasn\u2019t viewed as endowed from a resource standpoint as I think most people would say today. That\u2019s a fundamental shift,\u201d Wirth told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of capital investment required in the near term,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a time when cash flow matters, that\u2019s a very appealing attribute.\u201d  The deal brings an alliance with Israel that has been smoothed by the narrowing of some historical rifts in the region, such as the establishment of formal ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in an agreement signed last month.  Wirth said Middle Eastern commercial and diplomatic relations \u201care becoming more codified and stronger, that\u2019s a trend that we think augurs well for the region.\u201d  Chevron also made a courtesy call about the Noble deal to officials in Saudi Arabia, a key partner in several Chevron oil projects and a nation with historically strained relations with Israel, according to a senior source at the U.S. company.  The Saudi government media communications office did not respond to a request for comment, while Chevron said it did not discuss details of meetings.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  RISKS AND RENEWABLES  Yet the regional political and security risks that have deterred some companies in recent years still exist.  Syria and Yemen are riven by wars, with uncertain consequences for a wider region where archrivals Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a proxy battle.  Just this January, the U.S. killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq - and a reprisal by Tehran - illustrated the instability of the Middle East and threatened to engulf it in conflict.  Despite such risks, Chevron - which at one point leap-frogged rival ExxonMobil this month to be the largest U.S. oil company by market value - is plowing ahead with efforts across the region.  The Leviathan field and others nearby have the potential to become major factors in regional fuel supplies. Chevron could send gas to a Egyptian liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant that could ship the fuel to Europe or Asia, Wirth said.  European and Asian nations have been moving toward gas, solar and wind, and away from coal and nuclear power.  \u201cThe reality is you need gas in tandem with renewables,\u201d said Christopher Kalnin, CEO of Banpu Kalnin Ventures, which invests in U.S. shale gas. Asia in particular will remain dependent on imported gas, he said, because it complements solar and wind.  Global gas demand through 2025 is projected to rise 1.5% per year on average, largely on growing purchases by customers in China and India.  In contrast, oil consumption may have already peaked at last year\u2019s 100 million barrel per day (bpd) level, forecasters say, and this year could sink to 91.7 million bpd, a seven-year low.  PERMIAN COST-CUTTING  The Middle East produces a third of the world\u2019s oil and one sixth of its natural gas, and has long drawn the interest of foreign oil companies. Chevron produces fewer barrels of oil and gas in the region than other majors, according to Rystad Energy data, but it is the only major to have had a continuous presence in Saudi Arabia for 70 years and has maintained good relations with governments in the region.  \"Chevron is extremely good at what I would call crown jewel government relations, big assets in challenging countries,\" said Robin West, a board member of Spanish oil major Repsol SA REP.MC and head of Boston Consulting Group's Center for Energy Impact. \"They very quietly work away at things.\"  The Noble deal fits Wirth\u2019s effort to adapt to a low-cost energy world and expand in Qatar, Egypt and Iraq. It brought Chevron nearly 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, and ensures it remains among the world\u2019s top 10 gas suppliers.  \u201cThe size of the opportunity was way beyond the capacity of a company like Noble,\u201d said a former Chevron executive who declined to be identified because of ongoing relationships.  The purchase may help Chevron's bid for a stake in Qatar's LNG production expansion, where it is competing with Exxon, Shell and Total SA TOTF.PA, among others. Chevron also recently signed a preliminary agreement for oil exploration in southern Iraq.

Slideshow ( 3 images )  At a hearing in San Francisco federal court, Chevron attorney Theodore Boutrous also said that the scientific consensus about greenhouse gas emissions did not fully form until the past decade.  The cities of San Francisco and Oakland, California sued Chevron Corp CVX.N, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, ConocoPhillips COP.N, Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDSa.L, and BP PLC BP.L last year, seeking an abatement fund to help the cities address flooding they say is a result of climate change.  The companies argued in legal filings on Tuesday that the case should be dismissed, partly because Congress has given regulatory agencies, not the courts, authority over the production and emission of fossil fuels.  The lawsuits, filed by Democratic Party politicians, are part of a larger campaign to address climate change in the courts. Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits on climate change in 25 countries, a U.N. study said last year.  U.S. District Judge William Alsup invited both sides to the hearing to describe their views on \u201cthe best science now available\u201d on global warming and rising sea levels.  Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office 14 months ago, domestic climate change policy has been turned on its head. Republican Trump has pushed to increase production of fossil fuels and said he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions but Washington has not disengaged from it completely.  In court on Wednesday, Boutrous said Chevron supports a 2013 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded it was \u201cextremely likely\u201d humans contribute to warming. However, Boutrous also said earlier IPCC reports were not as certain.  The judge asked Boutrous if the other four companies agreed with his presentation, and Boutrous said he was only speaking for Chevron.  No attorneys for the other four companies answered questions at the hearing, though all generally acknowledge the reality of climate change.  \u201cI\u2019m going to ask them at some point if they agree with everything you said,\u201d Alsup said.  All five companies argued in court papers on Tuesday that they should not be held liable for warming, which is caused by \u201cbillions\u201d of parties and \u201ccomplex environmental phenomena occurring worldwide over many decades.\u201d","135":"(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp has acquired a stake in Noble Energy Inc, the oil and gas producer which agreed in July to be bought by Chevron Corp for $5 billion.

FILE PHOTO: The Occidental Petroleum Corp headquarters is pictured in Los Angeles, California September 16, 2013. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  Both suitors are offering a premium for Anadarko\u2019s holdings in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using new, low-cost drilling techniques.  Occidental\u2019s surprise $76-per-share bid is valued at $57 billion, including debt. That is well above Chevron\u2019s $65-per-share offer, worth $50 billion including debt, and would make an Occidental-Anadarko deal the fourth-largest in terms of oil production.  Anadarko said it had received the bid, but had not yet determined whether it was a \u201csuperior proposal,\u201d and for now reaffirmed its recommendation of a sale to Chevron.  \u201cWe are confident the transaction agreed to by Chevron and Anadarko will be completed,\u201d said Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson.  Occidental, meanwhile, said it boosted the cash portion of its offer to 50 percent. Chevron offered 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock.  Anadarko shares jumped 11.6 percent to close at $71.40, well above the $65 per share offered by Chevron. Occidental shares dipped 0.6 percent to $62 and Chevron\u2019s were 3.1 percent lower at $118.28 on the day.  A deal would add nearly a quarter million acres to Occidental\u2019s holdings in the lucrative Permian shale basin, and double its global production to 1.4 million barrels of oil and gas per day.  \u201cWe are very confident. Our proposal is so strong, it\u2019s definitely superior, and we now know the value which we can communicate to shareholders,\u201d Vicki Hollub, Occidental\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview. She said the deal would boost cash flow and allow Occidental to raise its dividend over time.  Still, Occidental has lost more than 7 percent of its value since it disclosed its interest in Anadarko. It faces hurdles to sell its own shareholders on the deal.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think a bidding war with Chevron (CVX) is in the best interest of OXY shareholders,\u201d analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a client note.  Occidental is \u201cgoing head-to-head against a supermajor four times its size\u201d and Chevron is likely to win, said Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James, adding \u201cthis is an extremely fluid situation.\u201d  VALUE \u2018IN THE SHALE\u2019  A combined Occidental and Anadarko would be a \u201clong-term leader in the Permian,\u201d Hollub said, noting that Anadarko\u2019s shale assets in the Permian Basin and in Colorado are most appealing to Occidental.  \u201cThe value of this is in the shale,\u201d said Hollub, who ran Occidental\u2019s Permian Basin operations before becoming CEO in 2016.  The Anadarko board will have to give the Occidental offer \u201cstrong consideration,\u201d and would be \u201chard pressed\u201d to reject it outright even though it clearly prefers to sell to Chevron, said Brian Kessens, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which holds shares in an Anadarko pipeline business and in Chevron.  Occidental\u2019s latest offer could pressure Chevron to revise its bid, analysts said, although Kessens said Chevron has no incentive to do so unless the Anadarko board accepts Occidental\u2019s.  \u201cSomething tells me this isn\u2019t going to be the last foray between these companies,\u201d Kessens said.  Occidental must deliver strong growth or it could itself become a takeover target, said a person familiar with merger-and-acquisition discussions. Currently, there about $40 billion of onshore oil assets up for sale in the United States.  Occidental\u2019s offer would require shareholder votes at both companies. Anadarko would have to pay Chevron a $1 billion break-up fee if its board chooses Occidental\u2019s offer.  \u201cIt is unfortunate that Anadarko agreed to pay a break up fee of $1 billion, representing approximately $2 per share, without even picking up the phone to speak to us after we made two proposals during the week of April 8,\u201d Hollub wrote in a letter to Anadarko\u2019s board.  Analysts have said they expect further industry consolidation. Small oil producers revolutionized the sector through advances in horizontal drilling and fracking, but their stock prices have languished with investors pressing for higher returns.  The Permian produces about 4 million barrels per day (bpd), and is expected to hit 5.4 million bpd by 2023, according to consultancy IHS Markit, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.  Occidental has offered $38 in cash and 0.6094 of its shares for each share of Anadarko. It represents a premium of 19 percent to Anadarko\u2019s closing price on Tuesday and 62 percent to the closing price on April 11, the day before Chevron made its bid.  Under Chevron\u2019s bid, Anadarko shareholders would receive 0.3869 share of Chevron and $16.25 in cash for each Anadarko share.","137":"(Reuters) - Chevron on Friday said it was evacuating offshore personnel and initiating shut-in procedures at four offshore platforms and removing non-essential workers from two additional facilities as a pair of tropical cyclones took aim at the U.S. Gulf Coast.

REUTERS\/Toby Melville  LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has postponed decisions on whether to go ahead with two large oil and gas developments in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea after oil prices collapsed due to the coronavirus crisis, a company source said on Wednesday.  The Anglo-Dutch company slashed its 2020 spending plans by a fifth as measures to halt the spread of the virus led to an unprecedented drop in oil demand and sent oil prices to their lowest in two decades.  As a result of this, the source said Shell had delayed a final investment decision (FID) to 2021 on whether to develop its Whale discovery in the southern part of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The source said some work on the project continued.  A decision on Whale was initially planned for later this year, following the discovery in 2017 of what Shell said was one of its biggest finds here in recent years.  Shell, the operator of the Whale project, holds 60% in the field, while Chevron holds the remaining 40%.  The project\u2019s pace has slowed and an investment decision has been put off to next year, a Chevron spokeswoman said. The U.S. oil major last month cut its 2020 project budget by $4 billion and suspended share buybacks to save cash.  Shell also decided this month to defer a decision about the Jackdaw natural gas field in Britain\u2019s North Sea, the source said. The development plan originally envisaged linking the field to the existing Shearwater platform by 2024.  The delays come after private-equity backed Siccar Point, Shell\u2019s partner in another North Sea project, Cambo, announced on March 20 that the FID on the field was pushed back to 2021 due to coronavirus.  Shell previously said projects it would develop would be built to generate profit with Brent crude at $30 a barrel or more. The benchmark was around $20 on Wednesday.","140":"(Repeats with no changes to text)  BANGKOK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron Corp has decided to continue negotiations with Thailand rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay the bill for removing offshore oil and gas platforms, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.  Thailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs for the energy infrastructure, estimated by one local newspaper at up to $2.5 billion.  The dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France\u2019s Total SA and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.  \u201cWe have agreed to temporarily suspend the arbitration process to allow more time for resolution discussions,\u201d a Chevron spokesman told Reuters, adding that the company was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the Thai energy minister\u2019s desire to come to an agreement.  A spokesman for Thailand\u2019s energy ministry on Wednesday said he could not comment on talks with Chevron.  Minister of Energy Sontirat Sontijirawong said in July he wanted to resolve the dispute as a matter of urgency to avoid arbitration, but that the issue was complicated.  The dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs to decommission all installed assets even if they no longer operate those assets.  Chevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts dating from 1971, it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer usable.  Chevron is due to hand over operation of the Erawan gas field to Thailand\u2019s state-owned oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl in April 2022 when its concessions expire. The new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning the assets it has installed, including those it transfers over to PTTEP.  Chevron told Reuters in July that moving to an arbitration process provided for by the 1971 contracts was a possibility.  The company had objected to a request by Thailand\u2019s energy ministry to pay a security deposit for the full decommissioning cost of all of the company\u2019s assets in the Erawan gas field.  Neither Chevron nor the ministry would disclose the amount of the requested guarantee when asked by Reuters. But local newspaper Thansettakij has reported it as around 75 billion baht ($2.5 billion), citing industry sources.  The Chevron spokesman said arbitration was still a possibility if talks do not succeed.  RETROACTIVE LAW  Other operators in Thailand are watching the dispute closely in case it changes their future liabilities for assets in Thailand. Foreign investors in Thailand in other industries were also concerned about what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts.  \u201cIt will snowball, as it\u2019s not just Chevron,\u201d said Kornkasiwat Kasemsri, director of the Energy and Resources Policy Research Center at Thailand\u2019s Rangsit University.  \u201cWhat decision is made in this case could affect other cases to follow.\u201d  Chevron won the concessions to operate four blocks constituting the Erawan gas field, Thailand\u2019s second largest, from 1972 to 2012, after which the contracts were extended for 10 more years.  The contracts, for blocks 10-11 and 12-13, were first signed under the Petroleum Act of 1971. The act has been amended six times since.  Chevron lost out to PTTEP, a unit of the state-owned PTT Pcl , in a bidding round for the new concession in December.","141":"July 31 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp posted a quarterly net loss on Friday, as the second largest U.S. oil producer took charges of $5.2 billion due to a collapse in oil prices due to the coronavirus pandemic and as related lockdowns decimated fuel demand.

Delek, via its North Sea oil and gas operator Ithaca Energy, could reach an agreement within days, two of five sources said.  U.S. oil major Chevron Corp kicked off the sale of its central North Sea oil and gas fields Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin\/Franklin, Erskine and Jade as well as the Britannia platform and its satellites last July, with the help of U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley.  (GRAPHIC: Chevron assets in the British North Sea - tmsnrt.rs\/2XKfBpR)  One of the sources said that Delek would pay between $1.8 and $2 billion for the assets, which exclude Chevron\u2019s 19.4 percent stake in the BP-operated Clair field.  The Israeli company beat competitors including a consortium formed by Britain\u2019s Premier Oil and U.S. private equity fund Apollo Global Management and also British petrochemical maker Ineos Group, the sources said. It hired JP Morgan and BNP Paribas as advisors to the acquisition.  The acquisition would mark another step for Delek toward its expected public listing, the sources said. The company earlier this month acquired Shell\u2019s 22.45 percent stake in the Caesar-Tonga field in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for $965 million.  Chevron and Delek declined to comment.  Ithaca said in an emailed statement \u201cit is continuously looking at opportunities to grow its business but will not comment on any specific situations or market speculation.\u201d  The deal would be just the latest of many that have transformed the population of North Sea producers over the past five years.  Under pressure from a fall in oil prices to near 14-year lows of $26 a barrel in 2016, major oil and gas companies have been forced to sell assets to private equity-backed investors and specialized operators.  Funds including Neptune, backed by Carlyle Group and CVC Capital Partners, and Chrysaor, backed by EIG Global Partners, among others, have since raised billions of dollars to snap up what they see as bargains in the sector.  Chevron, which produced 50,000 barrels of liquids and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on average in 2017, is looking to free up cash for longer-term, more high margin businesses in the United States.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  The oil price crash has decimated shares of many energy companies, making them attractive targets for those that have weathered the downturn and have the resources to buy. Chevron ended the first quarter with a cash pile of $8.5 billion after withdrawing a $33 billion bid for Anadarko last year and then being among the first big oil companies to slash spending during the downturn.  The purchase boosts Chevron\u2019s investments in U.S. shale, and gives it Noble\u2019s flagship Leviathan field off the shore of Israel, the largest natural gas field in the eastern Mediterranean.  The deal makes Chevron the first oil major to enter Israel. Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth told Reuters \u201cWe certainly are mindful of the fact that there are political differences and tensions\u201d between Israel and neighbors where Chevron also has business including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the Kurdish region of Iraq.

Oil companies are under pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Gas is seen as a cleaner burning fuel.  Last year, Chevron dropped its offer for Anadarko when Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N bid more. Noble \"offers an unique combination of shale as well long-cycle assets,\" much as Anadarko would have, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones, adding that she thought the deal was unlikely to spark a wave of consolidation.  A bidding war for Noble was unlikely, said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James. He noted the smaller scale of this deal - $5 billion versus the $33 billion Chevron had offered for Anadarko. He said other \u201cprospective buyers would find it easier to replicate via other means.\u201d  The acquisition will give Chevron a bigger presence in the shale patches of Colorado as well as the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. Chevron has been expanding there, and was under pressure to show how it planned to expand output when existing Permian assets are depleted.  Last year\u2019s bid for Anadarko was an attempt to boost Permian production, but Chevron instead pocketed a $1 billion break fee.  Since then, margins and drilling have been decimated by the coronavirus crisis. Prices have rebounded to around $40 a barrel from an average of around $20 in April, yet they remain depressed and have weighed on energy company valuations. Just seven months ago, Noble had a market capitalization of about $12 billion compared to $4.63 billion on Friday.  Shares of Noble closed up 5.4% to $10.18, after falling more than 60% this year through Friday\u2019s close. Chevron fell 2.2% to $85.27.  The offer values Noble at $10.38 a share, a 7.5% premium to its Friday close. Including the company\u2019s debt pile, the deal is worth roughly $13 billion.  Chevron is paying a \u201cmoderate premium\u201d reflecting a cautious outlook for oil and gas deals, said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at data provider Enverus.  Noble shareholders will own about 3% of the combined company, after the deal closes, expected in the fourth quarter.  The deal will help save about $300 million on an annual run-rate basis and add to free cash flow and earnings one year after closing, if global oil prices LCOc1 stay at $40, Chevron said.  It would add about 18% to Chevron\u2019s proved reserves.

The state approved the $54-billion Gorgon project in 2009 on the condition that at least 80 percent of carbon dioxide released in its gas processing operations over a five-year rolling average period would be buried.  \u201cIt has become apparent there needs to be a clearly defined start point for the commencement of the five-year rolling average,\u201d Stephen Dawson, the state environment minister, told reporters in the Perth, the state capital, on Monday, according to an email sent to Reuters by his spokeswoman.  He ordered the state\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority to report back within the next nine months whether the conditions should be changed, along with any other recommendations.  Chevron said it welcomed the review \u201cto clarify the existing condition\u201d on the carbon capture project.  \u201cOur focus is on the safe commissioning and start-up of the carbon dioxide injection project and achieving a high percentage of injection over the 40-year life of the Gorgon project,\u201d a Chevron spokeswoman said in emailed comments.  Chevron told the government last December it would not be able to start capturing and burying carbon dioxide until the fourth quarter of 2018 at the earliest, after having found problems with valves and pipeline equipment during commissioning of its A$2.5 billion ($1.9 billion) injection system.  The Gorgon carbon dioxide injection system is the world\u2019s largest capture and storage project.  Processing operations began in March 2016, when Gorgon started producing gas from the Jansz field.  However, Chevron only intended to start burying carbon dioxide after it started producing from the Gorgon field, which has a higher carbon dioxide content. Production started there in 2017.  Gorgon LNG is owned by Chevron, ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell, and Japan\u2019s Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA.","152":"(Reuters) - Chevron Corp CVX.N on Tuesday said it would shut down and evacuate its Fourchon and Empire terminals in Louisiana by the end of the day due to Tropical Storm Zeta.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  Among the parties in talks with Chevron for a possible stake in Kitimat LNG are Petroliam Nasional Bhd [PETR.UL], or Petronas, which scrapped its own $36 billion LNG project in British Columbia last year due to challenging market conditions, two of the people said.  Reuters spoke over the past week to the sources, who said there is no certainty that Chevron would proceed with the stake sale. The persons spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private.  Chevron declined to comment, and Petronas did not respond to a request for comment.  Chevron is also considering selling a stake in the project to a financial investor such as a Canadian pension fund or a private equity firm, the people added.  Canadian companies Seven Generations Energy Ltd VII.TO and Tourmaline Oil Corp TOU.TO are in discussions to supply natural gas to Chevron's project, the people said. Seven Generations may also consider buying a stake in the project by partnering with other gas producers, the people said.  While any possible deal with a financial investor would be strictly a cash infusion to help support the cost of building the project, a deal with a producer could be structured as a commitment to supply natural gas to the plant for a period of 20 to 25 years, the people said.  Canadian pension funds have a huge appetite for infrastructure-style assets that offer stable cash flows over a long period, and pipeline investments tend to have those attributes.  The project in British Columbia, a 50\/50 joint venture with Australia's Woodside Petroleum Ltd WPL.AX, has a 20-year, 10 million-metric-tonne-per-year export license for LNG and is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to build.  Kitimat could become one of the largest capital investments in a Canadian energy project, Chevron says on its website.  Taking such a substantial investment decision has been difficult for the duo, given concerns over a global LNG supply glut for the last three years. Fierce political opposition in Western Canada to building pipelines and other energy infrastructure has also escalated in the last several years.  However, surging gas demand from China and Southeast Asia is reassuring export project developers that the market cycle is finally beginning to turn.  Seven Generations declined to comment, and Tourmaline did not respond to a request for comment.  Located about 1,400 kilometers north of Vancouver, the Kitimat project was earmarked to utilize shale gas extracted in the northern part of British Columbia and export LNG to energy-hungry markets in Asia.  San Ramon, California-based Chevron acquired its 50 percent stake in Kitimat in early 2013 from EOG Resources Inc EOG.N and Encana Corp ECA.TO.","154":"CALGARY, Alberta, April 4 (Reuters) - The Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday dismissed all claims attempting to force Chevron Corp\u2019s Canadian unit to pay a $9.5 billion judgment handed down in Ecuador against the U.S. oil major over pollution in the Andean country.  The ruling draws a line under attempts to sue Chevron through its Canadian unit.  Residents of Ecuador\u2019s Lago Agrio region have been trying to force Chevron to pay for water and soil contamination caused from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001.  The villagers obtained a judgment against Chevron in Ecuador in 2011. But the company has no assets in the country, and the villagers have been trying to sue it in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to enforce the decision.  The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in 2017 that Chevron Canada is a separate entity to its parent company and its shares and assets could not be seized by those seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment.  Canada\u2019s highest court rejected a request to review that decision, which is now final.  \u201cAny further efforts by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to continue this lawsuit in Canada would be an abuse of the country\u2019s legal system and a waste of its judicial resources,\u201d said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron\u2019s vice president and general counsel.  The decision comes after an international tribunal last year unanimously ruled that the pollution judgment by Ecuador\u2019s Supreme Court against Chevron was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption.  Texaco was released from liability through a settlement with Ecuador years earlier, the tribunal found.

Global fuel demand has crashed by a third while many people shelter at home for an indefinite period. Major oil companies have largely reported losses in the latest period as an oil glut and coronavirus-related lockdowns sent prices to historic lows.  Chevron beat Wall Street expectations with a $3.6 billion profit, up from $2.6 billion during the same period last year. Results were boosted by $1.6 billion gain, largely from sale of oil and pipeline properties in Azerbaijan.  Cash flow from operations covered its dividend and capital spending, leaving Chevron \u201cin a strong position weather the storm,\u201d said Anish Kapadia of Palissy Advisors.  Shares were down 3% at $89.44 on Friday.  The second-largest U.S. oil producer benefited from higher earnings from its refinery business and increased oil output, offset by weaker prices.  The outlook for a continued oil glut prompted Chevron to further cut its 2020 spending budget to $14 billion, down 30% from its plan before the oil price crash. The percentage cut matches those at bigger rivals.  The cuts are \u201cacross the board,\u201d but include additional trims to shale oil projects and deferred spending at a major expansion project in Kazakhstan, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.  The company has \u201cpulled expansion down significantly\u201d at its Permian shale unit. It expects to end the year with Permian output about 125,000 bpd below its 600,000 bpd target.  \u201cWe will come out of this crisis, but we will come out with inventories pretty full because there\u2019s so much oil and products in storage,\u201d Breber said.  A 68% drop in profit from its U.S. oil business was offset by strong earnings in international oil and gas, which rose 13% on the rise in the U.S. dollar and asset sales. Refinery profits more than tripled to $1.1 billion last quarter.  Chevron held its dividend steady, while Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two. Equinor also cut its dividend, while BP Plc BP.L and Exxon kept their dividends stable.  Oil and gas output rose to 3.24 million barrels per day (bpd), an increase of more than 6%. The company plans to curtail its oil output by as much as 300,000 bpd in May and by up to 400,000 bpd in June, Breber said.  Chevron and Exxon had been racing to reach 1 million barrels per day of production in the Permian basin, the top U.S. shale field, before demand tumbled.  Chevron has sidelined 10 drilling rigs since early March and Exxon has cut 11 in the field since, according to data from research firm Enverus.","162":"FILE PHOTO: Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi speaks during news conference at the ministry of oil in Baghdad, Iraq November 27, 2017.

In the fantasy M&A game, Exxon could in theory buy Chevron at a premium, mostly for stock. But Darren Woods may not be investors\u2019 preferred leader for the combined group. Chevron buying Exxon might bring the right chief executive, with Mike Wirth in charge, but a deal that way around could call for too much leverage. There\u2019s a third, way, too: a $400 billion merger of equals.  Exxon is the bigger of the two companies, with a market capitalization of over $210 billion, more than 20% larger than Chevron\u2019s. If it were to offer a 20% premium for its rival, Woods\u2019 Texas-based company could fund the purchase almost entirely with shares and still leave its own shareholders with just over 50% of the combined company, according to a new Breakingviews calculator. And because Chevron has much less debt \u2013 and almost as much EBITDA forecast for 2021, according to Refinitiv data \u2013 Exxon could close the deal looking less leveraged than it is now.  The trouble is that Chevron\u2019s Wirth has proved a better operator, relatively speaking. Since taking the helm in February 2018, shares are off by just over 25% while Exxon\u2019s stock is down by more than 40%. He has also earned the reputation of being a prudent dealmaker, having walked away from buying Anadarko Petroleum at what was a market high.  Picking the right boss is key to a successful merger. If either company offers a meaningful premium for the other, even cutting 5% of combined operating costs, more than $3 billion a year, wouldn\u2019t compensate, once taxed and capitalized. The chief executive of the new fossil-fuel giant would have to do more with less capital expenditure, too.  But Chevron buying Exxon is a stretch. Wirth would have to issue more than $80 billion of debt so that current shareholders could maintain a majority stake. That would jack up the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at Chexxon to nearly 3 times, more than twice the current level.  A merger of equals is the dream answer, ignoring real-world hurdles like antitrust concerns. The market values of the two companies have been converging. Even now they are close enough, at around 55-45, to argue for an equal union. Then it\u2019s a question of sharing out the chief executive and chairman roles, board seats, headquarter locations, and other sensitive goodies.

An entrance sign at the Chevron refinery, located near the Houston Ship Channel, is seen in Pasadena, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  The administration said a decision will be made soon on the renewal of Chevron\u2019s six-month U.S. Treasury Department license to operate in Venezuela, with billions of dollars in the company\u2019s investments at stake. The administration in January imposed sanctions on PDVSA, Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company, intended to starve the country of oil revenue and force out President Nicolas Maduro.  The United States has said it considers Maduro\u2019s re-election last year illegitimate and has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido, who invoked the country\u2019s constitution in January to declare himself interim president, as Venezuela\u2019s leader.  \u201cWe are still waiting on a final decision,\u201d Chevron spokesman Raymond Fohr said, adding that the second-largest U.S. oil company \u201cremains hopeful that General License 8 will be renewed.\u201d A January license gave it six months to wind down operations with PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela).  A decision will be made before the 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday (0401 GMT) renewal deadline, a U.S. administration official said on Thursday.  President Donald Trump's administration in January issued licenses to five companies. The other four are Halliburton Co HAL.N, Schlumberger SLB.N, GE's Baker Hughes BHGE.N and Weatherford International. [WEATH.UL] All have largely halted operations.  An exit would put at risk Chevron\u2019s several billion dollars in investments, about 300 jobs and a nearly 100-year presence in Venezuela. Investments in the joint ventures totaled $2.68 billion at the end of December, according to its latest annual report.  A forced retreat from Venezuela could trigger impairment charges on its investments, according to Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.  \u201cI would expect them to take a write-down if they don\u2019t get an extension,\u201d Rowland said, adding that it would not be significant.  Chevron reported a loss of $51 million in the first quarter from its equity affiliates, including the Venezuelan joint ventures, compared with profit of $159 million in the same period a year earlier.  Its stakes in four joint venture operations with PDVSA produced about 42,000 barrels per day of oil and natural gas. Until sanctions were levied, the company received dividends from the joint ventures in payment for its production. Its contracts with the joint ventures run until at least 2026.  If Chevron leaves, its assets would likely end up in the hands of Russian oil giant Rosneft ROSN.MM, which would be counter to U.S. foreign policy goals, sources familiar with the matter said this week.  \u201cIf they pull the plug on Chevron, it\u2019s just a gift on a big platter to the Russians,\u201d one source said. The assets could also wind up in the hands of PDVSA or Chinese oil companies.  Guaido, the head of the National Assembly, said on Tuesday he would seek to protect Chevron\u2019s assets in the country if Washington does not renew the license.","177":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron (CVX) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Glass Lewis has recommended that shareholders of Noble Energy Inc NBL.O vote in favor of the energy producer's proposed $5 billion acquisition by Chevron Corp CVX.N, the proxy advisory firm said in a statement on Friday.  Chevron announced its proposal to buy Noble Energy for $5 billion in stock on July 20. It represented the first big energy deal since the coronavirus pandemic crushed global fuel demand and sent crude prices to historic lows.  In supporting the transaction, Glass Lewis said it found the proposal to be \u201cboth strategically and financially compelling\u201d to Noble investors, with the combined company offering a number of benefits that would be unavailable to Noble as a standalone entity.  However, Glass Lewis said Noble\u2019s shareholders should vote against \u201cexcessive\u201d payments to certain Noble Energy executives, including Chief Executive David Stover, which would be triggered by the sale of the company.  \u201cAlthough the company may have been contractually and legally obligated to make these payments due to employment agreements, we believe shareholders should question whether the size of these awards is the best use of company capital,\u201d it said.  Such change-of-control payments are designed, in the event of a sale of the company, to compensate executives, who may find themselves redundant given there is unlikely to be enough roles in the combined company for both management teams.  Noble shareholders are due to vote on the Chevron deal on Oct. 2. The deal has also been recommended by fellow proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).  Earlier this month, a notice posted on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s website showed that Elliott Management Corp had amassed an undisclosed stake in Noble.

FILE PHOTO: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  For most of Occidental\u2019s pursuit, Anadarko snubbed its overtures, arguing its offers were too risky. Last month, it entered into a deal with deep-pocketed oil major Chevron Corp to sell itself for $33 billion in cash and stock.  Yet Occidental turned the tables on Chevron by securing a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and an $8.8 billion asset sale to France\u2019s Total SA. These deals gave Occidental the firepower to prevail over Chevron in the race for Anadarko.  Here is the inside account of the takeover battle, according to seven sources familiar with the discussions:  SEPTEMBER 2017 - Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub contacted Anadarko CEO Al Walker and proposed to acquire Anadarko for between $60 and $70 per share in an all-stock deal. Occidental\u2019s initial proposal did not detail financing nor mention approval from its board of directors.  OCTOBER 2017 - Hollub followed up with Walker, informing him that she had the approval of her board. Walker said he would take the offer to his board of directors.  NOVEMBER 2017 - Anadarko officially rejected the offer, saying it would not be a good \u201cstrategic and operational fit\u201d.  JANUARY 2018 - Occidental made a revised proposal of $76 a share for Anadarko, half in cash and half in stock.  FEBRUARY 2018 - Anadarko responded that Occidental\u2019s offer still carried too much risk, which could only be mitigated with an all-cash offer. The high percentage of stock would require Occidental to hold at least two shareholder votes to get clearance. Discussions ended for the rest of 2018.  FEBRUARY 2019 - Chevron CEO Mike Wirth approached Walker with an offer to acquire Anadarko for 75% stock and 25% cash, for a total value of about $64 a share. Anadarko\u2019s board agreed to open up the company\u2019s books to Chevron.  MARCH 22, 2019 - Chevron and Anadarko were close to signing an agreement when Occidental contacted Anadarko once again.  MARCH 23, 2019 - Occidental sent Anadarko an offer for $19 per share in cash and 0.8737 shares of its stock for a total of about $76 a share. The offer was based on a 75\/25 stock-cash split.  MARCH 24, 2019 - Chevron upped its offer by $1 per share to $65 a share with the same 75\/25 stock-cash split. Chevron also informed Anadarko it would drop its bid if a deal was not signed soon. Anadarko\u2019s board weighed the two offers and authorized Walker to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Occidental that would kick off negotiations. Anadarko also closed its books to Chevron.  MARCH 25, 2019 - Due diligence started and resurrected the issues Anadarko and Occidental had previously discussed. Anadarko asked for a \u2018collar\u2019 that could shield Occidental\u2019s bid from fluctuations in its share price. Anadarko reiterated concerns about Occidental\u2019s financing arrangements and ability to win two shareholder votes.  APRIL 5, 2019 - While in talks with Occidental, Anadarko checked in with Chevron to gauge interest.  APRIL 8, 2019 - Occidental sent Anadarko a revised offer. The bid was lowered to $72 a share and the terms were changed to 40% cash and 60% stock, which removed one shareholder approval requirement. Occidental justified the lower offer by citing the higher cash component and referring to findings in its due diligence into Anadarko. The new offer still had no collar. Walker took the offer to Anadarko\u2019s board, which rejected it.  APRIL 9, 2019 - Anadarko restarted talks with Chevron. Walker negotiated a lower breakup fee of $1 billion with Chevron, leaving the door open for a rival bid. Anadarko also unsuccessfully asked Chevron to increase its offer.  APRIL 10, 2019 - Anadarko agreed to accept the offer on the table from Chevron.  APRIL 11, 2019 - Hollub sent Walker another email, this time increasing Occidental\u2019s offer back to $76 per share, with a 40\/60 cash\/stock split, including three board seats. Hollub also assured Walker she could get the deal done quickly. There was no reference in the email to financing, the collar, or the shareholder approval. Hollub offered to get the deal signed as soon as Sunday, April 14. Anadarko\u2019s advisers said that negotiations with Occidental could take two more weeks, jeopardizing a bird in hand that Walker had with Chevron\u2019s offer. Anadarko\u2019s board voted to approve the deal with Chevron.  On the same day, the board also approved higher compensation for Walker should the company change hands, according to an Anadarko filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Chevron and Anadarko signed their merger agreement that evening.  APRIL 12, 2019 - Chevron announced its deal to buy Anadarko, valued at the time at $65 per share.  APRIL 24, 2019 - Occidental announced a new $76-per-share bid for Anadarko, payable half in cash and half in Occidental stock. It said its deal would not contain any financing condition, but would require a vote by Occidental shareholders.  APRIL 29, 2019 - Anadarko said it would negotiate with Occidental over its bid, after determining it could lead to a better deal than it had struck with Chevron.  APRIL 30, 2019 - Buffett\u2019s Berkshire announced a deal to bankroll Occidental\u2019s bid for Anadarko.  MAY 5, 2019 - Occidental clinched an agreement to sell Anadarko\u2019s African assets to Total for $8.8 billion in the event of a deal. Occidental also increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko to 78% from 50%, removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental\u2019s shareholders.  MAY 6, 2019 - Anadarko\u2019s board found Occidental\u2019s bid to be superior, triggering a four-day clock in its contract with Chevron that allowed the latter to match.  MAY 9, 2019 - Chevron abandoned its pursuit of Anadarko, citing price discipline. Occidental declared victory.","180":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron Corp is seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017.

Patrick Pouyanne pounced after Occidental Corp trumped Chevron\u2019s $33 billion bid for Anadarko in April with an offer that includes raising financing by selling some of Anadarko\u2019s operations worth up to $15 billion. Chevron walked away from the race on Thursday.  By keeping those in the know to a minimum, the French CEO was able to stay flexible in negotiations, take a swift decision and ensure there were no leaks until the binding deal worth $8.8 billion was announced on Sunday, a Total source said.  \u201cPouyanne proceeded in the same way he did with previous deals: a restricted task force, no bankers and no external counsel,\u201d another source, close to the deal, told Reuters.  Throwing out the rulebook that expects CEOs to be surrounded by investment bankers and other advisers when dealmaking has become a trademark for the 55-year-old CEO and chairman of Total, who took the helm of the French energy major in 2014.  He has taken investors by surprise with his acquisitions, such as buying Maersk\u2019s oil and gas business in 2017 and Engie\u2019s upstream LNG operations in 2018, setting one deal in motion after an unsolicited phone call with the controlling shareholder.  His strategy, which one analyst has called \u201copportunistic\u201d, has rapidly lifted Total\u2019s growth outlook. Total has made acquisitions worth almost $20 billion in the past five years, under Pouyanne\u2019s leadership.  But the buying spree has increased debt and left its shares lagging rivals, such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP . His manner can also come across as brash, and industry sources say it was one reason a deal to buy a Libyan oilfield stake has now run into a roadblock.  HEAVENLY MATCH  Pouyanne\u2019s move to buy Anadarko\u2019s assets, the French firm\u2019s biggest acquisition since taking over Elf almost two decades ago, will add 5 percent to Total\u2019s output by 2025, said Bernstein analysts, who rate Total\u2019s shares \u201coutperform\u201d.  The assets stretching from Algeria to South Africa bolster his effort to refocus Total on operations in Africa, the North Sea, deep offshore and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The deal depends on Occidental (Oxy) completing the Anadarko merger.  \u201cPouyanne quickly understood that it could be a match made in heaven because Oxy was mainly focused on Anadarko\u2019s Permian assets. And Pouyanne has repeatedly said he was not interested in Permian,\u201d a source close to the deal said, referring to the Permian Basin where the U.S. shale oil industry is concentrated.  Total has built up a strong balance sheet under Pouyanne since the 2014 oil price crash, giving him the firepower to swoop on Anadarko\u2019s assets. But Total was also able to act swiftly because it has long had its eye on the African operations.  \u201cTotal was already familiar with Anadarko\u2019s portfolio. At some point, they took a closer look at Anadarko\u2019s assets, particularly in Africa. There were some discussions, but they did not go any further,\u201d an industry source said.  Another source said Anadarko had been looking for a partner for its Mozambique LNG project to tap an estimated 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas.  Two days after Occidental announced its bid for Anadarko on April 24, Oxy\u2019s corporate jet was on the tarmac in Paris.  UNDER WRAPS  Both firms declined to comment on the reason for the jet\u2019s flight to Paris, although an industry source told Reuters the jet was flown in for a meeting with Total.  Another source familiar with the matter said Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub had flown in with another executive, without telling anybody, to discuss Anadarko\u2019s African assets with Total.  \u201cOf course they (Total) had already thought about it. And I think they reached out to her and said \u2018Hey Vicki, if you happen to win this, we would really be interested\u2019,\u201d the second source said. \u201cShe did not let the phone get cold. She left and flew to Paris overnight, met with them and heard their deal.\u201d  Occidental did not comment on the account.  A banking source said this deal was not the first time Total had held talks without bankers in the room. The source said it made sense in this case because Total did not need financing and wanted to make a quick decision.  Shell, the world\u2019s top LNG buyer and trader, had been considering an approach to Oxy for the Mozambique asset but was caught off guard by Total\u2019s rapid move, a source close to the company said. A Shell spokeswoman declined to comment.  It was not the first time Pouyanne surprised the market. He first made a splash in 2017 with the purchase of Maersk\u2019s energy business for $7.5 billion after an unsolicited bid made in a phone call to Ane Maersk Mc-Kinney Uggla, chairwoman of the A.P. Moller Foundation, which has a controlling stake, a corporate source said.  \u201cThe deal was unplanned but it was a good fit. A banker gave Patrick the idea and he made it happen,\u201d the source said.  Maersk could not immediately be reached for comment.  But Pouyanne\u2019s manner does not always win over partners.  When he boasted to a U.S. energy conference about the benefits to Total of his deal to buy a $450 million stake in a Libyan field from Marathon Oil last year, Libya\u2019s state-owned National Oil Corporation sought to re-negotiate terms, concerned it was too much of a bargain, industry sources said.  Total has said it was in talks with Libyan authorities to resolve financial issues over the deal. NOC could not immediately be reached for comment.","182":"(Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp has evacuated executives from Venezuela after two of its workers were imprisoned over a contract dispute with state-owned oil company PDVSA, according to four sources familiar with the matter.  The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Marco Bello  Chevron asked other employees to avoid the facilities of its joint venture with the OPEC nation\u2019s oil firm, the sources said.  The arrests, in a raid by national intelligence officers, were the first at a foreign oil firm since Venezuela\u2019s government launched a purge last fall that has resulted in detentions of more than 80 executives at PDVSA and business partners accused of corruption.  The Chevron workers may face charges of treason for refusing to sign a supply contract for furnace parts drawn up by PDVSA executives, Reuters reported earlier this week. The workers balked at the high costs of the parts and a lack of competitive bids.  Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, linked the Chevron arrests to the government anti-corruption probe for the first time on Wednesday.  \u201cIn our oil industry and in its relationships with other countries, there has been corruption,\u201d Arreaza said at a news conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York that was broadcast on Venezuela state television. \u201cThe decisions of the prosecutor\u2019s office are based on serious investigations to fight corruption ... These two people involved have the right to defense and due process.\u201d  Of Chevron\u2019s evacuation of executives, Arreaza said: \u201cThe logical decision would be to turn themselves over to authorities and demonstrate their innocence ... not to flee.\u201d  Chevron spokeswoman Isabel Ordonez responded to the minister\u2019s comments with a written statement that the firm \u201cabides by a code of business ethics, under which we comply with all applicable U.S. and Venezuelan laws.\u201d  Chevron\u2019s move to evacuate its expatriate workforce underscores the how arduous it has become for foreign oil firms and their workers to sustain operations through Venezuela\u2019s accelerating political and economic meltdown. The affected staff numbers about 30 people in the coastal city of Puerto la Cruz.  Chevron\u2019s Ordonez said the company had an executive team overseeing operations in Venezuela but declined to provide details on the leadership there or the number and type of workers the company had withdrawn.  Last week, the company said it was working for the release of the detained workers, Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez, who are represented by Chevron lawyers.  Chevron has no plans to exit the country, according to a person familiar with the thinking of its board of directors. The oil company has not pulled out of other tough environments in the past, the person said - citing the jailing of employees in Indonesia in 2013 - and the firm believes Venezuela will eventually stabilize.  Chevron, the world\u2019s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects across the OPEC-member nation.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The firm has about 150 employees in its Puerto la Cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year, to $329 million, according to regulatory filings.  The arrests mark an escalation of tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts and the joint ventures\u2019 governance, sources familiar with the dispute told Reuters.  Outside firms say they are increasingly faced with impossible dilemmas. If their executives sign contracts without following their companies\u2019 due process rules, they run the risk of violating compliance standards meant to control costs and guard against corruption. If they don\u2019t sign, they stoke tension with their partners at PDVSA, which has a controlling interest in all joint ventures.  Companies evaluating an exit from Venezuela have limited options because few if any international firms would pay anything close to full value for assets in the country amid the ongoing turmoil, according to interviews with three executives of oil firms that have operated in Venezuela. But continuing operations often means stomaching steep losses, taking massive write-downs - and, now, the threat of having staff arrested by the embattled socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro.  PDVSA\u2019s deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge 33 percent in a year, to 1.51 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, according to official data reported to OPEC. Venezuela\u2019s oil output so far this year is at a 33-year low.  The falling production and arrests of PDVSA executives on allegations of corruption picked up speed late last year after Maduro named a military chief with no oil industry experience, Major General Manuel Quevedo, as the nation\u2019s oil minister and president of PDVSA.  Several of Chevron\u2019s foreign staff and some local executives and their families left Venezuela starting last week after the arrests, the four sources familiar with their departures told Reuters. They described the situation as temporary, and said executives may return if proposed talks between Chevron and PDVSA to resolve the dispute are successful.  Chevron executives have had high-level meetings with Venezuelan government officials this week, said two of the people familiar with the matter.  Chevron and other firms aim to avoid a repeat of what happened to Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips in Venezuela in 2007, when the government of then-President Hugo Chavez expropriated their assets after they could not reach an agreement to convert their projects into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures.  \u201cNo company can leave because it would lose the assets,\u201d said a former negotiator of Exxon\u2019s 2007 exit from Venezuela. \u201cAt this point, there are just a few options.\u201d  FEAR OF ARREST  Chevron employees remaining in Venezuela are concerned they may be vulnerable to detention following the departure of senior management, according to interviews with employees and family members.  The arrested Chevron workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar, an oil production and processing project co-owned by PDVSA and Chevron.  Chevron has asked employees assigned to Petropiar to temporarily work from the firm\u2019s Puerto la Cruz office rather than show up at its partner\u2019s oil production and processing facilities, according to one person familiar with the situation.  The two men had refused to sign a multi-million dollar contract under an emergency decree to buy imported parts required by Petropiar, according to six sources with knowledge of the contract dispute. Such decrees, which skip competitive bidding, have been cited by Venezuelan and U.S. prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent corruption cases.  Algarra and Vasquez are now being held in a detention center in Barcelona run by Venezuela\u2019s intelligence unit, known as Sebin. Coworkers and relatives have brought them food to supplement what they are provided, a person familiar with the matter said.  WRITE OFF ASSETS, CUTTING STAFF  Several other foreign energy companies have written down the value of their Venezuela assets by hundreds of millions of dollars or halted most operations, keeping only a skeletal staff in the country.  Spain\u2019s Repsol took a pre-tax charge of about $1 billion on its Venezuelan assets in the prior quarter. Italy\u2019s ENI said it was owed 500 million euros ($615 million) in delinquent payments from PDVSA last year.  Service provider Schlumberger wrote down its Venezuelan holdings in the fourth quarter by $938 million. Halliburton earlier this month said it wrote off all remaining assets in the country, adding a $312 million charge on top of $647 million in charges last year.  Other international oil firms, including France\u2019s Total SA, have withdrawn foreign staff in recent years and reduced investment as living conditions have deteriorated.  \u201cI can tell you it is difficult for our people because of lack of power, lack of water,\u201d said Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne last week at an oil summit in Paris.  The company would maintain a presence there, however, on the hope the crisis would ease.  \u201cIt is important to stay in a country even in difficult times,\u201d Pouyanne said, \u201cbecause people will remember it.\u201d","183":"(Reuters) - Chevron Corp CVX.N will cut 10% to 15% of its worldwide workforce as part of an ongoing restructuring at the second-largest U.S. oil producer.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The oil producer previously disclosed a 30% reduction in its 2020 spending and some voluntary job cuts amid this year\u2019s sharp drop in oil prices and lower demand for oil and gas due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Chevron has been widely seen as the standard bearer of financial discipline in the oil industry and was among the first to make significant budget cuts as oil demand plummeted. Last year, it abandoned a takeover bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp rather than get into a bidding war with Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N. Chevron pocketed a $1 billion break fee while Occidental has faced investor wrath for its ill-timed deal.  Chevron, which has 45,000 employees, expects to remove about 10% to 15% of its global staff to \u201cmatch projected activity levels,\u201d spokeswoman Veronica Flores-Paniagua confirmed.  U.S. crude oil prices CLc1 have nearly halved this year to about $33 a barrel as the COVID-19 pandemic slashed travel and led to stay-at-home orders that have cut oil demand by as much as 2 million barrels per day. Chevron this month said it would reduce planned U.S. shale output by about 125,000 bpd.  The about 4,500 to 6,750 job cuts envisioned are to \u201caddress current market conditions,\u201d with varying impact on each business unit and region, said Flores-Paniagua. Most reductions will take place this year. \u201cThis is a difficult decision and we do not take it lightly,\u201d she said.  At its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, No. 1 U.S. oil producer Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N said it had not yet taken steps to reduce its workforce. \"Today, we have no layoff plans,\" Chief Executive Darren Woods said. Exxon also cut its planned spending 30% for the year.  Both companies have outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world\u2019s top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades.

Additional severance pay, a medical benefits subsidy and education services will be available to U.S. employees who lose their positions, he wrote.  In March, Chevron began offering severance payments to some of its U.S. oil exploration and production employees.  It last year launched a major cost-cutting overhaul that has already pared the number of units.","184":"HOUSTON, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp said on Tuesday that compensation for former Chief Executive John Watson rose less than 1 percent last year.

An oil pumpjack is seen in La Canada de Urdaneta, Venezuela October 1, 2019. REUTERS\/Jose Nunes  To feed himself and his wife as the once-prosperous OPEC nation suffers a hyperinflationary economic collapse, Brito depends on a monthly basket of rice, canned tuna, beans and other products valued at $200 given to him by California-based Chevron Corp CVX.N, PDVSA's minority partner at the Petroboscan field in western Zulia state where he works.  But Chevron's future in Venezuela now depends on U.S. President Donald Trump, who must decide here by Oct. 25 whether or not to renew a waiver allowing Chevron to keep operating in Venezuela despite U.S. sanctions on PDVSA, part of Washington's campaign to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro.  The benefits enjoyed by Brito and some 1,200 other Petroboscan employees and contractors are not available for most of cash-strapped PDVSA's 100,000-odd workers, who have seen their wages eroded due to inflation, prompting thousands to resign here and join the 4 million Venezuelans who have emigrated.  \u201cIf Chevron leaves, we would be left without a helping hand, because what little we have comes from them,\u201d Brito said.  Chevron has been present in Venezuela for nearly 100 years: it opened its Caracas office in 1923, and first struck oil at the Boscan field in 1946, making it among the private companies with the longest presence in the country.  But in January, the U.S. Treasury Department slapped sanctions on PDVSA as part of Washington's effort to cut off cash flow to Maduro. Chevron was only able to remain in Venezuela thanks to a six-month exemption granted to it and major oilfield service companies like Halliburton Co HAL.N and Schlumberger NV SLB.N. The companies are keen to retain a presence in Venezuela, which has the world's largest crude reserves.  The campaign to oust Maduro has since stalled, despite Venezuela's deteriorating economy and accusations of human rights violations. After internal debate here within the administration, Trump in late July renewed the waiver for three months.  Some in the administration, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, argued that, were Chevron to leave, Maduro might deliver its assets to Russian or Chinese companies, depriving a potential new government of a chance to rebuild the economy in partnership with the U.S. firm. But others, such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton, argued that forcing Chevron out could prompt a further decline in crude output, adding to the economic pressure on Maduro.  Slideshow ( 5 images )  With the new deadline looming, residents of La Ca\u00f1ada de Urdaneta, where Petroboscan\u2019s operations are located, fear the company\u2019s exit would add further misery to a drastic deterioration in their quality of life during the last seven years of recession.  \u201cChevron has supported everything,\u201d said Yennifer Gonzalez, a parent of three students at the San Agustin school in La Ca\u00f1ada, where the company funds meals for students and staff, and is also paying for a construction project. \u201cIf Chevron leaves, here in the field things will not be the same.  By law, PDVSA\u2019s joint ventures are required to invest 1% of their profits in social programs in the areas where they extract crude. In La Ca\u00f1ada, Chevron\u2019s logo adorns schoolyard basketball hoops it donated and police stations it helped build.  Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said in a statement the company\u2019s social investment contributions totaled nearly $100 million between 2007-2018, and that the firm was a \u201cpositive presence\u201d in the country.  Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela\u2019s oil ministry responded to requests for comment. Maduro blames an \u201ceconomic war\u201d led by the United States for the country\u2019s problems.  HALTED PUMPJACKS  Venezuela\u2019s crude output steadily declined from well over 2 million barrels-per-day (bpd) in 2014 to just over 1 million bpd by the end of last year, the result of a drop in prices and what critics say is years of underinvestment and mismanagement. Blackouts and U.S. sanctions have accelerated that collapse this year: the country now produces just 600,000 bpd.  Petroboscan and Petropiar, Chevron\u2019s other major joint venture with PDVSA, together pumped well over 100,000 bpd earlier this year. But both have halted production completely at times in recent months, as Washington\u2019s sanctions scare away buyers and Venezuela\u2019s storage tanks near capacity, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.  None of the dozen pumpjacks that Reuters observed while driving through the Boscan field on Oct. 14 and Oct. 15 were turning.  Should Chevron be ordered to depart, that would be unlikely to have a major impact on Maduro, analysts said.  \u201cTwo million barrels to 600,000 barrels and these guys are still there,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, an energy economist at Rice University in Houston, referring to Maduro\u2019s government. \u201cAnd you think that because of 100,000 (fewer bpd) it\u2019s going to make a difference?\u201d  Even with Chevron\u2019s help, Brito\u2019s patience with his miniscule wages is wearing thin. He held back tears when talking about his four children who have moved to Colombia, where he said many Petroboscan workers would emigrate if Chevron left.  \u201cI can tell you because I\u2019m one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll sell what I have here, pack my bags, and I\u2019ll drive away in my truck.\u201d","189":"(Reuters) - U.S. oil majors Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp cut spending aggressively in the third quarter in a race to offset weak trends in fuel demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though the former managed a slim profit.  Exxon posted its third straight quarter of losses on Friday and reduced spending plans for the coming year.  In common with others in the sector, the two are laying off a substantial portion of their workforce and expect to cut costs further as they try to reverse years of weak stock performance, worsened by the impact of movement restrictions.  U.S. oil prices have dropped 41% this year as the coronavirus forced billions of people into lockdowns. Demand recovered in the late northern hemisphere summer, but nations including Germany, India and the United States are again tackling a surge in infections, dampening demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  The outlook for energy consumption \u201cdepends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume.

Exxon shares have lost half of their value this year; Chevron\u2019s are down 40%.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer by production, earned $201 million in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $2.9 billion for the year-earlier period.

REUTERS\/Angus Mordant\/File Photo  Exxon came into the year with an ambitious spending plan driven by investments in shale and offshore discoveries, particularly off the coast of Guyana. It originally planned to spend $33 billion in capital and exploration investment in 2020, though through three quarters it has instead spent just $16.6 billion.  SHAREHOLDER PAYOUT  Now, however, Exxon is focused on preserving its dividend.  Earlier this week, it announced plans to cut its workforce by about 15% but kept its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout.  \u201cWhile we see the dividend as safe over the next 12 months, the cash flow outspend is massive under current conditions,\u201d analysts at Raymond James wrote.  The largest U.S. oil producer, which has slashed costs aggressively, is also evaluating whether to hold on to other North American assets. It could write down natural gas assets valued between $25 billion to $30 billion, and possibly part of its Canadian business, Imperial Oil, it said.  \u201cIt is significant that Exxon is explicitly guiding to maintaining the dividend having reduced capex and potentially adding more divestments,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.  Next year, Exxon said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, versus an adjusted plan to spend around $23 billion this year.  The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra.  In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects oil and gas output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, from 565,000 boepd this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers.  Exxon\u2019s Permian output was around 401,000 boepd in the third quarter, up from the previous quarter, and it said its costs there had dropped 20%.","190":"(Corrects 2nd bullet point to say East Kalimantan contract ends in Oct, not Rokan)  JAKARTA, Aug 27 (Reuters) -  * Oil company Chevron estimated 2018 oil production in Indonesia at 218,300 barrels per day (bpd), lower than 247,300 bpd in 2017, company data distributed to a parliamentary committee on Monday showed.  * The outlook includes output projections from four oil blocks in Indonesia, including the East Kalimantan block, whose contract expires in October.

(Reporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)","194":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub was caught off guard when U.S. oil giant Chevron swooped in last month with a $33 billion offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production firm she had been wooing for nearly two years.  Chevron, nearly five times larger than Occidental, appeared to have out-maneuvered its smaller rival. But on Sunday Hollub showed the fight was not over. After a whirlwind few days to raise more cash, Hollub offered a sweetened deal. By Thursday, Chevron had bowed out.  In edging out Chevron, Hollub leaned on global relationships and knowledge forged from 35 years in the oil industry, according to about a dozen people familiar with the talks leading up to the company\u2019s latest offer.  Occidental had struggled to win over Anadarko because its first public $38 billion offer of 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock, as well as previous offers made privately, required the approval of Occidental shareholders, and Anadarko was not convinced they would go for the deal, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.  Hollub knew she needed to substantially increase the cash offer - thereby making shareholder approval unnecessary - and moved swiftly to secure it, the sources said.  She was in Paris on April 26, just two weeks after Chevron\u2019s announcement, and struck an $8.8 billion deal with French major Total SA to sell Anadarko assets her company didn\u2019t yet own.  Two days later she was in Omaha, Nebraska, securing $10 billion in financing from billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, who typically does not partner with companies pursuing unsolicited takeovers.  Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview for this story. The company\u2019s shares are down 9 percent since making their offer public in late April.  The combined company would establish Occidental as the largest operator in the Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution, where a boom in production has propelled the United States into becoming the world\u2019s largest oil producer.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  It would make Occidental the third-largest U.S. oil company with a market value of about $80 billion, dwarfed only by global giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron.  \u201cShe\u2019s doing the boldest M&A thing that\u2019s happened since the \u201880s,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy consultant and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cYou\u2019re having an atypical M&A battle in a very competitive space where (usually) the bigger you are, the more you\u2019re going to win.\u201d  Hollub\u2019s challenge has stunned an industry where the last attempt to break up an agreed-upon deal between two U.S. oil companies was in 1984 when Texaco challenged Pennzoil\u2019s acquisition of Getty Oil.  It has also angered some Occidental investors who say Hollub is overstretching the company\u2019s balance sheet in an ill-advised quest for size in a volatile industry.  \u201cOur concern is the willingness of the management team at Occidental to cut very favorable deals against the interests of shareholders on a longer-term basis,\u201d said John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.  T. Rowe, the sixth-largest holder of Occidental shares, announced it would vote against the board of directors on the annual shareholder meeting Friday. But such a move may be mostly symbolic.  An Occidental spokesman declined to comment on the concerns but pointed to Hollub\u2019s defense of her strategy that it was better to raise cash than issue new debt.  Hollub\u2019s background in the technical aspects of oil production contrasts with her predecessor, a banker and known dealmaker. She has been described as down to earth by former and current employees, differing from flamboyant energy CEOs.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  LONGTIME DISCUSSIONS  Buying Anadarko was seen as the best way for Occidental to gain more acreage in the Permian shale basin, where it markets nearly a quarter of all barrels produced in the region.  When Chevron announced a deal on April 12 to buy Anadarko, Hollub gathered the merger team. They were shocked that Anadarko had accepted a bid that was $11 per share below what Occidental had privately offered, three of the people familiar with the discussions said.  \u201cShe thought, we\u2019re in it to win it. Let\u2019s make our offer public so their shareholders know what they passed up,\u201d one of the sources said.  In a letter to Anadarko\u2019s board of directors on April 24, Occidental said they \u201cwere surprised and disappointed\u201d that Anadarko had not agreed to their previous two offers in April.  Anadarko executives, however, remained concerned that Occidental shareholders could scuttle the deal, leaving them without a buyer, two sources familiar with the situation said. The board of directors wanted to stick with Chevron.  Just two days after sending the letter, Hollub was in Paris meeting with Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne to discuss Anadarko\u2019s African assets, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.  The two already had a relationship stemming from the Dolphin Gas Project, a Middle East cross-border gas initiative where both companies have an equal share. Total had made it known to her that they coveted Anadarko\u2019s properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique.  \u201cVicki wanted to show that she could quickly put the cash on the table. In less than 10 days she had the cash ready,\u201d a Paris-based source said.  Omaha, Nebraska was next. Buffett is known for moving quickly when a deal piques his interest, but he tends to avoid getting involved in hostile takeover bids.  The meeting was set up by BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, whose bank was helping to provide financing for the Anadarko deal. Hollub later said Buffett was \u201cwarm and wonderful\u201d in their meeting, a source familiar with the discussions said.  Buffett, cash flush and on the hunt for new deals, agreed to provide $10 billion in financing in return for an 8 percent premium, a concern for dividend-focused shareholders who believe the terms are too pricey.  The two deals enabled Hollub to submit a revised offer on Sunday, increasing the cash component from 50 percent to 78 percent.  On Thursday, Chevron said it would collect its $1 billion termination fee and walk away from the negotiations.

In April, Exxon collapsed seven of its business units into three to better coordinate output with logistics and refining businesses.  Chevron\u2019s proposed changes could lead to the departure over time of several hundred employees now assigned to overlapping production technology groups likely to be consolidated or folded, the sources said.  These would be the first major changes to the organization since its merger with Texaco in 2001. Wirth foreshadowed the move by naming Pierre Breber, another cost cutter, as his finance chief earlier this year.  Shale, which did not exist in Chevron\u2019s portfolio 10 years ago, will make up about 27% of its total production by 2023. Chevron has been heavily investing in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, but has not yet turned a profit from shale. The company expects the investment to start generating free cash next year.  \u201cOne of the great benefits of the advent of shale is it has inspired greatness in other asset classes,\u201d Wirth told Wall Street analysts in March.  Chevron\u2019s exploration and production business earned $2.7 billion in the latest quarter, down from $3.4 billion in the same period last year, due to lower oil and gas prices. Annual profit has gradually improved since the nadir of the 2015-2016 oil bust but remain below the $26.2 billion peak in 2012.  COST OVERRUNS  Its stock traded on Friday at $119.08, up 9.5% year to date, outstripping other oil majors but well behind the 24% gain in the S&P 500 Index.  The company recently warned of massive cost overruns at a giant Tengiz oil project in Kazakhstan. Overall costs are projected to rise 25% to $45.2 billion, with Chevron\u2019s share of the overrun expected to be about $4 billion to $5 billion.  \u201cIt does feel like they have more they can cut and more they want to cut following the issues with Tengiz,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at researcher Palissy Advisers.  Other oil majors that have faced greater challenges from deepwater or reserves cuts have cut deeper than Chevron for several years, he said. The company pays shareholders a 4% dividend, below its rivals, which has helped its balance sheet relatively strong, Kapadia said.","199":"Environmental Protection Agency political appointees announced on Wednesday include its former general counsel who, in more recent years, defended Chevron in cases where cities and counties are seeking to hold major oil companies liable for damages tied to climate change.

Exxon posted its third straight quarter of losses on Friday and reduced spending plans for the coming year.  In common with others in the sector, the two are laying off a substantial portion of their workforce and expect to cut costs further as they try to reverse years of weak stock performance, worsened by the impact of movement restrictions.  U.S. oil prices have dropped 41% this year as the coronavirus forced billions of people into lockdowns. Demand recovered in the late northern hemisphere summer, but nations including Germany, India and the United States are again tackling a surge in infections, dampening demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  The outlook for energy consumption \u201cdepends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.  Exxon shares were down 1.8% to $32.39 in early trading on Friday. Chevron rose 0.7%. Exxon shares have lost half of their value this year; Chevron\u2019s are down 40%.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil producer by production, earned $201 million in the most recent quarter, compared with a profit of $2.9 billion for the year-earlier period. Exxon posted a loss of $680 million, its third straight quarterly loss.  Exxon came into the year with an ambitious spending plan driven by investments in shale and offshore discoveries, particularly off the coast of Guyana. It originally planned to spend $33 billion in capital and exploration investment in 2020, though through three quarters it has instead spent just $16.6 billion.  SHAREHOLDER PAYOUT  Now, however, it is focused on preserving its dividend. Earlier this week, Exxon said it would cut its workforce by about 15% but kept its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout.  \u201cIt is significant that Exxon is explicitly guiding to maintaining the dividend having reduced capex and potentially adding more divestments,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.  Exxon said its North American dry gas assets, worth roughly $25 billion to $30 billion, could be written down if the company decides those holdings are not part of its long-term investment plans.  Next year, the largest U.S. oil producer said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, versus an adjusted plan to spend around $23 billion this year.  The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra.  In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, from 565,000 barrels per day this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers.  Exxon\u2019s Permian output was around 401,000 barrels per day in the third quarter and it said its costs there had dropped 20%.","201":"NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub was caught off guard when U.S. oil giant Chevron swooped in last month with a $33 billion offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production firm she had been wooing for nearly two years. Chevron, nearly five times larger than Occidental , appeared to have out-maneuvered its smaller rival. But on Sunday Hollub showed the fight was not over. After a whirlwind few days to raise more cash, Hollub offered a sweetened deal. By Thursday, Chevron had bowed out.  In edging out Chevron in the bidding war, Hollub leaned on global relationships and knowledge forged from 35 years in the oil industry, according to about a dozen people familiar with the talks leading up to the company\u2019s latest offer.  Occidental had struggled to win over Anadarko because its first public $38 billion offer of 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock, as well as previous offers made privately, required the approval of Occidental shareholders, and Anadarko was not convinced they would go for the deal, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.  Hollub knew she needed to substantially increase the cash offer - thereby making shareholder approval unnecessary - and moved swiftly to secure it, the sources said.  She was in Paris on April 26, just two weeks after Chevron\u2019s announcement, and struck an $8.8 billion deal with French major Total SA to sell Anadarko assets her company didn\u2019t yet own.  Two days later she was in Omaha, Nebraska, securing $10 billion in financing from billionaire investor Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, who typically does not partner with companies pursuing unsolicited takeovers.  Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview for this story.  The combined company would establish Occidental as the largest operator in the Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution, where a boom in production has propelled the United States into becoming the world\u2019s largest oil producer.  It would make Occidental the third-largest U.S. oil company with a market value of about $80 billion, dwarfed only by global giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron.  \u201cShe\u2019s doing the boldest M&A thing that\u2019s happened since the \u201880s,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy consultant and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cYou\u2019re having an atypical M&A battle in a very competitive space where (usually) the bigger you are, the more you\u2019re going to win.\u201d  Hollub\u2019s challenge has stunned an industry where the last attempt to break up an agreed-upon deal between two U.S. oil companies was in 1984 when Texaco challenged Pennzoil\u2019s acquisition of Getty Oil.  It has also angered some Occidental investors who say Hollub is overstretching the company\u2019s balance sheet in an ill-advised quest for size in a volatile industry.  \u201cOur concern is the willingness of the management team at Occidental to cut very favorable deals against the interests of shareholders on a longer-term basis,\u201d said John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.  T. Rowe, the sixth-largest holder of Occidental shares, announced it would vote against the board of directors on the annual shareholder meeting Friday. But such a move may be mostly symbolic.  An Occidental spokesman declined to comment on the concerns but pointed to Hollub\u2019s defense of her strategy that it was better to raise cash than issue new debt.  Hollub\u2019s background in the technical aspects of oil production contrasts with her predecessor, a banker and known dealmaker. She has been described as down to earth by former and current employees, differing from flamboyant energy CEOs.  LONGTIME DISCUSSIONS  Buying Anadarko was seen as the best way for Occidental to gain more acreage in the Permian shale basin, where it markets nearly a quarter of all barrels produced in the region.  When Chevron announced a deal on April 12 to buy Anadarko, Hollub gathered the merger team. They were shocked that Anadarko had accepted a bid that was $11 per share below what Occidental had privately offered, three of the people familiar with the discussions said.  \u201cShe thought, we\u2019re in it to win it. Let\u2019s make our offer public so their shareholders know what they passed up,\u201d one of the sources said.  In a letter to Anadarko\u2019s board of directors on April 24, Occidental said they \u201cwere surprised and disappointed\u201d that Anadarko had not agreed to their previous two offers in April.  Anadarko executives, however, remained concerned that Occidental shareholders could scuttle the deal, leaving them without a buyer, two sources familiar with the situation said. The board of directors wanted to stick with Chevron.  Just two days after sending the letter, Hollub was in Paris meeting with Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne to discuss Anadarko\u2019s African assets, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.  The two already had a relationship stemming from the Dolphin Gas Project, a Middle East cross-border gas initiative where both companies have an equal share. Total had made it known to her that they coveted Anadarko\u2019s properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique.  \u201cVicki wanted to show that she could quickly put the cash on the table. In less than 10 days she had the cash ready,\u201d a Paris-based source said.  Omaha, Nebraska was next. Buffett is known for moving quickly when a deal piques his interest, but he tends to avoid getting involved in hostile takeover bids.  The meeting was set up by BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, whose bank was helping to provide financing for the Anadarko deal. Hollub later said Buffett was \u201cwarm and wonderful\u201d in their meeting, a source familiar with the discussions said.  Buffett, cash flush and on the hunt for new deals, agreed to provide $10 billion in financing in return for an 8 percent premium, a concern for dividend-focused shareholders who believe the terms are too pricey.  The two deals enabled Hollub to submit a revised offer on Sunday, increasing the cash component from 50 percent to 78 percent.  On Thursday, Chevron said it would collect its $1 billion termination fee and walk away from the negotiations.","202":"(Repeats April 12 story with no changes to text)  April 12 (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron Corp\u2019s $33 billion deal on Friday to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp has some investors and industry executives asking whether it is time for other U.S. shale oil and gas producers to consider selling themselves.  Anadarko has been one of the pioneers of the shale revolution, which turned the United States into the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, overtaking Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Houston-based company\u2019s willingness to ink a sale, rather than capitalize on oil prices rebounding, illustrates the significant challenges facing many U.S. shale producers.  These challenges include exploration and production becoming more expensive, as the oil and gas that is easier to access gets scarcer and existing wells turn less productive. Deep-pocketed oil majors such as Chevron can better cope with these costs, because they can get cheaper drilling rates by committing to longer contacts and afford cutting-edge technology to get more out of wells.  Shale producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources, Continental Resources, Diamondback Energy and Concho Resources have already been under pressure from investors to improve their profitability. Many investors now say Chevron\u2019s deal will embolden them to grill companies in the sector whether it is time to throw in the towel and sell.  \u201cIf you have large acreage positions like Pioneer and Concho, or lesser but more contiguous positions like Parsley Energy, and you\u2019re a pure-play Permian producer, there\u2019s no doubt that you are on the radar screen for these majors,\u201d said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors.  Pioneer, Concho and Parsley shares rose 11.5 percent, 8.8 percent and 11.7 percent respectively on Friday following the announcement of the sale of Anadarko, amid investor speculation over who the next takeover target will be.  U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said independent producers expect to spend about 11 percent less in 2019, while major oil companies plan to spend about 16 percent more.  Pioneer, one of the Permian\u2019s largest producers, said in February it plans to reduce 2019 capital expenditures by 11 percent, or about $350 million, in an effort to appease investors.  While there has been dealmaking in the last 12 months - both Concho Resources Inc and Diamondback Energy Inc have bought rivals - many of the large producers which spent years gobbling each other up have been sitting on their hands, under shareholder pressure to focus on creating stronger returns.  The sale of Anadarko could likely change that for potential acquirers, including ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp, the two largest U.S. independents behind the majors. Occidental was the rival bidder that lost out to Chevron in the race to buy Anadarko, sources said on Friday.  \u201cAt some point in time in the next few years the majors may reach out,\u201d Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield told Reuters this week, before Chevron\u2019s acquisition was announced.  He declined to comment on whether majors had approached Pioneer directly.  Asked about his appetite for deals in February, Conoco CEO Ryan Lance said it would have to be an unusual opportunity for the company to consider an acquisition. \u201cWe are not feeling any pressure to do anything,\u201d he said.  RUNNING OUT OF INVENTORY  Given the substantial production forecasts being offered by some of the majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp, they will need to acquire new acreage at a big scale to offset the often sharp declines experienced by shale wells.  The majors \u201care eventually going to run out of inventory,\u201d said Pioneer\u2019s Sheffield. \u201cThey are drilling their inventory faster than the independents, so they are going to run out a lot faster, in my opinion.\u201d  BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which lag peers like Exxon and Chevron in the Permian, could make acquisitions to gain more exposure to the formation, analysts said.  Shell was seen as the leading contender to buy privately owned Permian producer Endeavor Energy, people familiar with the transaction told Reuters, but the two companies have, so far, failed to agree on Endeavor\u2019s valuation.  Shell is further constrained by its target to spend only $30 billion on capital projects in 2019, including acquisitions, said Noah Barnett, an analyst at Janus Henderson.","203":"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand\u2019s energy minister on Sunday welcomed a decision by U.S. energy company Chevron to continue negotiations rather than seek arbitration to resolve a dispute over who should pay for removing offshore oil and gas platforms.  FILE PHOTO: A Chevron gas station sign is seen in Del Mar, California, in this April 25, 2013 file photo. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Thailand wants Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs, estimated by a local newspaper at around $2.5 billion, for infrastructure at the Erawan gas field, which it is due to hand over to Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl in April 2022 when its concessions expire.  Reuters first reported last week that the U.S. company had \u201ctemporarily suspended\u201d a plan to seek arbitration in order to allow more time for talks with Thailand\u2019s energy ministry, but that arbitration was still a possibility \u201cwithin weeks\u201d if talks do not succeed.  Thailand\u2019s energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said on Sunday the Chevron\u2019s decision was a good sign that the two parties could work together to resolve the dispute and ensure a smooth handover of the gas field.  \u201cChevron\u2019s decision to hold off the arbitration process to continue negotiations is welcomed,\u201d energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong said.  \u201cI also believe that we will arrive at the best agreements while prioritizing Thailand\u2019s interests,\u201d he added.  The dispute arose in 2016 when Thailand retroactively enforced a new energy ministry regulation requiring gas field operators to pay the costs of decommissioning all assets they have installed even if they no longer operate them.  Chevron argues that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971 it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer deemed usable before it hands over the field to another operator.  The new law would require Chevron to pay the future costs of decommissioning all the infrastructure it has installed at the Erawan field, including still usable assets it will transfer to PTTEP free of charge.  The dispute has implications for other international energy companies such as France\u2019s Total and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.  Outside of the oil and gas industry, other foreign investors in Thailand were also concerned about the retroactive use of laws, and what precedent the case might set for the sanctity of their contracts.","204":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted oil major Chevron Corp a 2017 hardship waiver from U.S. biofuel laws for its Utah refinery earlier this year, according to a source familiar with the company\u2019s operations.  FILE PHOTO: A Chevron gas station sign is shown in Cardiff, California, in this January 25, 2016 photo. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Chevron, which reported a net income of $9.2 billion in 2017, becomes the largest known company to be awarded a hardship waiver from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel pool or buy compliance credits from competitors that do.  The waivers, which have grown significantly under the Trump administration, have angered corn-belt farmers who say it hurts demand for ethanol and other biofuels.  \u201cWhen an oil company whose net profits surpass the total value of the Iowa corn crop claims it is experiencing \u2018hardship,\u2019 you know we\u2019ve reached a new level of absurdity,\u201d said Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association.  California-based Chevron declined to confirm whether it received a small refinery hardship waiver, but did say that seeking them can level the playing field.  \u201cEPA has acknowledged that it has granted several small refinery exemptions from the RFS. Any Chevron refinery not exempted from the RFS would be at a disadvantage in the highly competitive markets where we operate,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.  The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Refineries with a capacity less than 75,000 barrels-per-day can receive waivers from the RFS if they prove compliance would cause them disproportionate hardship. Chevron\u2019s Salt Lake City, Utah, plant is 54,000 barrels-per-day.  The EPA, under President Donald Trump, expanded the waiver program, awarding 29 exemptions for the 2017 calendar year, up from 19 in 2016 and just seven in 2015, EPA data shows.  The EPA has attributed the program\u2019s expansion to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners who challenged the EPA\u2019s denial of their waiver request. A federal judge ruled the EPA was using too narrow of a test to evaluate applications.  Biofuel backers say the expansion was politically driven by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who sought ways to lower compliance costs for refiners. The Chevron approval was granted under Pruitt, the source said.  The surge in hardship waivers has pummeled the price for compliance credits some refiners must buy.  Reuters previously reported that Chevron, along with Exxon Mobil Corp, sought a hardship waiver from U.S. biofuel laws.  Exxon Mobil\u2019s application status was unclear.","205":"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand\u2019s energy ministry said on Tuesday it had set a March target to resolve a $2 billion dispute with U.S. oil and gas major Chevron Corp and would make the \u201cutmost effort\u201d to reach a deal after the company halted arbitration.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018.

It was not immediately clear if Chevron had agreed to the 180-day time frame, and a spokesman could not immediately comment on Tuesday.  Reuters reported late last month Chevron had suspended the arbitration process for a matter of \u201cweeks\u201d, adding it would revert back to it if talks with Thailand failed.  Kulit, in charge of leading negotiations from the ministry side, said he could not reveal details of ongoing talks, but Thailand was ready to enter the arbitration process if needed.  \u201cNow we have a truce. We\u2019ll see what happens if war starts again, but for now, we don\u2019t want to provoke or do anything that will adversely affect the negotiations,\u201d he told Reuters.  Chevron objected to a June request by Thailand\u2019s energy ministry to pay the full decommissioning costs of around $2 billion for infrastructure in the Erawan gas field, including still usable assets it will transfer free of charge to Thai state oil firm PTT Exploration and Production Pcl when its concessions expire in April 2022.  The company argued that under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971, it was only liable for infrastructure deemed no longer usable.  The dispute has implications for France\u2019s Total SA and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in soon-expiring offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.  Ministry officials estimated the decommissioning costs for some 50 assets in the Bongkot field, operated by PTTEP and Total, are worth around $1 billion.  In the Erawan field, Chevron and Mitsui & Co operate some 200 assets, estimated to cost around $2 billion to remove.","206":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A decision by Petrobras not to invest in drilling new wells has derailed Chevron Corp\u2019s plan to resume exploration in a Brazilian offshore field, people familiar with the matter said.  Chevron, which operates the field with a 52 percent stake, approved the drilling plan but Petrobras, which holds a 30 percent stake nixed the move, according to two people close to the talks.  Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company, officially known as Petroleo Brasileiro, is prioritizing development of pre-salt offshore resources where billions of barrels of oil lie under a thick layer of salt below the ocean floor, the two people said. The Frade field is post salt and has less oil than pre-salt fields.  Petrobras and Schlumberger NV, which planned to drill six wells for some $20 million, could not immediately be reached for comment. Chevron declined to comment.  Brazilian energy company Petro Rio SA said on Monday it bought the remaining 12 percent from Frade Japao. Petro Rio SA CEO Nelson Queiroz told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday the company would be interested in buying Petrobras\u2019 stake.  \u201cWe see extending the life of the field as a positive, drilling new wells,\u201d he said.  Chevron and Petrobras halted exploration in the Frade field after a 2011 spill that led to criminal charges and a civil lawsuit.

The U.S. oil giant said it had offered to buy the rest of Noble Midstream at $12.47 per common unit, in line with its closing price on Thursday.  Noble Midstream\u2019s units rose more than 6% to $13.13 in early trade on Friday, slightly above the offer price.  While this consolidation was the most likely outcome after Chevron\u2019s Noble Energy takeover, the market is likely to focus on previous similar deals that required premiums to get over the finish line, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts wrote in a note.  Noble Midstream\u2019s investors, however, should not expect a sweetened bid or a competitive offer because Chevron owns its parent, said Ethan Bellamy, managing director of midstream strategy at East Daley Capital Advisors.  \u201cWe expect the transaction to be consummated expeditiously, without regulatory impediments,\u201d Bellamy said.

Shares in both the companies were down in early trading in New York, despite a rising overall market and weekend gains in global crude prices.  \u201cAt the depths of the market last year... a cost cutting focused merger of the two companies may have made sense and also scale matters in this industry so it would have created by far the largest integrated oil company,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.  However, anti-trust concerns and the new U.S. administration\u2019s stance on big mergers make it unlikely that a deal resurfaces, Kapadia said, adding that buying smaller, hard-hit oil companies gives Exxon and Chevron more value.  As oil producers in Europe adapt to investors\u2019 push for a shift into renewables, it is also possible that Chevron or Exxon could buy the oil producing business of a European major in the coming years, Kapadia said.  Exxon\u2019s year-end results scheduled for Tuesday are expected to be marred by a charge of up to $20 billion on the value of its natural gas properties.

Like most of its peers in an industry struggling with the collapse of oil prices this year, Chevron is cutting spending, consolidating business units, and has asked some managers to reapply for their jobs.  Figures from the end of last year show that less than a quarter of Chevron\u2019s U.S. executives and senior managers were female, and only 22% were from ethnic minorities.  In an email sent to employees this week and seen by Reuters, Chief Human Resources Officer Rhonda Morris said the company selected 26% women for global roles in a second round of evaluations and, in the United States, 29% of candidates selected were from ethnically diverse candidates.  A spokeswoman for the company confirmed the details of the email but did not specify whether the selections were permanent appointments or a shortlist for the positions.  The company, however, expects the diversity ratio to be around 44% when the selection processes are complete, the spokeswoman added.  Long owned and run predominantly by white males, the oil industry has drawn criticism along with other parts of corporate America for failing to do enough to promote diversity.  Women and people from non-white ethnic backgrounds represented 46% of the oil industry\u2019s workforce in 2019 and are expected to fill 54% of total job opportunities through 2040, an IHS Markit analysis for the American Petroleum Institute shows.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  In December, Chevron warned it could take up to $11 billion in writedowns on properties that were no longer economical: Appalachian shale gas properties, a proposed Canadian liquefied natural gas project and a U.S. offshore field.  With oil prices weak, major oil companies including Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corp, have sought to raise cash and improve returns by putting properties on the market.  Chevron shares were off 3% at $107.57 in early trading.  Its production rose in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, but results were hurt by sharply lower prices for its sales of oil and gas. Average prices for Chevron\u2019s oil fell 16% from a year earlier, and natural gas prices fell by nearly half.  Excluding one-time items, per share profit was $1.49, slightly above Wall Street\u2019s estimate of $1.45.  Analysts said weaker prices and margins hurt Chevron\u2019s cash flow from operations. It fell more than $1 billion from a year ago, to $5.3 billion.  Still, the company generated enough cash for the full year to cover its capital spending and dividends.  \u201cWe expect robust cash returns to shareholders to continue,\u201d said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland in a note on Friday.  Chevron\u2019s quarterly loss including charges was $6.61 billion, or $3.51 per share, compared with a profit of $3.73 billion, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier.  Results included a gain of $1.2 billion in the quarter on the sale of U.K. North Sea assets.  Chevron\u2019s net oil equivalent production was flat at 3.08 million barrels per day in the quarter as gains in its U.S. shale were offset by lower output elsewhere.  Its production in the Permian Basin rose 36% from the year ago quarter, to 514,000 barrels per day.  Charges for shale and other write downs pushed operating profit in its U.S. oil and gas operations to a $7.4 billion loss, compared with a $964 million profit a year ago. Outside the U.S., production profits fell to $731 million from $2.3 billion a year ago.  In refining and chemicals, the company posted a $672 million profit for the quarter, down from $859 million a year ago.","216":"(Corrects fourth paragraph to show La Rosa previously served as commercial manager in Venezuela, not country manager)  RIO DE JANEIRO\/HOUSTON, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp permanently assigned its Brazil country chief to run its Venezuelan operations, three sources said this week, after the months-long detention of two executives escalated tensions between the OPEC-member nation and foreign oil firms.  Javier La Rosa, who had been president of Chevron Brazil since 2016 according to his LinkedIn page, this month was named to replace the company\u2019s Venezuela general manager, Christopher Whatley, said the sources, who spoke on Thursday and Friday.  Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  La Rosa had headed Venezuelan commercial operations for the company from 2005 to 2008, his LinkedIn page said. He flew to Caracas shortly after Chevron employees were detained to temporarily lead the Venezuela unit, according to two other people familiar with the matter.  None of the sources could speak for attribution because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.  La Rosa\u2019s appointment comes after a tense showdown between foreign oil companies and the government in recent months as Venezuela\u2019s political and economic meltdown deepened.  Venezuelan authorities this week released the two executives jailed since April as part of an ongoing graft probe into the oil sector, which has spooked other foreign companies operating in partnership with state oil company PDVSA.  The arrests, related to the executives\u2019 refusal to sign a supply contract for furnace parts for a PDVSA joint venture, were made public after some oil-service companies pulled back from Venezuela, writing off billions of dollars in assets.  La Rosa is leaving Brazil just as Chevron begins to flex its muscle in Latin America\u2019s largest crude producer. In a consortium with Petrobras and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Chevron clinched its first block in Brazil\u2019s coveted offshore pre-salt oil play on Thursday.  It was not immediately clear who will run Chevron\u2019s Brazil operations.  Reuters reported in December that Chevron was in talks with oil services firm Schlumberger NV to resume drilling in an offshore field after a 2011 oil spill there cut production.  Chevron, the world\u2019s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer, with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year to $329 million, according to regulatory filings.

REUTERS\/Mike Segar\/File Photo  Nine years ago, Donziger had won a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in an Ecuador court, but was unable to enforce it after a U.S. judge found it had been obtained through fraud.  In a decision published Thursday, the appeals court faulted Donziger\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d misconduct, which it said included ghostwriting a court expert\u2019s report, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and judicial coercion and bribery \u201cwhich he steadfastly refuses to acknowledge and shows no remorse for.\u201d  Martin Garbus, a lawyer for Donziger, said in a statement on Donziger\u2019s Twitter feed that his client will appeal.  \u201cThis is a horrendous decision\u201d that deprives Ecuadorians harmed by Chevron of their main advocate, Garbus said. \u201cHe is being singled out because he so threatens Chevron and the fossil fuel industry.\u201d  Chevron declined to comment. Donziger did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. The decision prevents him from practicing law in New York.  Donziger, a Harvard Law School graduate, represented villagers in Ecuador\u2019s Lago Agrio region who sought to hold Chevron liable for water and soil contamination from 1964 to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001.  While not disputing that pollution occurred, San Ramon, California-based Chevron contended that Texaco cleaned up the area, and state-owned Petroecuador was mainly responsible for the contamination.  In 2014, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan said Donziger and his legal team used bribery, coercion and fraud to obtain the judgment against Chevron, including a $500,000 bribe to the presiding judge. He barred them from \u201cprofiting in any way from the egregious fraud that occurred.\u201d  Several countries have rejected efforts by Donziger or Ecuador to enforce the judgment. In 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider the case.  The legal battle was also the subject of a 2009 documentary, \u201cCrude.\u201d  Donziger had been suspended from law practice in July 2018, but a judicial referee in February recommended his reinstatement.  In rejecting Donziger\u2019s request to affirm that recommendation, the appeals court said the referee had been \u201ctoo dismissive\u201d of the severity of Donziger\u2019s misconduct.

FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo adorns an office door at the SEC headquarters in Washington, June 24, 2011. REUTERS\/Jonathan Ernst  U.S. District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan granted the freeze over accounts linked to suspicious purchases between Feb. 8 and April 1 by unknown buyers of Anadarko securities, who the SEC said stand to make roughly $2.5 million in illicit profits, according to a court filing.  In a separate complaint, the SEC said the traders were unknown as they used accounts located in Britain and Cyprus, making a series of \u201clarge, unprecedented purchases\u201d of call option contracts in Anadarko days after the company began acquisition talks, and weeks before the potential agreement was made public.  \u201cThe timing, size, nature, and profitability of the Defendants\u2019 trades, as well as the lack of prior history of significant Anadarko options trading in the subject accounts, make the trades at issue highly suspicious,\u201d the SEC wrote.  Chevron announced on April 12 it would buy Anadarko for about $33 billion. Another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp, launched an unsolicited $38 billion bid for Anadarko on April 24, which Anadarko said on Monday it would negotiate.  The first suspicious purchases were made on Feb. 8, two days after Chevron privately proposed an acquisition to Anadarko, according to the SEC. All told, 1,650 call options were purchased across four transactions between then and April 1. Each purchase accounted for a large portion of such call purchases on each particular day.  Buying a call option conveys the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares at a fixed price in the future. The value of calls can jump sharply when the underlying stock\u2019s price rises.  For example, in one of the trades laid out in the SEC filing, on April 1, 650 Anadarko contracts betting on the shares rising above $50 by mid-May were bought for $1.07 per contract.  By April 12, these calls traded as high as $13.18, according to Refinitive data.  The SEC said the unknown parties stand to make roughly $2.5 million in illicit profits from the trading, after selling or exercising the options to buy company stock after the potential deal was announced, which sent the company\u2019s stock higher. The day Chevron announced it planned to purchase Anadarko, the company\u2019s stock jumped 32 percent.  While it has not yet identified specific individuals, the SEC believes the traders are located outside the United States, adding there is a \u201csignificant risk\u201d the illicit proceeds may move overseas shortly.  The asset freeze orders any parties that receive notice must not withdraw, transfer or dispose of assets related to the allegations.  The SEC declined to comment on the case beyond its complaint, while Anadarko could not immediately be reached for comment.  Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals and other news that tends to move stock prices, and the SEC has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options.  Anadarko shares have trailed other energy companies in recent years, but they recently got a boost from the twin takeover offers.  On Monday afternoon, its shares were trading largely steady at about $72.79.","220":"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday dismissed claims attempting to force Chevron Corp\u2019s Canadian unit to pay a $9.5 billion judgment handed down in Ecuador against the U.S. oil major over pollution in the Andean country.

But the company has no assets in the country, and the villagers have been trying to sue it in the United States, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to enforce the decision.  The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in 2017 that Chevron Canada was a separate entity to its parent company and its shares and assets could not be seized by those seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment.  Canada\u2019s highest court rejected a request to review that decision, which is now final.  \u201cAny further efforts by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers to continue this lawsuit in Canada would be an abuse of the country\u2019s legal system and a waste of its judicial resources,\u201d said R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron\u2019s vice president and general counsel.  An international tribunal unanimously ruled last year that the pollution judgment by Ecuador\u2019s Supreme Court against Chevron was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption.  Texaco was released from liability through a settlement with Ecuador years earlier, the tribunal found.  Patricio Salazar, one of the lawyers for the affected communities, said the Supreme Court ruling left parent company Chevron Corp as the sole defendant and the communities would proceed immediately to trial to force the U.S. oil company to comply with the Ecuadorian judgment.  \u201cWhile we wanted the Canada Supreme Court to hear the issue, its denial of our motion does not mean the issue is resolved and it can still be decided at a later date after we enforce the judgment,\u201d said Salazar.","221":"(Reuters) - About 600 gallons of petroleum and water mixture that leaked from Chevron Corp's wharf at its Richmond, California, oil refinery has been contained on Tuesday, according to the regional air pollution regulator's official twitter bit.ly\/3jygjTb account.

The plant is operated by Pasadena Refining System Inc, a Texas-based unit of Brazil\u2019s state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA.  Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall declined to comment on Monday. Carlos Monteiro, a spokesman for Petrobras in Rio de Janeiro, said any communications on an agreement would be disclosed to the market.  A deeply indebted Petrobras put the plant on the market in early 2018 after sinking more than $1.18 billion into it since it acquired its first stake in the operation in 2006.  Chevron and Petrobras\u2019 negotiations were delayed in part by Brazil\u2019s presidential election and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc dropping out of talks to operate a terminal at the site as a joint venture, the sources said.  Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Lexey Long declined to comment.  Petrobras has been looking to divest $21 billion in assets to reduce its debt load amid a series of corruption scandals including allegations bribes were paid to executives as a result of the 2006 purchase of the Pasadena plant.  The rapid expansion of U.S. shale production from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico has stirred demand for new U.S. refining capacity and crude-export facilities. Oil output has soared to an estimated 3.8 million bpd this month, from 1.48 million five years ago.  Chevron, which reported a 150,000 bpd increase in shale production in the third quarter, has said it wants a second Gulf Coast facility to handle that crude and better supply its retail gasoline network. The plant produces mostly gasoline and distillates such as diesel.  The refinery covers 192 acres on the Houston Ship Channel and the purchase includes another 274 acres of terminal and other cleared land available for expansion. The site has storage tanks that can hold 5.1 million barrels and a marine terminal for exports.  The plant\u2019s 300-strong work force is represented by the United Steelworkers union, and would become Chevron employees once the deal is completed.  There are several small U.S. refineries on the market. Husky Energy Inc earlier this month began marketing a 12,000-bpd refinery in Prince George, British Columbia.  Royal Dutch Shell recently began accepting bids for its 75,000-bpd Sarnia, Ontario, refinery, according to people familiar with the matter.

The Trump administration has been divided on whether to revoke California-based Chevron\u2019s ability to continue operations in Venezuela, home to the world\u2019s largest oil reserves and where the company has been active for about 100 years. It has renewed the license for Chevron and four other U.S.-based companies several times and the current one expires on April 22.  State Department officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have wanted to keep Chevron operating in Venezuela to have a U.S. beachhead there and source of stability should President Nicolas Maduro be forced to step down.  White House officials on the National Security Council have been more aggressive, arguing that Chevron\u2019s presence in Venezuela is not helping in the push to remove Maduro. The United States supports opposition leader Juan Guaido.  Abrams found it unlikely that there could be other ways for Washington to halt Chevron\u2019s activities in Venezuela. \u201cThere are various reasons why Chevron might stop other than the revocation of the license but in terms of the U.S. government, I think that would be the only way,\u201d he said.  Some analysts have said that if Chevron were to leave Venezuela its assets could end up in the hands of Russia\u2019s state-led energy company Rosneft or other Russian interests. Abrams said Washington had ways to deal with that.  \u201cThe first question is whether Rosneft which portrays itself as just a business, just an oil company, would want to put more of its assets and activities in Venezuela, and that ought to be a business decision,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cLet\u2019s see first if it is a business decision. That is who makes the decision? The company or the government of Russia,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cObviously we have ways of responding if they do that.\u201d  Washington last week slapped sanctions on a trading unit of Rosneft that has emerged as a key intermediary for the sale of Venezuelan oil and President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned more actions will be taken.  Rosneft has accused Washington of double standards saying it allows U.S. companies to work in Venezuela.  Chevron says its Venezuelan crude exports last year represented about 2% of the country\u2019s total crude shipments and that its marketing activities are permitted under the license. It also said the proceeds go to maintenance of operations at joint ventures in Venezuela.  \u201cProceeds are not paid to PDVSA,\u201d said Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr. \u201cOur focus continues to be on our base business operations and supporting the more than 8,800 people who work with us and their families.\u201d","229":"(Corrects year-end Permian output, adds analyst comment)  March 24 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp will slash capital spending by $4 billion this year and suspend share buybacks, the latest oil company to cut costs in the face of an unprecedented slide in oil prices.  Oil has crashed by more than 60% since January, hit by global demand destruction from the coronavirus pandemic and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.  The second largest U.S. oil firm on Tuesday joined refining giant Phillips 66, which cut its 2020 spending forecast by about 18%. Chevron said it would spend $16 billion instead of a planned $20 billion this year, including halving spending in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. It now expects to pump about 125,000 fewer barrels of oil and gas per day in the Permian Basin by the end of this year, down 20% from earlier plans. It had expected output to exceed 600,000 barrels per day.  This is the first indication from an oil major of how sharply it would pull back spending in the Permian field, output from which has helped the United States become the world\u2019s largest oil producer.  Chevron will cut $2 billion from its Permian spending, from an expected pace of about $4 billion per year.  Royal Dutch Shell on Monday said it would cut spending by $5 billion and suspend its $25 billion share buyback plan.  Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. oil company, has not released its new spending plan but said cuts would be \u201csignificant\u201d, while Norway\u2019s Equinor has also reduced its share buyback program.  The No. 2 Canadian crude producer Suncor Energy Inc on Monday cut its 2020 production outlook and suspended share repurchases.  Chevron\u2019s spending cuts were \u201cmuch deeper than expected\u201d, RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said, adding that the suspension of share buybacks was in line with expectations.  The $5 billion annual repurchase program was halted after $1.75 billion of shares were bought back during the first quarter.  Earlier this month Chevron had promised to keep its spending in check and return up to $80 billion to shareholders over the next five years.  \u201cOur focus is on protecting the dividend, prioritizing capital that drives long-term value, and supporting the balance sheet,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.  The cuts do not \u201ccompletely close the post-dividend outspend,\u201d analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said, but added that Chevron is the \u201cbest positioned to weather this downturn\u201d of the major oil companies.  Chevron shares closed on Monday at $54.22, down 8.7%, but were up 6.7% in premarket trading to $57.80.

Chevron operates in Venezuela, home to the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, as part of its 30 percent stake in the Petropiar joint venture with PDVSA, the Venezuelan state-controlled oil company.  Even as Exxon Mobil Corp and other companies in recent years have left the country, Chevron has stayed and has consistently said its operations there are fine.  \u201cThe upstream operations are still functioning and our focus is on safe operations and protecting people,\u201d Jay Johnson, Chevron\u2019s head of upstream operations, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Scotia Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans.  Johnson declined to comment when asked if Chevron has been asked by PDVSA - or expects to be asked - to divert crude from export to PDVSA refineries.  Reuters reported last fall that PDVSA asked the Petropiar joint venture with Chevron to turn over as much as 45 percent of the oil it planned to export in November with no immediate reimbursement.  Venezuela\u2019s overall oil production fell to a 28-year low last year amidst insufficient investments, payment delays to suppliers, U.S. sanctions and a talent brain drain.  Separately, Johnson said the recent U.S. tax overhaul has not had a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on the company, the world\u2019s third-largest publicly traded oil producer, as it already uses much of its cash generated overseas on foreign operations.  \u201cOn balance, though, a lower tax rate is better for us and does make the U.S. more competitive,\u201d said Johnson.

Wirth, who has worked at Chevron for more than 35 years and was previously the company\u2019s vice chairman, is also elgible for stock awards and other compansation this year potentially worth more than $15 million.  The pay raise came after Wirth\u2019s compensation as vice chairman was boosted last year by more than 25 percent, according to regulatory filings.  Wirth earned compensation last year of $11.7 million, up from $6.5 million in 2016. Chevron paid roughly $350,000 last year to bolster security at Wirth\u2019s home and about $16,000 for a medical checkup and related costs for its incoming CEO.  It is not uncommon for companies to insist on tighter security for incoming CEOs. Chevron, like many peers, also has its CEOs travel on company-owned aircraft, even for personal matters.  Chevron awarded outgoing CEO John Watson $24.8 million in compensation for 2017, roughly 1 percent higher than the prior year, as the company swung to an annual profit of $9.2 billion.

The move is a first for a U.S. oil major and focuses on the company\u2019s oil fields. More investors have been pressuring San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and other big oil companies to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change.  Chevron said that by 2023, it will reduce its methane and flaring intensity by 25 percent to 30 percent from 2016 levels, and said the goal would be added to the scorecard that determines incentive pay for around 45,000 employees.  \u201cIt\u2019s about the mindset and the culture of the company,\u201d said Chevron Vice President Mark Nelson, noting that including most of its global workforce would \u201charness\u201d ideas from all employees.

Royal Dutch Shell in December announced it would link executive compensation to reducing carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2020, including so-called Scope 3 emissions from fuels sold to customers around the world.  Chevron\u2019s report said it does not support establishing Scope 3 targets.  Exxon\u2019s latest climate report, published on Tuesday, includes a goal of reducing methane emissions from operations by 15 percent and flaring by 25 percent by 2020 compared with 2016 levels, as well as reducing greenhouse gas intensity at its Canadian oil sands facilities by 10 percent by 2023.  Chevron\u2019s target aims to reduce emissions and flaring as a percentage of production, but does not set a goal for total emissions - a measure that activist investors prefer. The targets will apply to Chevron\u2019s operations as well as joint ventures or assets it has a stake in but does not operate itself, the company said.  Methane, the main component of natural gas, is colorless and odorless, and has more than 80 times the heat trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say.  Methane can leak from oilfield equipment and pipelines, or is flared or vented during maintenance work, and when new oil wells are added in areas that don\u2019t have natural gas pipelines.

A report by the opposition-led Congress in 2016 said at least $11 billion went \u201cmissing\u201d at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014.  For years, the government decried such accusations as \u201csmear campaigns\u201d against socialism and in favor of a U.S.-backed coup.

He now blames \u201cthieves\u201d and \u201ctraitors\u201d for an economic crisis so severe that disease and malnutrition are spreading unchecked by a broken public health system.  Vowing a cleanup, Maduro replaced many of the jailed executives with soldiers.

But his strategy would likely shift with more input from allies and trading partners, a Biden strategist has said.","245":"HOUSTON\/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp CVX.N has held talks to acquire Pasadena Refining System Inc (PRSI), a Texas oil refining unit of Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, three people familiar with the matter said this week.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron (CVX) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  U.S. oil companies are looking to expand refining operations to handle rising volumes of crude flowing from the country\u2019s shale fields. A deal for PRSI would give Chevron an oil refinery that can process about 110,000 barrels-per-day of light crude.  Chevron is also discussing a gas liquids processing joint venture with Kinder Morgan Inc KMI.N, largest energy infrastructure provider in North America, two of the sources said. Kinder Morgan operates a nearby plant that separates gas liquids into ethane, propane and other fuels.  The sources requested anonymity to discuss the confidential talks. They did not disclose the deal price.  Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment.  Chevron and Kinder Morgan declined to comment.  Petrobras, which is deeply in debt, has been seeking to divest $21 billion in assets by year-end but has faced union resistance and legal obstacles. A presidential election on Sunday could raise obstacles for a sale with front-runner Jair Bolsonaro promising to install new managers at the company.  The PRSI refinery has been limited in the type of crude it can run since a 2011 fire, which left one of its processing units idle. A buyer would have to invest to upgrade the refinery, one of the people familiar with the matter said. But PRSI includes open land that could enable a future owner to easily expand the plant.  Petrobras put the plant, which is on the Houston Ship Channel leading to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and has its own export docks, on the market earlier this year after sinking more than $1.18 billion into the operation since 2006.  Garfield Miller, chief executive of energy investment bank Aegis Energy Advisors, said the U.S. shale-oil boom has given a second chance to U.S. plants designed to process lighter crudes. Several years ago Petrobras would not have been able to sell PRSI because of its age and inability to process heavy crudes, he said.  That has changed with the growth of the Permian Basin, the nation\u2019s largest oilfield, which now produces 3.5 million barrels per day of oil, according to U.S. government figures.  \u201cAnyone with crude in the Permian might logically want to own it,\u201d said Miller. \u201cThis refinery today has value, whereas eight or nine years ago it had none.\u201d  Pierre Breber, Chevron\u2019s head of refining and chemicals, this month said the company wanted to build or buy a refinery along the U.S. Gulf Coast to process oil from its West Texas operations.  Chevron\u2019s shale output from the region jumped 51 percent in the second quarter to 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By expanding its refining capacity to Houston, it would be able to process the crude closer to where it is produced.","246":"(Reuters) - Chevron Corp CVX.N cut its capital spending budget by $4 billion on Tuesday, leading a wave of cost-cutting announcements across the oil-and-gas industry as it reels from declining demand in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and a dramatic slide in prices.  FILE PHOTO: An entrance sign at the Chevron refinery, located near the Houston Ship Channel, is seen in Pasadena, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  Crude oil prices have crashed by 60% since January as Saudi Arabia and Russia pump full bore to grab share in a dwindling market, and gasoline and jet fuel use has slumped. Demand worldwide is expected to fall by more than 12 million barrels per day, more than 10% of daily demand.  The reset is being felt across the industry, as Chevron was joined on Tuesday in reducing expenses by oilfield service leaders Halliburton HAL.N and Schlumberger SLB.N, independent refiner Phillips 66 PSX.N, and Canada's Suncor SU.TO.  \u201cThis is as unprecedented an oil price environment as I can recall seeing,\u201d Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said in an interview.  Chevron will spend $16 billion this year, down from a planned $20 billion, halving its spending in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. It is the lowest spending level for the company since 2005.  This is the first indication from an oil major of how sharply it would pull back in the Permian, which has made the United States the world\u2019s largest oil producer. The Permian accounts for about 4.8 million bpd of crude production, or more than a third of daily U.S. oil output.  Dozens of smaller U.S. shale companies have curtailed spending, and analysts at Goldman Sachs expect a roughly 35% drop in capital expenditure in 2020, and for U.S. oil production to fall by 1.4 million bpd by the third quarter of 2021.  Shale companies have been pressuring U.S. service companies for discounts, which is cutting into those firms\u2019 earnings as well. Halliburton said it was testing the possibility of cutting as much as 60 to 65% in spending.  \u201cThe industry is facing an unprecedented dual impact on demand and supply side that none of us have witnessed over our professional lifetimes,\u201d Lance Loeffler, Halliburton\u2019s chief financial officer, told investors on a Tuesday webcast.  Share prices were higher across the board on Tuesday, though many oil company stocks have been battered over the last few weeks.  Chevron shares jumped 21% on Tuesday to $65.73 as investors cheered the company\u2019s budget cut, which was twice as big as analysts expected, as a sign it would not incur debt to finance operations. Even with those gains, the stock was still down 46% on the year. Halliburton shares rose 19% on Tuesday, while Schlumberger gained 9%.  CUT IN PRODUCTION  Chevron now expects to pump about 125,000 fewer barrels of oil and gas per day in the Permian Basin by the end of this year, down 20% from its 600,000 barrel per day target.  The field is its \u201cmost flexible\u201d for spending reductions. Chevron has 16 drilling rigs at work in the field now, down from 20 last year, and will drop to fewer than eight, Wirth said.  Chevron will cut $2 billion from its Permian spending, from an expected pace of about $4 billion per year.  Exxon Mobil XOM.N, the largest U.S. oil company, has vowed to make significant cuts this year, while Norway\u2019s Equinor also reduced its share buyback program.  Chevron\u2019s reductions were \u201cmuch deeper than expected,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said.  Its $5 billion annual share repurchase program was halted after $1.75 billion of shares were bought back during the first quarter.  \u201cOur focus is on protecting the dividend, prioritizing capital that drives long-term value, and supporting the balance sheet,\u201d Chevron\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said.  The company would not consider an acquisition now, said Wirth, adding: \u201cThere will be a day when opportunities may present themselves. If we do the right things today we\u2019ll be in a position to consider that.\u201d  Chevron was already in the middle of a reorganization when oil prices plummeted, but Wirth would not say how many jobs it may cut.

The facility will once again produce Hamaca-grade synthetic crude for export at the plant, according to the document. Petropiar stopped producing Hamaca last year and had been making heavier Merey crude, mostly for the Asian market, since July.

Petropiar once made up to 210,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) of Hamaca out of tar-like oil from the OPEC nation\u2019s Orinoco belt, one of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves. The extra-heavy crude must be upgraded or blended with lighter grades at facilities near the Jose terminal before being exported.  But PDVSA struggled to find markets for that grade after the United States, previously Venezuela\u2019s largest customer, slapped sanctions on the company last year as part of Washington\u2019s push to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a dramatic economic collapse along with a freefall in crude output.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Dow Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company Chevron (CVX) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp released dueling Permian Basin projections that, if realized, would cement the rivals as the dominant players in the West Texas and New Mexico field, with one-third of Permian production potentially under their control within five years.  Chevron expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of next year, 59 percent above current production, and 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023, it said at its annual meeting with equity analysts in New York.  The stakes are such that Exxon on Tuesday forecast shale production of 1 million barrels per day in the Permian as early as 2024, grabbing the spotlight on the day Chevron was making a case in its oil growth.  \u201cOur investors don\u2019t need to wait several years for the story to come together,\u201d Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an apparent dig at Exxon, which has been investing heavily in the Permian to reverse production declines. \u201cWe\u2019re delivering now.\u201d  The Permian Basin pumps around 4 million barrels per day now and IHS Markit expects it to hit 5.4 mbd in 2023, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.  Wirth said at a press conference that he had been \u201cbusy\u201d and had not seen Exxon\u2019s Permian goal, which was released while he was speaking to analysts. He said, however, that Chevron\u2019s production could exceed 900,000 barrels daily if the company decided to increase drilling rigs from the 20 currently in operation.  \u201cIt\u2019s a decision we haven\u2019t taken yet but we certainly have it under active consideration,\u201d Wirth said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good story that could get even better.\u201d  Oil companies are trying to win back investors after years of underperforming other industrial sectors and the S&P 500. The weighting of energy shares in the S&P 500 index fell to 6 percent in 2018, from 8.4 percent four years earlier.  Like Exxon, Chevron has begun to emphasize achieving faster payoffs from investments in shale rather than the megaprojects of the past.  \u201cThe key driver of cash flow growth over the medium term remains the Permian, which continues to perform ahead of expectations,\u201d said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.  Chevron said it expects global production to rise 3 percent to 4 percent annually through 2023.  Executives said the company would return more cash to investors this year through dividends and $4 billion in share buybacks aiming to achieve a 6 percent shareholder return.  The company also raised its estimate of its reserves in the Permian, in Texas and New Mexico, to 16.2 billion barrels of recoverable resources from 9 billion.

U.S. President Donald Trump has in recent months imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imports, steps that have resulted in retaliatory measures against U.S. crops, motorcycles and other products, including petroleum.  That has sparked concern amongst Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and other major oil and natural gas producers that Trump\u2019s actions could imperil relations with some of their largest customers, including China and the European Union.  The United States, the world\u2019s largest natural gas producer, has begun exporting more of the fuel, part of Trump\u2019s approach to energy diplomacy.

Critics have long attacked the oil industry for ad campaigns that they call \u201cgreenwashing\u201d - telling people that policies or products are more environmentally friendly than they really are. But the ad agencies behind the campaigns have largely escaped scrutiny.  That\u2019s changing, as the issue of climate change shoots up the global agenda. Climate activists and some ad industry figures are calling on agencies to declare or dump their Big Oil clients.  Recent lawsuits by four U.S. states, the District of Columbia and a city allege \u201cgreenwashing\u201d by oil companies, accusing them of making \u201cmisleading and deceptive\u201d claims. The suits don\u2019t name the ad agencies as defendants, but do single out at least 15 campaigns. As a result, the companies could face embarrassment or become embroiled in the litigation.  Sean Corey, a Chevron spokesman, said such lawsuits are \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cserve only to divert attention and resources away from the collaborative, international efforts that are critical to developing a meaningful solution to climate change.\u201d  Pressure has been building against oil and gas companies in recent years to address dangerously rising global temperatures.

A prominent climate protest group, Extinction Rebellion, last year unfurled a banner reading \u201cTELL THE TRUTH\u201d outside the advertising industry\u2019s top awards ceremony in Cannes, France. Activists in the Netherlands and other European countries are campaigning for a tobacco-style ban on fossil fuel advertising.  All these pressures will likely intensify after the January inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who has vowed to get tough on climate change.

Sokol said that similar lawsuits against the tobacco industry brought to light information on the role of advertisers and PR companies in deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking.  In 1997, R.J. Reynolds tobacco company agreed to pay $10 million to settle a lawsuit over a campaign for its Camel brand, which was accused of targeting children. The \u201cJoe Camel\u201d campaign was executed by large advertising firms that also were sued.  Ultimately, Sokol said, details about advertising and marketing practices that emerged during litigation against the tobacco industry contributed to the companies\u2019 decision in the late 1990s to pay billions of dollars annually in a massive settlement with the vast majority of U.S. states and territories.  \u201cThere was a sea change in how we viewed tobacco products after we learned about that industry\u2019s disinformation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of that with climate.\u201d  Others predict that Big Oil\u2019s message makers will likely avoid costly courtroom verdicts. Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School who specializes in climate change, among other things, said it was unlikely that ad firms would be held liable for misleading communications by fossil fuel companies. That\u2019s because the primary duty of those firms is to their clients, the companies, and not to the public, he said.  However, he added, given the \u201cexistential stakes\u201d of climate change, advertisers likely won\u2019t escape being sued in the first place. \u201cI fully expect that advertising\/PR firms, bankers, insurers, accountants, lawyers, and other professionals that support fossil fuel companies, will increasingly find themselves targeted by lawsuits and pressure campaigns.\u201d  \u2018CREATIVITY HAS CONSEQUENCES\u2019  The picture is different in Europe, where regulators have taken action against a number of ad campaigns by oil companies.  In 2019, for instance, the UK advertising watchdog upheld a complaint against an ad by Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA that suggested gas was a \u201clow carbon\u201d energy source. In January, Italy\u2019s competition authority slapped state-backed energy giant Eni SpA with a \u20ac5 million ($6.10 million) fine for ads claiming that its diesel was \u201cgreen\u201d and helped the environment.  In the United States, ad agencies face a more immediate worry.  Several current and former ad executives and industry experts say advertisers for fossil fuel companies face a big challenge in appealing to young people, who polls show are far more concerned about global warming than their elders. In addition, some say, agencies with oil industry clients face a struggle to recruit talented young people with climate concerns.  Ad agency staff \u201care forced to treat all clients as equal,\u201d said Solitaire Townsend, co-founder of Futerra, a mid-sized advertising firm based in London. \u201cBut for the best young talent that simply isn\u2019t good enough anymore. They know that creativity has consequences, so our industry cannot be neutral.\u201d  Futerra has set up an initiative in which agencies voluntarily declare what proportion of their revenue comes from so-called \u201chigh-carbon\u201d clients, including not just Big Oil but also the aviation, automobile, concrete and plastics industries.  Futerra disclosed in 2019 that 1% of its revenue was generated by clients involved in plastics or aviation, but otherwise had no high-carbon clients.  Her firm and 244 small to mid-size agencies have signed on to the initiative, she said.  The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, criticized the spate of recent efforts to get advertising firms to ditch the oil and gas industry, saying that they were \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cunfounded.\u201d  \u201cWe are focused on being part of the solution, and we welcome debate on the best ways to innovate for a cleaner, reliable and affordable energy future,\u201d said API spokeswoman Bethany Aronhalt.  Together with their subsidiaries, the Big Four advertising companies - WPP, Omnicom Group, Publicis Groupe and Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG) - handle the accounts of many major oil companies. The accounts provide much-needed income for an ad industry financially devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.  WPP and IPG told Reuters they would not disclose their client lists. Omnicom and Publicis didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  \u2018THE CLARION CALL\u2019  Despite financial strains exacerbated by the pandemic, the oil industry\u2019s spending on advertising and PR will continue, or perhaps rise, as it fights tougher climate-related regulations and shrinking social acceptance in many countries, ad industry experts told Reuters.  \u201cOver the past thirty years, the major oil companies have ramped up their PR activities whenever it appears that the government is considering regulation of their activities,\u201d said Bob Brulle, Visiting Professor of Environment and Society at Brown University in Rhode Island. \u201cIt is quite predictable that this will occur as the Biden administration starts acting to control carbon emissions.\u201d  The suits by Delaware and Hoboken cite four WPP campaigns for fossil fuel companies as \u201cmisleading\u201d or \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d  WPP, which is not named as a defendant, declined to comment on the lawsuits.  WPP\u2019s website publishes an emphatic statement in favor of addressing climate change by its subsidiary, Ogilvy Consulting. \u201cAs industry leaders, we must be the clarion call,\u201d said the article. \u201cWe must act now.\u201d  Those actions included helping its clients from the energy sector \u201caccelerate the world\u2019s transition to a lower-carbon economy,\u201d WPP told Reuters.  Christine Arena, CEO of Generous, an ad agency in San Francisco, said big agencies were positioning themselves as saviors of the climate while representing companies accused of wrecking it. In 2015, Arena was one of four executives who left a large U.S. public relations firm to protest its representation of oil companies.  \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where you can no longer play both sides credibly or with impunity,\u201d she said.  ($1 = 0.8193 euros)","261":"(Reuters) - Chevron Corp doubled down on its bet on surging U.S. oil and gas output on Friday, saying it would buy shale producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $33 billion in cash and stock that will make it the second-largest crude producer in the world. The combined company will produce an estimated 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), trailing only Exxon Mobil Corp among publicly traded companies, up from fourth. It expands Chevron\u2019s reach in two areas where U.S. energy output is breaking records: shale from the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). These have helped make the United States one of the world\u2019s largest energy exporters.  \u201cChevron now joins the ranks of the \u2018ultra majors\u2019 \u2013 and the big three becomes the big four,\u201d said Roy Martin, senior analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. \u201cThe acquisition makes the majors\u2019 peer group much more polarized. Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and BP are now in a league of their own.\u201d  These companies are turning to shale and its revolutionary techniques of fracking, blasting sand and water into formations to extract oil. This is cheaper and produces oil more quickly than costlier offshore and LNG projects that take years to generate cash.  The shale oil-and-gas boom reversed a long decline in U.S. crude production and propelled the country to a record 12 million barrels a day (bpd), more than Russia and Saudi Arabia. The United States is also now the third-largest producer of LNG, super-cooled natural gas that enjoys record demand as a cheaper, cleaner alternative than coal for power generation.  The combined companies are expected to produce more than 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the United States this year and 3.9 million boepd globally, according to Wood Mackenzie.  Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the deal offers a \u201ccompelling and unique fit\u201d because the companies operate in similar areas, both with holdings in shale, offshore, and LNG projects. Chevron also expects shale to generate profits for its pipeline, trading and refining units.  \u201cWe are the best company to combine with Anadarko and Anadarko is the best company to combine with us,\u201d Wirth said in an interview.  Chevron\u2019s pledge to restrain expenditures has made it a favorite among energy stocks, with its shares up 13.8 percent this year. It plans to sell some $15 billion in assets over time to offset the Anadarko deal.  Chevron shares fell 4.9 percent to $119.76 on Friday. Anadarko shares jumped 32 percent, reflecting the offer\u2019s 39 percent premium over Thursday\u2019s close. Before the deal, Chevron shares had gained 25 percent over the last two years, while Anadarko had dropped 23 percent. In that time, U.S. crude oil prices have risen 20 percent.  It is the oil industry\u2019s largest deal since Royal Dutch Shell bought BG Group in 2016, and it sparked speculation that other shale producers are in play. Shares of Noble Energy rose 7 percent, while Pioneer Natural Resources Co jumped more than 11 percent.  Chevron, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the shale bonanza, when more nimble independent producers such as Anadarko pioneered shale drilling technology and leased Permian acreage on the cheap.  Analysts predict further consolidation as the smaller companies that revolutionized the industry through advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking have seen their stock prices languish and have curtailed spending due weak returns.  Chevron, which already has 2.3 million acres in the Permian Basin, said the combined company would have a 75-mile (120-km)-wide corridor across the Permian\u2019s Delaware basin, on the Texas-New Mexico border.  \u201cWe will now see Chevron emerging as the clear leader among all Permian players, both in terms of production growth and as a cost leader,\u201d said Rystad Energy head of analysis Per Magnus Nysveen, noting that Anadarko\u2019s acreage is in the \u201csweetest spot\u201d of the Delaware Basin.  Chevron also owns mineral rights under some of the Anadarko Permian properties, saving royalties others would have to pay, said Drilling info analyst Andrew Dittmar. He estimated Chevron is paying about $50,000 an acre for Anadarko\u2019s west Texas holdings.  The Permian produces about 4 million barrels per day, and is expected to hit 5.4 million bpd by 2023, according to IHS Markit, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.  FILE PHOTO: A Chevron gas station sign is pictured at one of their retain gas stations in Cardiff, California October 9, 2013. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  BIG LNG PUSH  Anadarko also has a Mozambique LNG project, part of one of the industry\u2019s largest planned current investments, which Wirth said he still expects to move to final approval \u201csooner rather than later\u201d this year. Expenses from that project are expected to reach $4 billion over several years.  The tie-up with Anadarko adds to Chevron\u2019s deepwater investments in the Gulf of Mexico and gives it a stake in growing production in the U.S. Rocky Mountains in Colorado.  The $65-per-share offer was structured as 75 percent stock and 25 percent cash, and the company will also take on $15 billion of Anadarko\u2019s debt.  \u201cThis deal seems perfect. Oil is on a rebound yet Anadarko\u2019s stock price has been stagnant,\u201d said Chris Widell, CEO of Sponte Resources, a Dallas, Texas-based private exploration and production company.  Occidental Petroleum Corp, another company with assets in the Permian, bid more than $70 per share for Anadarko and is now considering options, sources said.  Chevron said the deal would add to its free cash flow and profit one year after closing, if Brent crude, currently around $70, holds above $60 per barrel. The enterprise value of the deal is $50 billion..  Anadarko shareholders will receive 0.3869 shares of Chevron and $16.25 in cash for each Anadarko share.","262":"(Reuters) - Oil major Chevron Corp\u2019s $33 billion deal on Friday to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp has some investors and industry executives asking whether it is time for other U.S. shale oil and gas producers to consider selling themselves.  Anadarko has been one of the pioneers of the shale revolution, which turned the United States into the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, overtaking Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Houston-based company\u2019s willingness to ink a sale, rather than capitalize on oil prices rebounding, illustrates the significant challenges facing many U.S. shale producers.  These challenges include exploration and production becoming more expensive, as the oil and gas that is easier to access gets scarcer and existing wells turn less productive. Deep-pocketed oil majors such as Chevron can better cope with these costs, because they can get cheaper drilling rates by committing to longer contacts and afford cutting-edge technology to get more out of wells.  Shale producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources, Continental Resources, Diamondback Energy and Concho Resources have already been under pressure from investors to improve their profitability. Many investors now say Chevron\u2019s deal will embolden them to grill companies in the sector whether it is time to throw in the towel and sell.  \u201cIf you have large acreage positions like Pioneer and Concho, or lesser but more contiguous positions like Parsley Energy, and you\u2019re a pure-play Permian producer, there\u2019s no doubt that you are on the radar screen for these majors,\u201d said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors.  Pioneer, Concho and Parsley shares rose 11.5 percent, 8.8 percent and 11.7 percent respectively on Friday following the announcement of the sale of Anadarko, amid investor speculation over who the next takeover target will be.  U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said independent producers expect to spend about 11 percent less in 2019, while major oil companies plan to spend about 16 percent more.  Pioneer, one of the Permian\u2019s largest producers, said in February it plans to reduce 2019 capital expenditures by 11 percent, or about $350 million, in an effort to appease investors.  While there has been dealmaking in the last 12 months - both Concho Resources Inc and Diamondback Energy Inc have bought rivals - many of the large producers which spent years gobbling each other up have been sitting on their hands, under shareholder pressure to focus on creating stronger returns.  The sale of Anadarko could likely change that for potential acquirers, including ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp, the two largest U.S. independents behind the majors. Occidental was the rival bidder that lost out to Chevron in the race to buy Anadarko, sources said on Friday.  \u201cAt some point in time in the next few years the majors may reach out,\u201d Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield told Reuters this week, before Chevron\u2019s acquisition was announced.  He declined to comment on whether majors had approached Pioneer directly.  Asked about his appetite for deals in February, Conoco CEO Ryan Lance said it would have to be an unusual opportunity for the company to consider an acquisition.  \u201cWe are not feeling any pressure to do anything,\u201d he said.  RUNNING OUT OF INVENTORY  Given the substantial production forecasts being offered by some of the majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp, they will need to acquire new acreage at a big scale to offset the often sharp declines experienced by shale wells.  The majors \u201care eventually going to run out of inventory,\u201d said Pioneer\u2019s Sheffield. \u201cThey are drilling their inventory faster than the independents, so they are going to run out a lot faster, in my opinion.\u201d  BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which lag peers like Exxon and Chevron in the Permian, could make acquisitions to gain more exposure to the formation, analysts said.  Shell was seen as the leading contender to buy privately owned Permian producer Endeavor Energy, people familiar with the transaction told Reuters, but the two companies have, so far, failed to agree on Endeavor\u2019s valuation.  Shell is further constrained by its target to spend only $30 billion on capital projects in 2019, including acquisitions, said Noah Barnett, an analyst at Janus Henderson.","263":"April 30 (Reuters) - Statoil ASA:  * STATOIL: SELLS NON-CORE ASSET ON UK CONTINENTAL SHELF  * STATOIL HAS AGREED TO SELL ITS 17% NON-OPERATED INTEREST IN ALBA OIL FIELD ON UK CONTINENTAL SHELF (UKCS) TO VERUS PETROLEUM  * ALBA IS AN OIL FIELD IN UK CENTRAL NORTH SEA THAT STATOIL ENTERED IN 1995 AND WHICH IS OPERATED BY CHEVRON  * TO DATE, IT HAS PRODUCED AROUND 420 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL.

FILE PHOTO: Toby Rice, CEO of EQT Corp, speaks during an interview in New York, U.S., June 11, 2019. REUTERS\/Brendan McDermid  EQT offered $750 million (578.53 million pounds) for the properties, one of the people familiar with the matter said.  Chevron last year said it was considering sale of the properties and took an $8.17 billion charge to earnings to write down their value and an unrelated U.S. offshore project. Most of the impairment charge was for the gas properties.  Chevron is marketing about 800,000 acres in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins of Pennsylvania and neighboring states and a 31% non-operating interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, which has intrastate and gathering lines servicing the Marcellus shale area.  EQT declined to comment. EQT Chief Executive Toby Rice in July described Appalachia shale as \u201ca buyer\u2019s market,\u201d and called consolidation an opportunity for the Pittsburgh-based company.  Bids for the properties were received on Aug. 12 and are being evaluated, Chevron said in response to inquiries. It declined to comment on the bids.  There is no guarantee the talks will lead to a sale to EQT or another company.  The shale assets are from Chevron\u2019s purchase of producer Atlas Energy for $4.3 billion including debt in 2010, a time when shale gas fields were selling at large premiums. A year earlier, Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to pay $30 billion for XTO Energy, then a large Appalachian shale basin operator.  The deals soured for both companies. In addition to Chevron\u2019s writedown, Exxon later took a $2 billion writedown on the value of its natural gas assets.  U.S. natural gas futures are trading at about $2.27 a million British Thermal Units (BTUs) and have languished well below their peak 12 years ago when gas traded as high as $12.78 per million British Thermal Units.  The Appalachian assets last year produced 262 million cubic feet of natural gas, on a net daily basis. EQT had average daily sales volumes of about 4.1 billion cubic feet equivalent.","265":"June 26 (Reuters) - A California federal court dismissed climate change lawsuits against five oil companies by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, saying the complaints required foreign and domestic policy decisions that were outside the purview of courts, Chevron Corp said on Monday.

REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  The effort, part of a wave of climate-related proxy resolutions planned for spring 2019 annual shareholder meetings, is being led by investor groups Follow This, As You Sow and Arjuna Capital.  The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of capping temperature warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) before the turn of the century.  The activist investors of Chevron Corp said on Wednesday they had filed annual meeting resolutions calling for the oil company to embrace greenhouse gas reductions.  They now want Chevron CVX.N to report on how it can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Paris accord, arguing climate change presents \"portfolio risks to investors,\" according to a copy of the resolution reviewed by Reuters.  Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  \u201cWe filed the first carbon asset risk resolution in 2013,\u201d said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow. \u201cThere has been progress, but not enough.\u201d  In Europe, Follow This filed a climate resolution for Equinor's 2019 annual general meeting, mirroring its activist moves on BP BP.L and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS.  A spokesman for Equinor said it was supporting the Paris climate agreement. \u201cWe have our own climate roadmap and clear goals for how to cut Co2 emission,\u201d he said.  Following pressure from its investors, Shell made a U-turn setting out plans to introduce three-year or five-year carbon emissions targets linked to customers\u2019 use of its fuels and affecting executive pay beginning in 2020.  BP BP.L and Total TOTF.PA also have set short-term targets on reducing their own carbon dioxide emissions.  When asked why Follow This has not targeted Total and Italy's Eni ENI.MI, the group's founder Mark van Baal said ownership thresholds make it harder to file resolutions in some countries, for example, a 1 percent hurdle in France.  This week, two other groups of Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N investors said they would file a shareholder resolution calling on the world's largest oil company to set targets.

The company denied Chevron an opportunity to visit the Leviathan facility in February, but weeks later agreed to a confidentiality agreement to begin discussing their operations in the region, according to the filing.  As global energy markets collapsed that month and Noble reported a first-quarter loss of nearly $4 billion, its board opted for a sale of the company rather than a regional partnership, according to the filing.  It contacted eight companies to gauge interest in a stake in its Eastern Mediterranean holdings and held talks with six potential buyers.

MOL was initially interested in both oil companies\u2019 stakes in the field but decided to bid only for Chevron\u2019s 9.57% holding, the sources told Reuters.  Chevron and MOL both declined to comment.  The discussions come as the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is seeking to develop closer relations with central Asian countries.  Exxon continues to seek a buyer for its 6.8% stake in the field.

San Ramon, California-based Chevron and other energy companies have pledged to restrain spending after the collapse in oil prices earlier this decade forced many to borrow to cover the costs of long-term projects.  Chevron said it expected writedowns this quarter related to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico project, which needs higher oil prices to churn a profit, and shale gas in Appalachia, which has suffered from low natural gas prices. It is considering selling its stake in Appalachian shale and the proposed Kitmat LNG project in Canada.  \u201cWith capital discipline and a conservative outlook comes the responsibility to make the tough choices necessary to deliver higher cash returns to our shareholders over the long term\u201d, Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.

It had planned to spend around $5.2 billion this year.  It will spend $2.8 billion on its business that refines, transports and markets fuels and petrochemicals, up about $300 million from this year\u2019s budget.

The tweet, deleted less than five hours after it was posted, was accompanied by two graphics produced by the financial television network CNBC. One showed oil consumption slipping from 2005 through 2015 and the other showed renewable energy consumption rising across the same period.  Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp and other oil producers have come under increasing pressure to invest less in oil projects and more in solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies.  An active presence on Twitter with 189,000 followers, Moyo added several hashtags to her post that have been associated in the past with activists pushing for greater adoption of renewables by oil producers, including \u201c#environment,\u201d \u201c#getsmarter\u201d and \u201c#happywarrior.\u201d  Moyo could not be reached for additional comment.  Chevron said the tweet showed the diversity of thought amongst its leadership. \u201cThis simply demonstrates that Chevron\u2019s board takes into account multiple points of view on the important topic of the future of energy,\u201d Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an emailed statement.  Moyo, who tweets under the handle @dambisamoyo, is also a board member of Barclays Plc and Barrick Gold Corp.  John Watson, who retired as Chevron\u2019s chairman and chief executive earlier this month, told Reuters last fall that he did not see demand for oil peaking in the foreseeable future.  The view is widely shared in the oil industry and leaders of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat from climate change policies or renewable technologies.

The companies plan to begin producing Hamaca-grade synthetic crude for export at the plant early next year, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Petropiar stopped producing Hamaca earlier this year and has been making heavier Merey crude, mostly for the Asian market, since July.  Petropiar once made up to 210,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) of Hamaca out of tar-like oil from the OPEC nation\u2019s Orinoco belt, one of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves. The extra-heavy crude needs to be either upgraded or blended with lighter grades at facilities near the Jose terminal before being exported.  But PDVSA struggled to find markets for that grade after the United States, previously Venezuela\u2019s largest customer, slapped sanctions on the company in January as part of Washington\u2019s push to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a dramatic economic collapse and a freefall in crude output.  It was not immediately clear if PDVSA had a client lined up for the Hamaca crude.  Neither PDVSA nor Chevron immediately responded to requests for comment.  The Treasury Department last month renewed Chevron\u2019s license to continue operating Petropiar and its three other joint ventures with PDVSA despite the sanctions through January, the second such extension this year. The license had previously been set to expire on Oct. 25.  PDVSA said in July it expected Petropiar to produce some 130,000 bpd of Merey, but in September it was forced to suspend blending due to high crude inventories, as sanctions left the company with few willing buyers. It restarted operations in October and was producing around 100,000 bpd of Merey.  Exports surpassed 800,000 bpd for the second month in a row in October, helping to drain the inventory buildup.

FILE PHOTO: A Chevron gas station sign is seen in Del Mar, California, in this April 25, 2013 file photo. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Chevron, part of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) along with Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and BP Plc BP.L, said it will also target a reduction of 2% to 5% in green house gas emissions intensity from gas production over the same period.  However, Chevron\u2019s goals do not include plans to cut Scope 3 emissions or those from its customer\u2019s use of its fuels and other products.  The company said its measure of greenhouse gas intensity uses what it called equity basis, or combining direct and indirect emissions from its own production, subtracting those indirect emissions associated with electricity and steam that its operations exports, and dividing the result by production.  The method does not include customer emissions, but a spokesperson said it is willing to work with governments to address the issue.  The oil and gas industry has been under pressure from activists concerned about the effects of climate change, with scientists saying that the world needs to halve greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade to avoid catastrophic warming.  The OGCI, formed in 2014, is a group of 13 major oil companies that account for 32% of global oil and gas production. It aims to reduce methane emissions and increase carbon efficiency. The companies have also been investing in carbon capture technology that traps carbon in caverns or porous spaces underground.  Chevron said it had so far spent more than $1 billion on carbon capture and storage projects in Australia and Canada and the investment is expected to reduce greenhouse emissions by about 5 million metric tons per year.  Earlier this year, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L said it planned to reduce carbon emissions from its oil and gas operations and product sales by 2% to 3% during the 2016-2021 period.  Shell's targets include Scope 3 emissions, unlike rivals BP BP.L and Total TOTF.PA, which have limited their short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions to their own operations.  Energy companies are on the front line of a global transition to a low-carbon economy, with investors potentially on the hook for hefty losses if the companies do not overhaul their business models in time.","298":"MIDLAND, Texas (Reuters) - U.S. oil company Chevron Corp CVX.N is turning to joint ventures and drilling alliances in its bid to dominate the Permian Basin after abandoning a takeover that would have made it the leading producer in the world's biggest shale field.  Oil pump jacks work at sunset near Midland, Texas, U.S. August 21, 2019. REUTERS\/Jessica Lutz  It is now in a race with Exxon Mobil XOM.N to be the first to pump a million barrels of shale oil a day from the field in the U.S. southwest, using a strategy that depends on a host of partners sharing their expertise and their output.  Chevron's joint venture with Cimarex Energy XEC.N, one of the few Permian operators that has been consistently profitable since late 2016, is well known.  But it also has dozens of other agreements with companies including Concho Resources CXO.N, Devon Energy DVN.N, EOG Resources EOG.N, and even arch-rivals Exxon and Occidental Petroleum OXY.N, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.  \u201cWe\u2019re partners with all of the great operators,\u201d said Scott Neal, a Chevron exploration executive. He declined to name any partners, besides Cimarex. Concho, Devon, EOG, Occidental and Exxon declined to comment.  Chevron\u2019s deals, ranging from large-scale joint ventures to small deals where it has leased land to other operators, give it a share of the oil its partners produce.  They also provide data from thousands of wells stretching back years, allowing Chevron to hone drilling strategies. In return, partners get access to areas adjacent to their wells and pipelines, reducing their costs.  Shale drilling has helped the United States reverse decades of declines in output to become the world\u2019s largest oil producer and all the major U.S. oil companies have jumped on the shale bandwagon to boost their own production.  Unlike conventional oil fields, however, shale wells decline quickly, producing most of their oil in the first few years, so fields such as the Permian Basin require constant, and costly, drilling just to keep production steady.  \u201cIf there\u2019s a downside, that\u2019s the downside,\u201d said Jeff Gustavson, who oversees Chevron\u2019s Permian operations. \u201cYou\u2019re always having to put more in.\u201d  LONGER WELLS  At a site near Midland, Texas, know-how gleaned from Cimarex and other partners is helping Chevron drill a series of ultra-deep wells - named after the mythical three-headed hound Cerberus - to reach an oil-rich layer more than a mile underground.  The alliances and vast land holdings Chevron can tap allow it to drill longer wells than some rivals, giving it an edge as long wells generally pump more oil and save money.  Slideshow ( 23 images )  Chevron said its Permian wells average nearly 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) this year, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the industry average is 8,500 feet. Next year, its wells will stretch almost 10,000 feet on average.  In one formation near Midland, Chevron\u2019s peak average production rate runs at 760 barrels per day (bpd) for each well while rivals are producing at 705 bpd, according to IHS Markit.  Shale drilling combines horizontal wells with hydraulic fracturing, the process of pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to crack rocks that hold oil and gas.  Those wells and partnerships in the Permian, the fastest growing shale field, are critical to Chevron\u2019s future.  It missed the first phase of the shale boom early this decade but reversed course in 2014 when it drilled its first horizontal well in Permian and embarked on an investment spree to try to become the world\u2019s largest shale oil producer.  It has been shedding assets in the North Sea, Africa and Asia and expects to sell up to another $10 billion worth of properties to focus on projects including the Permian, where it has controlled some of the best and cheapest acreage since the 1920s.  Those holdings helped lift Chevron\u2019s oil and gas output to a record high in the second quarter. In the Permian, output leapt 56% from a year earlier to 421,000 bpd and Chevron\u2019s goal is to pump 900,000 bpd from the oilfield by 2023.  Chevron\u2019s Gustavson said its long-standing relationships provide it with \u201call of the data, all of the cost information\u201d from wells across the basin. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge advantage. Huge.\u201d  For a chart of the top Permian drillers:  MINERAL RIGHTS  Chevron is not the only energy company claiming a unique position in the Permian Basin.  Occidental outbid Chevron for Anadarko Petroleum in a takeover battle this year, spending $38 billion and vowing to use its technology to squeeze more oil from the deal which gave it a combined 3 million Permian acres.  Exxon, meanwhile, spent $6.6 billion two years ago to buy more Permian land and is now running nearly three times more rigs than Chevron in a race to reach its target of producing 1 million bpd of shale by 2024.  But Chevron has two key advantages: it holds 2.2 million Permian acres, second only to the Occidental-Anadarko trove, and it owns mineral rights on much of its land so it doesn\u2019t pay the 20%-25% production royalties most rivals face.  Chevron\u2019s Permian oil and gas output last quarter was second to Occidental\u2019s 533,000 bpd, but rising faster. Exxon is in the top 10 with production of 274,000 bpd.  For a chart of the top Permian land holders:  Chevron\u2019s mineral rights reduce its breakeven, or the oil price it needs to make a profit, while other savings come from drilling ventures. Chevron operates 20 rigs, far fewer than the 56 Exxon operated in June and Occidental-Anadarko\u2019s 27.  But Chevron estimates its partners contributed the equivalent of another seven to 10 rigs.  Cimarex struck a small deal with Chevron in 2009 to drill on its land and share data, and then broadened the agreement in 2013, said Michael DeShazer, Permian manager at Cimarex.  He said the two companies were able to learn faster, deploy faster and, by sharing resources, they could more easily invest in infrastructure such as pipelines, roads and electricity.  Shale output drops sharply the first year and declines 80% to 90% over two to three years, but Chevron has been able to slow the decrease.  In the formation near Midland, Chevron\u2019s wells lost 52% of their output after the first 12 months compared with an average decline of 70% for rivals, according to IHS Markit. Output from Chevron\u2019s wells in the first two years was also 40% higher.  While most shale firms have spent heavily but failed to deliver the returns demanded by investors, Chevron\u2019s \u201cslow and steady\u201d approach to the Permian is welcomed by investor Matrix Asset Advisors, which holds 55,000 Chevron shares.  \u201cThey\u2019ve got a game plan. They\u2019re executing on the plan,\u201d said Matrix President David Katz.","299":"WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - There will be a decision before a July 27 deadline on renewing a license for energy company Chevron Corp\u2019s operations in Venezuela, a U.S. administration official said on Thursday.  \u201cThere will be a decision before Saturday,\u201d a U.S. administration official told a conference call with reporters when asked about the license.

The merger, the sixth largest energy acquisition by value, propels Chevron two spots to the second-largest major by oil output, behind Exxon Mobil Corp, according to research firms Drillinginfo and Wood Mackenzie.  The deal announced on Friday comes less than three months after Wirth bought Pasadena Refining System Inc, the (PRSI) operator of a Texas oil refinery.  \u201cMy aspirations are for the company to be a strong performer,\u201d Wirth said in an interview on Friday. \u201cWe have always said and will still say that anything we do would have to make us even stronger.\u201d  Wirth, 58, took over as chief executive 14 months ago, with a reputation for keen attention to costs earned from running Chevron\u2019s pipeline and trading units, and nearly a decade in charge of its refining business.  The Anadarko deal was negotiated over the last few weeks, though Chevron has been thinking about the deal for some time, Wirth, a chemical engineer by training, said.  Chevron regularly evaluates potential deals and has a number of companies \u201cthat we\u2019re watching,\u201d said Wirth. But completing the latest purchase is now his priority. \u201cExecuting it well is important, so that will be our focus,\u201d said Wirth.  The Chevron executive is detailed-oriented and a relentless worker, said Mike Sommers, president of industry group American Petroleum Institute, where Wirth is a member of the executive committee. After a recent dinner concluded at 10 p.m., Wirth headed off to make calls to staff overseas, Sommers said.  \u201cHe is not someone who enters into every conversation but when he engages on an issue, he has a way of bringing the room together,\u201d said Sommers.  His agreement with Anadarko marks the company\u2019s biggest expansion since its acquisition of Texaco in 2000. The purchase makes Chevron the top producer in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale field. It also expands its oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico and in liquefied natural gas.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago you wouldn\u2019t have heard the word \u2018Permian\u2019 in anything from Chevron,\u201d said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment firm Tortoise Capital.  Chevron\u2019s $350 million deal for PRSI, a Gulf Coast refinery business owned by Brazil\u2019s Petrobras, fits its Permian expansion. The unit will turn West Texas crude into gasoline and fuels for its retailing network.","301":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron (CVX) is seen in Los Angeles, California, United States, April 12, 2016. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo  CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA and Chevron Corp plan to turn their joint venture Petropiar plant back into a crude upgrader, after months operating as a less complex blending facility, three people familiar with the operation said.  The companies plan to begin producing Hamaca-grade synthetic crude for export at the plant early next year, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity this week. Petropiar stopped producing Hamaca earlier this year and has been making heavier Merey crude, mostly for the Asian market, since July.  Petropiar once made up to 210,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) of Hamaca out of tar-like oil from the OPEC nation\u2019s Orinoco belt, one of the world\u2019s largest oil reserves. The extra-heavy crude needs to be either upgraded or blended with lighter grades at facilities near the Jose terminal before being exported.  But Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, struggled to find markets for that grade after the United States, previously Venezuela\u2019s largest customer, slapped sanctions on the company in January in an effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a dramatic economic collapse and a freefall in crude output.  It was not immediately clear if PDVSA had a client lined up for the Hamaca crude.  PDVSA, which owns 70% of the joint venture and operates it, did not respond to a request for comment. Chevron deferred comment to Petropiar.  The Treasury Department last month renewed Chevron\u2019s license to continue operating Petropiar and its three other joint ventures with PDVSA despite the sanctions through January, the second such extension this year. The license had previously been set to expire on Oct. 25.  PDVSA said in July it expected Petropiar to produce some 130,000 bpd of Merey, but in September it was forced to suspend blending due to high crude inventories, as sanctions left the company with few willing buyers. It restarted operations in October and was producing around 100,000 bpd of Merey.  Exports surpassed 800,000 bpd for the second month in a row in October, helping to drain the inventory buildup.","302":"HOUSTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp plans to set greenhouse gas emissions targets and tie executive compensation and rank-and-file bonuses to the reductions, the oil major said in its latest climate report released on Thursday.  The move is a first for a U.S. oil major and focuses on the company\u2019s oil fields. More investors have been pressuring San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and other big oil companies to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change.  Chevron said that by 2023, it will reduce its methane and flaring intensity by 25 percent to 30 percent from 2016 levels, and said the goal would be added to the scorecard that determines incentive pay for around 45,000 employees.  \u201cIt\u2019s about the mindset and the culture of the company,\u201d said Chevron Vice President Mark Nelson, noting that including most of its global workforce would \u201charness\u201d ideas from all employees.  Among other oil companies, London-based BP and France\u2019s Total have set short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from to their own operations.  Royal Dutch Shell in December announced it would link executive compensation to reducing carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2020, including so-called Scope 3 emissions from fuels sold to customers around the world.  Chevron\u2019s report said it does not support establishing Scope 3 targets.  Exxon\u2019s latest climate report, published on Tuesday, includes a goal of reducing methane emissions from operations by 15 percent and flaring by 25 percent by 2020 compared with 2016 levels, as well as reducing greenhouse gas intensity at its Canadian oil sands facilities by 10 percent by 2023.  Chevron\u2019s target aims to reduce emissions and flaring as a percentage of production, but does not set a goal for total emissions - a measure that activist investors prefer. The targets will apply to Chevron\u2019s operations as well as joint ventures or assets it has a stake in but does not operate itself, the company said.  Methane, the main component of natural gas, is colorless and odorless, and has more than 80 times the heat trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say.  Methane can leak from oilfield equipment and pipelines, or is flared or vented during maintenance work, and when new oil wells are added in areas that don\u2019t have natural gas pipelines.

BP BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and BHP Group BHP.AX said they had or were in the process of removing some workers from their facilities as a precautionary measure. Each said oil and gas production at the offshore facilities was unaffected.  Dorian is forecast to strike the Atlantic coast of Florida by early next week as a major hurricane. Some computer models project Dorian may cross the Florida peninsula and enter the Gulf of Mexico.  Oil and gas operations in the Gulf of Mexico account for 16%of U.S. crude oil output and about 4% of U.S. natural gas.

Since Saudi Arabia and Russia launched an oil price war on March 9, U.S. crude has more than halved to under $20 per barrel. Last month, it crashed into unprecedented negative territory. The world is also witnessing one of its biggest demand shocks, as global travel curbs to prevent the spread of coronavirus have reduced oil consumption by millions of barrels per day.

The sale was agreed to in January, but Chevron put the transfer of the 112,229 barrel-per-day plant\u2019s ownership on hold on April 2, telling Petrobras it had to prove the refinery would operate as promised, sources told Reuters.  The Pasadena refinery is the second on the U.S. Gulf Coast for Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, California.  Chevron wanted to refinery to process sweet crude coming from its oil fields in the Permian Basin of Texas.  \u201cThis acquisition builds on the strength of our existing Gulf Coast business, enabling us to supply more of our retail market in the region with Chevron-produced products, and positions us for connectivity to our strong upstream assets in the Permian Basin,\u201d said Mark Nelson, Chevron\u2019s executive vice president for downstream and chemicals.  In addition to the refinery, Chevron acquired PRSI, a Petrobras subsidiary that operates the refinery and owns subsidiary PRSI Trading, which trades in crude and refined products markets. PRSI owns a 5.1-million-barrel storage tank farm and an additional 143 acres of land along the Houston Ship Channel.  Chevron also operates a 352,000-bpd refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi.

Executives from the two companies have signed an agreement which outlines a program to develop the fields, which includes studies to survey the reservoirs and extraction operations, said a statement posted on the oil ministry\u2019s website.  Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi announced in June that Basra Oil and another state-run company, Dhi Qar Oil, signed an MOU with Chevron.  The MOU provides for Chevron to conduct surveys and studies on oil sites and installations and help the two Iraqi companies to improve their technical, administrative and financial performance.","310":"(Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp, the U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company that agreed this month to sell itself to Chevron Corp for $33 billion, decided on Sunday to begin negotiations to sell itself to Occidental Petroleum Corp instead, according to people familiar with the matter.  FILE PHOTO: The unstaffed lobby of the North Dakota regional headquarters of oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp is seen in Dickinson, North Dakota in this October 14, 2015. REUTERS\/Ernest Scheyder  The bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.  Anadarko\u2019s board of directors has decided that Occidental\u2019s $38 billion cash-and-stock bid could lead to a deal that would be superior to the one it has with Chevron, the sources said. Without such a formal determination, Anadarko\u2019s contract with Chevron prevented it from engaging with Occidental.  Anadarko will now kick off negotiations with Occidental to see if it can finalize a deal, the sources said.  There is no certainty that Occidental, which was vying for Anadarko before Chevron clinched its deal, will be able to secure its own deal, the sources said.  If it does, Chevron will be given a chance to match the new deal. If Chevron finally loses out to Occidental, Anadarko would have to pay Chevron a $1 billion break-up fee, according to the terms of their agreement.  The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Anadarko and Occidental did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson declined any immediate comment.  The acquisition of Anadarko would add nearly a quarter million acres to Occidental\u2019s holdings in the Permian shale basin, and double its global oil and gas production to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.  Occidental unveiled its bid for Anadarko last Wednesday, offering to pay for it half in cash and half with its own shares. Chevron\u2019s deal with Anadarko was structured as 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock.  Chevron declined to say on Friday during its earnings call how it would respond if Anadarko\u2019s board determined Occidental\u2019s proposal the better of the two deals. Chevron\u2019s finance chief Pierre Breber, however, said the company had the ability to put more cash into its deal.  A key hurdle that Occidental has to overcome in its negotiations with Anadarko is that its proposed deal is contingent on Occidental shareholders voting to approve it. A deal with Chevron offers more certainty to Anadarko in that regard, because Chevron shareholders will not be given a vote.  Anadarko shareholders will be given a vote on the sale of the company, be it with Occidental or Chevron.","311":"(Corrects company name in first para)  LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The Intercontinental Exchange signed memorandums of understanding with Chevron, Trafigura and Occidental Petroleum to use the new Murban oil futures as a price point for U.S. crude sales to Asia, the president of ICE Futures Europe said.  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see interest from not just Middle East crude exporters to Asia but we\u2019re seeing other firms, particularly those exporting light sweet crude pay attention,\u201d Stuart Williams, president of ICE Futures Europe, told the ADIPEC conference on Tuesday.  \u201cWe\u2019ve reached agreement with three key U.S. exporters ... that are exploring the use of Murban to export U.S. barrels.\u201d  ICE said in a separate statement on Tuesday it planned to launch ICE Futures Abu Dhabi (IFAD) and trading in Murban crude oil futures contracts on March 29.

The value of Siccar Point's 20 percent stake was unclear, since the project's final scope and costs will only be determined once Chevron and its other partners, Suncor SU.TO and Ineos, decide to go ahead with the development, the sources said.  Chevron began engineering studies for the project in 2012, but planning dragged out after oil prices collapsed in 2014 and the partners tried to reduce its costs.  The cost of the current development plans were estimated at below $7 billion, compared with previous forecasts of around $10 billion, but the partners want to cut them further, the sources said.  Chevron has not disclosed the estimated project costs. A company spokeswoman said the company was \u201cencouraged by the significant progress made in optimizing the Rosebank facilities and we remain focused on improving project value.\u201d  Siccar Point, headed by Jonathan Roger, a former Centrica executive, and backed by private equity firm Blue Water Energy and Blackstone BX.N, expects the partners to reach a final investment decision by early 2019, according to its website.  Siccar Point and Chevron declined to comment on the sale process.  By selling up to half of its 20 percent stake, Siccar Point aims to reduce its financial commitment to the project, the sources said.  \u201cSiccar\u2019s exposure to Rosebank is big, possibly too big if it wants to develop its other projects,\u201d one source said.  The company, one of several new private equity-back oil companies in the North Sea, emerged as a major player following the $1 billion acquisition of Austrian oil and gas company OMV's OMVV.VI UK business in November 2016.  Siccar Point holds stakes in a number of producing fields and developments, including the Statoil-operated Mariner field and BP\u2019s Schiehallion field, both around the Shetland Islands.  The Rosebank project, some 130 kilometers (80 miles) northwest of the Shetlands in seas over a kilometer deep, would be one of the biggest new fields in the UK North Sea. With reserves estimated at around 300 million barrels of oil, it could help boost the aging basin\u2019s production.

Anish Kapadia, an analyst at consultancy AKap Energy, said the project was likely to go ahead with today\u2019s oil prices around $65 a barrel.  \u201cChevron\u2019s Permian acreage will out-compete Rosebank for capital,\u201d Kapadia said. \u201cHowever, Chevron still wants some diversification, so it will need to invest in some higher-cost projects that still have favorable economics.\u201d","313":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp CVX.N on Friday posted a surprise third-quarter profit as oil prices recovered from spring lows and spending cuts benefited operating results.  FILE PHOTO: A Chevron gas station sign is shown in Cardiff, California, in this January 25, 2016 file photo. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  Chevron and its peers have slashed spending budgets this year on plummeting demand and crude oil prices that remain about 40% below where they began the year. Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L and BP Plc BP.L also posted higher-than-expected quarterly results after deep expense cuts this year.  The second-largest U.S. oil producer reported earnings of $201 million, or 11 cents per share, excluding one-time items. That compared with a profit of $2.9 billion, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier.  Wall Street analysts had expected a loss of 27 cents for the quarter, according to Refinitiv IBES data.  Shares rose to $69.52, up 1%.  Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said it was too soon to say when the pandemic-related decline in oil demand will end.  The outlook for energy consumption \u201cdepends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d Breber said.  Chevron is near the end of a year-long restructuring of its operations to reflect a prolonged period of low prices, Breber said. The effort will reduce its workforce by up to 15% of its 45,000 person staff. The company expects about $500 million in severance payments this quarter.  Despite lower volumes, it posted modest operating profit in oil and gas production and refining by cutting expenses 12% and spending on new projects by 48%, excluding acquisitions, both from year-ago levels.  That helped offset cheaper fuel. While its oil sold last quarter for 63% more than in the second quarter, it was still well below the $47 a barrel price received a year ago.  \u201cThe world\u2019s economy continues to operate below pre-pandemic levels, impacting demand for our products which are closely linked to economic activity,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said in a statement.  In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, from 565,000 barrels per day this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to keep production there flat until the global economy recovers.  \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t need more supply,\u201d Breber said.  Project spending is planned around $14 billion next year for the combined Chevron and Noble Energy, which Chevron purchased this month for about $4.1 billion.  Chevron\u2019s oil and gas production in the third quarter was down 7%, compared with a year earlier, reflecting asset sales, curtailment due to low prices and contract agreements. Refining volumes recovered from a sharp second-quarter drop, while remaining below year-ago levels.  The company continues to give priority to its shareholder dividend even as cash flow from operations fell 57% from a year ago and turned negative in the third quarter.  \u201cChevron generated enough cash flow to cover its capital spending and had only a modest deficit after funding its dividend,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland said.  \u201cThe company\u2019s strong balance sheet and liquidity position supports its dividend during this difficult period. We view the company as a defensive holding in a challenging industry.\u201d","314":"MELBOURNE, May 10 (Reuters) - The state of Western Australia has ordered an inquiry into a delay in burying carbon dioxide emissions at Chevron Corp\u2019s Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which could lead to a change in conditions on the project.  The state approved the $54 billion Gorgon project in 2009 on the condition that at least 80 percent of carbon dioxide released in its gas processing operations over a five-year rolling average period would be buried.  \u201cIt has become apparent there needs to be a clearly defined start point for the commencement of the five-year rolling average,\u201d Stephen Dawson, the state environment minister, told reporters in the Western Australia capital of Perth on Monday, according to an email sent to Reuters by his spokeswoman.  He ordered the state\u2019s Environmental Protection Authority to report back within the next nine months whether or not the conditions should be changed and any other recommendations.  Chevron told the government last December it would not be able to start capturing and burying carbon dioxide until the fourth quarter of 2018 at the earliest, after having found problems with valves and pipeline equipment during commissioning of its A$2.5 billion ($1.9 billion) injection system.  The Gorgon carbon dioxide injection system is the world\u2019s largest capture and storage project.  Processing operations began in March 2016, when Gorgon started producing gas from the Jansz field.  However, Chevron only intended to start burying carbon dioxide after it started producing from the Gorgon field, which has a higher carbon dioxide content. Production started there in 2017.  Chevron spokesmen were not immediately available to comment on the state\u2019s inquiry.  Gorgon LNG is owned by Chevron, ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell, and Japan\u2019s Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA.","315":"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and natural gas producer Chevron Corp CVX.N on Friday reported that its quarterly profit doubled on record oil and gas production, sending its shares up as much as 5 percent.

REUTERS\/Jonathan Bachman\/File Photo  The results reflected strong gains in its oil and gas production with crude prices up 44 percent during the quarter and offset a drop in earnings from its downstream operations, including refining and chemicals.  Third-quarter oil and gas production rose 9 percent over a year earlier, and the company forecast total output for the full year would be up about 7 percent over 2017.  Its production in the West Texas shale fields rose 80 percent in the quarter, adding 150,000 barrels per day, \u201cthe equivalent of adding a midsize Permian pure-play E&P company,\u201d Pat Yarrington, the company\u2019s finance chief, told analysts on a conference call.  Chevron ran 20 drilling rigs in its Permian operations during the quarter, and will continue running the same number this quarter, Yarrington said.  \u201cOur approach right now is to take a bit of a pause and to focus on capturing all the efficiencies that a 20-rig fleet would necessitate,\u201d she added.  Fourth-quarter downstream earnings and cash flow will be hurt by higher planned maintenance activity, the company said. Downstream profit fell 24 percent in the quarter from continuing weakness in its international refining operations.  Pierre Breber, Chevron\u2019s executive vice president of downstream and chemicals, declined to comment on reports it is in discussions to acquire a U.S. Gulf Coast refinery. But he said the company has strong reasons, including growing Permian oil production, to consider doing so.  The company reported third-quarter net income of $4.05 billion, or $2.11 a share, compared with $1.95 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Analysts were looking for $2.06 per share of profit, according to IBES data on Refinitiv.  Shares rose $3.44 to $114.51 and hit a session high of $117.11.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp shut production on platforms in the eastern Gulf of Mexico due to Alberto and evacuated workers from those sites, the companies said.  The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Alberto was transitioning to a tropical cyclone as its circulation became more focused around a central core located 135 miles (220 km) west of Tampa, Florida, with 50 mile per hour winds (85 kph).  The storm was expected to make landfall on Monday morning in the Florida panhandle.  Chevron shut production at its Blind Faith and Petronius platforms in the eastern Gulf. The Blind Faith platform is located in the Mississippi Canyon region of the northern Gulf of Mexico.  The Petronius platform is in the Viosca Knoll area of the Gulf.

While one-time asset sales or write downs were large factors, the two companies said earnings suffered from weaker margins in crude oil, chemicals and fuel production. They gave tepid outlooks for the near term.  Shares of Exxon and Chevron were both at least 3% lower in morning trade on the results and worries about slowing global economic growth.  Fourth-quarter results at Exxon fell below Wall Street\u2019s recently lowered estimate, with earnings sliding to $5.6 billion from $6 billion a year ago. Per share profit excluding one-time gain from asset sales was 41 cents, below Wall Street\u2019s estimate of 43 cents and 71 cents prior to a recent warning.

The company had $10 billion in charges including writedowns on the value of oil and gas properties that were no longer economic to pump. Excluding charges, its $1.49 cent a share profit topped estimates.  This week, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s shares hit a three-year low after it laid out a plan to pull back on share buybacks amid slower global growth and weak commodity prices.  Exxon CEO Darren Woods said its natural gas, refining and chemicals businesses have suffered from prices near or at decade lows. Exxon will keep investing in new projects on the belief that a growing global middle class will drive demand for its products, Woods said, describing the margin weakness as \u201ca short-term impact.\u201d  Exxon and Chevron are racing in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, to reach 1 million barrels per day of production, but neither is anywhere near that level right now.  Exxon\u2019s output rose 54% from a year ago to around 294,000 barrels of oil and gas daily, while Chevron is pumping 514,000 barrels daily, up 36% in a year. Both companies have a goal of 1 million bpd within a few years.  Values are down across the oil and gas sector, prompting ongoing speculation that large companies will acquire smaller ones in the Permian Basin. Woods, though, said that the best opportunities are usually the ones \u201cthat you can generate organically,\u201d while Chevron CEO Mike Wirth repeated a pledge to maintain capital discipline.","318":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: The Occidental Petroleum Corp headquarters is pictured in Los Angeles, California September 16, 2013. REUTERS\/Mario Anzuoni  The development represents a breakthrough in Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub\u2019s two-year effort to buy Anadarko, one of the top U.S. oil and gas producers in the lucrative Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. Anadarko announced a deal with Chevron on April 12 after snubbing a higher bid from Occidental, prompting Occidental to try to upend the Chevron deal.  \u201cWe hope Anadarko will proceed quickly to secure this superior transaction for its shareholders,\u201d an Occidental spokeswoman said.  Anadarko said its board had unanimously decided that Occidental\u2019s offer could result in a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d but added that its deal with Chevron remained in effect until it decided to cut a new deal with Occidental.  Anadarko asked Chevron on Sunday if it wanted to raise its bid and Chevron declined, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.  Chevron is reluctant to pay more for Anadarko and does not want to be drawn into a bidding war, the sources said. Chevron also wants to see if Occidental will manage to ink a deal for Anadarko, and whether Occidental shareholders will support it, one of the sources said.  \u201cWe believe our signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko\u2019s shareholders,\u201d Chevron said in a statement on Monday.  Chevron and Occidental are vying for one of the biggest prizes in the oil industry: Anadarko\u2019s nearly quarter-million-acre holdings in the core of the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field.  The two companies each control land adjacent to Anadarko\u2019s properties and expect a deal will add deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.  Occidental unveiled its bid for Anadarko last Wednesday, offering to pay for it half in cash and half with its own shares. Chevron\u2019s deal with Anadarko was structured as 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock. Occidental\u2019s stock was down 2.38 percent to $59.85.  Anadarko shares were up 0.4 percent to $73.05, slightly below the value of Occidental\u2019s offer.  OCCIDENTAL SHAREHOLDERS GET A SAY  Under the terms of the merger agreement, Chevron has four days after being notified by Anadarko\u2019s board to respond with a counter-offer. If Anadarko proceeds with a sale to Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee.  The acquisition of Anadarko would add nearly a quarter million acres to Occidental\u2019s holdings in the Permian shale basin, and double its global oil and gas production to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.  A key hurdle that Occidental has to overcome in its negotiations with Anadarko is that its proposed deal is contingent on Occidental shareholders voting to approve it.  These could make a deal more vulnerable to shareholder agitation. For example, activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP tried to shoot down Bristol-Myers Co\u2019s $74 billion deal to acquire biotech Celgene Corp earlier this year by trying to convince Bristol-Myers shareholders to vote it down. It was ultimately unsuccessful.  A deal with Chevron offers more certainty to Anadarko in that regard, because Chevron shareholders will not be given a vote. Anadarko shareholders will be given a vote on the sale of the company, be it with Occidental or Chevron.  Chevron and Occidental also have put forward different estimates on the value of the operational synergies they can derive from Anadarko. Chevron projects the synergies to be worth $1 billion a year, while Occidental says it can extract $2 billion annually in synergies.","320":"LONDON\/DUBAI (Reuters) - Chevron has begun preparations to restart production at the Wafra oilfield in the Kuwaiti-Saudi Neutral Zone, the company said in a statement on Thursday.

REUTERS\/Loren Elliott\/File Photo  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, both members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), agreed last year to end a five-year dispute over the border area known as the Neutral Zone, allowing production to resume at two jointly run fields that can pump up to 0.5% of the world\u2019s oil supply.  Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Reuters in December that new production from the oilfields would not affect the countries\u2019 commitments under an agreement between OPEC and other producing nations including Russia, known as OPEC+, to curtail global output.  That deal expires in March.  A Kuwait oil official told Reuters earlier this month that 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) of trial oil output from the Wafra field will start by late March, and production is expected to increase to 80,000 bpd from the field within six months of starting trial production.  Output from Wafra is expected to reach 145,000 bpd after a year of restarting.  Wafra has been shut since May 2015 and had output capacity of about 220,000 bpd.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Marco Bello  The United States imposed harsh sanctions on Venezuela in early 2019, in an effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.  Venezuela\u2019s oil exports have dropped by one-third since then, but more than a year on, Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela\u2019s military as well as Russia, China and Cuba.  Frustrated by the socialist leader\u2019s grip on power, the Trump administration has increased pressure on Venezuela\u2019s oil industry in recent weeks.  The U.S. Treasury Department last month blacklisted Geneva-based Rosneft Trading, a unit of Russia's oil giant Rosneft ROSN.MM, for conducting business with PDVSA and warned global energy firms that more such measures were expected.  Now, U.S. officials are targeting oil-for-fuel swaps and loan repayments through oil deliveries, threatening to close off the last areas left open by the government for firms still dealing with PDVSA.  According to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Washington has already told some of PDVSA\u2019s customers to stop oil-for-fuel swaps if they want to fully comply with new sanctions. Companies taking Venezuelan oil as repayment for debt could also have to cease those transactions.  A 90-day period set by Washington to wind down foreign purchases of Venezuelan oil ends on May 20.  \u201cThe United States is asking us to follow a policy of zero Venezuelan crude going out, zero fuel going in. So swaps so far allowed would have to end by the wind-down period deadline,\u201d an executive from one PDVSA customer said.  One of the sources said the measures were likely to come late next week but another cautioned a final announcement could still be several weeks away.  Chevron is the largest U.S. company still in the country, operating with a waiver that allows it to continue producing oil with PDVSA in several joint ventures, and also trade cargoes of Venezuelan crude in international markets. Its license expires in April.  Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the company is \u201chopeful\u201d its license can be renewed.  PDVSA and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, declined to comment. The U.S. Treasury did not comment beyond repeating that the license expires on April 22.  \u201cChevron is a positive presence in Venezuela,\u201d Fohr said. The company\u2019s share of production from its joint ventures with PDVSA averaged some 35,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, representing about 6% of the country\u2019s total production.  \u201cIf Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela, non-U.S. companies will fill the void and oil production will continue,\u201d he said.  Senior State Department officials had argued against cancelling Chevron\u2019s license for now, but the White House has backed the idea of taking action, one of the sources told Reuters.  Buyers in China, India and Europe continued importing after sanctions last year, so Venezuela\u2019s oil exports did not fall as much as some U.S. officials expected. Washington recently said it will go after customers in Asia, as well as intermediary firms that have helped hide the origin of the crude.  In recent days, major Indian refiners Reliance Industries RELI.NS and Nayara Energy began planning a reduction in purchases of Venezuelan oil starting next month.  The United States in January 2019 recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the OPEC nation\u2019s legitimate interim president.

The company paid more than $1 billion for the plant by the time it took sole ownership in 2012.  In addition to the refinery, Chevron is buying a terminal, land surrounding the refinery and a trading company owned by PRSI.  Chevron is buying the Pasadena plant to run sweet crude oil it produces in Texas. It will be the second Gulf Coast refinery owned by the company.

The discussions, which are no longer active, are indicative of the pressure the energy sector\u2019s most dominant companies faced as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and crude prices plunged.  The talks between Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth were serious enough for legal documents involving certain aspects of the merger discussions to be drafted, one of the sources said. The reason the talks ended could not be learned.  The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment.  Exxon and Chevron\u2019s shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxon\u2019s stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the company\u2019s long-term profitability and spending decisions.  In their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000.  Following the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.  A proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last November\u2019s U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all.  Now, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.

General Motors last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, which rely on oil, by 2035.  The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  News of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction.  Engine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, last week nominated four directors to Exxon\u2019s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance.  Exxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.  COMBINED GIANT  A combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by Saudi Aramco, which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil.  Despite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United States\u2019 best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the world\u2019s other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said.  Last year\u2019s Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output.  U.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene.  Exxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection.  Yet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s spread.  At one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel.  Exxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year. Exxon late last year left its dividend flat after boosting the shareholder payout each year since 1982.","328":"HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Friday reported an adjusted third-quarter profit as oil prices recovered from spring lows and spending cuts benefited operating results.  Chevron and its peers have slashed spending budgets this year on plummeting demand and crude oil prices that remain about 40% below where they began the year. Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc also posted higher-than-expected quarterly results after deep expense cuts this year.  The second-largest U.S. oil producer reported earnings of $201 million, or 11 cents per share, excluding one-time items. That compared with a profit of $2.9 billion, or $1.55 per share, a year earlier. Net loss including the effect of foreign exchange and charges was $207 million.  Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said it was too soon to say the worst of the pandemic-related decline in oil demand was over.  The outlook for energy consumption \u201cdepends on when the world - this country and other countries - get control of the pandemic and those activities resume. We don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d Breber said.  Chevron is near the end of a year-long restructuring of its operations to reflect a prolonged period of low prices, Breber said. The effort will reduce its workforce by up to 15% of its 45,000 person staff.  Despite lower volumes, it posted modest operating profit in oil and gas production and refining by cutting expenses 12% and spending on new projects by 48%, excluding acquisitions, both from year-ago levels.  That helped offset cheaper fuel. While its oil sold last quarter for 63% more than in the second quarter, it still was well below the $47 a barrel price received a year ago.  \u201cThe world\u2019s economy continues to operate below pre-pandemic levels, impacting demand for our products which are closely linked to economic activity,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said in a statement.  Chevron\u2019s oil and gas production in the third quarter was down 7%, compared with a year earlier, reflecting asset sales, curtailment due to low prices and contract agreements. Refining volumes recovered from a sharp second-quarter drop, while remaining below year-ago levels.  The company continues to give priority to its shareholder dividend even as cash flow from operations fell 57% from a year ago and turned negative in the third quarter.  In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, from 565,000 barrels per day this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to keep production there flat until the global economy recovers.  \u201cThe world doesn\u2019t need more supply,\u201d Breber said.

So, absolutely, that ... remains on the table,\u201d the official said, emphasizing that the administration was \u201cconcerned\u201d by more than just Rosneft\u2019s behavior.  \u201cWhether it\u2019s Rosneft, whether it\u2019s Reliance, whether it\u2019s Repsol, whether it\u2019s Chevron here in the United States, I would tread cautiously towards their activities in Venezuela that are in support, directly or indirectly, of the Maduro dictatorship because ... we\u2019re halfway through our maximum pressure campaign,\u201d he added.  Rosneft, India's Reliance Industries RELI.NS, Spain's Repsol REP.MC and Chevron did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  But some company executives were surprised by the tone of the remarks, since the U.S government has not taken action since it threatened oil firms dealing with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A., or PDVSA, in August, sources told Reuters.  Rosneft, Reliance, Repsol and Chevron have emerged as the main business partners for PDVSA since the United States imposed the steepest sanctions yet on the state-owned Venezuelan company last year.  Most of them share oilfields with PDVSA in Venezuela, and they also act as intermediaries for sales of Venezuelan oil to markets such as Asia. In 2019, Rosneft was the main receiver of Venezuelan oil, followed by China National Petroleum Corp - which suspended direct purchases from PDVSA, Cuba\u2019s Cubametales and Reliance, according to PDVSA\u2019s internal documents and Refinitiv Eikon data.  Washington imposed a first round of sanctions on PDVSA a year ago, depriving the state-run firm of its main market, the United States. In August, it announced new sanctions targeting non-U.S. firms buying Venezuelan oil.  \u201cVERY SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES\u201d  The official also warned against any interference by the Maduro government in Guaido\u2019s trip back to Venezuela. \u201cAny harm that may be caused on Juan Guaido on his return to Venezuela will have very significant consequences,\u201d the official said.  Guaido, president of the opposition-held National Assembly, is recognized as Venezuela\u2019s rightful president by dozens of countries including the United States.

The senior administration official also described \u201cgood momentum\u201d since Maduro\u2019s party failed to wrest control of the national assembly from Guaido last month, and said there would be some \u201cimpactful measures\u201d within the next 30 days to further cripple Maduro\u2019s rule.  The only possible topic up for negotiation with Maduro\u2019s government was a discussion of \u201ccertain guarantees\u201d upon his exit, the person added.","330":"CARACAS, July 23 (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said on Tuesday he would seek to protect Chevron Corp\u2019s assets in the country if the United States does not renew a license allowing the company to operate despite sanctions on the OPEC nation\u2019s oil sector.  The Trump administration slapped sanctions on state oil company PDVSA in January as part of a bid to cut off cash flow to socialist President Nicolas Maduro and pressure him to leave power. A license allowing Chevron to keep operating its four joint ventures with PDVSA expires on July 27.  Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency, arguing Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.  In a decree published by his office, he said a possible decision not to extend the license \u201cconstitutes an event of force majeure\u201d that could nonetheless \u201callow the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro to take control of or expropriate the company\u2019s assets.\u201d  Once the sanctions are lifted, an event that presumably would not happen unless Maduro left power, \u201cwe will adopt all the measures that will allow Chevron Corporation and its affiliates in Venezuela to restart activities,\u201d the decree said.  Guaido has been recognized as the rightful leader by most Western countries including the United States, but he would have no ability to enforce the decree while Maduro remains in power.  The move comes as industry observers have speculated that Maduro could transfer control of Chevron\u2019s assets, which include the Petropiar joint venture and crude upgrader in the extra-heavy Orinoco oil belt, to state-owned companies from Russia or China, which have continued to recognize Maduro.  Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela\u2019s oil or information ministries immediately responded to a request for comment. Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Venezuelan authorities have not commented directly on what they would do if Chevron\u2019s license is not extended. But in April, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza praised Russia\u2019s presence in the Orinoco belt and said that \u201ccompanies that leave the oil belt will be substituted by companies of equal quality from Venezuela\u2019s allies.\u201d  Earlier this month, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a possible renewal of the license was \u201cunder discussion.\u201d  Chevron\u2019s minority stakes in the Petropiar and Petroindependencia joint ventures in the Orinoco belt, as well as the Petroboscan and Petroindependiente joint ventures in western Venezuela, yielded net crude production of 44,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) for the company in 2018.  Venezuela produced 734,000 bpd in June, according to OPEC secondary sources, down from an average of 1.4 million bpd in 2018.

It reported a net loss of $463 million in the first nine-months of the year.  For Chevron, the deal marks a return to a sector it left in March 2015 after selling its half-share in refiner Caltex Australia for $3.7 billion. Puma has more than 270 retail sites, 20 depots and 3 bulk seaboard terminals across Australia and delivers more than 1 billion liters of fuel a year.  \u201cThe acquisition will provide Chevron with a stable market for production volumes from our refining joint ventures in Asia and create a foundation for sustainable earnings growth,\u201d Mark Nelson, Chevron\u2019s executive vice president for downstream and chemicals said in a statement.  The deal is expected to complete by the middle of next year.  Last month, sources familiar with the sale told Reuters that Trafigura would accept a hefty discount to the price it paid and that the assets would likely fetch no more than $500 million, which they said would be a sharp drop in price.  Puma, which said it was retaining its bitumen business in Australia, entered the country in 2013 with the purchase of Ausfuel, Neumann and Central Combined Group assets. Media reports at the time said it paid around $850 million for the Ausfuel and Neumann assets.  Despite the potential scale of the price tag difference, some investors said the sale would be welcomed by Trafigura, which last week reported its lowest annual net profit in nearly a decade after a string of losses in its physical asset portfolio.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good deal for Trafigura,\u201d said a Melbourne-based fund manager, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press.  It is the second major sale for Puma this year. The firm announced the sale of its Paraguay business for $200 million in early October to a Trafigura joint venture. Puma also sold its small business in Indonesia for $3 million and it is still evaluating its portfolio.

Peak output is now expected to reach around 700-800 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd), compared with an initial estimate of over 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), when the remaining two gas hubs start production, Fatar Yani Abdurrahman, deputy chairman of regulator SKK Migas, told reporters.  The lower estimate was due to the design change, including using shallow water platform instead of deep water, Abdurrahman said on the sidelines of an industry forum.  Last year, the government said Chevron planned to halve its investment for the project to $6 billion from $12.8 billion, but targeted production would remain the same at 1.1 million bcfd and 31,000 barrels of condensate.  The project began production from the Bangka field in 2016 and Chevron is in the process of developing the Gendalo and Gehem gas hubs off the coast of East Kalimantan.  Production from the two gas hubs combined is expected to reach 700 mmscfd, though Bangka\u2019s output has declined, Abdurrahman said.  \u201cNow, Bangka production is already depleted to below 100 mmscfd, to around 60 mmscfd,\u201d he said.  Chevron and other stakeholders in the project, Italy\u2019s ENI and China\u2019s Sinopec, are in a discussion for a revised plan of development, which they will hand over to SKK Migas for approval.  \u201cNow, we\u2019re just waiting for the decision from Chevron and partners. The later they submit it, the project will be more delayed and it will be more costly,\u201d he said.

If the loading proceeds, it would be the first shipment assigned to Chevron since the United States sanctioned PDVSA in January as part of a campaign to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose 2018 reelection most Western nations consider a sham.  The vessel Agios Fanourios is set to load 2 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude on Oct. 19-21 at Jose port, according to a PDVSA scheduling document viewed by Reuters. The document does not show where the cargo is to be delivered.  Chevron in a statement declined to confirm the loading, saying it \u201cdoes not discuss specific commercial transactions,\u201d but said its operations comply with all legal requirements.  \u201cInternational crude marketing activities that ultimately pay for expenses related to the maintenance of operations are permitted under OFAC General License 8C,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement, referring to its current sanctions waiver.  The planned Agios Fanourios loading is set to occur days before the U.S. license that has allowed Chevron to continue its oil production and crude blending in Venezuela is due to expire. The company has lobbied for another renewal.  The loading is also set to happen the same month that India's Reliance Industries RELI.NS, Italy Eni ENI.MI and Spain Repsol REP.MC will load cargoes of Venezuelan crude through swaps for fuel deliveries to PDVSA or for settling pending payments, such as dividends.  The Trump administration has several times imposed sanctions on Venezuela and sought to limit PDVSA\u2019s transactions to largely cut off Maduro\u2019s access to oil revenues, which account for most of the South American country\u2019s hard currency income.

Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in output and investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world\u2019s top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades.  Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter ahead of planned cuts. Each had been racing to hit 1 million barrels per day of production in the Permian. But fuel demand sank nearly a third this year as travel and business lockdowns collided with a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hitting the market when those countries abandoned production cuts.  Prices for U.S. crude have dropped nearly 70% this year, and actually settled in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever. On Friday, Exxon and Chevron, the two top U.S. oil producers, announced shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter, much of it from their U.S. shale units.  The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output. Both companies have been rapidly sidelining Permian drilling equipment since prices crashed starting in March.  \u201cWe would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,\u201d said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber in an interview.  Exxon posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.  (For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: tmsnrt.rs\/3aTTnrp)  Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30% this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to $14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at $23 billion, the lowest in four years. Both said spending cuts will weigh heavily on shale.  Even though their results topped Wall Street\u2019s reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 4.5% at $44.35 while Chevron dropped 3.4% to $88.90.  U.S. crude futures have recovered since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around $19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many.  Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.  Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend for the first time since World War II and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP Plc\u2019s first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.","340":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp on Tuesday began shutting in and evacuating five production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, joining a move by major oil companies to prepare for a tropical storm.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson\/File Photo\/File Photo  The U.S. company is the first oil major to confirm it is reassessing its spending in the wake of the price collapse.  Oil prices have dropped by around a third over the past week after OPEC and allies led by Russia failed to agree on new output cuts and have let production curbs lapse this month.  The move was seen as an attempt to stymie the rapidly growing American shale oil industry which turned the United States to an oil exporter in recent years.  Chevron has said it plans to sharply boost its shale oil output in the coming years, but did not mention shale production specifically in its statement.  \u201cWe are reviewing alternatives to reduce capital expenditures, that are expected to lower short-term production and preserve long-term value,\u201d Chevron said in a statement to Reuters late on Monday.  Unlike many oil and gas projects such as deepwater fields which require years of development, shale drilling can be switched on and off within weeks in most cases.  Chevron requires an oil price of around $55 a barrel in order to fully cover its spending programme as well as dividend payouts and share buybacks, according to JP Morgan analysts.  In its statement, Chevron said it was already targeting $2 billion in savings through cost savings.  \u201cChevron has seen similar downturns before and is well positioned for a low price environment,\u201d it said.  The drop in the oil price has already led U.S. shale producers to deepen spending cuts and was set to put the world\u2019s top energy companies under heavy financial strain.  Chevron said last week that it would keep its spending in check and return up to $80 billion to shareholders over the next five years, with Chief Executive Mike Wirth making the case that his company is the oil major best able to produce oil and generate profits at the lowest cost.  The San Ramon, California-based company last week stuck to its capital spending plan of $19 billion to $22 billion annually through 2024.  Chevron also said last week that it expects to reach production of 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the Permian, the top U.S. shale field, by the middle of the decade and sustain it through to 2040.  Its Permian output reached 514,000 bpd at the end of 2019, up 36% in a year.

A license allowing Chevron to keep operating its four joint ventures with PDVSA expires on July 27.  Guaido, the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, in January invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency, arguing Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.  In a decree published by his office, he said a possible decision not to extend the license \u201cconstitutes an event of force majeure\u201d that could nonetheless \u201callow the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro to take control of or expropriate the company\u2019s assets.\u201d  Once the sanctions are lifted, an event that presumably would not happen unless Maduro left power, \u201cwe will adopt all the measures that will allow Chevron Corporation and its affiliates in Venezuela to restart activities,\u201d the decree said.  Guaido has been recognized as the rightful leader by most Western countries including the United States, but he would have no ability to enforce the decree while Maduro remains in power.  The move comes as industry observers have speculated that Maduro could transfer control of Chevron\u2019s assets, which include the Petropiar joint venture and crude upgrader in the extra-heavy Orinoco oil belt, to state-owned companies from Russia or China, which have continued to recognize Maduro.

The job cuts, which are on top of Chevron\u2019s plan to cut 10%-15% of its workforce, come after the company promised to lower its operating expenses by $1 billion this year in the face of sharply lower energy demand.  Most of the cuts will take place this year, Chevron said. Noble had about 2,300 employees at the end of last year.  Chevron\u2019s purchase of Noble boosted its investments in U.S. shale patches of Colorado and the Permian basin and gave the company a foothold in Israel through Noble\u2019s flagship Leviathan project, the largest natural gas field in the eastern Mediterranean.  The deal came at a time when drilling had been decimated by the coronavirus crisis, and since then oil producers across North America have continued to consolidate in hopes of surviving the downturn.

Anadarko has been one of the pioneers of the shale revolution, which turned the United States into the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, overtaking Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Houston-based company\u2019s willingness to ink a sale, rather than capitalize on oil prices rebounding, illustrates the significant challenges facing many U.S. shale producers.  These challenges include exploration and production becoming more expensive, as the oil and gas that is easier to access gets scarcer and existing wells turn less productive. Deep-pocketed oil majors such as Chevron can better cope with these costs, because they can get cheaper drilling rates by committing to longer contacts and afford cutting-edge technology to get more out of wells.  Shale producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources, Continental Resources, Diamondback Energy and Concho Resources have already been under pressure from investors to improve their profitability. Many investors now say Chevron\u2019s deal will embolden them to grill companies in the sector whether it is time to throw in the towel and sell.  \u201cIf you have large acreage positions like Pioneer and Concho, or lesser but more contiguous positions like Parsley Energy, and you\u2019re a pure-play Permian producer, there\u2019s no doubt that you are on the radar screen for these majors,\u201d said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors.  Pioneer, Concho and Parsley shares rose 11.5 percent, 8.8 percent and 11.7 percent respectively on Friday following the announcement of the sale of Anadarko, amid investor speculation over who the next takeover target will be.  U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said independent producers expect to spend about 11 percent less in 2019, while major oil companies plan to spend about 16 percent more.  Pioneer, one of the Permian\u2019s largest producers, said in February it plans to reduce 2019 capital expenditures by 11 percent, or about $350 million, in an effort to appease investors.  While there has been dealmaking in the last 12 months - both Concho Resources Inc and Diamondback Energy Inc have bought rivals - many of the large producers which spent years gobbling each other up have been sitting on their hands, under shareholder pressure to focus on creating stronger returns.  The sale of Anadarko could likely change that for potential acquirers, including ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp, the two largest U.S. independents behind the majors. Occidental was the rival bidder that lost out to Chevron in the race to buy Anadarko, sources said on Friday.  \u201cAt some point in time in the next few years the majors may reach out,\u201d Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield told Reuters this week, before Chevron\u2019s acquisition was announced.  He declined to comment on whether majors had approached Pioneer directly.  Asked about his appetite for deals in February, Conoco CEO Ryan Lance said it would have to be an unusual opportunity for the company to consider an acquisition. \u201cWe are not feeling any pressure to do anything,\u201d he said.  RUNNING OUT OF INVENTORY  Given the substantial production forecasts being offered by some of the majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp, they will need to acquire new acreage at a big scale to offset the often sharp declines experienced by shale wells.  The majors \u201care eventually going to run out of inventory,\u201d said Pioneer\u2019s Sheffield. \u201cThey are drilling their inventory faster than the independents, so they are going to run out a lot faster, in my opinion.\u201d  BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, which lag peers like Exxon and Chevron in the Permian, could make acquisitions to gain more exposure to the formation, analysts said.  Shell was seen as the leading contender to buy privately owned Permian producer Endeavor Energy, people familiar with the transaction told Reuters, but the two companies have, so far, failed to agree on Endeavor\u2019s valuation.  Shell is further constrained by its target to spend only $30 billion on capital projects in 2019, including acquisitions, said Noah Barnett, an analyst at Janus Henderson.","356":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil and natural gas producer Chevron Corp CVX.N on Friday reported quarterly earnings that topped analysts' estimates on higher prices and production, sending shares higher in morning trading.

Chevron\u2019s fourth-quarter cash flow from operations rose to $9.2 billion from $8 billion a year earlier, reflecting the higher output and expense reduction. Investors have been pushing oil companies to restrain spending and increase returns to shareholders.  Wirth forecast oil-equivalent production this year to grow between 4 percent and 7 percent, excluding asset sales.  Chevron reported a profit of $3.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with $3.11 billion, or $1.64 a share a year earlier. Analysts\u2019 mean forecast was $1.87 a share, according to Refinitiv.

FILE PHOTO: An entrance sign at the Chevron refinery, located near the Houston Ship Channel, is seen in Pasadena, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  The move comes a year after the company suspended the legal process to allow more time for talks with Thailand\u2019s energy ministry, ahead of the end of its concession in April 2022.  \u201cFor the last 12 months we have been seeking a solution on this issue ... in order to reach agreement that protects our rights as an investor,\u201d a company spokesman told Reuters.  \u201cWith no such solution likely in the near term, we are regretfully compelled to reinstate arbitration.\u201d  Thailand\u2019s energy ministry was not immediately available for comment, but has said it would be ready to enter arbitration if needed.  The dispute resulted from a retroactive Thai law in 2016 requiring gas field operators to pay the costs of decommissioning assets they have installed, including those they will transfer free of charge to a next operator.  Last year, Thailand asked Chevron to pay the full decommissioning costs of around $2 billion for assets in the Erawan gas field, including those it will hand over to PTT Exploration and Production Pcl, a unit of the state-owned PTT Pcl.  Chevron argues that, under the terms of its initial contracts from 1971, it is only liable for infrastructure that is no longer deemed usable and the transferred assets are the responsibility of the new operator.  The decommissioning work of the unusable assets was already underway, Chevron said on Friday.  Reuters reported in September 2019 that Chevron had suspended the arbitration process to continue talks with then-energy minister Sontirat Sontijirawong, who resigned in July.  The new energy minister, Supattanapong Punmeechaow, formerly a vice president of PTT, met with Chevron\u2019s representatives last month but has not made public comments about the dispute.  The case has implications for France\u2019s Total SA and Japan\u2019s Mitsui & Co, which also have stakes in soon-expiring offshore energy concessions in the Gulf of Thailand.

The market rebounded quickly from a dip after bearish U.S. inventory data because the build was not as large as it could have been, given the jump in exports, McGillian said.  Crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 2.2 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a 2 million-barrel draw. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub USOICC=ECI rose 459,000 barrels, EIA said.  A rise in U.S. government borrowing costs to their highest since 2013 this week has tempered some investor appetite for risk, but analysts said Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, may yet rise toward new 2018 peaks above $75 a barrel.  Supplier cutbacks, steady demand growth, geopolitical tensions and a favorable structure in the futures market have attracted record investment in oil this year.  Money managers hold record positions in Brent crude futures and options, lured by the hefty premium of the front-month June contract over subsequent months that makes it profitable to invest in crude over the longer term.  \u201cThe prospect of a downside correction in prices is lost on the speculative fraternity. In fact, financial players have rarely felt more optimistic.

This might eventually pressure crude prices, even though oil and the dollar have moved in tandem for a few weeks.","363":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp reported a 36% drop in third-quarter profit on Friday, hit by lower oil and gas prices and refining margins, and warned higher costs would affect results in its current quarter, sending shares lower.

Chevron executives \u201cremain focused on our base business operations and supporting the more than 8,800 people who work with us and their families,\u201d said spokesman Ray Fohr. The company is reviewing terms of the latest license.  The renewal effectively adds no new restrictions, according to a review of past licenses.  Chevron CVX.N has been in Venezuela for nearly 100 years and has about 300 direct employees there. Its joint ventures with state oil company PDVSA support about 8,800 people. The ventures produce the equivalent of about 200,000 barrels per day of oil, and Chevron's stake in them recently averaged about 34,000 bpd, the company said.  In January, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company PDVSA in an effort to oust Maduro. But it issued Chevron a six-month license to operate, which has now been renewed for two three-month periods.  Crude oil output in the OPEC nation has dropped from well over 2 million bpd in 2014 to just over 1 million bpd by the end of 2018, the result of lower prices and what critics say is years of underinvestment and mismanagement. Blackouts and U.S. sanctions have accelerated the collapse: The country now produces just 600,000 bpd.  The Treasury Department said the license does not authorize transactions related to shipments of diluents, which Venezuela needs to thin its heavy oil for processing.  The license also covers oil field service companies Halliburton Co HAL.N, Schlumberger SLB.N, GE's Baker Hughes BHGE.N and Weatherford International. All have largely halted operations in Venezuela because of the instability.  \u201cPresident Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election bid could make future extensions increasingly difficult,\u201d said Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners. \u201cThe White House may see a strong stand against Maduro as a way to appeal to Latino voters.\u201d","368":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq closed lower while the S&P 500 was little changed on Wednesday as investors rotated out of technology shares and concerns about inflation added some pressure on stocks.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose, however, aided in part by gains in shares of Verizon Communications Inc and Chevron Corp. Those stocks gained after Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed major investments in the companies on Tuesday. Verizon shares climbed 5.2%, and Chevron shares advanced 3%.  Technology shares led losses on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Apple Inc, PayPal Holdings Inc and Nvidia Corp weighed most on both indexes. The S&P 500 tech index ended 1% lower.  Conversely, energy rose 1.5% to lead gains among S&P 500 sectors as a halt in Texas oil production boosted crude prices. A strong rebound in U.S. retail sales helped consumer discretionary stocks advance 0.7%.  The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq pared losses while the Dow added to gains after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s January policy meeting.  All of the meeting\u2019s participants supported the decision to maintain an accommodative monetary policy. The Fed has pledged to pin interest rates near zero until inflation rises to 2% and looks set to exceed that goal.  \u201cThe market is accurately reflecting the combination of continued low interest rates and a continued accomodative Fed,\u201d said Oliver Pursche, president of Bronson Meadows Capital Management in Fairfield, Connecticut.  Yet the Fed\u2019s accomodative stance, coupled with President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9 trillion package for pandemic relief, has some analysts warning of a coming surge in inflation. As a result, some investors have worried that the Fed may have to change course sooner than expected.  Those fears, which have been bolstered by a sharp rise in benchmark Treasury yields, have contributed to recent market declines, with investors taking profits from market-leading technology stocks.  Inflation pressures may force the Fed to revise its policy in the future, said Michael O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut. But, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s a high threshold we have to cross in order to get them to react.\u201d  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.27 points, or 0.29%, to 31,613.02, the S&P 500 lost 1.26 points, or 0.03%, to 3,931.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 82.00 points, or 0.58%, to 13,965.50.

An entrance sign at the Chevron refinery, located near the Houston Ship Channel, is seen in Pasadena, Texas, U.S., May 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Loren Elliott  Oil majors have written off around $80 billion in asset values this year, cut output and laid off thousands of staff to save money in the face of a sharp decline in oil demand and revenue.  Chevron said it expects total capital and exploratory budget through 2025 to be between $14 billion and $16 billion, well below the prior forecast of up to $22 billion.  Its move to restrain spending on new oil projects, hold outlays flat next year and cut about $6 billion from last forecast was a sign it expects low energy prices for years.  The reduction came despite the addition of massive projects in the United States, Middle East and Africa, acquired by Chevron as part of a $4.1 billion purchase of Noble Energy.  Detailing its 2021 budget of $14 billion, the company said it will spend $11.5 billion on exploration and production and $2.1 billion for refining related operations.  Chevron\u2019s 2021 Permian basin spending of $2 billion is half of what it planned at the start of 2020 and lower than 2019 levels of $3.6 billion, said Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets, adding that the company has been true to its recent message of \u201clower for longer capex\u201d.  Despite the cut to the overall budget, the company said starting 2022 it was likely to raise investments in the Permian basin and the Gulf of Mexico, helped by an anticipated drop in capital needed for a Kazakhstan project.  In contrast with Chevron, which has been praised for its capital discipline, its U.S. rival Exxon Mobil Corp on Monday said by 2025, it will boost expenditures above this year\u2019s $23 billion level.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron Corp is seen in its booth at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan April 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai  A long, steady increase in U.S. gas production \u2013 much of it a byproduct of the shale oil boom \u2013 has pushed prices for the fuel toward a 25-year low. Nearly half of U.S. gas production is a by-product of oil drilling, and therefore does not change in response to weak prices, analysts said.  In response, BP Plc, Repsol SA and Equinor ASA have written off more than $11 billion in total from the value of North American shale assets just this year.  Industry players, consultants and analysts all said that Chevron\u2019s announcement on Tuesday that it expects to write down the value of its assets by $10 billion to $11 billion this quarter was a sign of more writedowns, with one brokerage highlighting exposure for Exxon Mobil.  \u201cChevron writing down assets \u2013 especially of this magnitude \u2013 isn\u2019t just symbolic, it\u2019s indicative of what\u2019s to come with impairment testing across the entire U.S. exploration and production space,\u201d said Dallas Salazar, head of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting.  Mizuho Securities analysts urged Exxon\u2019s chief executive, Darren Woods, to write down the full value of the company\u2019s $30 billion acquisition of XTO Energy. Exxon bought XTO in 2009 and booked a $2 billion charge in 2017 against the value of natural gas reserves from the buyout.  Exxon did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.  Chevron late on Tuesday said that more than half of its expected writedown in the fourth quarter is related to its Appalachia gas shale assets. Shares of the company on Wednesday closed down 1.4%.  PRICES LIKE 1995  The writedowns are broadly the result of oil companies having assumed much higher future prices for natural gas over the past decade.  Shell, for example, said as recently as its 2018 annual report that it expected prices would rise to $3.50 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) in 2020 and 2021 from $3.25 per mmbtu in 2019. BP said it had determined the size of its recoverable reserves based on a long-term price of $4 per mmbtu.  The main benchmark for natural gas has been below $2.70 for most of this year and currently stands around $2.28. IHS Markit projects U.S. gas prices will average below $2 per mmbtu next year, the lowest prices since 1995.  U.S. drillers seeking out more valuable oil produce a lot of unwanted associated gas, making producers insensitive to gas price declines. U.S. energy firms were on track to flare a record amount of that gas in 2019, especially in places like the Permian in West Texas and eastern New Mexico.  \u201cIt is likely that undisciplined, Permian byproduct gas production will continue to account for a significant percentage of gas-production growth in the coming years as oil production continues to increase,\u201d S&P Global Ratings said.

With a financing assist from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, Occidental, which is one-quarter the size of Chevron, is the likely victor in a contest that again proved the allure of U.S. shale.  Occidental has said it plans to shed most of Anadarko\u2019s non-shale properties in a deal that would cement its position in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the top U.S. shale field.  Chevron declined to raise its initial offer after Occidental boosted the cash portion of its $76 per share bid and Anadarko\u2019s board deemed it a superior offer. Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil producer, received a $1 billion breakup fee, which it has said it will apply to a $5 billion share repurchase program.  Chevron shares closed 3.1 percent higher on Thursday at $121.19 while shares of Occidental fell 6.4 percent to $56.33, the lowest in a decade.  Anadarko shares fell 3.3 percent to $73.39.  Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the company decided at a board meeting on Wednesday to walk away from the takeover battle, even though it could have matched or beaten Occidental\u2019s offer and saw Anadarko as a strategic fit.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  \u201cMake no mistake. We have the financial capacity to outbid Occidental, but we concluded that an increased offer would have eroded value to our shareholders, and it would have diminished returns on capital,\u201d Wirth said. \u201cThe bar is high. We don\u2019t have a need to do anything. We are not desperate to do a deal.\u201d  Chevron\u2019s decision demonstrated strong capital discipline, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.  \u201cI am a bit surprised that they walked, but am pleased that they didn\u2019t get caught up in a bidding war with Oxy, who comes across as willing to fight to win at all costs,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cAnadarko was a unique fit for Chevron, so I don\u2019t expect them to go on a shopping spree in the Permian.\u201d  Anadarko\u2019s major assets - in U.S. shale, the Gulf of Mexico and an liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique - were seen as a logical fit for Chevron, but not something the company needed. \u201cChevron has no objective need to acquire Anadarko - or, for that matter, engage in any other large-scale (mergers and acquisitions),\u201d said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James.  Analysts said they do not expect another bidder for Anadarko to emerge.  \u201cThe industry is trying to show investors more capital discipline and if another suitor comes in that would be significantly counter to most companies\u2019 strategies,\u201d analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Thursday.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  PERMIAN BASIN  Investors have sold off shares of oil companies that increased spending on drilling instead of returning cash to shareholders. They have called for capital discipline, defined as increasing production by 4 percent a year and maintaining a 4 percent dividend.  One result: The value of U.S. oil and gas mergers and acquisitions fell to a 10-year low in the first quarter as investors sold shares of companies that spent more on drilling than on buybacks and dividends.  The contest for Anadarko underscored the value of its assets in the Permian Basin, the vast shale field with oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.  The region\u2019s soaring production has propelled U.S. oil production to 12 million barrels per day (bpd), more than that of Russia or Saudi Arabia.  Anadarko said on Thursday it had signed a definitive agreement with Occidental and expects the merger to be completed in the second half of the year. The deal still faces antitrust reviews.  Chevron holds 2.3 million acres in the Permian Basin and has vast mineral ownership there, which reduces its royalty rate. It expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 bpd by the end of next year, and 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023.  Occidental outmaneuvered Chevron by gaining cash and allies.  It got a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and struck a deal with French oil giant Total SA to take most of Anadarko\u2019s international assets, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. Total agreed to pay $8.8 billion for the assets once the merger goes ahead.  Several Occidental investors oppose the deal, including its sixth-largest shareholder, T. Rowe Price Group Inc, because they consider it too large a risk if oil prices falter, or if Occidental cannot produce the $3.5 billion a year in cost savings it has promised.  Ratings agency Moody\u2019s Investors Service said on Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevailed in the takeover, noting the deal would add $46 billion of debt before any sale of assets.  Several investors also have criticized Occidental\u2019s decision this week to secure Anadarko\u2019s endorsement by excluding a shareholder vote on the deal.","379":"Slideshow ( 2 images )  HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc was returning workers to the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Chevron Corp restored some production on Monday after the passage of Subtropical Storm Alberto, the companies said.

The second-largest U.S. oil producer reported an adjusted loss of $11 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with a profit of $2.8 billion, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier. The net loss was $665 million including acquisition costs, the impact of foreign exchange and pension payouts.  Results missed analysts\u2019 expectations for a profit of 7 cents a share, according to data from Refinitiv IBES.  Chevron\u2019s shares were down about 3.3% to $86.09 around midday.  The refining business was \u201cvery weak,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors. However, the company had \u201cgood underlying cash flow from operations in a still-tough environment.\u201d  LOWER FUEL SALES  Improved oil and gas prices and a 6% increase in output from the Noble purchase boosted Chevron\u2019s oil and gas earnings to $501 million, compared with a loss of $6.7 billion a year earlier.  The gain came as Chevron sold its oil for about $40 per barrel, up from $39 in the prior quarter and down from $57 a year earlier.  The company\u2019s refining and chemical business reported a fourth-quarter loss of $338 million compared with a profit of $672 million in the prior year. Fuel sales fell 11% from the year-ago period as COVID-19 travel restrictions continued to reduce demand.  Its closely watched cash flow from operations was $2.3 billion, short of covering the $2.5 billion dividend and $3.2 billion in capital spending for the period.  Chevron will operate five drilling rigs in the Permian shale basin this year, down from about 20 a year ago, and does not expect to boost activity there this year, Breber said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think our shareholders want us to grow production in a world that has excess supplies,\u201d Breber said.  Rivals Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc report financial results next week.","382":"May 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp:  * CHEVRON SAYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDED STOCKHOLDERS TO VOTE AGAINST STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING REPORT ON METHANE EMISSIONS - SEC FILING Source bit.ly\/2IEuDJL Further company coverage:","383":"FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Chevron is seen at the company's office in Caracas, Venezuela April 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Marco Bello\/File Photo  The carbon storage project was delayed by more than two years after Chevron discovered problems with valves and pipeline equipment during commissioning of the A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) injection system.  Gorgon is the biggest emitter of carbon emissions out of Australia\u2019s 10 LNG plants, with gas from the Gorgon field containing 14% CO2. Growth in LNG exports has been a big contributor to Australia\u2019s rising CO2 emissions, according to the Environment and Energy Department.  \u201cWe are pleased to reach the first milestone of safely starting the operation of the Gorgon carbon dioxide injection system, one of the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas mitigation projects ever undertaken by industry,\u201d Chevron Australia Managing Director Al Williams said in a statement.  The facility, which will be ramped up over several months, will reduce Gorgon\u2019s emissions by 40 percent over the life of the project, the company said.  Western Australia\u2019s state government approved the $54 billion Gorgon project in 2009 on condition that some carbon dioxide from its gas processing operations would be stored.  Once fully up and running, between 3.4 million and 4 million tonnes a year of carbon dioxide will be buried, Chevron said.  LNG projects separate carbon dioxide before gas is liquefied to stop the gas from freezing. At other plants, CO2 is vented into the air.  Australia, the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter per capita, emitted 538.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018, up 0.7% from the previous year, mainly due to increased LNG exports.  Gorgon LNG is owned by Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and Japan's Osaka Gas 9532.T, Tokyo Gas 9531.T and JERA 9501.T9502.T.","385":"July 21 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp\u2019s surprise $5 billion deal for oil producer Noble Energy should spell the end of this year\u2019s deal drought, setting a price benchmark that will trigger more buys, mergers and acquisition bankers, lawyers and analysts said.  The COVID-19 pandemic destroyed fuel demand and left dozens of energy companies without the prospect of drilling their way out of debt. They may now be more willing to entertain deals with the Chevron offer as a standard.  \u201cSometimes you need the one significant deal to reset the comps and manage price expectations,\u201d said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Enverus.  \u201cThe debt maturity wall that has been out there for some time is getting closer and closer.\u201d  Chevron agreed to pay $5 a barrel for Noble\u2019s reserves, a price that could reset expectations for sellers weighing deals, analysts said.  Other oil companies that have hinted at interest in cheap reserves and have the wherewithal to buy include ConocoPhillips , Exxon Mobil Corp and Total SA.  \u201cThis is going to wake a lot of people up,\u201d said one Houston-based attorney specializing in energy mergers and acquisitions. \u201cThey are going to look at it and say \u2018uh oh, even someone like Noble threw in the towel.\u2019\u201d  He said his firm was working on 10-15 smaller sale processes, although he cautioned many may not get done due to capital constraints. He declined to be identified as deal talks are confidential.  U.S. producers spent only $3.4 billion on company and land deals in the first six months of the year, turning away from buying assets as oil prices fell.  Bankers and analysts said consolidation is needed to save many smaller players and that more deals will be paid for in stock alone, mirroring a number of buys last year.  Noble\u2019s $13 billion price tag puts it among the five biggest deals since 2013 and brings with it holdings that include deepwater and natural gas assets, as well as shale plays in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield.  \u201cPermian is still one place where buyers in the basin, probably don\u2019t have enough, or not in the basin and want to get in,\u201d said Vidisha Prasad, managing partner of upstream-focused energy consulting firm Adya Partners.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold said he expected at least one of the Permian\u2019s big independent drillers to be sold.  \u201cWhen you look at the big companies in there,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least one will be consolidated in the next three or so years.\u201d  The top Permian independent explorers and producers include Pioneer Natural Resources Co, Diamondback Energy Inc , Parsley Energy and Callon Petroleum.

The tweet was accompanied by two graphics, one showing oil consumption slipping from 2005 through 2015 and the other showing renewable energy consumption rising across the same period.  The tweet comes as Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp and other oil producers are under increasing pressure to invest less in oil projects and more in solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies.  An active presence on the social media platform with 189,000 followers, Moyo added several hashtags to her post that have been associated in the past with activists pushing for greater adoption of renewables by oil producers, including \u201c#environment,\u201d \u201c#getsmarter\u201d and \u201c#happywarrior.\u201d  Moyo could not immediately be reached for additional comment. A Chevron representative was not immediately available to comment.  Moyo, who tweets under the handle @dambisamoyo, is also a board member of Barclays Plc and Barrick Gold Corp .  John Watson, who retired as Chevron\u2019s chairman and chief executive earlier this month, told Reuters last fall that he did not see demand for oil peaking in the foreseeable future.  The view is widely shared in the oil industry and leaders of the world\u2019s biggest oil companies are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat from climate change policies or renewable technologies.  The International Energy Agency said earlier this month it expects global oil demand to rise 1.4 million barrels per day this year."}}
