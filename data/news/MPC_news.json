REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  (Reuters) - U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp\u2019s losses narrowed in the fourth quarter from the third, helped by a slight recovery in fuel demand on the back of easing COVID-19 restrictions and lower costs.  Demand for fuel has ticked up in recent months as more people traveled with many states and countries rolling back COVID-19 restrictions.  Like its rivals Valero and Phillips 66, Marathon Petroleum on Tuesday pinned economic recovery hopes on COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.  Marathon Petroleum forecast 2021 standalone capital spending of $1.4 billion, a reduction of $350 million from 2020.  The company\u2019s total throughput or the amount of crude it processed in the fourth quarter was 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd), flat from the third quarter but still below last year\u2019s 3.1 million bpd.  Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon said on Tuesday adjusted net loss narrowed to $608 million, or 94 cents per share, in the quarter ended December, from $649 million, or $1 per share, in the third quarter.","1":"(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp is operating refineries at minimum rates but sees signs of recovery in demand for gasoline amid the coronavirus crisis, executives said on Tuesday.  On the West Coast, the largest U.S. oil refiner is running plants at about 50% capacity, compared with an average of 66% to 67% overall.  \u201cThe West Coast demand drop was even more severe than the whole national average,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mike Hennigan said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Gasoline demand bottomed out after falling by more than 50% in mid- to late March, but has recovered by 5% to 15% since mid-April, dependent on the region, according to Speedway President Tim Griffith.  Griffith noted a clearer understanding of the demand environment is still a few months away and contingent upon consumer sentiment and the lifting of stay-at-home orders.  \u201cWe\u2019re still oversupplied on pretty much crude and products across the board,\u201d said Hennigan.  Executives said the company would not bring its idled Gallup, New Mexico, and Martinez, California, refineries back online until \u201cthe market requires it\u201d but noted that the refineries are expected to come back online by the end of the year.  Net loss attributable to Marathon was $9.2 billion, or $14.25 per share, in the first quarter, as it booked $12.4 billion in charges related to inventory writedowns and goodwill impairment.  The U.S. refiner cut spending by 30% and detailed other measures to reduce costs, as widespread lockdowns to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic pummel demand for oil and gas.","2":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp restarted the gasoline-producing unit over the weekend at its 585,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, sources familiar with plant operations said on Monday.  The 140,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) was shut late on Thursday and was back in production by Sunday, the sources said.","3":"(Reuters) - The Japanese owner of 7-Eleven convenience stores has agreed to buy Marathon Petroleum Corp's MPC.N Speedway gas stations for $21 billion, brushing aside coronavirus concerns to return to the table five months after initially baulking at the deal.  The acquisition is one of the biggest this year, suggesting the pandemic, while forcing many companies to focus on protecting balance sheets instead of expansion, has not killed off global dealmaking altogether.  The move will help Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd 3382.T shift focus beyond Japan, where its stores and supermarkets face a shrinking population, slow economic growth and tough price competition.  The deal boosts its 7-Eleven store count in the United States and Canada to about 14,000, adding to a portfolio fattened three years ago with a $3.3 billion purchase from Sunoco LP SUN.N - furthering its convenience store lead over Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc ATDb.TO.  Shares in Seven & i fell 4.8% on Monday in Tokyo on worries about a price just $1 billion lower than what the company reportedly turned down in March. Marathon\u2019s shares rose 9% in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Analysts and investors said then that the price was too high given concerns about a pandemic-induced global economic slowdown. Oil prices and fuel consumption have fallen this year as more people work from home and avoid travel.  Seven & i President Ryuji Isaka said expanding in the United States was still beneficial given its growing population and economy, regardless of the pandemic\u2019s hit to consumer spending.  \u201cThe coronavirus is not going to go on forever,\u201d Isaka told a conference call following the deal announcement.  While he declined to discuss specifics on why the company returned to the deal table, he said: \u201cWe made the management decision that these assets will be a source of our growth in five years, 10 years down the road.\u201d  FILE PHOTO: A motorist fuels-up his car at a Speedway gas station in Des Plaines, Illinois, April 22, 2008. REUTERS\/Kamil Krzaczynski\/File Photo  He said the retailer wanted to bolster food offerings at the U.S. stores, in the same way its Japanese 7-Eleven stores have become popular for their ready-to-heat meals and boxed lunches.  The 7-Eleven brand started in the United States, but the Japanese affiliate became far more successful as its 24-hour opening policy and franchise system proved a perfect match with a dense population and late-night work culture.  The global chain is now owned by Seven & i, one of Japan\u2019s biggest retail groups, with a market capitalization of around $27 billion.  RESTRUCTURING REFINER  The deal comes after Marathon last year launched a sweeping restructuring, including a spin-off of Speedway, under sustained pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.  Marathon said it expects the deal, approved by the boards of both firms, to close in the first quarter of 2021 and generate after-tax proceeds of about $16.5 billion which it will use to repay some of its over $30 billion debt and for shareholder returns.  The largest U.S. oil refiner by volume also said the deal includes a 15-year fuel supply agreement for about 7.7 billion gallons a year associated with the Speedway business.  Seven & i forecast $475 million to $575 million in savings through greater purchasing power and other benefits of scale through the third year of the deal\u2019s close, and compound annual growth of over 15% in 7\u2013Eleven\u2019s operating income.  The group said it will pay through debt and loans, without equity financing.  Credit-rating firm S&P had said at the previously reported deal price of $22 billion that Seven & i\u2019s key ratio of debt-to-EBITDA would climb to about 4, from 1.6 last year. A ratio above 4 or 5 often raises red flags for rating agencies and investors.  The retailer on Monday said it aimed to lower the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to below 3 within two years.  Japan Credit Rating Agency said the deal will help 7-Eleven bolster its earnings capacity, but still placed the Japanese company under a negative credit watch.  \u201cIt will take time to recover the financial structure,\u201d it said.","4":"Aug 1 (Reuters) - U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp reported a 4.8% rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, as strength in its midstream and retail segments more than offset a fall in refining income.

REUTERS\/Julio-Cesar Chavez  (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.N, the largest U.S. oil refiner, said it would lay off about 2,050 employees, or 12% of its workforce, at its U.S. operations, excluding Speedway, as the COVID-19 pandemic crushed global demand for motor fuels.  The workforce reduction plan is a result of indefinite idling of its Martinez, California and Gallup, New Mexico refineries, the company said in the filing here.  Refiners and oil producers have been cutting staff, slashing spending and reducing production to cope with the slump in crude prices and a global glut of fuel.  On Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L said it would dismiss up to 9,000 workers, or 10% of its staff, while oil majors, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, are in the process of restructuring their businesses to halt losses.  Marathon Petroleum said it expects to record charges of about $125 million to $175 million for severance and employee benefits-related expenses as a result of these actions.  The company said it expects the majority of the job cuts to take effect in October 2020.

The RFS requires refineries to blend fuels with ethanol to reduce pollution, or pay for credits to subsidize those that do that blending.  Heminger said that the standard has caused very volatile prices of those credits, and that it needs reform.  The Trump Administration has attempted to reform the standard, but has maintained much of the existing framework of the law due to support from corn producers in Iowa and other farming states.

Shares of Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon Petroleum gained as much as 7 percent to $79.43, while those of San Antonio, Texas-based Valero Energy Corp rose 4 percent to touch $113.53.  Most refiners in the United States process heavy crude from countries such as Venezuela or Canada into diesel, gasoline and other products, but the U.S. shale revolution has added millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix.  After reporting a doubling of profit in the second quarter, Marathon Petroleum Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said business prospects should hold up \u201cgiven strong global demand, wider crude differentials, and the changing dynamics of the low-sulfur fuel market.\u201d  The company said it plans to run 32 percent West Texas crude at its refineries in the third quarter, up from 23 percent a year earlier.  \u201cAs we look at our optionality and crude slate, we see opportunities to maximize usage of WTI crude,\u201d Heminger said on a post-earnings call with analysts.  Valero Energy CEO Joe Gorder said the refiner processed near record volumes of light crude in the second quarter.  Marathon\u2019s earnings beat estimates by 24 cents, while rival Valero posted a profit of $2.15 per share, ahead of estimate of $1.98.  Marathon\u2019s refining and marketing margin jumped 36 percent, while those for Valero rose 14 percent.  Margins were boosted by a discount on crude prices in Midland, Texas, which widened by nearly $10 a barrel against the benchmark during the second quarter, as production in the Permian surged beyond pipeline capacity. Lower tax rates also helped.  Strong crack spreads - the margin on turning crude oil into diesel, gasoline and other products - also spurred utilization rates, or the extent to which refineries are running at full capacity without downtime.  Marathon operated its refineries at near full capacity in the quarter, while Valero ran at 93 percent and expects it to scale up to 95 percent in the current quarter.  The rise in margins was also helped by wider differentials between Western Canada Select, the benchmark for heavy crude found in Canada\u2019s oil sands, and U.S. crude as a result of supply bottlenecks in Canada.  Revenue rose 22 percent at Marathon, while it surged 39 percent at Valero.  Profit at Valero jumped 54.2 percent from a year earlier, also helped by a drop in biofuel blending costs to $131 million from $255 million a year earlier, mainly due to lower Renewable Identification Number (RIN) prices.  RINs, which are renewable fuel credits, are used to comply with the country's biofuels requirements. A surge in waivers to refiners seeking exemptions here from the law under President Donald Trump's administration has sent the price of biofuels compliance credits to five-year lows.","15":"(Reuters) - Nearly 200 refinery workers represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters in St. Paul Park, Minnesota, voted last week to authorize a strike if they cannot agree on a new contract with Marathon Petroleum by the end of 2020, the union said on Thursday.  A strike could affect operations at Marathon\u2019s 102,000-barrel-per-day refinery in St. Paul Park.  \u201cWe do not anticipate supply disruptions in Minnesota or the Midwest region and expect to continue meeting our customer commitments,\u201d said a Marathon spokesman.  The company added that while it is committed to reaching an agreement, it has \u201cappropriate contingency plans in place\u201d and is prepared to safely operate the refinery in the event of a work stoppage.  No progress has been made in negotiations between the union and Marathon after nearly daily talks that have been ongoing since the end of November, union representatives said on a call with investors and media on Friday.  Talks will continue for three days next week and throughout the rest of December.  The union mainly disagrees with Marathon\u2019s position to hire subcontractors for work typically performed by unionized members at the refinery, representatives said.

The Tuesday fire broke out on the Bacliff substation at about 4:30 p.m. CDT (2130 GMT) with flaring seen at the Marathon and Valero refineries about 20 minutes later, according energy industry intelligence service Genscape.  At about 6 p.m., Centerpoint said the fire, which was fueled by mineral oil inside the substation, was under control.  All personnel at the substation were accounted for and no injuries were reported, according to Centerpoint.

The deal comes months after the U.S. refiner said it had been weighing a possible merger of MPLX and Andeavor Logistics LP, the two master limited partnerships (MLPs) in its midstream segment that transport, store and market crude oil and its refined products.  \u201cThis transaction simplifies our MLPs into a single listed entity and creates a leading, large-scale, diversified midstream company anchored by fee-based cash flows,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said in a statement.  The deal further deepens the refiner\u2019s presence in the Permian basin, the largest oilfield in the United States, building on its $23 billion Andeavor acquisition last year, the company said.  Marathon has been strengthening its midstream operations and retail unit, which includes Speedway gas stations and convenience stores and Andeavor\u2019s retail and direct dealer business, to diversify its revenue streams beyond refining.  \u201cThis transaction can likely unlock $2 billion value net to MPC that is being discounted by the market due to the overhang of this combination and concerns around future growth,\u201d Cowen & Co said.

At the year\u2019s low of $43.96 in August, its shares touched 2016 levels.  Under Elliott\u2019s latest plan, Marathon\u2019s transportation and storage business will become MPLX, a company with an enterprise value of more than $50 billion. Its refining business will be the \u201cNew Marathon\u201d with an enterprise value of $29 billion, while its retail business will become Speedway worth about $18 billion.  Marathon said it was focused on increasing shareholder value and would \u201cthoroughly evaluate\u201d Elliott\u2019s proposal.  The hedge fund, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, said on Wednesday it had accepted a \u201ccompromise\u201d last time around after \u201cextensive\u201d talks in which Marathon agreed to simplify its midstream business and undertake a strategic review of its Speedway assets.  After the review, the refiner chose to keep its Speedway retail arm, a decision then backed by Elliott.  Marathon later bought rival Andeavor to become the top U.S. refiner and earlier this year completed the merger of midstream units MPLX MPLX.N and Andeavor Logistics LP ANDX.N in a $9 billion deal.  Elliott, which owned 0.7% of Marathon as of June 30, according to Refinitiv data, said it estimated a $22 billion boost to shareholder value from the split and another $17 billion if refining, retailing and marketing operations were to be improved after the separation.  Shareholder DE Shaw, which has a stake of about 0.9% in Marathon, according to Refinitiv data, has backed Elliott\u2019s call to split the company, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Marathon Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Heminger could become a target for disgruntled shareholders, given he has overseen the company since Marathon Petroleum was separated from Marathon Oil Corp MRO.N in 2011.  Heminger\u2019s membership of Marathon\u2019s board of directors is due up for shareholder vote in 2020, according to Marathon\u2019s 2019 proxy statement. At the 2018 annual meeting, shareholders rejected a proposal to create an independent chairman position.  \u201cAt this stage, Elliott\u2019s going to have a lot of support, and it is going to be harder for Marathon to fight this,\u201d said Matthew Blair, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering & Holt.

Most refiners in the United States process heavy crude from Venezuela or Canada into diesel, gasoline and other products, but the U.S. shale revolution has added millions of barrels of very light crude to the supply mix.  After reporting a doubling of profit in the second quarter, Marathon Petroleum MPC.N chief Gary Heminger said business prospects should stay strong \"given strong global demand, wider crude differentials, and the changing dynamics of the low-sulfur fuel market.\"  Revenue at both Marathon and independent refiner Valero Energy Corp VLO.N surged by 22 percent and 39 percent respectively.

Marathon\u2019s refining and marketing margin jumped 36 percent to $15.40, while those for Valero rose 14 percent jump.  The refiners\u2019 earnings were also boosted by a discount on crude prices in Midland, Texas, which widened by nearly $10 a barrel against benchmark futures during the second quarter, as production in the Permian surged beyond pipeline capacity to move oil out of the region.

FILE PHOTO: An aerial view of the Valero Houston Refinery is seen in Houston, Texas, U.S. August 31, 2017. REUTERS\/Adrees Latif  Major independent refiners cut production dramatically during the quarter, with some electing to undergo maintenance rather than produce barrels at a time when gasoline margins slumped.  Several major U.S. refiners, including Valero Energy Corp, HollyFrontier Corp, and Marathon Petroleum Corp, are all expected to fall short of consensus estimates when they report results, according to Refinitiv Eikon\u2019s SmartEstimate model, which values more recent revisions from higher-ranked analysts.  However, reduced refining output in the early part of the year sets up the industry for a potential rebound as the critical summer months approach. With gasoline stockpiles at a four-year low on a seasonal basis, margins have rebounded in anticipation of driving season.  U.S. refinery utilization dropped to 87.5 percent in early April, the lowest seasonally since 2014. Refiners had been running full-tilt for much of 2018, encouraged by strong demand for distillates. But in the process, they overproduced gasoline, tanking margins for the fuel along the way.  Those margins fell to $3.64 a gallon in January, the lowest since 2009. They have since recovered, and were at about $23.00 a gallon on Monday, as inventories have fallen to about 228 million barrels from almost 260 million barrels in mid-January.  Refiner earnings kick off this week with Valero on Friday. Since the beginning of April, analysts, on average, have revised projections for refiners lower by more than 5 percent, according to Refinitiv data.  Analysts have sharply lowered estimates for Valero, Marathon and HollyFrontier, along with PBF Energy and Phillips 66, in the past month, putting them in the bottom quartile among U.S. companies in terms of revisions, according to Refinitiv data.  On top of heavy maintenance, fires broke out at facilities over the last few months, including at Valero\u2019s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s Baytown, Texas, refinery and HollyFrontier\u2019s El Dorado, Kansas, refinery.  HollyFrontier lowered the amount of crude it expected to process in the first quarter by 5,000 bpd. Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the company\u2019s outlook last week on concerns that profits would take a hit after Canadian crude differentials collapsed.  Sandy Fielden, director of commodities and energy research at Morningstar, said PBF also lost out because of \u201cthe Canadian crude discount just disappearing.\u201d  Canadian crude oil had been heavily discounted due to oversupply and lack of pipelines, but that discount eroded after the province of Alberta instituted production cuts. Western Canada Select (WCS) recently has traded around $9.25 a barrel under U.S. crude, compared with $15.65 at the beginning of the quarter. [CRU\/CA]  BUMPER BUNKER PROFITS?  Some refiners decided to undergo heavier planned maintenance during the quarter to ready facilities for new low-sulfur marine fuel requirements. The new regulations required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are due to come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020 and could produce bumper profits.  The rules outlaw high-sulfur fuels traditionally used for shipping - a boon for complex refineries that can break down products used by marine vessels into lower-sulfur products with higher margins.  Refiners could now run their plants at higher rates to take advantage of the higher margins, and analysts expect gasoline inventories to climb through the remainder of the year as a result.","35":"HOUSTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Most units were shut on Sunday night and Monday morning at Marathon Petroleum Corp\u2019s 585,000 barrel-per-day Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, as temperatures plunged due to a Arctic cold front reaching the Gulf Coast, said sources familiar with plant operations.

A plunge in global oil prices in April due to the COVID-19 pandemic had hammered refiners, but demand for gasoline and other products is now recovering from the collapse.

Marathon said total costs climbed 22 percent to $21.73 billion in the quarter ended September, partly due to some pension settlement charges.  Marathon and other refiners process heavy crude, sourced from countries like Canada, to make petroleum and fuel.  But heavy crude prices have been driven lower by capacity constraints in Canadian pipelines.  Marathon, the largest U.S. refiner by capacity, said otherwise weak profit margins were buoyed by cheaper Canadian crude, which pushed margins up by 1 percent.  Net income attributable to Marathon fell to $737 million or $1.62 per share in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $903 million or $1.77 per share a year earlier.

The changes were a victory for Elliott Management, DE Shaw and other investors that had sought a shakeup to boost the company\u2019s lagging share price following its troubled 2018 acquisition of rival Andeavor. Still, shares slid 3.4% to $63.95 despite third quarter results that topped analysts\u2019 estimates.  The $23 billion Andeavor deal gave Marathon a coast-to-coast refining network. But its shares fell to a two-year low this summer as investors were disappointed with the deal\u2019s impact on results.  Analysts said they were surprised the company\u2019s shares fell so sharply on Thursday even though results beat forecasts and the company announced the restructuring.  Marathon said Chief Executive Officer Heminger would retire in April. It has begun a search for a new CEO. Heminger has worked for Marathon since the mid-1970s and has been at the helm since 2011. Greg Goff, a top executive and former CEO of Andeavor, also will leave Dec. 31, the company said.  \u201cThis was not a management change by Elliott,\u201d Heminger told Reuters in an interview on Thursday, saying he had agreed to stay on until the next annual meeting to complete its integration of Andeavor.  \u201cMy plan has been that I would work through the annual meeting of 2020. There has been no ousting,\u201d he said, calling the merger one of several \u201ctransformative\u201d events during his tenure.  Billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott, which last month said it owns a 2.5% economic interest in Marathon, has argued a three-way split of the company would boost shareholder value by as much as $40 billion.  As well as spinning off the retail gas station business Speedway, Marathon said it was launching a strategic review of its pipeline and storage operations. The two businesses provide about half of Marathon\u2019s earnings. Speedway will trade as an independent public company after the separation is completed.  Elliott said it supported the moves announced on Thursday, adding it expected these measures would unlock substantial value for shareholders.  Former Andeavor board members Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens, who together own about 1.7% of Marathon, also had backed the proposals and had called for Heminger\u2019s immediate removal. The two declined to comment on Thursday.  \u201cWe see this (spinoff) as unlocking significant value for current MPC shareholders,\u201d analysts at Edward Jones wrote in a note.  Separately, Marathon beat analysts\u2019 estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday, posting adjusted profit of $1.63 per share, compared to analysts\u2019 average estimates of $1.38 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Net income attributable to the company rose 48.6% to $1.10 billion, or $1.67 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. It earned $1.62 a share in the same quarter a year ago.

Several refiners have delayed planned maintenance at their plants this year due to concerns around the spread of the coronavirus among workers, or as part of capital and operational expense cuts.  Contractors that work on a wide range of projects for the refinery were told they would not resume until next year, according to the source. Planned work included maintenance on a crude unit in September, according to Industrial Info Resources (IIR), which tracks refinery work and interruptions.  Marathon declined to comment.  Depending on the size of a project, refinery maintenance can require thousands of contract workers working for several weeks or months to carry out upgrades and maintenance at a plant.  Social distancing guidelines can be difficult to abide by while conducting such work, according to refiners.  The St. Paul Park refinery is operating at lower rates amid reduced demand for refined products resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, according to IIR.  Marathon Petroleum said in May that it would cut capital spending by approximately 30% and expected operating costs to be lower by $950 million.

The securities regulator said on Thursday that Andeavor\u2019s chief executive officer had directed its finance chief to initiate a $250 million stock buyback two days before the two companies were set to resume talks about a potential deal.  Andeavor\u2019s internal accounting controls failed to make sure the buyback adhered to a company policy prohibiting repurchases while it held material non-public information, the order said.  The refiner repurchased 2.6 million shares of its stock from investors at an average price of $97 per share in February and March of 2018, a month after which the two companies agreed to a deal valuing Andeavor at more than $150 per share.  Andeavor\u2019s parent Marathon Petroleum did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","59":"(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.N agreed to buy rival Andeavor ANDV.N for more than $23 billion in a deal creating one of the largest global refiners that will benefit from access to booming U.S. shale fields and growing U.S. fuel export markets.  The United States has become the world\u2019s top fuel exporter, shipping more than 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline and diesel. Refiners have capitalized on booming output from shale fields in Texas and North Dakota and are building out export terminals and processing facilities.  Buying Andeavor gives Marathon more exposure to the booming U.S. shale oil sector, thanks to Andeavor\u2019s logistics and terminal operations in Texas and North Dakota shale regions. Rising output from the Permian Basin, the largest oilfield in the United States, has driven the nation\u2019s crude production to an all-time record above 10.5 million bpd.  \u201cThe combination of the two companies allows us to go after and find ways to create a bigger presence in the Permian,\u201d said Marathon Chief Executive Gary Heminger, who will lead the combined companies.  The company would be able to process 3.1 million bpd of crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. Its capacity would be the sixth largest globally, behind China's Sinopec 600028.SS, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, PetroChina, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Aramco, according to consultancy IHSMarkit.  U.S. motorists consume more fuel than any other country in the world and overall demand nationwide hit a record 9.3 million bpd in 2017.  Operations that have capacity to refine light crude produced in shale fields such as Andeavor will be better positioned to take advantage of the production boom. Both North Dakota\u2019s Bakken and Texas shale regions primarily produce light, sweet crude oil.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  The deal also gives Marathon a line into fast-growing Mexican fuel markets. Andeavor is expanding its network of filling stations in the country. Mexico\u2019s dilapidated refineries cannot meet the growing population\u2019s demand for gasoline and other products.  U.S. fuel exports to Mexico rose to 1.4 million bpd as of January, up more than 85 percent from two years ago.  The deal values Andeavor, formerly known as Tesoro, at about $152 per share, or about 24 percent more than Friday\u2019s closing price of $122.38.  \u201cWe view this as pretty full value for Andeavor,\u201d Scotia Howard Weil analysts said in a note. \u201cNot many saw this one coming.\u201d  MARATHON SHARES DOWN, ANDEAVOR UP  Shares of Ohio-based Marathon lost $6.52, or 8 percent, to close at $74.91 a share. It also missed Wall Street forecasts for quarterly profit by a wide margin on Monday as expenses rose.  Slideshow ( 3 images )  Shares of Andeavor, based in San Antonio, closed up 13 percent at $138.32.  Including Andeavor\u2019s debt, Marathon is paying $35.6 billion to hold 66 percent of a combined company worth some $58 billion at Friday\u2019s close.  Andeavor operates 10 refineries in the United States, largely in the western part of the country. It has pipeline, trucking and terminal operations in the Permian and in the Bakken region, the second-most prolific state for oil production in the country after Texas. (To see an image from the companies, click here: reut.rs\/2JFgc58)  \u201cThis creates one coast-to-coast, border-to-border refining and marketing company that seems well balanced with a pretty broad footprint,\u201d said Garfield Miller, CEO of Aegis Energy Advisors.  Marathon\u2019s six refineries are largely in the Midwest, with one in Texas City, Texas. The Midwest region has reduced its reliance on crude oil from the Gulf Coast in recent years, pulling more of its barrels from Canada and North Dakota. Now, it is producing more products than it needs and has looked to export markets for additional opportunity.  Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said they expected the location of the two companies\u2019 operations to allow them to avoid antitrust hurdles.  Combining the companies\u2019 logistics subsidiaries will not happen immediately, Marathon CEO Gary Heminger said on a conference call following the transaction. He referred to that combination as a \u201cday two issue.\u201d  Andeavor is expanding a retail network of motor fuel stations in the Mexican states of Baja California and Sonora under its ARCO brand.  U.S. Gulf Coast refiners are becoming more integrated in the region\u2019s energy industry, filling shortages created by underinvestment in refining across Latin America.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question the new company has greater resource capability going forward into Mexico,\u201d Andeavor CEO Gregory Goff said on a conference call with analysts.  The deal, which is expected to close in the second half of this year, could spur other North American refiners to look harder at acquisitions, said IHSMarkit refining and marketing director Rob Smith.  \u201cThis may end up being the biggest of the bunch,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut it would not be surprising to see other mid-tier companies merge.\u201d","60":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three key U.S. House of Representatives Democrats on Wednesday asked Marathon Petroleum Corp to disclose any communications between the White House and federal agencies on the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026.

REUTERS\/Julio-Cesar Chavez  At its refineries in the U.S. Midwest, Marathon has been processing large amounts of Canadian crude, which has turned cheaper relative to the benchmark West Texas Intermediate  because of transport bottlenecks and a storage glut in Canada.  Refiners such as Marathon process crude into diesel, gasoline and other products. Some of them faced here challenges after the United States imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA.  In November, Marathon Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said the company was importing more than 500,000 barrels per day of Canadian crude.  On Thursday, the Findlay, Ohio-based company said refining and marketing margin per barrel of oil jumped about 15 percent in the fourth quarter. Crude oil throughput rose to about 3 million barrels per day from 1.84 million barrels last year, helped by its acquisition of Andeavor.  Marathon agreed to buy Andeavor for more than $23 billion last year, to become one of the world\u2019s largest refiners. The deal was closed in October.  \u201cWe have realized $160 million of synergies in just three months and continue to expect total annual gross run-rate synergies of up to $600 million at year-end 2019,\u201d CEO Heminger said in a statement.

Net income attributable to Marathon fell to $951 million, or $1.38 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.02 billion, or $4.13 per share, a year earlier.  In the year-ago quarter, the company recorded a $1.5 billion gain related to the U.S. tax overhaul.  Total revenue rose to $32.54 billion from $21.24 billion.

U.S. gasoline futures are down 26% from a year ago and oil is trading down a third from where it began the year.  Marathon will incur an up to $175 million charge to third quarter earnings for the 2,050 job cuts, it reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. About 20% of the charge will be recouped from its publicly traded pipeline unit, the company said.  The Findlay, Ohio, firm disclosed the workforce cuts after Reuters on Tuesday reported employees across the company had been notified of impending layoffs.  The cuts includes staff at its Martinez, California, and Gallup, New Mexico refineries, which in July were designated to close. The shutdowns and job cuts will lower overall costs beginning next year, Marathon said in a statement.  Employees of its retail gasoline business are not included in the 12% reduction. Marathon in August agreed to sell its Speedway unit to Japan's Seven & i Holdings Co Ltd 3382.T, a deal expected to close next year.  Red ink and job cuts are expected across the oil industry as results start rolling out next month. U.S. refiners typically gear up for winter heating oil demand after summer driving season ends. This year, heating oil and gasoline consumption are both depressed.  \u201cThe pandemic has resulted in near-record lows on diesel margins, the go-to product for refineries as we enter into the winter heating season,\u201d said Andrew Lipow, president of consultancy Lipow Oil Associates.  \u201cThe glut in refining capacity has forced these downstream companies into layoffs,\u201d he said.

Workers were also notified of 108 job cuts at Marathon\u2019s largest plant, the 585,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Galveston Bay Refinery, in Texas City, Texas. The total there may reach more than 200, the people said.  This month, Royal Dutch Shell and LyondellBasell Industries both announced 10% workforce cuts. Top U.S. oil companies Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N are also in the process of restructuring their businesses to halt losses.  Shell on Tuesday disclosed its refineries ran at between 64% and 68% of their capacity in the quarter ending today, a very low rate.  Marathon is expected to report a $623-million third-quarter loss on Nov. 2, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It lost $9.2 billion in the first half of the year, mostly on impairment charges.

The company did not provide further comment on the likely duration of the idle, but said it intends to return the plant to normal operations once demand levels support doing so.  The Martinez plant is the second in the United States and third in North America to temporarily cease operations in response to the plummeting demand for products such as gasoline and jet fuel amid severe travel restrictions in place to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.  Marathon previously announced it would idle its 26,000 bpd refinery in Gallup, New Mexico.  North Atlantic Refining has also idled its 130,000 bpd refinery in Come-by-Chance, Canada.  U.S. demand for gasoline has fallen by about a third due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended daily life and prompted stay-at-home orders for most of the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  As a result, refiners have slashed output and seen gasoline profit margins fall to the lowest since 2008.","76":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp shut the hydrocracker (HCU) and alkylation unit at its 585,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, by Thursday as part of a multi-unit overhaul that began on Saturday, said sources familiar with plant operations.  Marathon spokesman Sid Barth declined to comment.

The first shutdowns began on Saturday.  The overhaul is expected to be completed as early as mid-July but may extend through Aug. 1. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overhaul has twice been delayed from an initial start date scheduled in late March.  Hydrocrackers use a catalyst under high heat and pressure in the presence of hydrogen to produce diesel from gas oil along with other motor fuels. Alkylation units convert refining byproducts into octane-boosting components added to gasoline.  Reformers also convert refining byproducts into components used to boost octane in gasoline through a different process from that in reformers. Hydrotreaters use hydrogen to reduce sulfur in motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental rules.","77":"(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp, the second-biggest refining company in the United States, has asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a hardship waiver exempting one of its facilities from the nation\u2019s biofuels law, two sources with knowledge of the application told Reuters.  The request comes as the EPA expands its use of biofuel waivers in a way that has reduced regulatory costs for the oil industry by hundreds of millions of dollars in recent months, but which has also infuriated the powerful corn lobby.  EPA has authority to grant waivers freeing small refineries from their obligation to mix biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) if they can prove complying would cause them \u201cdisproportionate economic hardship.\u201d  The waivers can save individual facilities tens of millions of dollars in regulatory costs, adding to a company\u2019s bottom line.  Ohio-based Marathon made the waiver application for one of its facilities for the 2017 calendar year, according to the sources, who asked not to be named. The sources did not specify which facility the waiver would cover and did not know whether EPA had made a decision.  Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry declined to comment and EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox did not respond to requests for comment.  Marathon\u2019s smallest refinery is a 93,000 barrel per day plant in Canton, Ohio. While that plant has a nameplate capacity above the 75,000 bpd threshold that EPA uses for \u201csmall refineries,\u201d the facility could meet the criteria by operating at reduced rates. Refineries typically bring down units at least once a year for maintenance work, limiting production.  It is also possible that Marathon made the request for a portion of one of its larger refining complexes, such as its Galveston Bay refinery in Texas, arguing that certain parts of the complex operate distinctly.  EXPANDED PROGRAM  An EPA source said earlier this year that the agency has granted more than two dozen small refinery waivers for 2017 in recent months, a level that former officials say is about triple the number given each year under previous administrations.  The expanded use of biofuel waivers under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been a flashpoint between the oil and corn industries. While refining industry representatives have said EPA is required to provide such exemptions to qualifying facilities, corn-state Republicans have said the program is being abused in a way that hurts corn farmers.  Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said in an emailed statement that the move was a sign of \u201chow broken this process is.\u201d  \u201cNOTE TO EPA definition of hardship: a condition that is difficult to endure, suffering, deprivation, oppression,\u201d Grassley said separately on Twitter. \u201cSurely Marathon doesn\u2019t qualify for a waiver They had a net income of $3.4B in 2017 BILLIONS IN PROFITS ISNT HARDSHIP.\u201d  He and other lawmakers have pressed the EPA to curb the exemptions and to name the companies that have received them.  EPA does not reveal the names of waiver applicants or recipients - arguing the information is confidential.  Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that large U.S. refiner Andeavor and billionaire Carl Icahn\u2019s CVR Energy were among the companies that had been granted waivers recently \u2013 showing EPA is willing to award exemptions to plants owned by big, profitable companies.  Andeavor, which recorded net profits of $1.4 billion in 2017, said this month it saved $100 million in costs from waivers.  Majors Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp have also asked for relief for smaller units, according to sources, though it is unclear if their requests were granted.  Marathon, which owns six refineries and sells gasoline through independent retailers and its Speedway unit, booked net income of $3.4 billion in 2017. It recently announced it is buying Andeavor in a $23.3 billion deal that would make it the nation\u2019s largest refiner.  \u201cThis is the theater of the absurd. Marathon wants a small refinery hardship waiver at the very moment it is seeking to become the nation\u2019s largest refiner,\u201d Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said.  \u201cThe federal government should be protecting consumers by scrutinizing mergers like this instead of handing out dividends to multibillion dollar oil companies seeking to monopolize critical energy sectors.\u201d  Prices of the biofuel blending credits that refiners need to prove compliance with the RFS, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), have fallen to five-year lows in recent weeks as the increase in hardship waivers has turned traditional buyers of credits into sellers.  Marathon has long called for a legislative overhaul of the RFS to ease the burden on refiners but began investing years ago in terminal blending capacity to help curb its RIN expenses.  Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President Timothy Griffith in April 2017 told investors and analysts on a conference call that the costs associated with the RFS are \u201cincorporated into our trading and pricing decision and ultimately recovered and passed on to consumers.\u201d","78":"FILE PHOTO: Cars drive past the Marathon Petroleum refinery in Carson, California, U.S., December 5, 2019. REUTERS\/Mike Blake  HOUSTON (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.N, the largest U.S. oil refiner, warned on Wednesday of a first-quarter loss on a roughly $7.8 billion write-down from a sharp fall in fuel demand.  Stay-at-home orders designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic have decimated travel and forced businesses to shut down, cutting worldwide demand for oil by a third, or about 30 million barrels a day. In the United States, gasoline demand has dropped by half.  Other top oil refiners including Exxon Mobil, XOM.N Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Valero Energy VLO.N have cut output by as much as a third, halted new projects and sent contract workers home to avoid illnesses and reduce operating costs.  Marathon forecast a loss before charges of up to $250 million for the quarter ended March 31, in a regulatory filing here. The company is scheduled to report results on May 5.  Lower fuels prices have sharply cut the value of Marathon\u2019s stocks and it forecast inventory adjustments of up to $3.3 billion in the quarter. It said non-cash impairments to investments could reach up to $1.4 billion.  Marathon has deferred spending and tax payments for the first quarter, halted share repurchases and added to its financial reserves. To bolster its finances, Marathon said it has drawn on a $3.5 billion credit facility and plans to seek a one-year, $1 billion loan.  Its shares closed up 4% to $24.69 on Wednesday, before Marathon released its warning. In after-hours trade the shares were up 12 cents to $24.18.  Two years ago, Marathon acquired rival Andeavor, bringing its total processing capacity to about 3.1 million barrels per day. But its business has struggled and the company recently shook up top management and pledged to spin off its Speedway retail gasoline business.  Rival Valero Energy earlier this month warned of an up to $2.1 billion first quarter loss and withdrew its full-year outlook, citing business losses from coronavirus.","79":"(Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp will release earnings on Thursday at a time when activist investors are pressuring company executives to make major changes, including potentially spinning off its retail gasoline unit that enjoyed strong margins in the most recent quarter.  It has been 13 months since Marathon closed its $23 billion purchase of Andeavor Corp that gave it a presence across the entire United States, making it the second-largest independent refiner by market value after Phillips 66.  Now, activist investors, including Elliott Management Corp, have called for asset sales and corporate changes, including the potential removal of current chief executive Gary Heminger. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the company\u2019s board may try to appoint a new CEO to appease Elliott. Reuters has not independently confirmed that.  When Marathon executives speak on an analyst call on Thursday, they are expected to address Elliott\u2019s claim that the refiner could unlock up to $40 billion in shareholder value.  The company is expected to report earnings of $1.38 per share according to analysts polled by Reuters. The Refinitiv Eikon SmartEstimate, which weighs analysts with a higher degree of accuracy, forecasts earnings of $1.33 a share.  Analysts expect Marathon to report a strong retail performance after peer refiner Phillips 66 beat analysts estimates last week because of stronger retail fuel margins.

The Nikkei newspaper, which first reported the news, said the company decided to pull the plug on the deal over worries on price. It also cited growing concerns about a global economic slowdown from the coronavirus.

Hennigan replaces company veteran Gary Heminger, whose departure was announced in October when the largest U.S. independent refiner launched a sweeping restructuring that included a strategic review of the midstream business MPLX LP and the spinoff of its Speedway retail operation.  Billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott had last year renewed its demand for Marathon to split its business into three separate companies, saying that would boost shareholder value by as much as $40 billion.  The hedge fund, later joined by other shareholders, also demanded the ouster of Heminger.  Marathon said separating the unit would have been cash-flow negative to it and would have taken up about $11 billion to $15 billion of resources that could instead be returned to shareholders.  Analysts at Credit Suisse said Hennigan\u2019s appointment could have been the influential factor that made Marathon decide against a \u2018transaction-oriented\u2019 conclusion of the review.  They added that the decision was the best outcome for MPLX as other alternatives would have been dilutive to its shareholders.  Reuters reported last week that Marathon was considering a sale of MPLX\u2019s gathering and processing (G&P) business, worth as much as $15 billion of MPLX LP, looking for a cash boost as the coronavirus outbreak and lower oil prices weighed on its prospects.  Hennigan will take over immediately, the company said.  Earlier this month, there were reports that 7-Eleven franchise owner Seven & i Holdings had abandoned the idea of buying Speedway after balking at the $22 billion price tag that Marathon set for it. The company\u2019s shares were down over 8.8% in early trading on Wednesday amid a broader decline in oil and gas stocks as U.S. crude hit an 18-year low. [O\/R]","91":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.N plans to \"maximize\" input of U.S. crude in the third quarter, taking advantage of bottlenecks in key shale plays that have weakened domestic prices.  The company said on a Thursday earnings call that about 32 percent of its total throughput of 1.95 million barrels per day will be crude linked to the U.S. benchmark price, up from 23 percent during the same stretch last year.  Input of U.S. crude at the company\u2019s Midwest refineries is expected to jump to 53 percent of total throughput in the third quarter, up from 38 percent last year.  U.S. and Canadian producers have been forced to sell crude at a discount versus global prices as production has outpaced pipeline capacity.  The wide differentials helped Marathon and other refiners report strong second-quarter earnings.  Marathon reported $2.24 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), the highest quarterly number since the company went public in 2011, according to Chief Executive Gary Heminger.  The U.S. refining outlook will remain strong in the upcoming quarters as North American crudes will remain discounted and planned turnarounds at U.S. refineries will help keep gasoline inventories from climbing and distillate inventories low, Heminger said.  \u201cI think inventories are going to remain for both gasoline and distillate, inventories are going to remain in check through the year, which bodes very well for the business. But as we look into 2019 and where we believe inventories will end up at the balance of this year, it should put us in a really good position moving into \u201819 as well,\u201d Heminger said.  Gasoline inventories are just below the five-year high, while distillates sit below five-year highs, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Marathon reported that store gasoline sales declined by 1.8 percent in the second quarter, but Heminger said that was because crude prices drove up prices at the gasoline pump.  \u201cI am not alarmed at all,\u201d he said.","92":"March 2 (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp:  * MARATHON PETROLEUM CORP SAYS CHAIRMAN AND CEO GARY HEMINGER'S FY 2017 TOTAL COMPENSATION WAS $19.7 MILLION VERSUS $16.6 MILLION IN FY 2016 - SEC FILING Source text: (bit.ly\/2CVj6im) Further company coverage:","93":"Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp on Thursday posted a 53 percent fall in quarterly profit compared with a year earlier, when it recorded a $1.5 billion gain related to the U.S. tax overhaul.

The 140,000-bpd gasoline-producing Fluidic Catalytic Cracking Unit 3 (FCCU 3) was shut on June 29 to repair a leak, the sources said.  The refinery\u2019s 65,000 bpd reformer, called Ultraformer 4, is also shut down, according to the sources.  A Marathon spokesman was not immediately available to discuss operations at the refinery, which is the second-largest in the United States and the largest the company owns.  To repair the sour water stripper, which removes ammonia and hydrogen sulfide discharged by FCCU 3, Marathon may have to rebuild a needed transformer, which could take eight weeks, the sources said. If a replacement can be purchased, the repairs may only last two weeks.  \u201cIf they find one they can buy, it will be about two weeks before they can start again,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201cThe transformer they need is hard to get.\u201d  FCCU 3 was originally shut on June 29 to repair a leak in the regenerator section of the unit.  FCCUs are divided into two sections. In the reactor section, the fine powder catalyst mixes with gas oil under high heat and pressure to convert the gas oil into unfinished gasoline.  The catalyst then goes to the regenerator section to have excess carbon removed so it can be recycled into the reactor.  When FCCU 3 was shut in late June the key naphtha desulfurization unit (NDU) was also shut. The NDU, which removes sulfur in compliance with U.S. environmental rules, has restarted.  The reformer converts low-octane naphthas into octane-boosting components blended into gasoline.","95":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A crude distillation unit remained idle at Marathon Petroleum Corp\u2019s 585,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, on Friday for an inspection as part of a preventative maintenance program, a source familiar with plant operations said.  The 225,000-bpd Pipestill 3B CDU was temporarily idled on Tuesday for the inspection and is expected to return to production sometime next week, the source said.  Marathon did not reply to a request for comment on Friday afternoon.  The two 225,000-bpd large CDUs at the Galveston Bay Refinery convert crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks that go to production units to be made into motor fuels and petrochemicals.","96":"(Reuters) - U.S. oil refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.N missed Wall Street forecasts for quarterly profit by a wide margin on Monday, as its expenses surged during a period of increased refining activity.  The results came hours after Marathon announced a $23 billion deal to buy rival Andeavor ANDV.N, an acquisition that will see the company leapfrog Valero Energy VLO.N as the largest U.S. refiner by capacity.  Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon has seen expenses surge, as it ramps up refining activity to meet rising demand following record levels of U.S. crude oil production.  Marathon, which said it would save $1 billion in costs each year after closing the Andeavor deal, reported expenses of $18.54 billion in the three months ended March 31, up 15 percent from a year earlier.  The company\u2019s shares fell 5.2 percent to $77.19 in premarket trading on Monday.  Net income attributable to Marathon rose about 23 percent to $37 million in the first quarter.  Excluding one-time items, Marathon earned 4 cents per share, falling short of analysts\u2019 average estimate of 15 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company, which also operates convenience store chain Speedway, said revenue jumped 16 percent to $18.98 billion, led by higher refining and marketing margins.","97":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) laws are not working and there is an \u201copportunity for a reset\u201d of the standard in Washington, Marathon Petroleum Corp Chief Executive Gary Heminger said on Tuesday.  A fuel pump at a gas station in Des Moines advertises E85 ethanol fuel, December 6, 2007. REUTERS\/Jason Reed  The RFS requires refineries to blend fuels with ethanol to reduce pollution, or pay for credits to subsidize those that do that blending.  Heminger, who leads the largest U.S. crude oil refiner, said that the standard has caused very volatile prices for those credits, and that it needs reform.  The Trump Administration has attempted to reform the standard, but has maintained much of the existing framework of the law due to support from corn producers in Iowa and other farming states.  Heminger said U.S. refiners already rely on ethanol to boost octane in gasoline.  \u201cWe need the octane,\u201d he said. \u201cEthanol is a great source of octane. Ethanol shouldn\u2019t be mandated.\u201d  Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, Heminger said the switch to ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for ships scheduled for Jan. 1, 2020 would not be a shock to the global oil refining industry.  Heminger said he expected U.S. refiners would begin building an inventory of the new maritime diesel fuel by the middle of 2019 to prepare for the change in marine fuel mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).  \u201cWe\u2019re compliant,\u201d Heminger said of the U.S. refining industry. \u201cThe global refining industry is ready to meet demand\u201d for IMO.  The IMO 2020 fuel will drop sulfur content from no more than 3.5 percent to no more than 0.5 percent.  Marathon became the largest U.S. refiner in October when it merged with Andeavor creating a company with 3 million barrels per day of crude oil processing capacity.  \u201cI would expect there would be some consolidation in the industry, Heminger said.  The biggest question is what will happen to the three refineries owned by Citgo Petroleum Corp, a subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s troubled national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), he said.  Marathon has no interest in acquiring the Citgo refineries, Heminger said.  The company does expect to successfully conclude contract talks with workers at its Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, which was the site of a bitter five-month strike in 2015.  \u201cThat\u2019s a great workforce\u201d he said.","98":"May 5 (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp is operating refineries at minimum rates but sees signs of recovery in demand for gasoline amid the coronavirus crisis, executives said on Tuesday.  On the West Coast, the largest U.S. oil refiner is running plants at about 50% capacity, compared with an average of 66% to 67% overall.  \u201cThe West Coast demand drop was even more severe than the whole national average,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mike Hennigan said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Gasoline demand bottomed out after falling by more than 50% in mid- to late March, but has recovered by 5% to 15% since mid-April, dependent on the region, according to Speedway President Tim Griffith.  Griffith noted a clearer understanding of the demand environment is still a few months away and contingent upon consumer sentiment and the lifting of stay-at-home orders.  \u201cWe\u2019re still oversupplied on pretty much crude and products across the board,\u201d said Hennigan.  Executives said the company would not bring its idled Gallup, New Mexico, and Martinez, California, refineries back online until \u201cthe market requires it\u201d but noted that the refineries are expected to come back online by the end of the year.  Net loss attributable to Marathon was $9.2 billion, or $14.25 per share, in the first quarter, as it booked $12.4 billion in charges related to inventory writedowns and goodwill impairment.  The U.S. refiner cut spending by 30% and detailed other measures to reduce costs, as widespread lockdowns to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic pummel demand for oil and gas.

Major independent refiners cut production dramatically during the quarter, with some electing to undergo maintenance rather than produce barrels at a time when gasoline margins slumped.  Several major U.S. refiners, including Valero Energy Corp , HollyFrontier Corp, and Marathon Petroleum Corp , are all expected to fall short of consensus estimates when they report results, according to Refinitiv Eikon\u2019s SmartEstimate model, which values more recent revisions from higher-ranked analysts.  However, reduced refining output in the early part of the year sets up the industry for a potential rebound as the critical summer months approach. With gasoline stockpiles at a four-year low on a seasonal basis, margins have rebounded in anticipation of driving season.  U.S. refinery utilization dropped to 87.5 percent in early April, the lowest seasonally since 2014. Refiners had been running full-tilt for much of 2018, encouraged by strong demand for distillates. But in the process, they overproduced gasoline, tanking margins for the fuel along the way.  Those margins fell to $3.64 a gallon in January, the lowest since 2009. They have since recovered, and were at about $23.00 a gallon on Monday, as inventories have fallen to about 228 million barrels from almost 260 million barrels in mid-January. (GRAPHIC: Gasoline stocks fall as refinery runs drop tmsnrt.rs\/2Iafyjp.)  Refiner earnings kick off this week with Valero on Friday. Since the beginning of April, analysts, on average, have revised projections for refiners lower by more than 5 percent, according to Refinitiv data.  Analysts have sharply lowered estimates for Valero, Marathon and HollyFrontier, along with PBF Energy and Phillips 66 , in the past month, putting them in the bottom quartile among U.S. companies in terms of revisions, according to Refinitiv data.  On top of heavy maintenance, fires broke out at facilities over the last few months, including at Valero\u2019s Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, Exxon Mobil Corp\u2019s Baytown, Texas, refinery and HollyFrontier\u2019s El Dorado, Kansas, refinery.  HollyFrontier lowered the amount of crude it expected to process in the first quarter by 5,000 bpd. Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the company\u2019s outlook last week on concerns that profits would take a hit after Canadian crude differentials collapsed.  Sandy Fielden, director of commodities and energy research at Morningstar, said PBF also lost out because of \u201cthe Canadian crude discount just disappearing.\u201d  Canadian crude oil had been heavily discounted due to oversupply and lack of pipelines, but that discount eroded after the province of Alberta instituted production cuts. Western Canada Select (WCS) recently has traded around $9.25 a barrel under U.S. crude, compared with $15.65 at the beginning of the quarter.  BUMPER BUNKER PROFITS?  Some refiners decided to undergo heavier planned maintenance during the quarter to ready facilities for new low-sulfur marine fuel requirements. The new regulations required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are due to come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020 and could produce bumper profits.  The rules outlaw high-sulfur fuels traditionally used for shipping - a boon for complex refineries that can break down products used by marine vessels into lower-sulfur products with higher margins.  Refiners could now run their plants at higher rates to take advantage of the higher margins, and analysts expect gasoline inventories to climb through the remainder of the year as a result.","105":"March 15 (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp:  * MARATHON PETROLEUM CORP SAYS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER GARY HEMINGER'S FY 2017 TOTAL COMPENSATION $19.7 MILLION VERSUS $16.6 MILLION - SEC FILING Source text (bit.ly\/2DuRnFA) Further company coverage: (Reuters.Brief@thomsonreuters.com)","106":"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp may restart the main gasoline-producing unit at its 585,000 barrel-per-day Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, without a transformer that could take two months to repair, sources familiar with plant operations said on Friday.
