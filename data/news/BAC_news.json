REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced the settlement on Friday, and called the fine the largest collected by the state to resolve an electronic trading probe.  The attorney general said Bank of America Merrill Lynch had undisclosed agreements with several electronic trading firms from March 2008 to May 2013 to handle client trades.  He said the bank told clients it was processing the trades in-house, even going so far as to alter trade confirmations, as part of an effort to make its electronic trading services appear safer and more sophisticated than they were.  Schneiderman said the \u201cmasking\u201d scheme affected more than 16 million trade orders and 4 billion shares, benefiting such firms as Madoff Securities, Citadel Securities, D.E. Shaw, Knight Capital and Two Sigma Securities.  The bank also admitted to having told traders in its \u201cdark pool,\u201d a private venue where they expected protection from high-speed traders, that up to 30 percent of orders came from retail traders, when the percentage was closer to 5 percent.  \u201cBank of America Merrill Lynch went to astonishing lengths to defraud its own institutional clients about who was seeing and filling their orders, who was trading in its dark pool, and the capabilities of its electronic trading services,\u201d Schneiderman said in a statement.

About five years ago, we addressed the issues concerning communicating to clients about where their trades were executed.\u201d  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank also admitted that its masking activity violated New York\u2019s powerful securities fraud law, the Martin Act.

While most of corporate America has been forced to dramatically scale back operations due to the quickly spreading coronavirus outbreak, banks have been under pressure to keep critical infrastructure like ATMs, branches and trading floors open for business and to offer relief for customers adversely affected by the crisis.  Bank of America announced several relief measures for small businesses and consumers, including deferred payments on credit cards, auto loans and mortgages as well as refunds for checking account fees.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  LONDON (Reuters) - Leading emerging countries have burned through $240 billion in foreign exchange reserves over the past two months, Bank of America said on Monday, as central banks look to prop up their currencies and economies in the face of COVID-19.  The drain was likely to continue albeit at a slower pace, Bank of America added in a note citing reserves data for 31 states.  China, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Turkey had all seen the biggest total drop in reserves, the bank said.  Turkey and Egypt had seen particularly large percentage declines, it added. Turkey and Romania also stood out as their official reserves did not fully cover short-term external debt over 12 months, the note said.  \u201cThe drain of [EM] reserves is likely to continue, though more slowly, during what looks to be a disappointing recovery in global and EM growth,\u201d David Hauner at BofA wrote in the note.  \u201cAfter an initial bounce in activity after the opening of lockdowns, several factors are likely to restrain the recovery: high debt, corporate defaults, inefficient labour markets, de-globalisation and China-U.S. tensions.\u201d  The bank said that it was remarkable how little some other emerging market countries, including Russia, had spent of their reserves in percentage terms.  Instead, it added, they had built up credibility by allowing their currencies to adjust without much intervention, and had instead focused on cutting interest rates and in many cases buying government bonds.  Russia\u2019s central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Friday the bank will consider cutting its key rate by 100 basis points in June, opening the door for a bigger cut than the market had expected.","6":"(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp BAC.N reported a 48.5% drop in first-quarter net income on Wednesday, warning that it anticipated a recession because of the novel coronavirus and setting aside an additional $3.6 billion to cover potential losses.

Other major lenders, including JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, also bulked up reserves to absorb potential losses.  Including BofA\u2019s reserve build of $3.6 billion, the top four U.S. lenders have set aside a combined $14.2 billion in loan loss provisions. BofA\u2019s total provisions is more than three times its actual first-quarter loan losses of $1.1 billion.  In recent days, amid signs that the spread of coronavirus may be peaking in some areas, governments have started examining when and how they should re-open the economy. Investors and economists are also debating what an eventual recovery would look like.  In a call with analysts, Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the bank was still waiting for signs that the situation was stabilizing.  The bank had seen lower demand for loans from businesses such as credit cards and mortgages through the first two weeks of April compared with the levels in February, before the coronavirus crisis hit United States with full force, Moynihan said.  \u201cWe\u2019re watching to see these stabilize at some level of activity,\u201d Moynihan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll keep watching that as states, cities and the federal government focuses on reopening the economy.\u201d  CFO Donofrio, however, said a rush by companies to get loans as they worried about their ability to meet immediate cash needs like payrolls had peaked in March and returned to normal levels in the first week of April.  Bank of America said it extend an additional $57 billion in loans, or a 6% increase during the quarter.  Overall, net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $3.54 billion, or 40 cents per share, in the first quarter, coming in below the 46 cents per share predicted by analysts, according to Refinitiv data.  Net interest income declined 2% to $12.1 billion, as interest rates fell.  Sales and trading revenue, excluding certain valuation adjustments, increased 22% to $4.3 billion, with higher revenues in both fixed income and equities. The bank said it increased its global markets balance sheet by $130 billion in early March compared with the year-end to help manage record-breaking market activity.  Bank of America, which was the first major bank to participate in the U.S. Treasury\u2019s $349-billion small business rescue program, said it started accepting applications within hours of the official launch.  The bank\u2019s wealth management arm shifted about 700 advisers to field client inquiries about the U.S. government\u2019s $2.3 trillion economic stimulus package.

The move is one of the most senior Brexit staff redeployments to date by a major bank, and reflects a renewed sense of action among institutions keen to protect their businesses from a possible Brexit shock.  International banks which built up London operations over the past few years are now scrambling to beef up EU outposts to overcome the loss of passporting rights which enable them to offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states with just one local licence.  U.S. banks have said London would almost certainly remain their primary hub in Europe irrespective of Brexit, citing a broader pool of talent, a more suitable legal and regulatory framework and an Anglo-Saxon workplace culture as factors giving the British capital an edge.  But they have also said relocation and hiring decisions were subject to change, depending on the shape of any financial services deal between Britain and Brussels.  In preparation, Bank of America is merging its London-based subsidiary with its Dublin-based Irish entity, which will become its main EU base.  It has already said it would expand its investment banking activities in Paris and transfer some of its London-based back office operations to Dublin, ahead of Brexit.  Reuters earlier reported that up to 400 jobs in Bank of America\u2019s markets, trading, sales and fixed income teams would move from London to the EU in a first wave of transfers next year, citing two sources familiar with the bank\u2019s Brexit plans.

FILE PHOTO: The Citigroup Inc (Citi) logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. Picture taken October 19, 2017. REUTERS\/Chris Helgren  Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of America Corp all reported declines in fourth-quarter revenue from their key fixed income, commodity and currency trading arms, although overall results at most were cushioned by improving loan growth and net interest margins.  The final months of 2018 were dominated by investor worries about slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute and were further aggravated by concerns that the Fed might be pushing interest rates too high. The resulting volatility in equity, bond and commodity markets sent many investors to the sidelines, pushing down bond trading volume and hurting the value of credit market assets sitting on banks\u2019 own books.  \u201cYou had a one-two punch of market losses on inventory along with a lot of bank clients stepping back from market because you couldn\u2019t have much of an opinion given the uncertainty,\u201d said Jeffery Harte, bank analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners.  Credit spreads, the measure of additional compensation investors demand for owning riskier corporate securities over safer U.S. Treasuries, widened in the fourth quarter by the most in more than seven years both for investment-grade and high-yield, or junk, bonds, according to ICE BofAML index data.  Moreover, corporate bond issuance largely dried up, slicing into underwriting fees.  As quarterly results spilled out this week, it became clear that it all added up to a sizable hit for Wall Street\u2019s biggest players.  Bank of America said fixed income fees fell 5 percent because of lower debt underwriting and advisory fees, while its adjusted sales and trading revenue fell 6 percent, with a 15 percent fall in bond trading. Goldman Sachs\u2019 bond trading revenue slid 18 percent to $822 million, far from its peak of more than $6 billion.  In both cases, a big surge in equity trading volumes during the quarter helped offset those losses.  But JPMorgan missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as its bond trading revenue slump overpowered strong consumer loan growth.  At Citigroup, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said for much of the quarter corporate and investor clients \u201cremained on the sidelines, waiting for some clearer market conditions.\u201d Citi reported a 21 percent fall in revenue in its markets and securities business for the quarter.  After being slow to address the spasms in financial markets, Fed officials in recent weeks have said they are mindful of how such moves have tightened financial conditions. The Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018, but since the start of this year a chorus of Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have come out to pledge that they will take it slow from here.  That dovish tone has investors in a better mood so far in the first quarter.  The S&P 500 is up more than 11 percent from its Dec. 24 low and junk bonds are enjoying their strongest start to a year in a decade, according to ICE BofAML\u2019s high-yield index.  The S&P bank sector has risen 17.5 percent since its Dec. 24 low, including a 5.6 percent gain since Citigroup kicked off earnings season on Monday.  Even as \u201cthe potential for tape-bombs from trade and political developments still present challenges, the dovish pivot at the Fed has helped calmed markets,\u201d said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for U.S. fixed income strategies at RBC Wealth Management. \u201cThis has contributed to tamping down fixed income volatility, so to me it could be just a matter of one bad month\/quarter.\u201d  But no one is quite ready to dismiss the possibility that the environment could change quickly again for the worse.  \u201cThat could change tomorrow,\u201d said Sandler O\u2019Neill\u2019s Harte. \u201cThat\u2019s the trouble with trading revenues, they\u2019re awfully volatile. But at least today the first quarter is looking a lot better than the fourth.\u201d","15":"(Recasts lead paragraph, adds detail from conference call, stock move and file photos)  Jan 19 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp executives said on Tuesday they were optimistic the bank could return to loan growth this year, after the coronavirus pandemic caused its loan book to shrink on an annual basis for the first time since 2014.  Total loans and leases at the second-largest U.S. bank slid 6% in 2020. Appetite for new loans waned during the pandemic as customers spent less and saved more and large companies relied on capital markets for funds rather than their bank.  But bank executives said on calls they are starting to see signs of a rebound if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to abate.  \u201cWe\u2019re grinding out of this health crisis,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe should be able to grow NII because we are adding deposits and we are adding loans.\u201d  Net interest income (NII) at the bank, a key measure of how much it can make from lending, tumbled 16% in the fourth quarter.  Lower rates meant to prop-up the economy during the pandemic have limited how much banks can charge for their lending services at the same time fiscal stimulus programs and flagging consumer confidence have softened loan demand. As a result Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each posted double-digit overall revenue declines this month.  NII grew slightly from a low point in the third quarter of 2020 and will continue to increase in 2021 with the biggest gains in the last half of the year, Donofrio said.  Megabank peers Wells Fargo and Citigroup said last week NII could decline by 4% due to the rock-bottom interest rates Fed officials have signaled will stay in place throughout the year while JPMorgan predicted modest growth in 2021.  Bolstering the bank\u2019s upbeat view are signs of improving financial health among its customers.  Consumer and small business transaction volume across the second-largest U.S. bank managed to grow 2% in 2020 despite plunging 21% to a record low as the coronavirus gripped the U.S. economy in the spring.  Debit card spending jumped 12% during the quarter as customers who had been spending less amid lockdowns, reopened their wallets over the holidays, the bank said.  Underscoring its confidence in the economy, the bank joined peers JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc in releasing $828 million from its reserves to cover bad loans after adding more than $8 billion through the first three quarters of the year.  Roughly 75% of the reserve release is tied to the bank\u2019s consumer portfolio as customers entered the new year in better-than-expected financial health due to fiscal stimulus. The commercial reserve release was mostly driven by a pullback from industries heavily impacted by the pandemic.  Revenue from its sales and trading business rose 7%, but underperformed peers as its fixed-income trading desk missed estimates.  Net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $5.21 billion, or 59 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $6.75 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of 55 cents per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv, helped by lower credit costs. Shares gained 1.2%.  Separately, the second-largest U.S. bank said its board approved a $3.2-billion share repurchase program in the first quarter.

After the deal closes, Bradesco said its main goal is to provide a wide range of financial services in the United States to Bradesco clients and lure new customers to BAC Florida.  Bradesco Chief Executive Officer Octavio de Lazari said on a call with journalists that the Brazilian bank\u2019s private banking clients have increasingly demanded diversification and greater access to global products.  \u201cThis move underscores our expansion not only in the U.S., but also in Latin America as a whole, as BAC has clients all over the region,\u201d he said. Around 20 percent of BAC Florida\u2019s clients are Brazilian and 9 percent are American.  Still, Lazari said Bradesco is not seeking to build a retail base outside Brazil, but wants to boost its private banking business, which manages nearly $50 billion in assets.  BAC Florida will add 10,000 customers to Bradesco\u2019s 13,000 private banking clients in Brazil.  \u201cThis acquisition is small for Bradesco (less than 1 percent of the bank\u2019s market cap) and tends to help the bank to reduce the gap of its private banking business,\u201d Ita\u00fa BBA said in a note to clients, estimating a 30 basis point impact on capital.

FILE PHOTO: The Bank of America building is shown in Los Angeles, California October 29, 2014. REUTERS\/Mike Blake\/File Photo  Bank of America\u2019s (BofA\u2019s) Asia headcount expansion comes against the backdrop of a subdued recruitment outlook for the broader investment banking business as global lenders grapple with cost pressures and slowing M&A momentum.  A third of BofA\u2019s new hires in Asia will be senior bankers, including managing directors, for its merger and acquisitions advisory and capital markets businesses, mainly in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia, the people told Reuters.  BofA\u2019s hiring tally for the year could change depending on the deals\u2019 momentum, said two of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the plans are still confidential.  A BofA spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment.  Deals involving Asia-Pacific firms worldwide fell in 2019 amid the U.S.-China trade war and tighter regulatory scrutiny. But after a Phase 1 agreement between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, trade tensions have eased, which should bode well for dealmaking.  Bankers see Chinese state-owned companies playing a major role in dealmaking in 2020, and expect large floats including a potential listing of Ant Financial, an Alibaba BABA.N9988.HK affiliate, to buoy capital markets activity.  With the renewed focus on investment banking, BofA is aiming to break into the top four of Asian investment banking advisory league tables in the next few years, the people said.  \u201cThe bank\u2019s coverage footprint (in Asia Pacific) is smaller than bigger rivals,\u201d one of the three people said, adding BofA\u2019s hiring has to increase to reduce the gap in coverage of industrial sectors and clients in the region.  BofA is the second largest bank in the United States, with consumer banking its biggest business.  INVESTMENT BANKING FOCUS  BofA\u2019s recruitment drive for the investment banking unit comes as it struggles with falling market share and revenue, as well as a string of departures of senior leaders in the United States and Asia in the recent past.  The Wall Street bank promoted its Asia Pacific president Matthew Koder to global head of corporate and investment banking in late 2018 and tasked him with revitalizing its corporate and investment banking business.  Koder, an Australian who started out at Goldman Sachs GS.N in the mid-1990s, has made significant changes to the business in the past year and stepped up hiring in the bank's home market as well as in Europe.  In Asia, senior hires in 2019 included Patrick Steinemann, who came on board as BofA's head of industrials investment banking team, while Monica Chang joined the China coverage team from Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE.  Overall, BofA expanded its investment banking headcount in Asia last year by hiring about a dozen senior bankers, making it one of the most aggressive recruiters among other global banks in the region, one of the people said.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm reported a 9% rise in investment banking fees in the fourth quarter ended December to $1.5 billion, on higher income from debt and equity underwriting deals.  BofA was third in the Asia Pacific M&A advisory league table including Japan in 2019, but it was ranked ninth in the equity capital markets table and did not feature in the top 20 debt capital market rankings, according to Refinitiv data.","26":"Feb 24 (Reuters) - Bank of America expects benchmark Brent crude prices to average $62 per barrel in 2020, with medium-term downside risks due to slowing global growth, trade war uncertainties and the coronavirus outbreak.

But activity began dissipating by late March, and few expect it to return as the year goes on.  \u201cGood temporary news for the big banks is trading was really good in 1Q,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a recent report.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch unit will pay at least $4 million and two Raymond James units will pay $8.03 million, after failing to ensure that financial advisers properly took fees into account when recommending investments in so-called 529 savings plans.  Such plans are tax-advantaged municipal securities designed to encourage saving for education, and sponsored by U.S. states, state agencies and educational institutions.  FINRA said the supervisory failures caused Merrill and Raymond James customers, especially those with young children many years away from college, to incur higher fees than they should have.  According to the regulator, many customers who invested in Class C shares, which carry no upfront sales charges but higher annual fees, would have been better off investing in Class A shares that carry upfront sales charges but lower annual fees.  The failures allegedly occurred from 2011 and 2015 at Merrill, and from January 2008 to March 2017 at Raymond James.  None of the units admitted or denied wrongdoing, and FINRA said they received credit for \u201cextraordinary cooperation\u201d with the regulator.","41":"July 17 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp reported a 10% increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday as a healthy U.S. economy boosted demand for loans.

That spread is lower, and we make less money,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said.  The fall in revenue and profit was broadly in line with other Main Street peers that have suffered from the need to brace for a deep recession, while profiting from the surge in financial market trading since February.  \u201cStrong capital markets results provided an important counterbalance to the COVID-19-related impacts on our Consumer business,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said.  The bank allocated a much lower dollar amount for reserves this quarter than some of its peers earlier in the week, in part due to it having set aside more in the previous quarter.  Its provision expense rose just 7% in the second quarter, compared with a 26% increase at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, a 12% jump at Citigroup Inc C.N and a 138% jump at Wells Fargo WFC.N.  It also reported a 9% fall in pre-provision income, pointing to the pressure on its business model from the interest rate environment, even if it did not have to prepare for potential loan losses.

Higher non-interest income, mainly in global markets and banking unit, drove the beat but was offset by lower net interest income (NII) and loan loss provisions, UBS analyst Saul Martinez said.  NII, a key measure of how much banks can make from their lending activities, has been pressured by the pandemic as the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near-zero levels.  Net income for the bank\u2019s global markets unit rose 81% to $1.9 billion but revenue gains of 50% in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and 7% in equities trading failed to match those reported by some of its rivals.  Overall revenue, net of interest expense, fell 3% to $22.3 billion, while consumer banking net income dropped to $71 million from $3.29 billion a year earlier, and that for global wealth and investment management by more than 40%.

June 3(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp is rolling out a new wealth management product that combines automated portfolios with human advice, becoming the latest brokerage to seek to boost business by blending digital with personalized financial planning.  It comes as competitors are increasingly offering hybrid advice models, in response to questions about the potential profitability of stand-alone robo-advisers.  The new service underscores how Bank of America is targeting downscale clients even as certain banks like Morgan Stanley have opted to reserve human advice for wealthy customers.  The Bank of America service, Merrill Guided Investing with an Advisor, builds on its robo adviser launched in 2017, adding the ability for clients to call or make an appointment with a bank employee to discuss their financial goals.  Providing online investors access to a human adviser is growing more popular in the wealth management industry as studies have shown many clients prefer a combination of digital and personal advice.  Robo-advisers typically use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios made up of low-cost exchange-traded-funds for clients with as little as a few hundred dollars to invest.  Merrill Guided Investing, which uses recommendations from the wealth management chief investment office, requires a $20,000 minimum investment for access to a financial adviser who can offer help over the phone, online, or in person at a Bank of America branch.  The tiered offering is meant to attract young families and others in the early stages of wealth accumulation, head of Consumer Banking & Investment Aron Levine told Reuters.  Bank of America estimates that 85 percent of its clients who are eligible for its wealth management products hold investments elsewhere.  \u201cIt\u2019s critical for us to have the right wealth management solution to meet the needs of investors at every age, and every stage of their wealth accumulation,\u201d said Andy Sieg, president of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.  Research firm Aite Group expects digital wealth management to continue growing quickly over the next few years but said in a May 2019 survey that large incumbents will grow faster than start-ups as they leverage their massive distribution networks.  With a 0.85% annual fee, Merrill Guided Investing with an Advisor is more costly than many competitors\u2019 hybrid financial planning services.  Betterment, a start-up robo-adviser, charges an annual fee of 0.4 percent for its premium service and has a minimum investment of $100,000, while Wells Fargo & Co\u2019s Intuitive Investor charges 0.5% annually with a minimum investment of $10,000.

Life Plan, a new functionality on Bank of America\u2019s website and app, allows customers to set multiple goals like buying a home, improving credit or saving for retirement, and uses its existing trove of client data to serve them recommendations.  Such personalized advice used to be reserved for high-net worth customers who had enough cash to retain a financial advisor to help manage their wealth, but a host of digital budgeting tools, like Intuit Inc\u2019s Mint app, have used artificial intelligence to bring planning to the masses.  \u201cPlanning is no longer an activity that\u2019s born out of how much money you have,\u201d said digital planning executive Evelyn Varner.  Bank of America, which operates one of the largest wirehouses catering to America\u2019s richest households, has been building out its product set to capture customers lower on the wealth spectrum.  The tool, which launched nationally on Monday, has already helped the bank better target customers, executives said. During the eight-month long pilot period, Life Plan led to over 3,800 referrals for conversations with bankers.  It could also give the megabank more control over its customers\u2019 data as they use the bank\u2019s tools over third-party applications, executives said.

The wealth division, which caters to individuals with at least $3 million to invest, added 64% more households in 2019, helping the unit end the year with a record of $288 billion in assets under management.  Bank of America bought U.S. Trust, a storied firm that once handled money for families like the Astors, in 2007 in a deal that vaulted the bank to top of the U.S. private banking rankings with $270 billion assets under management. But asset growth has lagged competitors since then. JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N private banking arm now boasts more than $670 billion assets under management and Citigroup Inc C.N has roughly $460 billion globally.  Early in 2019, the bank dropped the 166-year-old U.S. Trust name in favor of its own, and moved to accelerate growth by streamlining management structures and integrating the private bank more deeply with Bank of America\u2019s other business lines.  The business launched new initiatives in partnership with the investment and corporate banks to increase the amount of chief executives using the private bank to manage their personal wealth. That\u2019s helped grow referrals between the private bank and other businesses by 30% to 7,000 in 2019.  In addition to tapping its corporate parent\u2019s existing client list, the private bank is taking share by re-entering markets it left behind after the financial crisis and pushing into new markets like Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Salt Lake City, Knox said.  The business is also looking to strengthen its presence in growth markets like Northern and Southern California.  Bank of America has been deepening its bench of private advisers by training and promoting back-office staff internally, which has improved retention and productivity levels, Knox said.  Last year, new relationships per adviser jumped 35% compared with 2018.  The business is also poaching talent from rivals in new markets. When the bank moved into Cincinnati last year, it hired private client advisers away from regional and national competitors like PNC Financial Services Group Inc PNC.N and JPMorgan, according to LinkedIn.  Overall, adviser count was up 8% to 482 in 2019.\u201dThat is a big sales force out there taking share,\u201d Knox said.","54":"(.)

The most extreme though is bitcoin, with nearly half of those surveyed seeing it at a maximum 10 on a 1-10 bubble scale.  More generally, too, when asked specifically about the 12-month fate of bitcoin - which surged 300% last year - and electric vehicle maker Tesla which soared nearly 750% and is seen as emblematic of highly priced tech stocks, a majority of respondents said they were now more likely to halve than double in value.  A similar Bank of America (BofA) survey showed that buying bitcoin had replaced buying tech stocks as the trade which fund managers saw as most crowded, knocking tech off the top spot for the first time since October 2019 and into second place.  The cryptocoin hit a record high $40,000 earlier this month, having rallied more than 900% since a low in March and having only just breached $20,000 in mid-December.  Investors were bullish on the outlook for world growth, with the proportion of fund managers surveyed by BofA who said the global economy was in an early-cycle phase, as opposed to a recession, at its highest in 11 years.  A record 92% expected higher global inflation over the next year, though Deutsche Bank\u2019s survey also showed 71% expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to resist the temptation to start removing the stimulus that has helped markets rally.

Bank of America also said it planned to upgrade its network of 16,000 ATMs to allow customers to pay credit card bills and withdraw cash with their phones, and install an additional 2,700 machines.  By 2021, Bank of America\u2019s branch and ATM network will cover more than 90 percent of the U.S. population, said David Tyrie, head of consumer advanced solutions and digital banking.  The percentage of customers who prefer to make their transactions in brick and mortar banks fell to 26 percent from 38 percent in 2016, according to a study published this year by consulting firm McKinsey. However, the firm found that banks that closed a significant number of branches must rely more heavily on advertising to win market share.

But over the past year some banks have announced plans to expand again.  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America said on Friday that it will expand its retail banking presence in two new markets, Cleveland and Lexington, Kentucky, next year as part of a previously announced pledge to add 500 branches.

FILE PHOTO: Customers wait in line outside a bank amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Chelsea, Massachusetts, U.S., May 11, 2020. REUTERS\/Brian Snyder  But as taxpayers begin to take on the cost of forgiving those loans, lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp, are girding for what is likely to be years of regulatory scrutiny for their role in doling out the money, according to industry insiders, securities filings and government watchdogs.  \u201cThe sense of anxiety is high,\u201d said Vivian Merker, a management consultant to financial services firms at Oliver Wyman in New York. \u201cThey are gearing up for years of requests from regulators and there\u2019s still reputational risk from PPP fraud even if they did all the right things to follow program rules.\u201d  Banks participating in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) issued more than 5.2 million loans, to be repaid by the government as long as borrowers demonstrated financial need and used most of the cash to make payroll.  Fraud by borrowers popped up almost as quickly as the program, overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA), began in April. The Department of Justice has so far brought charges against 82 individuals in 56 cases for around $250 million in loans, according to a review by the Project On Government Oversight.  So far, the burden on lenders has mostly been administrative. One veteran attorney who advises major banks on compliance matters said clients were responding to as many as 20 law enforcement subpoenas a week, producing documents and making employees available for interviews.  There is increasing concern, though, that the lenders themselves will face legal challenges over PPP, already leading to internal compliance reviews, investor warnings and even the outright sale of loan portfolios, according to public statements and people familiar with the situation.  At least four banks have warned investors in shareholder filings about PPP regulatory and legal risk. Bank of America, for example, said in a July filing that its participation in government stimulus programs \u201ccould result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings, and has resulted in, and may continue to result in, litigation, including class actions.\u201d  \u201cWe fully cooperate with government inquiries,\u201d said Bill Halldin, a Bank Of America spokesperson.  POSSIBLE HAZARDS  Among the possible hazards, experts have pointed to potential violations of the program\u2019s first-come, first-served application rules, disadvantaging minority-owned and women-owned businesses; maintaining adequate documentation, especially for loan forgiveness applications; and abiding by broader \u201cknow your customer\u201d rules, which could have spotted more fraud.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  Congress passed the $2.2-trillion Cares Act bailout in March which included nearly $350 billion for PPP loans, with the pot later increasing.  Under pressure to get the cash out the door fast, banks were initially concerned they would be taking on too much liability, even if they stood to earn origination fees of up to 5%, and 1% interest payments on government-guaranteed loans. Lenders secured a promise from the government that they would not be held responsible if borrowers broke the program rules.  An October congressional report said that several lenders, including JPMorgan, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Truist Financial Corp, processed larger PPP loans for wealthy customers at two to four times the speed of smaller loans for the neediest small businesses.  It also said some banks limited their PPP loan programs to existing customers.  That decision, the report said, had a disproportionately adverse effect on women-owned and minority-owned businesses, because they are less likely to have pre-existing banking relationships, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data. Depending on the circumstances, policies that hurt such \u201cprotected\u201d groups - even if inadvertently - can violate fair lending rules.  Citing an internal April presentation, the report said that Citigroup identified the negative effect on these businesses as a possible compliance risk, but decided to initially prioritize existing customers because demand was high and it required less manual intervention. Citi declined to comment.  A Truist spokesman said that it handled PPP applications through a single portal on a first-come, first-served basis, \u201cwithout any preference to larger or more affluent clients.\u201d  JPMorgan declined to comment. PNC did not respond to requests for comment.  Bank groups pushed back on the House report. The Consumer Bankers Association said lenders were denied waivers that would have made it easier to lend to new borrowers, and that larger borrowers had dedicated staff and documentation that accelerated their applications.  \u201cWhen Congress, the SBA and Treasury designed the Paycheck Protection Program they prioritized getting money into the hands of small businesses very quickly, issuing confusing and changing operational and legal guidance for banks,\u201d said Greg Baer, CEO of the Bank Policy Institute.  REVIEWING PPP LOANS  People familiar with the situation say that virtually every large PPP lender, including JPMorgan, Citi, Truist and KeyBank, conducted standard internal reviews to spot violations by their own employees of program rules.  \u201cAs we participate in efforts to make critical government stimulus programs available ... we continue to execute on our controls to identify, address and report fraud,\u201d a Truist spokesman told Reuters via email.  KeyBank declined to comment.  Wells Fargo said in a May filing that it had received \u201cformal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans.\u201d  Wells Fargo spokesman Manny Venegas said the filing was referring to industry-wide inquiries from regulators over PPP fraud, which the bank had worked to spot and report. He declined to comment on whether the probes also concerned bank employees or processes.  Regulators have signaled there\u2019s much more to come. The SBA plans to review PPP loans over $2 million and its inspector general recently said there were \u201cstrong indicators of widespread potential abuse and fraud.\u201d  A recent U.S. House committee analysis found tens of thousands of PPP loans could be subject to fraud, waste, or abuse, including more than $1 billion in multiple loans to the same company, a violation of program rules.  James Stevens, an attorney who advises lenders at Troutman Pepper in Atlanta, said banks did their best to get money to needy small businesses, but that fast-changing program rules created \u201cfertile ground\u201d for fraud and internal errors.  \u201cRegulatory scrutiny of banks is always in hindsight,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come.\u201d","69":"FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs Headquarters building is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., December 19, 2018.

It comes as competitors are increasingly offering hybrid advice models, in response to questions about the potential profitability of stand-alone robo-advisers.  The new service underscores how Bank of America is targeting downscale clients even as certain banks like Morgan Stanley have opted to reserve human advice for wealthy customers.  The Bank of America service, Merrill Guided Investing with an Advisor, builds on its robo adviser launched in 2017, adding the ability for clients to call or make an appointment with a bank employee to discuss their financial goals.  Providing online investors access to a human adviser is growing more popular in the wealth management industry as studies have shown many clients prefer a combination of digital and personal advice.  Robo-advisers typically use computer algorithms to create and manage portfolios made up of low-cost exchange-traded-funds for clients with as little as a few hundred dollars to invest.  Merrill Guided Investing, which uses recommendations from the wealth management chief investment office, requires a $20,000 minimum investment for access to a financial adviser who can offer help over the phone, online, or in person at a Bank of America branch.  The tiered offering is meant to attract young families and others in the early stages of wealth accumulation, head of Consumer Banking & Investment Aron Levine told Reuters.  Bank of America estimates that 85 percent of its clients who are eligible for its wealth management products hold investments elsewhere.  \u201cIt\u2019s critical for us to have the right wealth management solution to meet the needs of investors at every age, and every stage of their wealth accumulation,\u201d said Andy Sieg, president of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management.

The Republican-controlled Senate passed by an overwhelming 84-8 vote a $4.6 billion spending bill on Wednesday. The Democratic-led House of Representatives on Tuesday night tied more strings to its approval of the money, setting standards for health and nutrition of migrants in custody after reports they lacked necessities such as soap and diapers.  Now the two chambers are trying to strike a compromise to send to U.S. President Donald Trump before Congress recesses at the end of this week for the Fourth of July holiday.  The House on Thursday will consider adding to the Senate-passed bill several requirements that were in the House version, including medical, nutrition and hygiene standards for facilities holding migrants, and a three-month limit for any child to spend at an intake shelter, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It would also require the death of a child be reported within 24 hours.  Trump has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration but officials are saying they will run out of money for border agencies soon. Border crossings hit the highest level in over a decade in May, straining resources and creating chaotic scenes at overcrowded border patrol facilities.  The need for funding has become more urgent as attorneys last week called attention to more than 300 children detained in squalid conditions at a border patrol facility in Clint, Texas.  Children are supposed to be transferred quickly out of border patrol facilities and into shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Slideshow ( 4 images )  There are currently 178 children in border patrol facilities who have been there longer than 72 hours, Representative Diana DeGette said she was told by HHS on Wednesday.  Adding to concerns was a harrowing photo published this week of a Salvadoran migrant and his young daughter who both drowned crossing the Rio Grande from Mexico.  Trump has said U.S. asylum laws, which allow those who claim fear of returning to their home countries to seek protection through a U.S. court process, need to be changed to deter migrants from coming. But so far the president has failed to push through any changes in Congress.  At this pivotal time in U.S. border policy, the head of the U.S. immigration agency is resigning on July 5. The head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Mark Morgan, will take his place, an official said.  ICEBOXES AND PRIVATE DETENTION CENTERS  Immigration advocates have long complained about inadequate conditions in border patrol facilities, often called \u201chieleras\u201d - or \u201ciceboxes\u201d - by the immigrants held there because they are so cold.  Slideshow ( 4 images )  But the stark images and descriptions of detention conditions has spurred some companies and employees to take action.  On Wednesday, several hundred people, including employees of Wayfair Inc, rallied in Boston to protest the online retailer\u2019s sale of furniture for a detention facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas housing migrant children.  Also on Wednesday, Bank of America Corp said it will no longer finance operators of private prisons and detention centers, joining peers in distancing itself from a sector that has triggered protests over Trump\u2019s policies.  ICE typically detains adults who have been arrested in the interior of the United States or arrested at the border, and contracts with private companies like CoreCivic Inc and GEO Group Inc, two major private prison operators. Bank of America has underwritten bonds or given syndicated loans to both companies.  Private detention centers account for about two-thirds of people held by ICE, S&P Global Ratings estimated last year.  With younger and younger children crossing the border and being held for longer periods of times, the issue is becoming a flashpoint of debate ahead of the 2020 presidential elections.  Democratic candidates Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, both U.S. senators, visited a different private facility in Florida on Wednesday holding thousands of unaccompanied migrant children. Close to a dozen other candidates, including Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said they would tour the same center later this week.  Immigration advocates have said the Homestead facility, which houses more than 2,000 teenagers apprehended at the border, does not meet basic safety and wellness standards.","82":"FILE PHOTO: A Bank of America logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017.

Anne Finucane, Bank of America\u2019s vice chair, said in April that the bank had decided on its pledge to help reduce mass shootings, saying in an interview with Bloomberg TV that \u201cit is not our intent to underwrite or finance military-style firearms on a go-forward basis.\u201d  The comment came weeks after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, triggered a new movement for gun control, led in part by student survivors, increasing pressure on U.S. companies to seek to distance themselves from the firearms industry.  Finucane in the Bloomberg TV interview said that Bank of America was in discussions with its gun-manufacturing clients following the change, but did not give details. She did not mention Remington.  Bank of America\u2019s plans to go ahead with the credit facility following its change of policy in April have not previously been reported.  Bank of America said it does not comment on client matters.  Representatives for Remington and Cerberus Capital Management L.P., Remington\u2019s private equity owner, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cerberus will give up its equity stake in Remington under the weapons maker\u2019s bankruptcy plan.  According to a review of bankruptcy court documents and interviews with restructuring experts, Bank of America\u2019s agreement with Remington allows it to back out and find another lender to cover its commitment.  But withdrawing from the deal would hurt the bank\u2019s reputation for standing by its lending agreements and could undermine Remington\u2019s survival, according to one person familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking.  Noting that the credit facility is part of a court-supervised bankruptcy, the source said that if the bank were to pull out of the deal it could expose itself to lawsuits and potential damages.  Remington makes the Bushmaster assault-style rifle, including the one used in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults.  At Bank of America\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in April, Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the change of policy toward some gun makers was prompted in part because more than 150 Bank of America employees \u201cdirectly lost a relative in the shootings in the last couple years.\u201d  Moynihan was responding to conservative activist and shareholder Justin Danhof, who said at the meeting that the bank has an obligation to its investors to make profitable loans.  \u201cThe company is willfully giving up money,\u201d Danhof said of the guns pledge.  Remington has been a client of Bank of America and the six other lenders providing the credit facility since at least 2012, according to court records.  For the new facility, Wells Fargo & Co and Regions Bank are each providing $43.2 million, while Branch Banking and Trust Co, Synovus Bank, Fifth Third Bank and Deutsche Bank are providing smaller amounts.  Wells Fargo has said it believes the government should set gun policy, not companies through their credit.  The other banks declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.  In the weeks leading up to Remington\u2019s bankruptcy, 30 other potential lenders turned down requests for help from Remington\u2019s financial adviser, many of them citing firearms as the reason, according to court documents.  One corporate restructuring specialist suggested Bank of America could have used the new credit facility as leverage to demand that Remington stop making assault-style rifles.  \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for them to say to any borrower, \u2018We\u2019re happy to lend to you if you don\u2019t make military-style assault weapons,\u2019\u201d said Ted Gavin of the Gavin\/Solmonese LLC restructuring advisory firm. \u201cThe lender has all the power.\u201d (Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware and Jessica DiNapoli in New York Editing by Noeleen Walder, Daniel Wallis and Leslie Adler)","84":"March 6 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp is splitting its trading staff with about 100 employees working out of the Stamford location effective Monday, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Noninterest expense dropped 5 percent in the quarter from a year earlier as the bank trimmed headcount and worked on digitizing its retail operations to lower overhead.  Revenue rose in each of the bank\u2019s segments with the exception of global banking, where lower investment banking fees dragged revenue down 2 percent.  The bank\u2019s shares were up 2.4 percent to $29.24 in morning trading.  During his near-decade long tenure, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan has focused on making the bank\u2019s sprawling operations more efficient. Two years ago, he pledged to cut expenses to $53 billion by the end of this year, and the bank confirmed it is on track to meet that goal and plans to hold expenses at that level through 2020.  Banks have been broadly expected to report higher investment banking fees this year as lower U.S. corporate tax rates and a friendlier regulatory environment encourage deal making.  Moynihan acknowledged on a call with analysts that the bank is underperforming peers when it comes to earning M&A advisory fees.  \u201cThe team knows they can do a better job, and they\u2019re after it,\u201d he said.  The corporate tax cuts have helped boost Bank of America\u2019s bottom line along with its Wall Street peers, while Federal Reserve interest rate hikes have padded net interest income.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo  Total loans increased 2 percent in the quarter for Bank of America, led by growth in its consumer banking and wealth management businesses.  Total loan growth continued to be weighed by its runoff portfolio of consumer real estate loans, while year-over-year growth in Bank of America\u2019s business segments was 5 percent.  In comparison, JPMorgan Chase & Co\u2019s core loans, which exclude consumer credit and loans to the biggest corporations, rose 7 percent in the quarter. Citigroup Inc\u2019s total loans rose 5 percent.  Loan growth combined with higher interest rates helped push net interest income up during the quarter, but rising interest rates also increased the price the bank pays for its deposits.  The bank has increased the rate it pays for deposits in its wealth management and global banking units, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said.  Overall, Bank of America\u2019s net income applicable to common shareholders rose 36.3 percent to $6.47 billion in the second quarter.  Excluding items, it earned 64 cents per share compared with the average expectation of 57 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Net interest income rose 6 percent as the bank\u2019s large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities helped it take advantage of four interest rate hikes in the past year.  Revenue, net of interest expense, fell 1 percent to $22.76 billion. Revenue in the year earlier quarter included a $793 million pretax gain on the sale of the bank\u2019s non-U.S. consumer card business. Analysts had expected revenue of $22.29 billion.

FILE PHOTO: A Bank of America sign stands on the side of a building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  On Tuesday, Bank of America reported better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by loan growth, higher equities trading revenue and bigger fees from dealmaking and wealth management.  But overall, the bank\u2019s net revenue was nearly flat, as were core expenses. The difference between those two figures, known as operating leverage, is watched closely on Wall Street as a barometer of how well a bank manages costs.  That metric had been positive at Bank of America for eighteen straight quarters, until the most recent one.  Instead of slashing expenses, the Charlotte, N.C.-based lender spent more on marketing, technology, real estate, equipment and compensation during the quarter.  Its U.S.-centric consumer business opened 20 new locations, renovated another 117 and paid retail employees more after a pledge to boost minimum wages to $15 an hour. Bank of America also opened a new Paris office, hired more customer-facing staff and spent on digital tools across its operation.  Such investments are necessary to keep businesses healthy and growing, executives said, while asserting they have a good handle on expenses. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan pledged to keep annual costs at around $53 billion.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to operate at that [level] despite increased investments in technology and infrastructure, buildings and people,\u201d he said.  Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets, does not stand alone in prioritizing business investments over cost cuts.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, for instance, has been spending heavily on its burgeoning consumer business even as its revenue has slumped. Executives defended the strategy on Tuesday when discussing quarterly results.  Similarly, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N partially explained its outlook for higher expenses in a presentation by saying \"we don't want to forgo revenue to manage to an expense target.\" Costs at the San Francisco based bank have also been elevated as the bank hired more risk and compliance professionals to help it work through its regulatory issues.  Citigroup Inc C.N management also faced questions about winnowing operating leverage. The bank, which reduced headcount by 7,000 over the past year, has been keeping a close eye on travel expenses while avoiding what its finance chief called \"non-critical hires.\"  But CEO Michael Corbat also sounded a cautious note about not \u201csacrificing the investments that we need to make to either maintain or continue to attempt to build competitive advantages.\u201d  JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N was the only one to report positive operating leverage for the third quarter as well as year-to-date.  Spending in the face of revenue pressure is a sharp reversal for the U.S. banking industry after years of cost cuts following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. For Bank of America, it also marks a new chapter for CEO Brian Moynihan.  His tenure was defined first by spending billions of dollars to settle costly legal disputes, and then cutting billions of dollars from Bank of America\u2019s expense line through an initiative he dubbed \u201cProject New BAC.\u201d  From when Moynihan first developed the cost-cutting plan in 2011 through last year, the bank\u2019s annual expenses have fallen by more than one-third and its payroll is down by more than 70,000 workers.  On Wednesday, Moynihan predicted recent investments will pay off through productivity gains and that the bank will find more savings by doing things like reducing paper use.  \u201cWe have a good track record of generating operational savings,\u201d he said.","93":"FILE PHOTO: Chairman and CEO of Bank of America Brian T.

FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  The banks, which operate the two biggest U.S. wealth management firms, are focused on different parts of the benefits business, executives told Reuters. But both strategies create opportunities for the firms to market to younger and middle-class clients.  Morgan Stanley is building on its $850 million purchase of Solium Capital, which manages employee stock plans for some 3,400 companies and 2.7 million employees.  Morgan Stanley has renamed it Shareworks and is looking to roll out deferred compensation management, health savings accounts and student loan refinancing. The firm is also considering partnering with a payroll company.  Meanwhile, Bank of America has focused on retirement services, with significant growth in its 401(k)s and health service accounts businesses.  The bank now manages plans for about 30,000 companies covering 5 million people. It ranked No. 7 on PlanSponsor.com\u2019s annual list of 401(k) record-keepers by assets last year, three notches higher than in 2017.  The two banks typically cater to older, wealthy families. By providing wealth services to companies, they hope to start relationships with young workers that could develop into one-on-one wealth management relationships later.  The investments Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are making in workplace benefits services reflect the global banking industry\u2019s shift toward steadier, fee-driven businesses to offset a secular decline in trading revenue since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  However, the business has become more competitive in recent years. Fidelity, Vanguard and TIAA are consistently ranked as the top three employee-benefits providers, and Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.N and E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O have substantial stock plan businesses.  Companies only consider changing financial institutions about once a decade, and retirement products are fairly standardized, leaving little incentive to switch.  Combined with a push to reduce investor fees and the hefty expense of operating an employee-benefits operation at scale, it could be hard for Morgan Stanley and Bank of America to succeed, analysts said.  \u201cThis is a very fee-sensitive industry,\u201d said Anastasia Krymkowski, an associate director at research firm Cerulli Associates specializing in retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s an even bigger deal in 401(k) plan management because you have this idea of being a good fiduciary.\u201d  OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH  Nonetheless, executives at the two banks told Reuters in separate interviews that they see opportunity to grow revenues and gain clients through these businesses.  Bank of America believes it can pick up clients left behind by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, which both quit the 401(k) business in recent years.  And Morgan Stanley bought the most popular software platform for employee stock plans, making it difficult for rivals to compete.  Morgan Stanley has added 200 new corporate clients since the acquisition and estimates that, overall, employees on Shareworks\u2019 platform have $1.5 trillion in other accounts.  Executives predict that, over the next decade, they can turn hundreds of thousands of employees into customers of the firm\u2019s robo-adviser or its full-service brokerage.  \u201cIt creates value for the employer, the employee and creates a new source of potential clients for us,\u201d said Jed Finn, chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley\u2019s wealth unit.  Analysts said revenues earned from Shareworks will be minimal in the near-term but later could create substantial business.  Bank of America\u2019s strategy to market a full suite of employee benefit products, including 401(k)s, equity compensation plans and health savings accounts, to existing clients in other parts of the bank also makes it money now.  Bank of America added nearly 3,000 corporate clients to its institutional retirement business in 2018, up about 50% from the prior year. So far this year, it has added another 2,190 of them. That includes 401(k)s, HSAs, employee stock and defined benefit plans.  \u201cThe vast amount of wins come from existing clients,\u201d said Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America\u2019s global head of commercial banking.  Still, only about 10% of Bank of America\u2019s corporate clients use its retirement services, presenting the bank with an opportunity, Borthwick said. The institutional retirement business is hiring more retirement specialists to help pitch these products.  \u201cGetting a company to turn on a 401(k) or a stock plan administration takes time,\u201d said Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI. \u201cThe good news is that they already have relationships with their target market customer and now it is up to them to convince them.\u201d","95":"March 15 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp has promoted two veteran investment bankers to be co-heads of U.S. mergers and acquisitions, Kevin Brunner and Ivan Farman, according to a memo seen by Reuters.

Its loan book shrank for the first time since 2015, according to Refinitiv data.  Net interest income at the bank, a key measure of how much it can make from lending, sank 17%, showing the effects of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s moves to slash interest rates to near-zero and promise to keep them there to help spur growth.  The bank is especially vulnerable to rate movements because of the composition of its balance sheet, weighing on overall revenue that missed estimates.

The additional layer of risk assessment is aimed at helping prevent the bank from losses on deals, like bond issuances, the sources said.  It comes as coronavirus spreads quickly around the world and is forecast to dent global economic growth.

However, lower interest rates fueled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s emergency rate cut on Tuesday has increased corporate appetite for issuing and refinancing debt. Total debt deals totaled $30 billion in the first week of March compared with roughly $90 billion in all of February, according to IFR data.  Bank of America participated in roughly 20 investment-grade debt deals this week, a source said.

Big banks have been implementing contingency plans like staggering shifts, and asking their workforce to test telecommuting systems for the past week.  Effective Monday, Bank of America is splitting its trading staff with about 100 employees working out of its Stamford, Connecticut, location, according to another source familiar with the plans.  The plans to split its trading staff to different locations was a precautionary move, the source said, adding that other business lines were not affected by the split.

The bank is contributing $43.2 million to a $193 million lending package funded by seven banks, according to court documents, which will help put Remington back on stable footing as it emerges from bankruptcy later this month into an uncertain environment for gun makers.  The package replaces a similar credit facility the banks committed to providing Remington. Both were agreed in late March, before Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, changed its policy to stop financing companies that make military-style guns for civilian use.  Anne Finucane, Bank of America\u2019s vice chair, said in April that the bank had decided on its pledge to help reduce mass shootings, saying in an interview with Bloomberg TV that \u201cit is not our intent to underwrite or finance military-style firearms on a go-forward basis.\u201d  The comment came weeks after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, triggered a new movement for gun control, led in part by student survivors, increasing pressure on U.S. companies to seek to distance themselves from the firearms industry.  Finucane in the Bloomberg TV interview said that Bank of America was in discussions with its gun-manufacturing clients following the change, but did not give details. She did not mention Remington.  Bank of America\u2019s plans to go ahead with the credit facility following its change of policy in April have not previously been reported.  Bank of America said it does not comment on client matters.  Representatives for Remington and Cerberus Capital Management L.P., Remington\u2019s private equity owner, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cerberus will give up its equity stake in Remington under the weapons maker\u2019s bankruptcy plan.  A man aims a Remington firearm at the annual National Rifle Association (NRA) meeting in Dallas, Texas, U.S., May 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Adrees Latif  According to a review of bankruptcy court documents and interviews with restructuring experts, Bank of America\u2019s agreement with Remington allows it to back out and find another lender to cover its commitment.  But withdrawing from the deal would hurt the bank\u2019s reputation for standing by its lending agreements and could undermine Remington\u2019s survival, according to one person familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking.  Noting that the credit facility is part of a court-supervised bankruptcy, the source said that if the bank were to pull out of the deal it could expose itself to lawsuits and potential damages.  Remington makes the Bushmaster assault-style rifle, including the one used in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults.  At Bank of America\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in April, Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the change of policy toward some gun makers was prompted in part because more than 150 Bank of America employees \u201cdirectly lost a relative in the shootings in the last couple years.\u201d  Moynihan was responding to conservative activist and shareholder Justin Danhof, who said at the meeting that the bank has an obligation to its investors to make profitable loans.  \u201cThe company is willfully giving up money,\u201d Danhof said of the guns pledge.  Remington has been a client of Bank of America and the six other lenders providing the credit facility since at least 2012, according to court records.  For the new facility, Wells Fargo & Co and Regions Bank are each providing $43.2 million, while Branch Banking and Trust Co, Synovus Bank, Fifth Third Bank and Deutsche Bank are providing smaller amounts.  Wells Fargo has said it believes the government should set gun policy, not companies through their credit.  The other banks declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.  In the weeks leading up to Remington\u2019s bankruptcy, 30 other potential lenders turned down requests for help from Remington\u2019s financial adviser, many of them citing firearms as the reason, according to court documents.  One corporate restructuring specialist suggested Bank of America could have used the new credit facility as leverage to demand that Remington stop making assault-style rifles.  \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for them to say to any borrower, \u2018We\u2019re happy to lend to you if you don\u2019t make military-style assault weapons,\u2019\u201d said Ted Gavin of the Gavin\/Solmonese LLC restructuring advisory firm. \u201cThe lender has all the power.\u201d","111":"NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp\u2019s head of global investment banking Diego De Giorgi is leaving the company, according to an internal memo on Wednesday, in the first major personnel move under new investment banking chief Matthew Koder.

Since 2015, Wall Street\u2019s marquee banks have benefited from higher interest rates, as they could afford to charge more interest on loans, without having to significantly raise payouts on deposits.  However, this year, markets have been buffeted trade tensions and a weakening global economy, forcing the Federal Reserve to cut rates twice this quarter.  Bank of America is the most vulnerable among the big U.S. banks to fluctuations in interest rates because of its large deposit stock and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.  BofA took a small hit on its spread and reported a 4 basis-point decrease in its interest margin to 2.41% for the third quarter. But a 5% growth in overall loans helped it overcome the impact of lower rates.

Andy Sieg, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, and Katy Knox, president of Bank of America\u2019s private bank, U.S. Trust, will be elevated to the management team and report directly to Chief Executive Brian Moynihan.  The two new leaders bring different perspectives to the management team. Knox joined the wealth management business as president last year and has experience working with clients from a broad range of business segments, while Sieg, who got his start as a financial analyst at Merrill in 1992, will become the first Merrill Lynch veteran raised to the top ranks of leadership since the company was acquired in 2009.  Wealth management has been a bright spot for Bank of America in recent quarters. On a call with analysts in October, Moynihan called it \u201cthe best business there is the world.\u201d  In the first nine months of the year profit in the segment surged 28 percent as client balances grew to a record of nearly $2.8 trillion. Merrill Lynch Wealth Management accounted for roughly 84 percent of those assets.  During his tenure as head of the Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, Sieg has focused on increasing referrals from wealth management services to other products at the bank like loans and credit cards.  Sources who have worked with him say he would do well in the role given his ability to please Merrill\u2019s \u201cthundering herd\u201d of thousands of financial advisors, and the firm\u2019s corporate banking parent.  Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag also worked at Merrill Lynch, but only for a brief few months before the company was acquired by Bank of America in the throes of the financial crisis in 2008.

This memo - which was sent by Greg Kelly and Matt Cannon, who runs EMEA investment banking - said Anstee would focus on covering clients in the region, while Fortunati would battle to win advisory mandates and execute on deals in the highly competitive M&A market.  The pair will have different managers, with Anstee reporting into Kelly and Cannon, while Fortunati will continue working for his current bosses, Luca Ferrari and Eamon Brabazon, who co-head M&A in EMEA, the memo said.

More than two-thirds of business owners surveyed by the bank said they had taken steps to prepare for an economic downturn, including setting cash aside or planning to reduce expenses.  Of the 69 percent of owners who had started preparing for a recession, only 19 percent had opened a line of credit, a figure that Bank of America\u2019s head of small business Sharon Miller said was too low.  \u201cWhen you need a line of credit, you often can\u2019t get one,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cBusiness owners should be thinking about that now.\u201d  There was less optimism about the U.S. economy than last year, the survey showed. Forty-eight percent of business owners felt the national economy would improve over the next year, down from 55 percent last fall. Concerns about healthcare costs and the impact of trade wars contributed to declining sentiment.  Although the bank said it is important for businesses to be ready for a potential downturn, top executives pointed to growth in consumer spending and low unemployment to show the economy is still in good shape.  \u201cWe continue to see a good, strong solid U.S. economy,\u201d said Chief Executive Brian Moynihan on a conference call earlier this month.

Rome aims to clinch a merger with a healthier peer in 2021, the sources said, to provide a long-term solution for the bank, which has been backed by the government since 2017 following an 8 billion euro ($9.5 billion) rescue deal.  The mandates, which will last 12 months, will see Bank of America\u2019s co-head of the financial institution group, Giorgio Cocini, and Orrick\u2019s partners Patrizio Messina and Marco Nicolini working closely with the Treasury to attract buyers and address the bank\u2019s capital shortfalls.  Rome is expected to pay about 150,000 euros in financial and legal fees, with the lion\u2019s share going to Bank of America, the sources said.  Italy\u2019s Treasury and Orrick were not immediately available for comment, while Bank of America declined to comment.  Dogged by legal claims and poor quality assets, MPS is a tough sell in Italy\u2019s banking market, which has a surplus of branches and has seen a rise in loan losses and remote banking in the COVID-19 pandemic.  UniCredit is seen as the preferred buyer for the 548-year old bank given its robust balance sheet, sources have said, despite boss Jean Pierre Mustier ruling out mergers which, he has said, only add \u201cbranches and staff.\u201d  Italy\u2019s third-largest bank, Banco BPM, is in the process of exploring possible tie-ups and may also emerge as a viable bidder for MPS, one of the sources said.  Banco BPM has also repeatedly denied any interest for MPS.  Any deal for the Tuscan bank would only come after the Treasury acts to remove legal claims amounting to 10 billion euros, while also injecting fresh capital.  Rome has set aside 1.5 billion euros to shore up MPS but the bank faces a shortfall of at least 2 billion, sources have said.  Its capital buffers are set to fall below minimum requirements early next year, hit by the cost of a bad loan clean-up it is about to complete as well as provisions against legal risks following the conviction of former top executives.","132":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp can fund agencies that advise struggling home buyers under a relaxed regulatory program unveiled in September, the U.S. consumer watchdog said on Friday.  The decision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau means Bank of America\u2019s mortgage-lending unit will become the first lender to enter into financial relationships with approved housing-counseling agencies without fear of prosecution by the bureau, the agency said in a statement.  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) bars kickback or referral fees that may unnecessarily increase the cost of buying a home. This includes giving or receiving anything of value in exchange for referrals for homebuying services such as mortgages and title insurance.  In September, the CFPB said it was relaxing rules on such arrangements in order to increase funding for nonprofit housing counseling agencies. Consumer groups have said the change could lead to conflicts of interest that may ultimately hurt home buyers by steering them toward more expensive lenders.  Bank of America, which already has an active home buyer counseling program, is among several major U.S. lenders in talks with the bureau about the new program, said an agency official familiar with the application process, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter publicly.  The program exempts 1,600 agencies that participate in the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s counseling program from prosecution when entering into financial arrangements with lenders for pre-purchase services. It also assures lenders that the regulator would not find the funding arrangements in violation of RESPA.  The program is a response to HUD concerns that approved housing-counseling agencies have been hesitant to seek funding agreements with lenders over fears of prosecution, the CFPB said. HUD-approved housing-counseling agencies compete annually for funds from the government and other non-profit grants.  Reuters reported in August that U.S. mortgage firms are getting back into joint marketing and advertising arrangements, emboldened by what they perceive to be the CFPB\u2019s softer stance on RESPA enforcement.","133":"People line up to cast their ballots during early voting for the upcoming presidential elections inside of The Atlanta Hawks' State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., October 12, 2020.

The percentage of customers who prefer to make their transactions in brick and mortar banks fell to 26 percent from 38 percent in 2016, according to a study published earlier this year by consulting firm McKinsey. However, the firm found that banks that closed a significant number of branches have to rely more heavily on advertising to win market share.

Total loans and leases at the second-largest U.S. bank slid 6% in 2020. Appetite for new loans waned during the pandemic as customers spent less and saved more and large companies relied on capital markets for funds rather than their bank.  But bank executives said on calls they are starting to see signs of a rebound if the COVID-19 pandemic continues to abate.  \u201cWe\u2019re grinding out of this health crisis,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe should be able to grow NII because we are adding deposits and we are adding loans.\u201d  Net interest income (NII) at the bank, a key measure of how much it can make from lending, tumbled 16% in the fourth quarter.  Lower rates meant to prop-up the economy during the pandemic have limited how much banks can charge for their lending services at the same time fiscal stimulus programs and flagging consumer confidence have softened loan demand. As a result Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup each posted double-digit overall revenue declines this month.  NII grew slightly from a low point in the third quarter of 2020 and will continue to increase in 2021 with the biggest gains in the last half of the year, Donofrio said.  FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a Bank of America sign in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucas Jackson  Megabank peers Wells Fargo and Citigroup said last week NII could decline by 4% due to the rock-bottom interest rates Fed officials have signaled will stay in place throughout the year while JPMorgan predicted modest growth in 2021.  Bolstering the bank\u2019s upbeat view are signs of improving financial health among its customers.  Consumer and small business transaction volume across the second-largest U.S. bank managed to grow 2% in 2020 despite plunging 21% to a record low as the coronavirus gripped the U.S. economy in the spring.  Debit card spending jumped 12% during the quarter as customers who had been spending less amid lockdowns, reopened their wallets over the holidays, the bank said.  Underscoring its confidence in the economy, the bank joined peers JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc in releasing $828 million from its reserves to cover bad loans after adding more than $8 billion through the first three quarters of the year.  Roughly 75% of the reserve release is tied to the bank\u2019s consumer portfolio as customers entered the new year in better-than-expected financial health due to fiscal stimulus. The commercial reserve release was mostly driven by a pullback from industries heavily impacted by the pandemic.  Revenue from its sales and trading business rose 7%, but underperformed peers as its fixed-income trading desk missed estimates.  Net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $5.21 billion, or 59 cents per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $6.75 billion, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected a profit of 55 cents per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv, helped by lower credit costs. Shares gained 1.2%.

Historically low interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis have limited how much banks can make from their lending services.

A record $2.6 billion went into tech stocks this week, cementing the sector\u2019s leading position. Investors have plowed a total of $9.8 billion into tech funds so far this year - making the annualized flow figure a massive $46.5 billion.  Financials drew in $1.6 billion, and are the second most popular sector after tech, having enjoyed $7.3 billion of inflows year-to-date.  European stocks saw modest outflows of $1.3 billion, meanwhile. Emerging market equities continued to draw in cash ($2.7 billion) and Japanese equity funds enjoyed their 15th straight week of inflows as the popularity of the asset class proved resilient.  But large inflows are out of step with more muted returns from equities.  \"Chart-topping inflows not coinciding with headline returns,\" the strategists said, pointing to the NYSE composite index .NYA, which is down year-to-date. All major European stock indices are still in the red since the start of 2018, while the S&P 500 is only slightly up.  TEPID RETURNS, CREDIT OUTFLOWS KEEP LID ON SENTIMENT  Despite torrential inflows into stocks, BAML\u2019s Bull & Bear index of investor sentiment fell from 6.8 to 6.5 on the more muted equity returns, and as outflows from emerging market debt and high-yield corporate bonds increased.  What BAML calls \u201ccracks\u201d in the wall of money include signs the credit market is peaking, and a rising inter-bank borrowing rate.  High-yield corporate bond fund flows reached a \u201cclear negative inflection point\u201d, strategists said, noting the ninth straight week of outflows from high-yield bond funds - their longest losing streak since 2007.  Investors pulled $0.7 billion from emerging market debt funds.  Strategists said inflows and returns for investment grade, high yield and EM debt funds are peaking, which could be a harbinger of lower equity returns.  Treasuries funds drew in $0.3 billion in their eighth straight week of inflows. \u201cTreasuries and bunds hinting at \u2018growth scare\u2019 makes stocks vulnerable,\u201d the strategists wrote.  The increasing inter-bank borrowing rate (LIBOR) was likely to lead to tighter financial conditions, they added. Short-term borrowing costs have surged in the past weeks to levels last seen in the 2008 global financial crisis. [nL2N1QH1N5]  A rise in the U.S. dollar could also hobble the rally in tech and emerging market stocks.  Passive investment vehicles reasserted their dominance this week as the vast majority of investors used exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to plow money back into stocks.  A record $43.9 billion was driven into equity ETFs while mutual funds suffered $0.6 billion of outflows. Actively managed funds had managed to claw back some inflows in the past few weeks.","148":"Chairman and CEO of Bank of America Brian T.

The decision was the latest sign of restraint from bank boards after a year of robust revenue growth.  For instance, Morgan Stanley\u2019s board made the rare move of cutting CEO James Gorman\u2019s pay 7% to $27 million for 2019 in an effort to reduce expenses. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s board gave Chief Executive Jamie Dimon just a half-million-dollar raise.  In 2018, Moynihan was awarded a 15% increase in total compensation after Bank of America posted record profit of $28.1 billion. Total 2019 income was declined slightly due the impact of ending a joint venture during the year. Excluding that impact, profit rose to $29.1 billion, a performance that would typically prompt the board to give the CEO a raise.  In all for 2019, Moynihan earned a base salary of $1.5 million and equity incentive award of $25 million, the bank said in a filing here .","149":"WASHINGTON, June 19 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp subsidiary Merrill Lynch will pay a $42 million penalty for lying to customers about how it handled their orders, the top U.S. securities regulator said on Tuesday.

The bank gave no further comment. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co. made similar commitments to stop financing private prison companies earlier this year.  Activism against the financing of private prisons has increased amid tightening immigration policies under U.S. President Donald Trump and concerns about detention conditions. Private detention centers account for about two-thirds of people held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, S&P Global Ratings estimated last year.  Chief Executive Brian Moynihan was confronted by activists in April at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting who asked why the nation\u2019s second-largest bank by assets continued to fund private prison companies, even as other banks backed away.  The Charlotte-based bank is one of several banks that have underwritten bonds or syndicated loans for CoreCivic Inc and GEO Group Inc, the two major private prison operators in the United States. In 2018, banks, including Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, raised roughly $1.8 billion in debt over three deals for CoreCivic and GEO Group, according to Refinitiv data.  GEO said on Wednesday that Bank of America\u2019s decision will not have an impact on its credit facility, which was recently extended through May 2024.

The Federal Reserve also slashed interest rates nearly to zero in response to the crisis, further limiting how much banks could make from lending.  Bank of America, the second largest U.S. bank by assets, does not expect to need to book another significant expense for loan loss reserves in the third quarter based on current trends.  \u201cWe set our second quarter reserves with a set of scenarios that had turned out that the actual data has been better,\u201d Moynihan said.  Fee-based income continues to be a bright spot for the bank, though at more modest levels. Trading revenue is expected to be up 5% from last year compared with a 35% surge in the second quarter.

REUTERS\/Carlo Allegri  The bank\u2019s shares initially fell as much as 2.8 percent but recovered to trade up 0.4 percent by mid-afternoon as analysts focused on its success in reducing expenses.  Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, followed rival domestic lenders by struggling to generate top-line growth in the latest quarter and suffering from a decline in trading revenue.  During the first quarter, lower market volatility hurt trading revenue at U.S. banks, leaving them to rely on expense cuts to drive profitability. At Bank of America, expenses declined by 4 percent.  JPMorgan Chase & Co, the country\u2019s biggest bank by assets, has been the exception. It increased revenue and beat expectations while seeing expenses rise as it invests in new technology.  Allowing for different tax treatments on some assets, Bank of America said revenue came in at $23.2 billion. That compared with the average analyst estimate of $23.3 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts on a conference call that the bank anticipates its net interest income will rise by 3 percent in 2019, compared with 6 percent last year.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got some near-term headwinds,\u201d he said.  The Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2019 given risks to the U.S. economy from a global slowdown. Investors fear that could pressure net interest income, or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays on deposits.  The bank saw 3 percent growth in consumer loans and 4 percent growth in loans to businesses in the first quarter, allowing it to capture more revenue from higher U.S. interest rates. The company reported a 5 percent increase in deposits from a year earlier.  Revenue rose in two of the lender\u2019s four main businesses.  Donofrio said growth in the bank\u2019s deposits and loans suggested the performance of the U.S. economy remained solid despite recession concerns.  \u201cBank of America has demonstrated for years now that we can grow well in an economy that is just growing moderately,\u201d he told reporters on a conference call.  Chief Executive Brian Moynihan cited demand for credit from middle-market business. He said that was \u201cgood news for the economy overall.\u201d  The lender has benefited from the central bank\u2019s four rate hikes in 2018. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits as it has a large deposit pool and retains rate-sensitive mortgage securities.  Net interest income - the difference between what a lender earns on loans and pays on deposits - rose 5 percent to $12.38 billion. Deposits on average also rose nearly 5 percent to $1.36 trillion.  However, the bank\u2019s trading desks, like those of its peers, have had a slow start this year because of the U.S. government shutdown and lower volatility. Changes in the U.S. tax code and concerns about a trade war spurred more trading a year ago.  Overall trading revenue declined 17 percent. Equities trading revenue fell 22 percent and fixed-income trading revenue slipped 8 percent.  Advisory fees at Bank of America stayed flat, indicating the bank is missing out on the M&A boom lifting rival investment banks. On Monday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a 51 percent surge in advisory fees.  Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 6 percent to $6.87 billion.  Excluding one-time items, the bank earned 71 cents per share, beating the 66 cents per share analysts on average had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","164":"FILE PHOTO: The company logo of the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch is displayed at its office in Hong Kong March 8, 2013.

Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a call with reporters the sequential decline was due to lower long-term interest rates.  \u201cWhen long-term interest rates fall, we see more people pay off their mortgages and that translates into more mortgage-backed securities being redeemed and that forces us to write off some premiums,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can extrapolate that into the future because long-term rates have stabilized at this point.\u201d  The lender is the most sensitive of the big U.S. banks to interest rate changes because of its large deposit stock and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.  Consumer banking has held up for the big Wall Street banks that have reported second-quarter results this week, cushioning a blow from weakness in trading and advisory businesses.  But warning signs also emerged with JPMorgan JPM.N, Citigroup C.N and Well Fargo reporting a dip in margins, stoking fears that interest rate cuts could further pressure profit by narrowing the spread between what banks charge on loans and pay on deposits.  In the absence of higher interest rates to help pad revenue, banks can improve margins by reducing expenses.  Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said on call with analysts that 2019 expenses are projected to be lower than 2018, against previous expectations for the bank to have flat expenses through 2020.  Expenses during the quarter were up slightly as the bank invested more in its consumer, commercial and wealth management businesses.  Total loans in its consumer banking unit rose 6%, while deposits were up 3%, pushing income from the business up 13% to $3.3 billion.  \u201cWe see solid consumer activity across the board, with spending by Bank of America consumers up 5% this quarter over the second quarter of last year,\u201d Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in a statement.  Growth in the consumer business helped offset softness in market revenue and Wall Street businesses.  The retail bank and wealth management segments each recorded double digit profit gains while its commercial and markets businesses each saw profit and revenue decline from lower investment banking and trading fees.  Adjusted revenue from Bank of America\u2019s global market business, which includes bond and equities trading, fell 5.7% to $4.18 billion.  Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 10% to $7.11 billion, or 74 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30. Excluding items, the bank earned 75 cents per share.  Revenue, net of interest expense, was up about 2% at $23.08 billion.

REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender is especially vulnerable to rate movements because of the composition of its balance sheet. As the Federal Reserve cut rates three times last year, analysts predicted Bank of America\u2019s earnings would suffer.  The bank blunted the impact last quarter by growing loans at a rapid clip, and managed to beat Wall Street\u2019s quarterly forecasts. But Bank of America shares fell 2% in morning trading after Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said net interest income will decline through the first six months of 2020.  Donofrio expects to improve that metric later in the year by growing loans and reducing interest rates on deposits, but predicted Bank of America\u2019s net interest income will be \u201cmodestly\u201d lower for the full year.

The bond trading business performed well across Wall Street, with JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc reporting even bigger revenue jumps. The increase was largely due to easy comparisons with the year-ago quarter.  Trading is a small part of Bank of America\u2019s income statement compared with consumer banking, its biggest business. Revenue there fell 5% to $9.5 billion, largely due to lower rates.  The bank\u2019s net interest margin, which measures how profitably a bank can lend out depositors\u2019 funds, fell to 2.35% from 2.52% a year earlier, and from 2.41% in the prior quarter.

(For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, tmsnrt.rs\/2HOVt1D)  \u201cThe Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they\u2019re saying about the economy,\u201d said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. \u201cFlat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It\u2019s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.\u201d  The central bank\u2019s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth.  Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond\u2019s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits.  \u201cThat\u2019s why the estimates are going down,\u201d Carlson added. \u201c(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there\u2019s an underlying concern about loan growth.\u201d  In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks.  Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings \u201crecession\u201d that ended in 2016.  The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates.  In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter.  \u201cWithin financials, the industry that\u2019s been hit hardest is capital markets,\u201d said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. \u201cThose downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines\u201d in first-quarter earnings estimates.  But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated.  Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note \u201cto be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.\u201d But he called the impact from the Fed\u2019s decision \u201ca minor one,\u201d and wrote that aside from these impacts, \u201cbank fundamentals are remarkably stable.\u201d  Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data.

(Reuters) - Bank of America said on Thursday it was standing by its pledge to stop financing civilian assault weapons and suggested it may be preparing to exit a loan for gun maker Remington Outdoor Corp that sparked criticism of the lender.  Slideshow ( 2 images )  The statement by Vice Chairman Anne Finucane follows a Reuters report on Sunday that the lender was participating in a $193 million credit facility that will help stabilize Remington\u2019s business when it emerges from bankruptcy this month.  After the report, activists including student gun control activist David Hogg were critical of the bank and took to Twitter using the #BoycottBankofAmerica hashtag. Hogg was a student at the high school in Parkland, Florida, where a February shooting helped touch off a renewed push for stricter U.S. gun control.  \u201cLet me be clear - we are not changing our policy to end financing of the manufacture of these military style firearms,\u201d said Finucane, who emphasized the policy change was on a go-forward basis.  She said the Remington financing was in the works for months before the firearms policy was announced on April 10.  A bank spokesman confirmed the statement, which took the form of a letter that Bank of America distributed in response to inquiries about its gun policy.  Bank of America is providing $43.2 million of the credit facility, with the rest coming from six other banks.  The banks have committed to providing the credit, and when Remington exits bankruptcy the credit facility will be established to replace an existing facility of the same size that Remington used to get through its Chapter 11.  The letter also indicated Bank of America may be preparing to exit the Remington credit facility soon after it is financed by selling its participation, as the agreement allows.  \u201cRemington is aware of the policy that we subsequently announced, and that policy will dictate our future actions after the bankruptcy proceedings conclude,\u201d said Finucane\u2019s letter.  Bank of America could have faced potential legal action and damages if it had backed out of its commitment to provide the Remington financing, particularly if the company failed to emerge bankruptcy.  In addition, the bank was concerned about its reputation for standing by lending commitments if it reneged on its Remington financing, according to a source familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking.  Remington makes the Bushmaster rifle that was used in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in which 20 children were killed.","187":"NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp has appointed Brad Kleinsteuber as its head of insurance investment banking in the Americas, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Monday, the contents of which were confirmed by a bank spokesman.

In 2019, the second-largest U.S. lender said it would give $5 billion to 20,000 low-to-moderate income homeowners through a mix of grants and loans through 2024.  \u201cI\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019ve gotten a lot further than that and we already have done over $5 billion to help create 21,000 new homeowners to the commitment,\u201d President of Retail Steve Boland said in an interview.  The new $15 billion commitment aims to reach 60,000 new home buyers and includes down payment and closing cost grants which could provide customers with up to $17,500 to help finance their new home.  Strong mortgage demand fueled by low interest rates during the pandemic helped the bank beat its expectations, Boland said. The bank also tripled the number of dedicated community lending officers to help find new customers.  Last year, the bank also got a green light to start paying agencies that advise struggling home buyers for referrals after regulators relaxed rules barring kickbacks between such agencies and lenders that may increase the cost of buying a home.  The announcement comes against the backdrop of growing calls to address the national shortage of affordable housing amid record unemployment. The issue is also of major interest to President Joe Biden, who included a $640 billion housing plan in his campaign.  Half of the bank\u2019s outstanding home loans are to low- to moderate-income or multicultural families and communities, it said.
